# Modelling and Impressions in Implants

Rajesh Dashaputra, Irfan Kachwala, Adwait Aphale, and Snigdha Chitnis

Abstract Implantology has come a long way to be mainstay in routine dental rehabilitation. An extremely high level of accuracy is essential in successful surgical placement of implants and development of the prosthetic solutions which should work like or better than natural healthy teeth. An equally accurate replication of the clinical situations in a physical or virtual mode is required before and during the treatment for the planning or execution of the prosthetic phase by the laboratories. Impression making and modelling tools form a vital segment in the armamentarium of implantologists and these techniques need a high level of skill development.

Multiple components specific to any implant system are provided by the manufacturers for single, multiple, and full arch implant impressions. Similarly, there are a different set of tools for digital impressions with intraoral scanning methods by dentists (in vivo) or by model scanning (in vitro) by laboratory experts.

This chapter details all the techniques and critical steps essential in both modelling and impression making for accurate replications and success. Few case presentations for different scenarios too are added for better explanations.

However, the long-term success of a dental implant depends on the prosthesis. The key to the attainment of perfect prostheses depends on the passive fit between the connector of the selected prosthesis and the implant itself [2]. Thus, the technique selected for making the impression of the implant, which simulates the exact position of the implant on the working cast, forms a crucial step in the dental implant procedure and should be as precise as possible. An ideal implant impression is one that records the accurate three-dimensional (3D) spatial position of the implant, analog, or abutment with respect to the other structures in the oral cavity [3, 4]. This allows the fabrication of a passive and well-fitting prosthesis which ensures the longevity of the dental implant.

Impression techniques for dental implants may be conventional or digital. Conventional methods consist of the utilization of impression material and impression copings to transfer implant positions to a stone cast with implant analogs in the position of the original implant. The advent of technology has ushered in the era of digital impressions that use optical methods to obtain the positions of implants and transfer them to a virtual model [5]. Both the conventional and digital impressions facilitate recording and transferring of the impression to a working cast, either stone or virtual, for the fabrication of an implant-supported prosthesis. The accurate transfer of the implant position with respect to the neighboring implants or teeth is vital for the selection of the appropriate prosthesis design and ensuring a good fit of the fabricated implant-supported prosthesis. Thus, it ensures the long-term success of the implant without mechanical and biological complications [5]. This chapter attempts to acquaint the reader with the conventional impression techniques of dental implants before introducing the digital impression techniques and the workflows associated with it.

# 2 Conventional Impression Techniques

On the basis of components utilized and the techniques applied, conventional techniques are classified as follows:

- Direct impressions without impression copings  
Abutment level impressions with snap-on copings  
- Implant level impressions

# 2.1 Direct Impressions Without Impression Copings

This method involves the insertion of the final abutment on the implant followed by modification of the abutment height, margins, and parallelism. An impression is then taken of the abutment using conventional methods of gingival retraction and the standard impression techniques used for fixed prosthodontics. Vinyl polysiloxane (addition silicone) is the recommended material for this technique. However, this technique is not the method of choice as it attracts all the clinical and laboratory errors associated with conventional impressions such as a suboptimal recording of abutment margins, distortion while pouring the cast, etc. Impressions made with the use of impression copings have proven to be of greater accuracy [6].

# 2.2 Abutment Level Impressions with Snap-on Copings

Initially, the final abutment is inserted onto the dental implant (Fig. 1a) followed by placement of a snap-on impression cap on the abutment (Fig. 1b). The snap-on plastic cap is then picked up in the impression (Fig. 1c). The abutment is then connected with the implant analog (Fig. 1d) and carefully repositioned inside the impression with proper orientation (Fig. 1e). The concept is similar to the closed tray impression technique. Comparative analysis has shown no difference in the accuracy of abutment level impressions and closed tray implant level impressions [7].

# 2.3 Implant Level Impressions

Implant level impressions record the 3D position of the implant in terms of its position in relation to adjacent teeth or implants. It also records the orientation of the implant in terms of the rotational position of the internal connection. Recording the shape and levels of the gingival tissue around the implant is another goal of the procedure. Polyether and vinyl polysiloxane are the materials of choice for this technique [8, 9]. The use of custom trays over stock trays for the impression procedure has been shown to be more accurate [10]. The reduced volume of material used in custom trays minimizes the volumetric shrinkage. Stock trays, when used, should be made of metal or rigid plastic [11, 12].

This method is preferred over direct impressions due to ease of use, reduced chairside time, and elimination of clinical and laboratory errors [6].

Implant level impressions can be accomplished by either the closed tray or the open tray impression techniques.

- Closed tray impression technique (Indirect/ transfer)  
- Open tray impression technique (Direct/ Pick up)

# 2.3.1 Closed Tray Impression Technique

This technique consists of the utilization of an impression coping which is retained in the mouth when the set impression is removed. Hence, it is also termed as the indirect or transfer technique.

Before starting the procedure, the healing abutment or provisional restoration is removed (Fig. 2a). A closed tray or transfer impression coping is inserted onto the implant (Fig. 2b). Radiographs are taken for verification of fit and to ensure the fabrication of a passively fitting prosthesis (Fig. 2c). Tray adhesive is applied on the stock or custom tray. The low-viscosity impression material is injected around the impression copings, gingiva, and adjacent teeth. The tray is simultaneously loaded with high-viscosity impression material such as heavy body or putty in case of vinyl polysiloxane. In the case of a viscoelastic material like polyether, the same material is used in the syringe and in the tray. The tray is seated in the mouth and held steady till the material sets completely. The impression is then removed from the mouth and examined for errors (Fig. 2d). The impression coping is unscrewed and removed from the mouth followed by reinsertion of the healing abutment onto the implant. The impression coping is then connected with an implant analog and reinserted into the impression. Care is taken to ensure that the orientation grooves on the impression coping are aligned properly (Fig. 2e) and the coping itself is seated completely (Fig. 2f). Additionally, care is taken to ensure that there is no movement of the impression coping-implant analog assembly inside the impression. If any such disturbance is suspected, it is wise to repeat the impression. The impression is then disinfected and sent to the laboratory for pouring.

# 2.3.2 Open Tray Impression (With or Without Splinting of Impression Copings)

This technique consists of the utilization of an impression coping that is incorporated into the impression and is removed from the mouth along with the set impression. Hence, this technique is also known as the direct or pick-up impression.

Similar to the closed tray technique, the healing abutment or provisional restoration is removed before the procedure (Fig. 3a). The open tray impression coping is then inserted onto the implant (Fig. 3b). Radiographs are taken for verification of fit. A rigid plastic tray of appropriate size is selected. Special metal trays with removable windows in areas of the implants are also available. A custom tray is the ideal choice; however, it requires an additional visit and increased lab cost. A window is cut out in the tray after locating where the guide pin or screw of the impression coping needs to extrude from the tray. This window is then covered by wax to prevent the tray material from flowing out of the tray through the window (Fig. 3c). Tray adhesive is applied on the stock or custom tray. The low-viscosity impression material is injected around the impression copings (Fig. 3d), gingiva, and adjacent teeth. Loading of tray with a high-viscosity impression material such as heavy or medium body in case of vinyl polysiloxanes is carried out. In the case of a viscoelastic material like polyether, the same material is used in the syringe and tray. This is followed by careful positioning and seating of the tray in the mouth, until the guide screws of the impression copings extrude through the wax covering the window (Fig. 3e). The tray is held in place till the material has completely set.

Any wax or impression material from the head of the guide screw is removed and the guide screw is then completely unscrewed (Fig. 3f). The impression is then removed from the mouth. The impression coping is picked up in the impression (Fig. 3g), and the impression is inspected for any errors. Healing abutments are then reinserted onto the implant. An implant analog is inserted onto the impression coping (in the impression) and the guide screw tightened (Fig. 3h). The implant analog is held in place while tightening the screw to prevent rotation of the impression coping inside the impression. Care is taken to ensure that there is no movement of the impression coping-implant analog assembly inside the impression. If any disturbance is suspected, it is wise to repeat the impression. The impression is disinfected and sent to the laboratory for pouring (Fig. 3i).

Multiple studies and systematic reviews have demonstrated that open tray impression techniques are more accurate than closed tray impression techniques [8, 9, 13, 14].

A systematic review by Lee et al. [8] comparing the accuracy of open and closed tray impression techniques found no significant difference in both the techniques when making impressions for three or fewer implants. The open tray technique was recommended for situations involving four or more implants. Another systematic review by Papaspyridakos et al. [9] found open tray impressions to be more accurate for completely edentulous arches. No significant difference between the two techniques was found for partially edentulous arches.

# 2.4 Splinting of Implants

Another recommendation for increasing the accuracy of the impression in cases involving multiple implants is the splinting of the impression copings to one another or to the custom tray prior to impression making [8, 9, 15-17]. The open tray impression technique is used when the impression copings are splinted together.

Various materials and methods have been used for splinting the impression copings to each other [18, 19]. A few examples of the same are as follows:

- Splinting only with an auto-polymerizing acrylic resin (AAR)  
- AAR and dental floss  
- AAR with burs or stainless steel wire  
- Light-cured composite resin with burs, stainless steel wire, or metallic sticks  
- Impression plaster

The most commonly used AAR is Pattern Resin LS (GC America Inc., Illinois, USA) because of its desirable properties of low shrinkage (0.36% at 30 min, 0.37% at 24 h) and quick setting time [18]. The time line for splinting with AAR ranges anywhere from immediately prior to 24 h prior to the impression according to various authors [8]. It is recommended to section the AAR and re-splint the segments prior to impression [13]. This is done to compensate for the polymerization shrinkage of the AAR, which affects the accuracy of the impression. Splinting can be accomplished intraorally on a model made from a previous unsplinted impression.

The technique for intraoral splinting with AAR and dental floss is as follows:

Open tray impression copings are inserted and tightened onto the implants as previously illustrated in Fig. 3b. Dental floss is wrapped in a criss-cross pattern between the impression copings and the loose ends secured (Fig. 4a). AAR (Pattern Resin) is then mixed to a thick consistency. The material has a working time of  $2 - 3\mathrm{min}$  and reaches dough stage almost immediately. A roll of the AAR is adapted around the impression copings and dental floss making sure that there is enough thickness of material around the impression copings (Fig. 4b). Setting time of the material is  $4\mathrm{min}$ . The material is pushed away from the gingival tissues with a spatula to avoid contact with monomer, prevent burns due the exothermic polymerization reaction, and make space for injection of light body impression material to record the tissues. The AAR can alternately be added completely by the brush technique through incremental additions. However, this is time consuming and the flow of the material is difficult to control.

The entire assembly of splinted impression copings is unscrewed and removed from the mouth. The impression copings are labelled for easy repositioning before sectioning. A diamond-coated disk with a straight micromotor hand piece is used to section the connectors between the impression copings. Care is taken to ensure the cut is as thin as possible to reduce the volume of material used to re-splint and, hence, the shrinkage. The impression copings are reinserted into their original positions on the implants and tightened while making sure that there is minimal space but no contact between the AAR connector segments (Fig. 4c). The AAR segments are then rejoined with minimal amount of material using the brush technique (Fig. 4d). After setting, the AAR splint is then painted with tray adhesive. The open tray impression technique described previously is carried out to complete the procedure (Fig. 3c-h).


# 3 Digital Impression Techniques

The conventional techniques may incorporate many human errors such as tray design, errors in component fixing, impression making, and material flow at multiple levels if not followed meticulously. Additionally, the dimensional changes in impression materials, pouring techniques in the lab, and expansion of stone plaster are the major technical errors encountered in these techniques [20-22]. The discomfort to the patient due to additional components, required tolerance to mouth opening, and the taste and odor of silicone materials remains a disadvantage. It was due to these shortcomings that the intraoral scanning technologies came into existence [22].

# 3.1 Development of Dental CAD/CAM Systems

Dental computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) systems have started to develop since the 1960s. Dr. Francois Duret developed the first CAD/CAM device for fabricating crowns based on digital impressions in 1971 [23-25]. Additionally, he developed the first CAD/CAM dental restoration in 1983 and the Sopha system in 1984 [23, 24]. Dr. Andersson developed the Procera system, which produced high-precision dental crowns and metal-free veneered restorations utilizing CAD/CAM in 1983 [26]. In 1987, Mörmann and Brandestini developed the CEREC system, which was the first dental system to combine digital scanning with the milling unit [25, 27].

The intraoral scanners have evolved towards more practicality and accuracy and have been made available chairside in the last two decades. Industrial grade machines for CNC or milling have catered to large institutional work outputs. Modern system allows the "scan to crown delivery" protocol with their integrated chairside system without outside lab intervention [28].

# 3.2 Intraoral Scanning Devices

The scanning or digitization technologies were introduced in the 1970s as indirect digitizations on models (extraoral digital impressions) utilizing extraoral scanners and direct digitizations (intraoral digital impressions) in the mouth and essentially came into existence along with development of CAD/ CAM. However, the direct digital impressions of abutments required considerable chair time and had limited accuracy. With the evolution of intraoral scanning, CAD/CAM systems are now clinically practical [29].

The last decade has witnessed the development of multiple devices for Intraoral Scanning (IOS) [29]. IOS comprises a system of medical optical camera device (hardware), a relevant computer Software Program (software), and a computer. The whole system is used to scan and capture the intraoral structures, save and process the input into a programmable file, and then design with soft tools to render output for manufacturing in the CAM lab. Alternatively, the hardware device may be used only to capture the image in the form of points cloud and meshwork [28] and render output in a universally used format called STL (Standard Tessellation Language) [29, 30], a computer code recognized by most CAD Software EXOCAD™.

The process of digitisation of oral structures can be done directly inside mouth with Intra oral scanning devices (intraoral digitisation) or by scanning the model derived from a physically made impression of the mouth (extraoral digitisation) as per earlier descriptions in earlier section.

1. Intraoral digitization: Intraoral scanning devices in the later decades revolutionized clinical workflows with their scanning and designing software with integrations for CAM. The complete digitized protocol increased accuracy and eliminated the need for conventional impressions and model pouring in labs [25, 29]. Earlier systems required the application of titanium dioxide or magnesium oxide powder or sprays to the glossy tooth surfaces in order to avoid reflection errors and to create a measurable surface. The powder layer applied to the tooth surface resulted in an additional thickness of  $13 - 85\mu \mathrm{m}$  [31] which had to be adjusted in measurements. Also, the time taken and frequent need to re-powder areas washed by saliva made the process more uncomfortable for operator and the patient. Hence, modern optical intraoral scanning devices are powder free and more advanced [31].

2. Extraoral digitization involves two methods

(a) Contact digitization: The capture is by means of a ruby ball and the 3D structure is measured. This method is distinguished by a high scanning accuracy, whereby the diameter of the ruby ball is set to the smallest grinder in the milling system so that all data collected by the system can be easily milled [26, 31]. One example is Procera Scanner. The drawbacks of this procedure are complicated mechanics, high expense, and its time-consuming procedure.  
(b) Optical digitization: This involves light systems in the form of point focus or line system which can scan the model or impression in detail forming mesh which is transferred to the designing system [30, 31] (Fig. 5a-c).

The indirect methods involve options of three, four, or five axis scanning for accuracy required [25, 29, 32].

# 3.2.1 IOS Technology (Device Construction and Engineering)

The IOS system consists of a handheld camera device, relevant software, and the computer system. Goal of intraoral scanning is essentially to capture the intraoral 3D structures with precision and replicating the same geometry through the software for further processing [29, 30].

All these devices have a conventional light source in the form of LED or laser and a camera for capture of the tissues either in pictorial format (static images) or video recording (dynamic images) and then to generate scanned object POI (point of interest) in a points and triangulation cloud (meshwork) to rendering the shape in 3D form in the software with precision (Fig. 6) [28, 30, 31].

The images captured are at a very rapid rate as multiple images or in video formats to multiple sections finally joined in the software to create the 3D output for processing by combining these multiple captures.

Most of the systems developed today have the ability to render the output files in the universal industry format and are called open file systems. The output format is called STL which can be processed by all the milling systems. They may also use intrinsic proprietor formats for enhanced rendering, especially regarding to gingival and tooth color system, texture, translucency of dental tissues, and other parameters (e.g., Polygon File Format, PLY files) [25, 29, 30].

# 3.2.2 IOS Clinical Factors

The clinical protocols of the scan systems have a learning curve involved to render accurate reproduction of the captures. There are a lot of inaccuracies seen by failure of the operator to accurately identify and measure the POI [28-31].

# 3.2.2.1 Distance and Path of Scanning

Various devices have different diameter/size of the IOS component and different speeds of capture. Skills must be developed in scanning of the arch, minimizing repetition to avoid patient anxiety and discomfort. Both the direction of the path followed and distance of the scanner from object must be maintained as per the device manufacturer's guidelines [25, 30].

The usual path for scanning followed involves first rough scanning of the occlusal and occlusal to palatal arches going in a long "S-shaped" path in each quadrant. This is followed by a labial scan and then labial to palatal semicircular movements to get the interdental areas and contact embrasures. Many repeats may be required to detail the images where voids are depicted by the software [30]. Also the occlusion can also be recorded by scanning the teeth in occlusion. This will get transfer to the project file with virtual articulator features given in the software [30] (Fig. 7a-d).

# 3.2.2.2 Tracking with Software

Intraoral scanning is a dynamic process and watched live as the reproduction can be seen live in the capture software screen. It is useful to trace out the occlusal full quadrant with slight cross arch area and then repeat regions to gain more details as the software tracks every area depicting the correct areas and marking voids or error regions for repeat [30].

The errors arise when distance to object and scan path as well as speed and smoothness of movements is not respected. The scanning connection continuity in software gets lost and these areas have to be rescanned. The software can track new captures and correctly superimpose on the old data in accurate fashion without (a)

# 3.2.2.3 Image Accuracy and Mesh Quality

The quality of the rendered image depends on the quality of device engineering, the system guidelines and limitations, skill of the user and the software capabilities, and type of area or object scanned [28, 33].

The presence of air or saliva pockets and inaccessible subgingival areas need greater notice and correction with multiple repeats and scan corrections. The reconstruction process usually creates a meshwork from the scanned captures (Fig. 9a-c). The denseness of the mesh will differ as per options used, depth of scan, and multiple recordings done (Fig. 9d-e). All the areas need not be rendered by increasing the mesh density. Only areas where sharpness is required, as in margins of a preparation with extremely delicate curvatures, a detailed rendering with a very dense mesh quality is needed [30] (Fig. 9f-g).

Accuracy is the degree of veracity, that is, how well the measured value represents the "truth," whereas "precision" is the degree of reproducibility, that is, the repeatability of the measurement system [31]. Ideally, a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with the measurements close to and tightly clustered around the true value [31, 32].

Regardless of the digitizing mode applied, clinical parameters such as saliva, blood, and movements of the patient might affect the reproduction of teeth.

Ender et al. [34] have reported that the mean trueness of various IOS technologies is between 20 and  $48\mu \mathrm{m}$  and the precision is between 4 and  $16\mu \mathrm{m}$ , when the impression is partial and compared to conventional impression. The conclusion of these reports is that current IOS devices are clinically adapted for common practice, with at least similar accuracy to conventional impression making. However, in vivo full-arch impression is reported to be associated with a phenomenon of distortion, in particular for triangulation, confocal, or AWS technologies.

Most of the leading intraoral devices have optimum functionalities but vary in different functional parameters.

In vitro comparison of the accuracy of four intraoral scanners and three conventional impression methods for two neighboring implants suggest that optical impressions are superior to elastomeric impressions for placing two implants in one quadrant. Closed tray impression accuracy was significantly lower than that of open tray impressions for placing two implants in one quadrant [35].

The desirable features of a digital impression are as follows [36]:

- Ability to export any digital impression file to any software (open system)  
- Ability to capture dental hard and soft tissue accurately over long spans  
- Smaller size of intraoral wand that can reach all areas  
- Fast acquisition time and ability to capture features in moist environment  
- Ability to capture true color  
- Portability  
- Software should have face scanning ability  
- Artificial intelligence incorporated in scanning protocol itself for implant component recognition

# 3.3 Clinical Applications

The goal of any dental implant procedure is to deliver perfectly fitting, functional teeth or prosthesis. With the recent developments in intraoral scanning techniques, software handling algorithms, and artificial intelligence incorporated in scanning, the predictability and precision of the fabricated implant prosthesis using a digital protocol is much more guaranteed [37].

The workflow: Similar to the conventional impression techniques for implants, the digital impressions are classified as follows:

1. Abutment level impression  
2. Implant level impression

# 3.3.1 Abutment Level Impression

After the final abutment is placed onto the implant, the intraoral scanning progresses similar to the crown and bridge procedure. The challenge in implant abutment scanning is the reflective surface of abutment. The unprepped abutment is highly reflective and is difficult to capture precisely by the intraoral scanner.

Roughening the abutment with sandblasting or use of opaque powders such as occlusal markers is suggested in such cases. If the abutment has undergone preparation with diamond points or carbide burs prior to impression, it already has roughness and has lost its shine, making it conducive for the scanning. After the abutment has been prepared, a digital impression is taken following the standard practices of gingival retraction and after making sure that the margin of the abutment is visible and preferably equigingival (Figs. 10, 11 and 12).

The STL/OBJ/PLY file is then shared with the dental laboratory in the digital format. The respective file is then imported into the CAD software for designing the

# 3.3.2 Implant Level Digital Impression

The fundamental function of registering an implant level digital impression is to accurately record the implant axis and position in bone in order to plan the prosthesis. This is done with the help of implant scan bodies. The correct engagement of the scan bodies with the implant reflects the angulation and position of the implant in bone. There are two types of scan bodies available:

(b) Extraoral scan bodies: Utilized extraorally in the dental laboratory. In this scenario, a conventional implant level or abutment level impression (in case of multiunit abutments) is registered. An extraoral scan body is then attached to the model in the dental laboratory and scanning is done using a lab scanner to facilitate the CAD process.

When performing complete-arch digital scans with more than two implants, clinicians should choose the intraoral scan body (ISB) and scan technique carefully, as these factors can significantly affect the accuracy of the scan when using the test scanner. Certain ISBs may be scanned faster than others [38].

Scanning technique is the technique of movement of the IOS wand over the teeth and implant area. Each company recommends its own protocol for scanning. Change in the path of scanning may result in the loss of the reference point and stitching of the resultant 3D image.

CAD process of implant level digital impression can be done in two ways depending on the prosthesis needed:

(a) Without model (No printing of resin model): This technique is indicated in single-implant or two-implant cases with a passive path of insertion and favorable angles of implants. Usually, single-implant cases with prosthesis which can be directly milled from CAD such as zirconia or E-max milled crowns can be executed without a model.  
(b) With model: This technique is indicated in cases which need customized abutment fabrication, layered ceramic prosthesis, full-arch prosthesis, and in implants with severe angulation which need correction at abutment level.

Essentially, in any of above mentioned scenario capturing implant level digital impression with the help of implant scan body remains the same.

# 4 Workflow of Scanning with Scan Body and Fabrication of Prosthesis

# 4.1 Without Model

The patient and prosthesis details are filled in the scanning case sheet. The healing abutment or provisional restoration is removed before the procedure (Figs. 14, 15, 16 and 17). Scanning is then initiated with the scanning wand following the path of scanning as per the manufacturer's instructions. The gingival profile of the implant site is captured from all aspects along with the full or partial arch as per the case (Figs. 18 and 19). An appropriate intraoral scan body is screwed in the implant. The scan body is inserted in a way that the matching point faces either the buccal or lingual area. Scanning is started from the adjacent tooth with maximum scan depth and then the scanner tip is turned to the buccal area to scan the matching point followed by the lingual side. The artificial intelligence (AI) command for recognizing the scan body intraorally is fed into the software which will get transferred to lab along with file. If AI is not incorporated in the scanning software, the scan body has a specific code which needs to be provided to the lab. This information gets integrated during export of STL/OBJ/PLY file to laboratory and helps the laboratory to decode the scan body for CAD. The scan then progresses, and the scan body, opposing arch, and the occlusion are scanned according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The scan process is then completed; the final scan files are prepared and sent to the laboratory for fabrication of prosthesis (Figs. 20, 21, 22, and 23).

Selection of the abutment is done as per the instructions shared by the clinician (Fig. 24). A virtual wax build up is then done on to it which will be later converted to the fixed prosthesis. Gingival emergence can be easily calculated with the help of software. The tooth library present in the software is used to design the morphology of the final prosthesis (Figs. 25 and 26). It is customized as per the adjacent contact areas, emergence, and occlusion with antagonists. CAD is done and checked to

# 4.2 With Model

The intraoral scanning procedure is followed similar to the one described in the previous case, whereas the laboratory procedure differs from the procedure described earlier. When the scan file is sent to the dental laboratory, it is opened in the respective CAD software and a model is designed for the implant prosthesis after decoding the scan bodies. When designing the model, the exact space for the incorporation of a physical lab analog needs to be created during the designing. Each implant company has separate STL files available in their library for the digital lab analog which is an exact replica of the physical form of the lab analog in the digital format. The upper and lower models are articulated as per the bite recorded in the occlusion scan. Some software allows use of virtual articulators for correcting mounting. After the customized abutments are ready, the rest of procedure remains the same as that of crown and bridge procedure, namely, coping, layering, and the final ceramic crowns. This procedure is especially indicated for multiple implants with an unfavorable path of insertion for the prosthesis. We have described a case to elicit this procedure (Figs. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50).

# 5 Advantages, Complications, and Technical Challenges

Clinicians and technicians who are accustomed to be working with analog need to undergo learning curve to acquire knowledge of digital process.

The advantages of digital impression technology in implant prosthodontics [39].

1. Precision over conventional impression technique  
2. No change in the implant direction due to use of scan body and AI  
3. Perfect capturing of the gingival profile  
4. Elimination of the gag reflex  
5. 3-D scope to study case and plan the prosthesis

6. Facial scan provides the relevant information of patient profile and its relation to dental prosthesis alignment  
7. No flaws related with conventional impression making  
8. STL model fabrication: less errors as compared to conventional model fabrication  
9. Repeats of impression are not costly as compared to conventional

10. Digital library of designs suggest better path of insertion for prosthesis to be passive

# Disadvantage:

1. Initial investment is more as compared to conventional  
2. Initial learning curves can be steep for some clinicians who are not so tech savvy  
3. Cost of the final prosthesis is little high as compared to conventional

In general, complications can be classified into two categories:

(a) Scanning-related complications  
(b) Software integration complications

# 5.1 Scanning-Related Complications

1. Intraoral scanning can get impeded by the size of the scanning tip itself limiting its proximity with intraoral scan body and acquiring correct information.  
2. Deeply placed implants may not expose scan body sufficiently for correct reproduction in digital software. This problem is solved by using artificial intelligence in software by choosing body during scanning.  
3. Poorly placed implants adjacent to teeth or adjacent to implant may prevent the use of scan body ad surface scanning as whole.  
4. Manually modified scan bodies can never be matched digitally. Never modify any scan body manually.  
5. Severely misaligned implants will not allow the use of digital workflow and a conventional impression and analog workflow will be necessary.

6. Careful repositioning of casts within desktop scanner is necessary to avoid errors in recording tissue height around implants which can lead to metal or marginal interface exposure.

# 5.2 Software Integration Complications

1. Merging complications  
2. Not enough scanned data reference points on scan body or adjacent tooth  
3. Changes in surfaces such as new restorations or presence of movable tissue being merged  
4. If scan body selected by the operator and dental lab technician is not supported by software

# 6 Conclusion

The wise selection of proper technique and adopting suitable technology will make the dental implant prosthesis more accurate in future. Digital technology is already a part of modern medicine and dentistry in particular. The comfort for the patient, the dimensional accuracy of the reproduction of the oral tissues and prompt availability for processing the next steps of prostheses designing and manufacturing makes the technology extremely promising.

With numerous advantages, digital impressions are on path to become rigueur de jour in dental, especially implant, impression techniques.
