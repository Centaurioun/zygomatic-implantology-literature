# Applications of CAD/CAM Technology in Dental Implant Planning and Implant Surgery

Kathleen Manuela D'Souza and Meena Ajay Aras

Abstract Proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning is paramount to achieve the best long-term prognosis in implant dentistry. Computer-aided implant surgery has dramatically improved the quality of surgical procedures used for dental implant bed preparation and implant placement. The term computer-aided implant surgery encompasses computer-guided implant surgery using static surgical guides and dynamic surgical procedures using navigation systems and computer-oriented surgery. In this chapter, we will be extensively discussing computer-guided implant surgery. The three-dimensional assessment of the restorative goal [using cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT), radiographic template and implant design programs] allows realistic planning and optimized positioning of implants using surgical guides. Three patient case reports are discussed which included the use of Implant planning software, namely, NobelClinician™ software and 3Shape Implant Studio® CAD software and stereolithographic surgical guides for predictable implant placement. Advances in dynamic implant surgery will also be discussed towards the end of the chapter.

# 1 Introduction

Osseointegration of dental implants is significantly dependent on a thorough presurgical planning, followed by a precise surgical and prosthodontic approach [1]. The past three decades have witnessed an increasing use of dental implants. Advancing technologies have facilitated the application of dental implants for the replacement of missing teeth. Although conventional dental implant placement encompasses reflection of a muco-periosteal flap, an increased level of patient satisfaction has been reported with minimally invasive surgical procedures and implementation of computer-aided implant surgery [2-4].

Use of conventional imaging techniques with clinical examination is considered insufficient for diagnosis and treatment planning for minimally invasive surgeries [5]. Consequently, advances in diagnostic imaging tools using cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT), interactive implant planning software and evolution of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology has revolutionized pre-surgical treatment planning and has promoted computer-aided implant surgery (CAIS). Hence, CAIS has become the mainstay of most oral and craniofacial reconstructive efforts.

This chapter will sensitize the reader to computer-aided implant surgery and provide an overview of the currently available systems that support computer-aided implant surgery. It will also review and illustrate the application of computer-guided technology and surgical guides in dental implant surgery with the help of three clinical case reports.

# 2 Overview of Technology

Computer-aided implant surgery is "the capability of performing virtual surgery based on the use of medical/dental imaging files (DICOM, STL, vrml, obj, etc.) using computer software. The results are used to develop digitally manufactured surgical guides or navigation directions for robotic guidance for surgery" [6].

It involves the following surgical protocols: (a) static navigation: computer-guided implant surgery using static surgical guides and (b) dynamic navigation: a computer navigation-based implant surgery or a computer-oriented implant surgery. A constant research in this field aims at a restoratively driven, patient-centred surgical outcome.

Computer-guided static navigation allows a fully guided (FG) bone implant drilling sequence and implant placement using static surgical guides. Whereas, dynamic navigation allows real-time monitoring of the bone drilling and implant placement using three-dimensional (3D) software [7-9].

The various benefits and drawbacks of each type of system [7-9] are enumerated in Table 1.

# 3 Need for Computer-Based Implant Surgery

Traditionally, the non-limiting and partially limiting designs of surgical guides provided guidance in angulations and positioning of implant drills at the bone entry point. A lack of correlation between the planned restoration and the underlying alveolar bone anatomy was commonly encountered. Also, 2D interpretation of radiographic

This demanded the application of computer-guided implant surgery in complex and compromised cases. The objective of computer-based surgery was to alleviate inadequacies of conventional two-dimensional (2D) imaging tools and traditional surgical guides.

Computer-guided implant surgery minimizes the errors in implant positioning compared to manual/conventional surgical guide implant placement [10]. Implant surgery with completely limiting design of surgical guide increases safety, predictability and efficacy of the treatment outcome in cases with excessive hard and soft tissue loss, sinus pneumatisation or atrophic alveolar ridges [11, 12].

In addition, computer-guided protocol promotes minimally invasive surgeries with possibility of immediate delivery of prosthesis. It offers gold standard treatment, with minimal patient visits and lesser post-operative morbidity, at affordable cost [12].

This system favours the production of customized prosthetic and surgical components needed for the treatment, such as surgical guides, provisional restorations, customized healing abutments and final prostheses. It increases productivity and reduces laboratory production delays. In addition, computer-guided implant surgery offers predictability with temporary restoration of dental implants and needs less time in adaptation of temporary prosthesis in immediate loading protocols [12, 13]. Nevertheless, it promotes an integrated prosthetic and surgical workflow.

It has shown favourable results in terms of accuracy and implant survival rates [14]. Even though literature reports deviations between planned and clinical positions of implants placed using completely limiting design of surgical guides, lesser deviation values were obtained with full-guided implant surgery as compared to half-guided surgery (HG) (implant placed without the surgical guide after osteotomy) [15-17]. It was also noted that computer-guided surgical guides provided greater accuracy and were more consistent in their deviation from the planned locations than conventional surgical guides and free-handed (FH) implant surgery [18-21].

# 4 What Is Computer-Guided Surgery?

"Computer-guided implant surgery" is defined as the use of a static surgical guide that reproduces the virtual implant position directly from CT data and does not allow for intra-operative modification of the implant position [22]. It involves reverse planning and fabrication of a static surgical guide, which is used to assist in proper surgical placement and angulation of dental implants [23]. A restorative treatment plan is created prior to establishing the surgical protocol. This is achieved by fabricating radiographic scan prosthesis or using intra-oral optical impressions and virtual models. This is followed by a CBCT scan. These images are then imported into a software program on a personal computer, which allows virtual treatment planning. Virtual surgical planning encompasses pre-surgical manipulation of 3D images of an anatomic site for the purpose of measuring outcomes and to design devices, grafts, and techniques. A digital plan, thus, obtained is used to fabricate a surgical guide. These surgical guides, accompanied by implant specific drilling instrumentation, allow precise implant placement in planned positions.

Typically, the surgical guide consists of two parts: (a) the guide body (contact surface) which fits either on the patient's mucosa, bone or teeth and (b) the guiding cylinder (sleeve) placed within the surgical guide to guide the drills in the exact position and angulation [24].

# 4.1 Classification of Computer-generated Surgical Guides

Based on method of fabrication, three types of guides have been reported:

(a) 3D printed surgical guide based on acrylic radiographic scan prosthesis [24].  
(b) 3D printed surgical guide based on intra-oral optical scans/laboratory scan of dental cast [25].

(c) Computer milled guides or mechanical templates--are fabricated by drilling the final position of the implants in the radiographic template using a computer-guided drilling machine. This is followed by setting titanium guide cylinders in the exact same position and angulation as previously planned [5, 8].

Based on guide support, four types of guides have been reported [7, 26]:

(a) Mucosa-supported: These guides are associated with flapless surgery. In completely edentulous patients, these guides are supported by the buccal and lingual mucosal flanges and the palatal mucosa. In addition, transmucosal fixation pins help in its stabilization during the surgery. Whereas, in partially edentulous patients with a long span of edentulous area, these guides are supported partly by mucosa and partly by teeth adjacent to the edentulous space.  
(b) Bone-supported: This surgical guide is supported by the bone surface which requires reflection of a full-thickness flap. They are indicated in cases with bone deficiencies requiring bone augmentation procedures, cases with anatomical limitations or in cases with lack of keratinized mucosa.  
(c) Tooth-supported: the guide is supported on the teeth adjacent to the edentulous space.  
(d) Special supported, (mini) implant, pin-supported surgical guides: this surgical guide is attached to implants inserted before or during the actual implant surgery.

# 4.2 Step-By-Step Protocol Involved in Fabrication of 3D Printed Surgical Guides for Dental Implant Surgery

The following workflow is adopted to obtain a conventional computer-generated surgical guide (Fig. 1).

# 4.2.1 Fabrication of Scan Prosthesis

A scan prosthesis or radiographic template is a partial or complete acrylic removable prosthesis, incorporated with radiographic markers, that conveys the ideal prosthetic positioning of the teeth for the definitive prosthesis during the CBCT scan. It can be either fabricated de novo from a diagnostic wax up or by duplicating the patient's existing denture, if it is aesthetically and functionally acceptable. Some of the crucial factors to be considered during the fabrication of a radiographic template are as follows [27, 28]: (a) precise fit of the prosthesis to the underlying mucosa, (b) precise extension of flanges to provide stability to the prosthesis during scanning, (c) involves mock-up of the ideally positioned artificial teeth, based on the patient's functional, biomechanical and aesthetic requirements, (d) proper incorporation of fiducial (registration/radiographic) markers [29] and (e) fabrication of an

Nevertheless, creation of a virtual patient by superimposition and registration of digital intra-oral scans with CBCT data has helped to alleviate shortcomings in surface reproduction of teeth in a CBCT image [37-39]. Digital impressions or surface scans of dental models have been suggested to replace conventional fabrication of scan prosthesis in partially edentulous patients [40]. Although the marker-based method of digital registration is considered more accurate, newly developed surface registration algorithms have greatly increased accuracy [41, 42]. These registration algorithms allow the clinician or the laboratory to utilize readily available dental surface markers, such as cusp tips, denture borders and soft tissue profiles, to facilitate digital registration. The dentogingival model scanning is superimposed on

DICOM files using specific software to create a virtual model of the patient. This promotes optimization of the digital treatment workflow, simplifies communication between clinician and laboratory, reduces expensive laboratory work and dental appointments needed for the fabrication of the scan prosthesis and promotes efficient time-cost workflow since there is fast processing of surgical guide. Moreover, digital scans alleviate errors that may be caused by ill-fitting or inaccurately fabricated scan prosthesis [39, 42, 43]. However, one of the major limitations of this technique is that it is helpful only in partially edentulous patients. For completely edentulous patients, incorporating intra-oral scan images into the CBCT data would not be possible, since mutual landmarks on both digital images, such as part of the teeth, are required [37]. Another significant limitation is the influence of imaging artefacts in CBCT data on the registration accuracy. For the purpose of registration, areas on the tooth surface represented in the virtual stone cast and in the model produced from radiographic data are selected and these markings must be discernable in the respective images to be registered. However, scatter artefacts can obscure these markings. Also, radiopaque markers placed on the buccal or lingual aspect of restored teeth will not be visible on a CBCT scan. Composite resin markers in the vertical plane can be used to alleviate this problem [40, 44].

When a laboratory scanner is used, first the diagnostic cast is scanned to obtain a soft tissue representation and then a rescan of the manual wax-up and the interocclusal relationship of the upper and lower cast is carried out. The first scan facilitates the placement of the guide sleeve in the surgical guide and the second scan helps to create a virtual diagnostic waxing image. Alternatively, the mirror image of the contralateral teeth can also be used in the software to create a digital wax-up. The resulting files are then superimposed on the CBCT scan to facilitate the implant position planning in relation to the planned restoration [37].

Various intra-oral scanners are commercially available. Some popular ones include CEREC® Omnicam (Dentsply Sirona Global, NC, USA), Primescan® (Dentsply Sirona, Bensheim, Germany), 3Shape Trios® (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark), Virtuo Vivo™ (Dental Wings Inc., Montreal, Canada) and iTero® (Align Technology, Inc., California, USA). Laboratory scanners for dental model scanning are also available, for example, 3Shape lab scanner (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark), 7Series Model and Impression Scanner (Dental Wings Inc., Montreal, Canada) and Ceramill® Map 400+ Scanner (Amann Girrbach GmbH, Koblach, Austria).

The modified workflow for fabrication of computer-generated surgical guide using intra-oral scanners is presented in Fig. 2 [25].

# 4.2.2 CBCT Scanning Procedure

Dental CBCT offers a three-dimensional evaluation of the concerned oral and craniofacial region by generating images that precisely replicate the clinical situation on a computer. A CBCT scan along with a third-party software program allows the clinician to visualize and interpret the anatomical situation of the patient. It has

CBCT machines emit a cone-shaped X-ray beam which is detected on a flat panel detector (FDP) receptor, both of which are simultaneously rotating  $180 - 360^{\circ}$  around the patient's head. The captured 2D images of the maxillofacial region are converted to 3D volumetric data. This process is carried out on a computer using a modified Feldkamp algorithm to create DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files [46]. DICOM file is a standardized file format used for handling, storing, transmitting and communicating CBCT data. It is a set of axial images that are merged together to form the volume data of the anatomical structures. These files are exported to a third-party software that enables surgical planning, transfer of data to surgery via 3D printing of surgical guides/observation systems and transfer of data for production of prosthetic solutions [47].

# 4.2.2.1 Indications

The following are the main indications for CBCT in implant placement: (1) evaluation of quality and quantity of residual bone, (2) three-dimensional assessment of implant site topography, (3) visualization of vital anatomic structures around implant site, (4) fabrication of surgical guides, (5) identification of any associated complexities and (6) patient education.

# 4.2.2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of CBCT

The high spatial resolution, small size isotropic voxel and segmentation accuracy of reconstructed CBCT datasets allows production of a high-quality image. It involves relatively less radiation exposure, reduction in the size of irradiated area by collimation of the primary X-ray beam to the desired area, rapid scan time, compact size, easier handling and accessibility and is economical, as compared to the conventional CT.

Certain limitations associated with CBCT include (1) lack of distinct soft tissue contrast, (2) inability to estimate the bone density using Hounsfield units [48], (3) artefacts incorporation in the image due to patient motion, dense restorative materials or a combination of both and (4) need for adequate training to operate CBCT and diagnose datasets. However, recent research and development of software algorithms aim to alleviate these shortcomings: (1) software algorithms improving signal-to-noise ratio and thus, increasing contrast, (2) improvement in image quality allowing structural analysis of bone in contrast to the density-based analysis, (3) artefact suppression algorithms and increasing number of projections causing reduction in metal artefacts, e.g. Metal artefact reduction software (MARS) by Sirona [49].

# 4.2.2.3 Display Modes in CBCT

The CBCT machine produces multiple basis projection frames which are collectively known as the projection data. The projection data is primarily reconstructed by the CBCT software to produce axial slices, which are further processed to generate inter-relational images in three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal and sagittal views). In addition to these views, other display modes generated include multiplanar reformations (MPR) consisting of oblique planar deformation, curved planar deformation, serial trans-planar deformation and multiplanar volume deformation [47].

- Oblique planar reformation produces non-axial 2D planar images by cutting across a set of axial images at any angle. It is useful to evaluate particular structures, such as winding angles of mandibular canal.  
- Curved planar reformation produces "simulated" distortion free panoramic images by aligning the long axis of the imaging plane with a specific anatomic structure. It is useful to trace the jaw during dental implant planning.  
- Serial trans-planar reformation produces series of stacked cross-sectional images orthogonal to oblique or curved planar reformation with option of selecting the thickness and spacing. It is useful in assessment of specific morphologic features such as alveolar bone height and width for implant site assessment.  
- Multiplanar volume reformation: produces an image that closely represents a specific volume of the patient by thickening the MPR slices:

- Ray sum or ray casting: this image can be generated by adding up adjacent voxels to the MPR slices. It is useful in generating virtual projections such as panoramic or cephalometric images identical to conventional radiographs without magnification and parallax distortion. However, this technique uses the entire volumetric data set and there can be superimposition of multiple structures [50].  
- Volume rendering: this generates an image which allows visualization of volume by selectively displaying voxels within a data set to facilitate spatial orientation of the jaw and object placement control during planning. This involves direct volume rendering and indirect volume rendering. Direct volume rendering involves picking an arbitrary threshold of voxel values, below or above which all grey values are excluded. Most commonly used technique includes maximum intensity projection (MIP). MIP is useful for surgical follow-up and for visualization of soft tissue calcifications [46]. Indirect volume rendering (IVR) involves selection of the density of the voxels to be displayed within an entire data set (segmentation) resulting in a volumetric surface reconstruction with depth. It can either be a solid view (surface rendering) or a transparent view (volumetric rendering). IVR is useful for visualization and analysis of craniofacial conditions and determination of relationships of various anatomic features [46].

# 4.2.3 Virtual Planning and Transfer of Data to Production Unit

Simulation computer software is used to create a CAD model of the patient's jaw for the accurate transfer of the virtually planned implant position to the surgical site. The virtual model that is solely reconstructed from CBCT data does not display the teeth accurately enough for the manufacturing of a surgical guide. Thus, integration of a virtual model of the teeth (derived from a CBCT scan of the scan prosthesis or an intra-oral surface scan or extra-oral scan of a stone cast) with the radiographic model (derived from CBCT scan of the jaw) is required. The surface scan of the patient's oral cavity is exported to the software in the Standard tessellation language (STL) format. This procedure, which involves the integration of the DICOM data set (CBCT model) with the STL file (virtual model) by a process of alignment of the two data sets in one virtual coordinate and transformation of the three-dimensional images, is known as registration [44]. The registration process helps in the pre-operative digital implant planning, surgical guide file creation based on the virtual model of the teeth and export of the created file to an external system for manufacturing.

The simulation software includes a realistic library of varied implant systems necessary for the virtual implant planning. It facilitates selection of a suitable implant fixture based on the anatomical situation, the planned prosthetic outcome and the specifications for each implant as delineated by the manufacturer. It permits import or export of DICOM data and STL files with third-party systems. The software also includes the tools needed to design and to enhance the surgical guide and to design the planned prosthetics. Once the plan is formulated, the software automatically creates a surgical report in the PDF format on the implant plan (implant type, and specifications such as platform, length and width) and designed guide with all the necessary information needed for successful surgery. On approval of the plan, the software automatically creates a STL file that can be directly sent to a suitable 3D printer.

Several commercially available proprietary 3D interactive computer software programs are available, which include Simplant® (Materialise Dental, Leuven, Belgium), Nobel Clinician™ (Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland), CoDiagnostix® (Dental Wings Inc., Montreal, Canada), VIP  $3^{\text{®}}$  (BioHorizons, AL, USA), Planmeca Romexis® 3D (Planmeca Oy, Helsinki, Finland), 3Shape Implant studio® (3Shape medical A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Blue Sky Plan® (BlueSkyBio, LLC, USA).

# 4.2.4 Fabrication of Surgical Guide

A completely limiting design of surgical guide further allows a predictable transfer of planned implant positions from computer to the patient. It helps to direct the surgical drills during the implant osteotomy and implant insertion. The process of building a three-dimensional object from a CAD model by successively adding material layer by layer is known as 3D printing or additive manufacturing process or rapid prototyping.

Resin 3D printing includes a vat polymerization technique in which a photosensitive resin is cured by a light source to produce solid layers. The resin is contained within a vat/tank and is cured against a build platform, which moves slowly away from the tank as the part is formed. Based on the light source used, there are three types of resin 3D printing technologies, namely, stereolithography (SLA), digital light processing (DLP) and liquid crystal display (LCD).

Stereolithography (SLA) is the most commonly used technology and it employs a vat of liquid ultraviolet (UV) curable photopolymer "resin" and a UV laser to build parts' layers one at a time. The laser beam is directed by mirror-like devices known as galvanometers. For each layer, the laser beam traces a cross section of the part pattern on the surface of the liquid resin. On polymerization of the surface layer, the mechanical table carrying the previously polymerized layer of the model moves down by  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . Exposure to the UV laser light cures and solidifies the pattern traced on the resin and joins it to the layer below [6]. Only  $80\%$  of total polymerization is completed in the vat, whereas the remaining  $20\%$  needed to be achieved in a conventional UV light curing unit [28]. Based on the diameter and angle of the simulated implants, the SLA machine selectively polymerizes the resin around the planned implant position, forming a cylindrical guide. This cylindrical guide is then fitted with a metal sleeve to guide the implant drill [51]. Stereolithography uses a STL file which describes only the surface geometry of a 3D object without any representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes. This file format is supported by all available 3D printers [24]. Thus, the stereolithographic-guided surgery system includes a stereolithographic surgical guide with implant system-related mounts for fixture installation, additional guide sleeves for fixation screw installation, drill keys of different heights and depth-calibrated drills to prepare the osteotomies. Some systems use consecutive guides with different sleeves to allow increasing drill diameter during surgery, while some use a single guide with different adjustable drill handles. Sleeveless guide design is also available that helps reduce costs of the surgical guide, since it alleviates material costs for sleeves and additional work required to fasten them into the guide [26]. Various improvements have been reported in the presently available 3D printers, such as rising build platform, improvements in the material properties of the photopolymer resin used, improved optical system to prevent errors in focusing and inexpensive in-office desktop 3D printers [52].

Digital light projector (DLP) technology uses a high-intensity light source uniformly across the entire build surface for curing the photo-reactive polymers. The light is selectively directed using a digital micromirror device (DMD) consisting of multiple tiny mirrors. Liquid crystal display (LCD) is similar to DLP. It uses a high-resolution LCD screen with UV LED backlighting to cure photopolymers layer by layer. More accurate surgical guides are achieved by SLA and DLP as compared to LCD. However, DLP and LCD technology produce faster prints as compared to SLA and LCD technology is cheaper than its counter parts.

Various 3D printers are available commercially for the fabrication of computer-generated surgical guide, for example, Form 2 SLA (Formlabs Inc., MA, USA), SprintRay Pro® DLP (SprintRay CA, USA), Planmeca Creo™ C5 LCD (Planmeca Oy, Helsinki, Finland) and Zenith 3D® SLA (Dentis Global, Daegu, Korea).

# 4.3 Case Reports Illustrating Application of Computer-Guided Technology to Dental Implant Planning and Dental Implant Surgery

Patient 1 is treated with an "All-on-4®" (Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland) treatment concept using NobelActive (Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland), which involves CT-based computer-guided implant planning using NobelClinician™ software, conventional flap procedure and standardized All-on-4® guide (Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland). Patient 2 is treated with implant-supported overdenture prosthesis with DIOnavi. implants (DIO Implant, Busan, Korea), which involves CT-based computer-guided implant planning using 3Shape Implant studio® implant-planning software (3Shape medical A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark), flapless implant placement and stereolithographic surgical guide with guide sleeves (Form 2 3D printer, Formlabs Inc., MA, USA).

# 4.3.1 Patient 1 (Courtesy of Department of Prosthodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Goa Dental College and Hospital)

A 70-year-old female patient with severely mutilated dentition reported to the department for replacement of missing teeth. Patient reported that she lost most of her teeth due to caries and periodontal disease. After a complete diagnostic evaluation, complete extraction of teeth and the "All-on-4®" (Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland) treatment concept, with immediately loaded full arch restoration, was planned for both the jaws. The treatment protocol includes placement of two implants vertically in the anterior region with straight Multi-unit abutment and two implants at an angle of up to  $45^{\circ}$  in the posterior region with angled Multi-unit abutment. Here we will be discussing rehabilitation of the maxillary arch (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).

# 4.3.2 Patient 2 (Courtesy of Department of Prosthodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Goa Dental College and Hospital)

A 65-year-old man presented with completely edentulous mandibular arch and a single implant with a locator attachment in the left mandibular canine region. Patient reported that all his mandibular teeth were extracted due to severe wearing pattern and gross breakdown of tooth structure. His lower jaw was restored with an implant-supported overdenture prosthesis using two implants, placed bilaterally in the canine region with locator attachments. However, failure of right mandibular implant was noted and patient requested rehabilitation of the lower arch. After a complete diagnostic evaluation, an implant-supported overdenture on ball attachments using four implants (DIOnavi.digital implant system, Busan, Korea) in 31, 32, 42, 43 region was planned (Figs. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22).

# 4.3.3 Patient 3 (Courtesy of Department of Prosthodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Goa Dental College and Hospital)

A 60-year-old female patient reported to the department for replacement of missing teeth in the maxillary arch. She reported that she lost her teeth due to caries and requested for a fixed option for replacement of missing teeth. After a complete diagnostic evaluation, "All-on-4®" (Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland) treatment concept using Osstem implants (Osstem Implant Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) and immediately loaded full arch restoration was planned for the maxillary arch (Figs. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31).

# 5 What Is Computer-Navigated Surgery?

Computer-navigated implant surgery is designed to allow implant placement in real time by a computer using the virtual plan formulated based on patient's CBCT scan. This system requires a motion tracking technology (hand piece array, patient tracking array and light source), which tracks the position of the dental drill relative to the patient's position (bur tracking) using sensors, as seen in Fig. 32. This three-dimensional positional information is then correlated with the previously of NobelActive implant  $(\varnothing 4.3\times 15\mathrm{mm})$  using the all-on-  $4^{\text{国}}$  guide was done, (f) the anterior and posterior Multi-unit Abutments  $(17^{\circ}$  and  $30^{\circ}$  respectively) were tightened using Unigrip Screwdriver Machine and Manual Torque Wrench Prosthetic. The angulations were verified using the pre-mounted holder which acts as a guide to allow for proper emergence of the prosthetic screw, (g) the Mutli-unit Abutment healing caps were placed on top of the Multi-unit Abutments prior to suturing. The position of the abutments was indexed on the denture by using heavy body impression material (Aquasil ultra heavy (Dentsply/Caulk, Konstanz, Germany) in the intaglio surface of the denture, to create space for the temporary coping Multi-unit cylinders


The light source above the patient reaches the patient tracking array and the array on the hand piece. The light is reflected from the arrays to two high-definition cameras. The captured reflected light is transmitted to the system-specific navigation computer to create the dynamic real-time representation. If necessary, changes to the plan can be made intra-operatively to achieve accurate implant placement. This system integrates dental implant surgical instruments, medical imaging technology (CBCT), optical positioning devices along with pre-operative planning software to perform precise dental implant surgeries [8, 53].


Navigation surgery is especially helpful in patients requiring dental implants in posterior maxillary/mandibular region where soft tissue in the vicinity of the planned implant site obstructs the view of the surgical field, or when short inter arch distance interferes with proper alignment of surgical drills with surgical guides [54].

Current dynamic navigation systems in implant dentistry include Image Guided Implant dentistry (IGI) (Image Navigation Ltd., New York, USA), X-Guide Dynamic 3D Navigation (X-Nav Technologies, Lansdale, USA), Navident

(ClaroNav, Toronto, Canada) and Inliant (Inlant Dental Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).

# 6 What Is Computer-Oriented Surgery?

In this type of surgery, there is a simultaneous use of information from digital planning and data derived directly from the clinical reality at surgery to assist in the placement of dental implants. The objective is to provide a creative and flexible surgical environment that can adapt to diverse intra-oral scenarios as encountered during surgery. The surgeon gathers all the necessary information during the planning stage, which includes dental models, CBCT scan, panoramic radiograph, 3D virtual models with virtual implant placement and intra-oral photographs. This information is then relayed on a computer multi-screen along with the intraoperative intra-oral information gathered by the microscope camera during surgery, as seen in Fig. 33. This surgical protocol promotes interactive use of information to allow "documented real-time decision making". This system allows the use of surgical guides or navigation system during the initial drill phase of surgery to establish initial path of implant drill or the entire surgery can be carried out using the COIS method [53].

# 7 Complications Associated with CT-Based Dental Implant Planning and Surgery

Literature reports various studies determining the accuracy of computer-guided technology for dental implant surgery, since safety and effectiveness of guided surgery are closely related to its accuracy. The accuracy of implant placement is often evaluated by the superimposed pre- and post-operative CBCT image and measurement of the deviations at the coronal or apical part of the implants along with mesiodistal and bucco-lingual discrepancies (distance error) and implant axis angle deviations (angular error). Also, vertical error (when placement is deeper or shallower than that in the plan) and horizontal error (when there is lateral displacement compared to the plan) are encountered in guided surgery [5, 15, 17-20, 51, 55-57].


The most common surgical and prosthetic complication encountered in computer-guided implant surgery is caused by the misfit between the installed implants and the prefabricated prosthesis. Deviations at the shoulder of the implants can hamper the correct fit of a prefabricated construction and require adaptation of fit or

Vertical error is commonly encountered than a horizontal error since superior border of alveolar bone is not distinctly demarcated in CT data during the implant plan, resulting in shallow placement of implants. Distance error is larger in the apex than coronal area, since angular displacement at the occlusal surface causes increased horizontal error at the apex [51].

A meta-analysis assessing accuracy of implants placed with fully guided surgery compared to half-guided surgery suggested higher accuracy with fully guided surgery with mean coronal deviation of  $1.00\mathrm{mm}$  in FG and  $1.44\mathrm{mm}$  in HG, mean apical deviation of  $1.91\mathrm{mm}$  in FG and  $1.23\mathrm{mm}$  in HG, and mean angular deviation of  $3.13^{\circ}$  in FG and  $4.30^{\circ}$  in HG [15]. An in vivo study assessing the accuracy of a fully digitalized plan for generating a stereolithographic surgical guide yielded results comparable to conventional guided implant surgery. It indicated an angular pattern of deviation between the planned and achieved implant position, with mean coronal deviation of  $1.05\mathrm{mm}$ , mean apical deviation of  $1.63\mathrm{mm}$  and mean angle deviation of  $3.85^{\circ}$  [55]. A meta-analysis involving clinical and preclinical studies on computer-guided implant surgery with static guides revealed results similar to the aforementioned in vivo study with a mean coronal deviation of  $1.12\mathrm{mm}$ , a mean apical deviation of  $1.39\mathrm{mm}$  and  $4^{\circ}$  angle discrepancy. It also suggested that flapless surgery exhibited higher accuracy compared to muco-periosteal reflection. Mucosa- and tooth-supported guides exhibited better accuracy compared to bone-supported guides. Tooth-supported guides tended to be more accurate compared to mucosa- or mucosa- and pin-supported guides [17].

Studies assessing accuracy of dynamic navigation suggested the results obtained demonstrated accuracy which is equal [56] or better than the in vivo accuracy reported in the literature for static surgical guides, with mean coronal deviation of  $0.71 \mathrm{~mm}$ , mean apical deviation of  $1.00 \mathrm{~mm}$  and  $2.26^{\circ}$  of angle deviation [57]. Thus, it can be concluded that dynamic navigation is a reliable method for executing computer-aided implant surgery; however, it is directly influenced by the surgeon's experience level.

Complications can occur because of the following factors in static computer-guided implant surgery [58-60]:

1. Radiographic template error—Inaccurate planning can occur in case of non-ideal prosthetic wax-up, poor adaptation or orientation of the template during the scanning process.  
2. Error during image acquisition and data processing, on average less than  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ . These errors include: (a) Scanning error-patient movement during the scan, extensive dental restoration artefact obscuring axial images, spatial resolution problems in CT, (b) Registration error—errors in data fusion due to limitations in CT resolution and metal scattering, improper placement of radiographic markers.  
3. Planning error—improper virtual planning of implants on the software.  
4. Error during manufacturing of the surgical guide, typically around  $0.1 - 0.2\mathrm{mm}$  with stereolithography [44]—depends on the manufacturing process involved, improperly placed guide sleeves.  
5. Mechanical error due to tolerance of surgical instruments (the bur-cylinder gap).  
6. Error during surgical guide positioning—movement of the guide during the drilling, improper fixing of mucosa-supported guide using anchor pins.  
7. Errors due to limited mouth opening.

8. Surgical guide fracture or drop out of metal sleeve.  
9. Complication due to bone overheating.  
10. Human error—setting the bur stop in an incorrect position.

These errors can result in early intra-operative or late prosthetic complications [5, 17, 26]:

The intra-operative complications include alteration of surgical plan and early implant loss due to limited primary implant stability, intra-operatively broken surgical guides, incomplete seating of prosthesis due to bony interference, incomplete placement of implant to the planned depth, implant dehiscence, and need for additional grafting procedures.

The prosthetic complications include prosthetic screw loosening, prosthetic misfit and prosthesis fracture.

# 8 Conclusion

Although errors in computer-guided implant surgery are in clinically acceptable range, for more accurate surgery, development of standardized methods to reduce the above-mentioned errors is necessary.

There is a need for further long-term clinical studies and randomized clinical trials to understand the factors influencing the accuracy, implant survival, bone loss and clinical complications associated with computer-aided implant surgery. Although advanced technology is applied, basic fundamentals such as proper case selection, patient preparation, surgical planning and execution are of paramount importance.
