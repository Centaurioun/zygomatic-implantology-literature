Abstract Reconstruction of oral and craniofacial bone defects has been a challenging issue for maxillofacial surgeons, periodontists, and scientists. The application of nanomaterials in craniofacial bone regeneration is a newly advancing field which holds great capabilities for enhancing conventional therapeutic methods. Nanomaterials mimicking the nanostructure of bone tissue and representing distinctive smart functions are requisite for better bone regeneration in craniofacial region. In addition, nanobiomaterials can immobilize and deliver various bioactive molecules including small molecular drugs, growth factors and genes under a controlled manner, which promotes osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Several nanoparticle-based approaches such as nanohybrid scaffolds and nano-modified membranes were used to enhance bone regeneration for dental implant therapy, maxillary and mandibular bone reconstruction, and periodontal regeneration. Despite our knowledge in nanobiomaterials is rapidly growing, there are still concern regarding their standardization, safety, and efficacy for clinical applications. In this chapter, we highlight the applications of nanobiomaterials as bone scaffolds, delivery systems, and barrier membranes for craniofacial bone regeneration. The key challenges and future directions of nanomaterials for craniofacial bone regeneration are also discussed.

# 1 Introduction

Bone defects in craniofacial area caused by trauma, infections, congenial deformity, etc., are common and compromise the functions and aesthetics [1]. Various bone grafting materials [2, 3] have been applied to restore the structure and functions. Application of autologous bone grafting is the current gold standard in both orthopedic and cranio-maxillofacial bone repair [4, 5]. The autogenous bone grafts are obtained from surrounding tissues of the bone defects' site or from distant anatomical sites such as iliac crest or rib. However, autogenous bone grafts have limited supply and may cause nerve injury, pain, discomfort, and postoperative wound infections in the donor sites [6, 7]. In addition, failure in the long-term outcome can also be observed as massive resorption of the transplanted autogenous bone [8]. Allogenic bone grafts and various biomaterials such as hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), and bioactive glass (BG) are receiving an increasing attention due to their large supply and no disease transmission. The traditional solid bioceramics are less satisfied due to their low bioactivities.

Nanomaterials with designed structures at the size range of several to several hundred nanometers (nm) present distinctive physical, chemical, and biological characteristics which are different from conventional bulk materials, and attract great attention in bone regeneration. For example, nanoparticles have been used for tracking mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [9, 10], and also for enhancing osteogenic differentiation towards various cells [11]. Nano-engineered scaffolds which mimic the structure of natural bone consist of a unique combination of hierarchical nano to macro structures that are designed and applied for craniofacial bone repairing. For example, by manipulating the designing of nanostructures, the mechanical properties of nanomaterials including their strength and stiffness can be turned to mimic natural bone structures [12]. In addition, various forms of nanomaterials such as nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanoparticles have recently emerged in the field of bone regeneration to improve the performance [13, 14].

In the stem cell-based therapy for bone tissue engineering, nano-/microscale interactions with different components of extracellular matrix showed a source of passive mechanical forces which can be influenced by a small-scale technology (Fig. 1). Nanotechnology fabricates a bio-inspired platform for regulating stem cell differentiation through advanced material design and/or smart drug delivery systems [12]. In the ensuing parts of this chapter, we will discuss nanomaterials incorporated scaffolds, nano-delivery systems, and nano-modified membranes for bone tissue engineering in craniofacial region.

# 2 Biological Mechanism of Bone Repair

Bone tissue is naturally structured with a unique pattern of collagen type one nanofibers and hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (Fig. 2). During bone regeneration process, assembly of these organic nanofibers with nano-inorganic crystals (biomineralization)

Bone healing is a complex process that usually involves two process primary or secondary bone repair. Primary process only remodels lamellar bone in a correct anatomical reduction of bone, which may take months to years. Secondary process is the most common form of bone repair that occurs in bone defects or fractures, which consists of the following steps:

(a) Hematoma formation in the defect site that brings various growth factors and stem cells.  
(b) Acute inflammation that recruits macrophages and neutrophils, and activates osteoprogenitor cells.  
(c) Granulation tissue formation with active stem cell proliferation, extracellular matrix secretion, and angiogenesis.  
(d) Biomineralization and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts, vascularization, and woven bone formation.  
(e) Remodelling of the newly formed bone and formation of the Haversian system and osteoclasts [16].

During these well-orchestrated cascades of biological events, numerous intra/extracellular signalling pathways and cell types participate to regenerate bone and rehabilitate the functions [17, 18]. It has been shown that platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), transforming growth factors (TGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) play important roles in the initiation and development of bone regeneration. PDGF and TGF- $\beta$  are released immediately after bone injury by osteoblasts and chondrocytes [19, 20]. These growth factors have vital roles in the natural proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells, and abnormal growth factor expressions can cause impaired healing [21].

# 3 Nanobiomaterials for Craniofacial Bone Regeneration

# 3.1 Nanobiomaterials-Based Bone Substitutes

Natural bone is made of organic constituents including collagen, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) and inorganic phase mainly consisting of HA  $(\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\mathrm{PO}_4)6(\mathrm{OH})_2)$  [22]. The presence of other elements such as silicon, magnesium, sodium, and potassium is also important for the physical property of the bone. To repair a bone defect, calcium in combination with phosphates forms the framework and other elements such as silicon helps in initial remineralization process. A wide diversity of bone substitute materials has been used in craniofacial bone regen eration, such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and calcium sulfate. Calcium phosphates show greater resistance to resorption when compared to calcium carbonates and calcium sulfates; hence calcium phosphates are more widely used as scaffold materials [23]. Calcium phosphate such as HA, biphasic ceramics, TCP, and bioactive glass (calcium with phosphates linked to silica glass) are added with small molecular drugs, growth factors, and genes for bone tissue regeneration [12]. HA is the most widely used bone repair materials and for the design of HA, In vitro studies demonstrated that HA with smaller size (nano-HA,  $67\mathrm{nm}$  size) remarkably promoted osteoblast adhesion comparing to conventional HA with size of  $179~\mathrm{nm}$ . This may attribute to the high adsorption of vitronectin (a protein that promotes adhesion) on nano-HA ceramics [24]. Nano-HA were also applied for bone regeneration in sinus floor elevation surgery [25], where nano-HA showed similar bone repairing performance to freeze-dried allografts in vivo [26]. Although the application of nano-HA in extraction sockets showed hard tissue and soft tissue regeneration [27], nano-HA is brittle and its low mechanical strength is considered as a major limitation for its applications in bone regeneration. In this regard, many composite materials including PCL, PLA, and PLGA combined with nano-HA to improve their mechanical properties [28]. In fact, nanobiomaterials opened a new horizon for designing the most appropriate scaffolds for specific applications [28]. Based on the clinical purposes, they can generate specific characteristics, for instance, metallic nanomaterials including titanium and silver can be used in high-pressure areas [29, 30]. Ceramic nanomaterial scaffolds provide both metallic and nonmetallic properties [31], and composite nanomaterials often demonstrated a combination of dual functionality and biocompatibility with desired mechanical properties [32].

Nanomaterials in combination with drugs, genes, and proteins/enzymes initiate, accelerate, and configure bone regeneration in the body. Currently, researchers are stressing on their property of growth factors and enzyme delivery and sustained release in the affected site. They can be broadly classified as nanocomposite scaffolds, nanofibers scaffold, and nanoparticle incorporated in the scaffold [33].

# 3.1.1 Nanocomposite Scaffolds

Nanocomposites for bone repairing usually refer to a combination of polymers and inorganic nanoparticles that have been applied for bone regeneration due to their appropriate mechanical strength and good biocompatibility [34]. The new generation of materials can synergistically combine the advantages of polymers (e.g., lightweight, biocompatibility, and resilient) with the bioactive properties of inorganic nanoparticles [35]. The idea behind the application of nanomaterials is that, same scale materials to the bone infrastructure can improve materials' surfaces and bonding with surrounding bone tissues (Fig. 3) [36]. Previous studies demonstrated bioactivity of various nanoparticles including HA, TCP, and BG in a polymeric matrix which can be originated from polyethylene, polycaprolactone, and poly(ether ketone) in bone tissue engineering [34, 35].

# 3.1.2 Nanofiber Scaffolds

Nanofibrous incorporated scaffolds commonly consisted of fiber bundles (usually  $10 - 500\mathrm{nm}$ ) resembling collagen fiber bundles in the extracellular matrix. High surface-to-total-volume ratio improves cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in these bone substitutes [37]. In fact, it has been shown that these nanofibrous scaffolds adsorb high amount of proteins and interact more properly with the cells which significantly increase osteoblasts attachments [38]. It was shown that the presence of nanofibers had a good impact on cell shaping and cell growth [39]. In vivo studies showed more bone formation after using nanofibrous scaffolds in comparison to solid bone substitutes [34, 40].

Fabrication of nanofiber scaffold is done by three methods: electrospinning, self-assembly, and phase separation. The electrospinning can be used for both synthetic and natural polymers. In the dentistry, gelatin membrane made by electrospinning has been used for periodontal tissue regeneration. Self-assembly is an autonomously forming process where components are arranged into a specific structure such as fibers. Some proteins can self-assemble to form complicated fibrous structures such as collagen, the main extracellular matrix in bone tissue. Phase separation is a process of quenching a single-phase polymer solution and separating the polymer into a polymer-rich phase and a solvent-rich phase. The separation is thermodynamically preferred as the separated phases have lower free energy in the system [41]. With this method, nanofibers with a size of  $100\mathrm{nm}$  can be formed and allow the fabrication of heterogeneous structures. Various designs of nanofibers scaffolds aim to mimicking the collagen fibers of natural bones. These architectural characteristics of nanofibers also enable the transport of cellular substances such as nutrients and signalling molecules [37].

# 3.1.3 Nanoparticle Incorporation in Scaffolds

Nanoparticles also can act as a bioactive component in scaffolds which enhance bone regeneration via sustained release [42]. Calcium- and silica-based nanoparticles have been shown to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis which lead to a significant amount of newly regenerated bone [34]. In addition, they can deliver other bioactive molecules such as growth factors and provide a prolonged releasing period [43]. The addition of nanoparticles to polymer scaffolds mimics the deposition of apatite crystals onto the bone matrix, enhancing the cell response for regeneration [44]. In addition, nanoparticles embedded in scaffolds can improve the mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering applications [45].

# 3.2 Nano-Based Delivery Systems for Bone Regeneration

Nanotechnology and nano-based delivery systems are applied for bone regeneration and provide additional advantages compared to traditional delivery systems. Over past decades, nanotechnology has rapidly been developing in order to fabricate various nanocarriers including micellar formulations [46], polymer-drug incorporation [47], liposomal nanocarriers [48, 49], and inorganic nanoparticles [50] for delivery therapeutic agents [51, 52].

Nanomaterials with designed size and surface properties can carry small molecule drugs, nucleic acids, and proteins such as growth factors and antibodies [53]. In addition, recent investigations are working on "smart" nanoparticle-based delivery by adding some features to make them to be responsive in their biological environment. For instance, there are several nano-based delivery systems that are reacting to enzyme, pH, or redox levels alteration [54-56]. Figure 4 shows the current approaches for controlled release in nanocarriers.

Although the direct application of various bioactive molecules has been increasing for bone regeneration, direct administration has limitations such as non-specificity, low cellular uptake, and fast degradations [53]. These limitations lead to the usage of supra-physiological dosage which increased the risk of adverse effects and low efficiency. Nanoparticle-based carriers can able us to handle pharmacokinetics of the agents including protecting them from biodegradation. Nanoparticles as controlled drug delivery systems can enhance the efficacy by targeting specific cells and tissues

[57], and improve transport properties by allowing more efficient deep penetration of therapeutic agents [58]. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have several benefits in comparison to other approaches which include lower immune reaction, flexibility of designing to provide smart and low toxicity materials, and safety [59]. However, they often have low transfection efficiency [60]. On the other hand, there are various designing methods which can ameliorate this problem. In addition, their nano-dimensions cause a remarkable distinct physiochemical property that changes their fundamental characteristics including diffusivity, solubility, immunogenicity, and toxicity [57]. Several types of nanobiomaterials as delivery systems have been studied in bone regeneration. Silica nanoparticles (nS) because of their structure can carry high drug loadings and have the capacity of various surface modifications [61]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies showed no toxicity of silica particles (reviewed in [61]), and also FDA classified silica as "Generally Recognized as Safe" [61]. Clinical investigations demonstrated higher osteoconductivity and biocompatibility in silica nanoparticles incorporated bone substitutes [62-65]. In addition, silica nanoparticles inhibited bacteria adhesion and the unwanted inflammatory reaction [66, 67]. It has been shown that PLGA nanoparticles (nPLGA) can be used for target-specific and controlled delivery of drugs, antibodies, peptides, and growth factors (reviewed in [68]). In addition, nPLGA illustrated very little or no toxicity on cells and human organs [69, 70]. In the ensuing paragraphs, we will discuss the influencing physical factors, current applications of nanocarriers in bone regeneration, and existing challenges and future directions.

# 3.2.1 Physical Influential Factors

An effective nanocarrier not only should target specific cells and tissues, and efficient cellular uptake [71], but also avoid rapid clearance and immunogenic reactions [71, 72]. For instance, shape and size of these particles can determine their circulation time, the ability to pass through biological barriers, degradation, and drug release kinetics by affecting surface-to-volume ratio [73].

# 3.2.1.1 Shape and size

Nanoparticles' shape affects many delivery characteristics including cellular uptake, toxicity, and biodistribution [74]. For instance, in comparison to sphere shape, nonspherical shapes have higher specific surface area that can provide more feasible modifications opportunity for delivery systems. On the other hand, nonspherical shapes delineated decreased cellular uptake and biodistribution, and increased immunogenicity [74]. In addition to cell uptake, biodistribution of nanoparticles can be significantly influenced by their diverse geometry (rods, quasi-hemispherical, cylinder, etc.). Decuzzi and Ferrari reported that among silica nanoparticles with four different shapes (spherical, discoidal, quasi-hemispherical, and cylindrical), cylindrical shape particles mostly accumulated in the liver, whereas spherical silica nanoparticles mainly collected in the reticuloendothelial system [75]. Recent studies revealed that nanoparticles shape also modulates immune responses. Kumar et al. represented that rod-shaped polystyrene nanoparticles stimulate Th1 cells to produce antibody while spherical nanoparticles induced Th2 cells antibody expressions [76]. Moreover, ellipsoidal PLGA nanoparticles showed significant induction of  $\mathrm{CD - 8^{+}}$  cells compared to spherical similar particles both in vitro and in vivo [77]. These phenomena can be explained by different antigen presentations to immune cells which caused different immune reactions, but the exact mechanism of this process is still unknown.

The other important physical factor of nanocarriers is their size [78, 79]. Zhang et al. demonstrated that size rather than shape can influence toxicity and biodistribution of nanogold particles. In fact, they showed that nanogold particles are distributed in different organs based on their sizes [80]. Moreover, cell uptake efficacy can be significantly altered by nanoparticles size. For instance, Mou et al. exhibited that mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with  $50\mathrm{nm}$  diameter had the best cellular uptake efficiency among a range of  $30 - 280\mathrm{nm}$  MSNs particles [81]. Nanotechnology also facilitates controlling delivery efficacy of nanoparticles by using various designing methods. For instance, Fig. 5 demonstrated a nanolithographical method for the preparation of a nanostructured surface with nanogold particles to bind with BMP-2 [82]. In this technique, the size of gold nanoparticles can be exactly determined which offers a molecular-level controlling capability for growth factors delivery.

# 3.2.1.2 Surface Modifications and Surface Roughness

Recently, surface-modified nanoparticles are becoming attractive drug carriers. In this regard, mostly natural or synthetic polymers are used to prepare nanoparticles [83]. The surface characteristics of nanoparticles are more important in comparison to the core due to the direct contact of this layer with cells, extracellular matrix, and fluids. In this regard, nanoparticles can be coated by various hydrophilic polymers for longer circulation in the body or can be conjugated with specific ligand proteins in order to site-specific delivery.

Lin et al. demonstrated that the transmembrane transport of MSNs is closely related to their surface zeta potentials and thus MSNs with positive charged surface can enter the cells more effectively than negatively charged similar nanoparticles [84]. Many surface modifications including polyethylenimine (PEI), amino group, and poly-L-lysine [85, 86] have been introduced to enhance cell uptake. But usually, cationic additive groups cause cytotoxicity and poor bio-stability [87].

Another physical factor is the surface roughness, which can improve protein adsorption capacity. Previous studies have shown that surface roughness can enhance cellular uptake in solid nanoparticles [88, 89]. Although it can influence cell uptake, it has a little contribution to lysosomal or endosomal escape and mostly surface modifications such as hydrophobic surface modification can improve these processes [90].

# 3.2.2 Current Application of Nanocarriers in Bone Regeneration

Nanomaterials commonly were applied for the delivery of growth factors, drugs, and nucleic acids (gene delivery) in bone tissue engineering [91]. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the concept of nanoparticle-based delivery systems for each of these categories. In addition, some of the most frequent nanocarriers and their applications in bone regeneration are summarized.

Growth factors, especially bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), mainly regulate the bone repair process [92]. A multitude of approaches have been investigated to deliver and immobilize these factors to the bone substitutes or dental implants [93]. One possibility is to incorporate growth factors into nanoparticles [94, 95]. In this regard, nanoscale materials are offering a advantage of molecular-level immobilization of scaffolds [80]. For instance, Cao et al. prepared a chitosan nanoparticle incorporated hydrogel loaded with BMP-2 and revealed that this combination increases cell proliferation, and adhesion in vitro, and bone regeneration in rabbits' radial critical-sized defects [96]. In addition, chitosan nanoparticle BMP-2 loaded hydrogel showed a significantly higher amount of new bone formation and bone marrow cavity consolidation in comparison to BMP-2 loaded hydrogel. Another improvement that can be done by nanoparticles is the sequential growth factor delivery. Previously BMP-2 and BMP-7 co-delivery were achieved by nanocarriers that constituted two different polymers (PLGA and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)) with different biodegradation periods. In comparison to simultaneous delivery, this approach significantly enhanced the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs [97].

Another application of nanocarriers is for local drug delivery systems in bone tissue engineering [98]. One of the most common drugs that were used in bone regeneration is dexamethasone [88, 91]. Oliveira et al. produced a dexamethasone loaded dendrimer NPs and they have shown that these pH-responsive drug-loaded dendrimers enhanced ectopic bone formation in rat models [99-101] (Fig. 6). These evidences confirm that nanoparticles can provide a preprogramming capability of delivery systems for bone tissue regeneration.

Another application of nanocarriers in bone regeneration is gene delivery. Although viral vectors have shown great transduction efficacy, there are some limitations to their clinical applications due to the potential safety and immunogenicity concerns [102]. Nonviral vectors such as nanocarriers have been applied to transport genes in a safer way in comparison to their viral counterparts [103]. Nanoparticles with rational design can pass through the cell membrane and escape from endosome/lysosome [91]. Kim et al. applied amine-modified MSNs for delivering BMP-2 DNA into rat MSCs [104]. The functionalization of MSNs with amine groups and enhanced its transfection ability up to  $18\%$ , and totally  $66\%$  of MSCs were transfected after 7 days. In another study, Santos et al. used PAMAM dendrimers for BMP-2 transfection which also demonstrated an efficient way of gene delivery for bone regeneration [105]. Other small nucleotide sequences such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs which regulate several biological mechanisms post-transcriptionally also can be delivered by nanoparticles. For instance,

Nanoparticles with various compositions are now available for preclinical research and clinical applications to deliver desired drug, growth factors, or bioactive molecules (Fig. 7). The most common nanoparticles that are being applied as a delivery system in bone tissue engineering consist of two major categories, organic or inorganic particles, and are discussed in the following part.

# 3.2.2.1 Liposomes

Liposomes are vesicles of mono- or bilayer of natural phospholipids which are commonly used as vehicles for drug delivery. For fabricating liposome carriers, genetic molecules are incorporated inside the liposome that can be done with two potential methods based on the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the desired molecules [108]. Liposomes are biodegradable and biocompatible. In addition, technically it is feasible to functionalize liposome to react to light, pH, and other stimuli which made them the most frequent clinically applied nanoscale delivery system with many commercialized types [110].

# 3.2.2.2 Dendrimers

Dendrimers are nanoparticles made of polymers with tree-like structures. These nanoparticles are usually biocompatible and biodegradable [111]. Its inner site commonly includes amine or other molecules with multiple reaction sites [112], and the surrounding functional groups provide a unique physicochemical property. These nanocarriers are also able to be responsive to various stimuli such as ionic condition, temperature, light, and pH [113]. Dendrimers are frequently used for target delivery with reliably reproducible results and appropriate pharmacokinetics in clinical applications [114].

# 3.2.2.3 Polymeric Nanoparticles

Nowadays, polymeric nanoparticles have been attracting attention due to their unique physical properties, various molecular architecture, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. In addition, their fabrication methods are flexible and various functionalization techniques are available [116]. Commonly polymeric nanoparticles are of spherical shape with  $100\mathrm{nm}$  diameter that can modify according to their applications. Polymeric micelles, spherical nanoparticles (Nanocapsules), and nanofibers are the most frequent type of these categories. Polymeric nanoparticles have a great loading capacity of various inorganic or organic molecules which can be dispersed, dissolved, or covalently linked with their monomers [116]. Hence, they are currently applied as a delivery system in cancer treatment, vaccination, inflammatory diseases, and tissue engineering [116-118]. Similar to other nanocarriers, polymeric nanoparticles can be functionalized with different methods generally based on the size of the ligand. Small ligand can be added to them before or after formation [119, 120]. However, larger molecules including polysaccharides, antibodies, or growth factors usually denature during fabrication; therefore, preferably they are linked at the surface of nanocarriers [121].

# 3.2.2.4 Nanofibers

Incorporating bioactive molecules directly into the materials is a novel strategy of smart delivery systems. But the incorporation of molecules especially proteins directly into scaffold is technically hard to procedure due to the desired molecules that may denature during fabrication procedure or cannot be released after scaffold forming. In this regard, nanofibers gained increasing attention because of their ability to mimicking natural extracellular matrix structures with high encapsulation efficiency of bioactive molecules [122, 123]. These nanofibers exhibited a gentle release pattern of different molecules without the initial burst release [95, 124]. Nanofibers can act as delivery vehicles with encapsulating desired molecules at specific sites and releasing them with various mechanisms such as erosion or degradation of fibers, and diffusion of factors. Figure 8 showed a specific designing of nanofiber scaffold for co-delivery of Dex and BMP-2 that gradually released by degradation of nanofibers and enhanced bone regeneration in an animal model [95].

# 3.2.2.5 Silica and Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles

Silica is a biocompatible and chemically stable material used in various medical applications including drug delivery [125]. According to their application silica nanoparticles can be synthesized as mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), bulk silica nanoparticles, or core/shell silica nanoparticles. For controlled drug release usage, usually MSNs are applied because of their distinct pore size and structure, various morphologies, their resistance to heat, pH, and mechanical stress, and their low toxicity and ease of fabrication [126, 127]. Considering their pore size and volume that can precisely control during fabrication, they can be loaded by various numbers of molecules including small molecular drugs and growth factors [128].

# 3.2.2.6 Ceramic and Glass Nanoparticles

Bioceramic nanoparticles have been applied for enhancing scaffolds' physical properties, and also controlled delivery of various bioactive molecules [129, 130]. Despite that the synthesis of some of the bioceramic nanoparticles, especially bioactive glasses, is not simple, they attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages [131, 132]. Both natural and synthetic nanoscaled molecules can also add to them to produce a nanostructure delivery system [133, 134]. In addition, calcium phosphate nanoparticles have been previously used for gene delivery system in bone defect. DNA-functionalized calcium phosphate nanoparticles effectively delivered BMP-2 genes over 10 days [135].

# 3.2.2.7 Carbon Nanotubes

After the discovery of carbon nanotubes in the 1990s, they have been used in a wide variety of fields including microscopy, biosensing, reinforcing materials, and drug delivery systems [136]. These materials are graphitic tubular structures which are made of carbon atoms with a very high chemical and physical stability. Given their tubular molecular structure, they can be functionalized from inside and outside which provide a great opportunity for fabricating different delivery systems [137]. However, for clinical applications it is still needed to perform deeper toxicity tests due to the fact that several variables including diameter, charge, purity, etc., influence carbon nanotube's cytotoxicity [138].

# 3.2.2.8 Metallic Nanoparticles

Metallic nanoparticles demonstrated distinct properties, and are different from bulk nanoparticles due to the quantic effect [139]. Gold nanoparticles among metallic nanoparticles have been applied for many purposes, such as bioimaging, biosensing, and drug delivery [140-142]. This versatility is due to their several surface modifications, optical properties, and biocompatibility [143]. Gold nanoparticles are synthesized with various shapes including rods, spheres, cages, and star-like [91]. These nanoparticles were used to deliver bisphosphonate drugs previously [144, 145]. For instance, recently alendronate (a common bisphosphonate) is successfully delivered by gold nanoparticles in animal models and human [146].

# 3.2.2.9 Magnetic Nanoparticles

This group of nanocarriers consists of metallic or metallic oxide cores and inorganic or polymer coating [147]. Similar to the aforementioned nanoparticles, they can be functionalized for target drug release. Application of magnetic nanoparticles as drug delivery systems provided the opportunity to control specific target locations with an external magnetic field. Some of these materials have been successfully administered in bone regeneration for growth factors and gene delivery [122].

# 3.3 Nano-Modified Membrane Barriers for Guided Bone Regeneration

Generally, the growth speeds of connective tissue are faster than bone tissue. As a result, the invasion of fibrous tissue occurs in bone defect sites resulting in a barrier that prevents the growth of new bone [148, 149]. This invasion of connective tissues leads to anatomical aberrations and may need additional surgery for removal [150, 151]. Guided tissue/bone regeneration (GTR or GBR) is a well-established method that utilizes a barrier membrane against connective tissue invasion and promotes osteogenesis or bone augmentation forming (Fig. 9) [152-154]. Recent studies showed that membranes with drug delivery system could promote the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone regeneration (Fig. 9) [147, 149-151]. Currently, this method is widely used for periodontal regeneration and dental implants [149, 155].

Many researchers have tried to fabricate and modify GTR/GBR membranes by mixing synthetic and natural components by various techniques including film casting [156-158], dynamic filtration [159], and spinning [160]. In addition, these membranes can be prepared with drug and growth factors [156, 157, 161]. However, a material with appropriate degradability, biological, and mechanical properties is still requisite for in vivo GBR. Although these methods showed some major advancement, their application in clinical settings is still limited due to difficulty in handling and non-homogenous degradation rate [162]. Recent advances in nano technology increased the chance of fabricating biomimetic multifunctional membranes for periodontal GBR. Figure 10 showed a sample of these novel fabrications with the usage of nano-HA.


In a study by Wu et al. (2017), surface-modified chitosan nanofibrous membrane was applied in GBR of a critical-sized calvaria model in rats. The nanofibrous chitosan membrane was initially generated by electrospinning and surface modified using a butyrylation method. The process of surface modification proved advantageous in creating desirable fibrous morphology, increase in mechanical stability, reduced rapid swelling, attracted the adhesion and proliferation of fibroblast, and promoted regeneration [163]. The mechanical property of the GBR regenerative membrane strongly influences the nature of clinical applicability [164]. For example, in another study, a ratio (60:40 wt%) of nano-  $\beta$ -TCP particles and polycaprolactone, respectively, yields a high bending property suitable for regeneration of large mandibular defect [165].

An approach to synchronize mechanical property and regenerative function inspires the development of multiple layered barrier membranes. The combination of carbonated nHA/PLGA using biomimetic and casting techniques can create porous and smooth surfaces on opposite sides of the membrane. This approach can control membrane flexibility, mechanical strength, and rate of biodegradation, altogether enhancing the biocompatibility and osteoconductivity function of the HA nanoparticles [157]. The nanoparticles can mimic the mineral crystals of the body and induce a significant change in the mechanical properties and regenerative quality of the membrane [166]. The fabrication of a robust regenerative membrane with bioactive compounds to support adequate regeneration of osteoporotic bone remains a major clinical challenge. In a recent study, functionalized nHA/carbon nanotubes with graphene oxides promoted osteointegration and regenerative bioactivity essential for the repair of osteopenic bony defects [167].

The use of electrospinning to fabricate the bilayered GBR membrane is an ideal option to enhance flexibility and mechanical strength. The biocompatible polyester (PCL) and polyglycerol sebacate (elastomeric polymer) are ideal candidates for this method. The bioactivity of the membrane can be further enhanced by the incorporation of  $\beta$ -TCP nanoparticles, which is osteoconductive and resorbable to support successful regeneration of bony defect [168]. For the same purpose, bilayered silk fibroin/PCL-PEG-PCL electrospun membranes were combined with nanocalcium phosphate. The synthesis of nanocalcium phosphate was done using a distinct approach, using a flame spray pyrolysis method. In this method, synthetic precursors of the calcium phosphate (liquid form) are pumped through a nozzle, dispersed by oxygen, ignited with methane and oxygen premixed gases. The nanoparticles are further collected on glass fiber filter above the flame and incorporated into the electrospun polymeric matrix. The membrane attracted apatite nucleation, induced mineralization, and enhanced osteoconductivity. Furthermore, the tensile strength of the membrane increased with the two-layered polymeric matrices maintaining stable coherent phases [169].

In another approach, the GBR membrane can be fabricated using a solution casting method with biocompatible, naturally derived polymeric microsphere. In this method, chitosan microspheres are initially generated and blended with a slurry of nHA particles using a wet chemical precipitation method and casted. An in situ biomimetic method can generate nHA/chitosan composite microsphere applicable in fabricating a GBR membrane. The incorporation of the microsphere can significantly enhance the mechanical property of the membrane. Meanwhile, microsphere-containing membrane has the advantage of maintaining space, improving biomimetic function, and promoting effective regeneration of bony defects [170]. The regenerative function of the GBR with antimicrobial properties can accelerate healing and regeneration of bony defects. The strategy to generate these kinds of membrane takes into consideration microbial control and efficient recapitulation of the extracellular matrix [171]. Additionally, GBR membranes are fabricated to release drugs, serve as regenerative barrier, and guide bone regeneration. In this direction, Tang et al. (2016) fabricated a GBR membrane comprising a PLGA/HA (core) and collagen/amoxicillin (shell) via coaxial electrospinning method. The core-shell nanofiber adequately prevented the invasion of fibroblast into the area of the bony defect, due to the small pores of the membrane, together with its hydrophobic property. The in vitro results confirmed the nanofibrous membrane having the capacity to induce apatite nucleation and efficiently release the drug (amoxicillin) [172]. The functional behavior of polymeric membrane can be decorated, by the addition of silica nanoparticles and osteoconductive polymeric surfaces. First, the silica nanoparticles are synthesized to achieve mono-sized units via a sol-gel Stöber's method [173] to overcome particle aggregation, and poor interaction between polymeric interfaces, before electrospinning [174]. It is worth noting that the GBR membrane might have different properties, in terms of structure, regenerative performance, and degradability. However, the membrane must be sufficient in stiffness and biocompatibility to prevent collapse and avoid soft tissue invasion into the defect area. As such, these key properties will define an ideal membrane: (1) biocompatibility, (2) space-making, (3) cell occlusiveness, (4) tissue integration, and (5) resorbability [175].

# 4 Current State and Challenges of Nanobiomaterials Application

While promising results are demonstrated using nanomaterials for craniofacial bone regeneration, several challenges and prerequisites need to be addressed prior to translation to clinical settings. The first challenge is to optimize the biocompatibility and mechanical properties. For instance, nanomaterial-based hydrogel demonstrated a perfect cell proliferation during bone regeneration, but its mechanical properties are not suitable for some bone defects. On the other hand, the application of nanopolymers can strengthen hydrogel scaffold, however decrease its cellular biocompatibility [176]. In order to enhance cell viability, although novel scaffold fabrication techniques including electrospinning and 3D printing have been presented, until now, these methods have not been applied for nanomaterial-based craniofacial bone regeneration [176]. The second important issue is the immunogenic properties of the nanomaterials. Despite a bone substitute may totally mimic natural bone structure or even show superior cell viability, it may also cause some severe immune response in some individuals [177].

The other issue is nanomaterials' long-term potential side effects and toxicity. The ultra-small size of nanoparticles allows them to interact with normally unreachable substrates for their bigger counterparts [178]. Those particles' toxicity relies on numerous variables, such as particle size, surface charge, shape, administration manner etc. [179]. For instance, nanoparticles applied in oral cavity may enter into liver and spleen via bloodstream through the gastrointestinal route [178, 180]. In this regard, the systemic distribution of nanoparticles by the gastrointestinal tract and bloodstream demonstrated its neurotoxicity in zebra fish [179, 181]. In addition, most data about nanomaterial toxicity is based on in vitro dose-response assays in vitro [182]. More in vitro evaluating tests are needed to facilitate their further safe administrations.

# 5 Conclusion and Future Direction

The development of nanotechnology in bone tissue engineering presents greater diversity in designing scaffolds for enhancing proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation. Nanobiomaterials, by mimicking the nanostructure of natural bone tissue, represented promoted osteoblasts functions in comparison to their microstructured counterparts. Several studies have delineated the potential of nanoparticles for improving drug delivery and membrane barriers in bone regeneration. These materials showed a precise and smart immobilization of various growth factors in order to improve vascularization. In addition, nanofibers resemble the native extracellular matrix to provide a better microenvironment for bone regeneration.

Although there is still a need for further knowing the mechanisms and finding practical ways especially investigating in vivo long-term safety, for applying them in the craniofacial region, it is hoped this rapidly growing field will help us to reach efficient therapeutic approaches for craniofacial defects.
