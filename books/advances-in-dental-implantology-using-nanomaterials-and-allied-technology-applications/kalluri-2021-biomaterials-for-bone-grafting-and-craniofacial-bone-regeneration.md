# Biomaterials for Bone Grafting and Craniofacial Bone Regeneration

Lohitha Kalluri and Yuanyuan Duan

Abstract Reconstruction of craniofacial defects poses a challenging task for craniofacial surgeons. Reconstruction of the underlying craniofacial bone is crucial for successful outcome of these defects. Bone grafting is the standard technique employed for bone reconstruction. However, with the advent of novel biomaterials as bone substitutes for grafting procedures, attractive alternatives have unlocked for surgeons. Since a few decades, the field of craniofacial bone regeneration has expanded enormously with the advent of novel biomaterials and innovative concepts such as bioprinting and drug delivery. At present, several natural and synthetic bone graft materials are available as bone substitutes. In this chapter, the authors will focus on the various biomaterials that are currently used as bone substitutes in craniofacial bone regeneration along with an update of the active research among each class of biomaterials going on in this area. Also, the authors will brief-in the recent concepts for craniofacial bone regeneration.

# 1 Introduction

# 1.1 Brief Introduction of Craniofacial Bone Regeneration

Craniofacial bone defects are the defects associated with bones of skull and face. Congenital birth defects (1/700 live births) such as cleft lip, cleft palate, craniosynostosis, and hemifacial microstomia are the most common causes of craniofacial defects in children. Acute trauma such as vehicle accidents, falls, sports injuries and physical assaults, cancer surgeries, and inflammation are the most frequent causes for craniofacial defects in adults. Reconstruction of the craniofacial defects is challenging as craniofacial tissue construct itself is complex, comprising bone, cartilage, neurovascular tissues, and soft tissues [1]. Accurate reconstruction of craniofacial bone is crucial in these defects to provide support and structural stability for adjacent soft tissues, thereby improving the appearance of associated facial structures. These bony defects could vary from small periodontal defects to complex segmental defects. Especially, in case of large craniofacial defects, soft tissue reconstruction is relatively easier with sufficient underlying bone structure [2].

Unlike skeletal bones, craniofacial bones are flat bones with some peculiar features, but they do have similar bone repair mechanism and metabolic turnover rate as the skeletal bone [3]. There are few major differences between craniofacial and skeletal bones such as their embryonic origin, homeostatic mechanisms, and bone shapes. Craniofacial bones originate from cranial neural crest, unlike the skeletal bones which originate from somites and lateral plate mesoderm [4]. Several authors [5, 6] stated that the bone grafts harvested from craniofacial region had better survival and longer volumetric maintenance compared to skeletal bone grafts, demonstrating different homeostatic mechanisms. Several growth factors, receptors, and associated signaling cascades play distinct roles in the formation of craniofacial and skeletal bones [7]. Also, unlike long bones, craniofacial bones exhibit extremely complex 3D shapes, impeding the precise fit of long bone grafts into these defect regions.

# 2 Biomaterials Used for Craniofacial Bone Grafts

Biomaterials play a vital role in biomedical applications for restoring the structural and functional integrity of damaged tissues. Biomaterials can either replace or regenerate a damaged tissue [8]. Ideally, the biomaterials to be used as craniofacial grafts should have the following requisites as described underneath [9]:

- They should be biocompatible.  
- They should either be osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and/or osteopromotive in nature.  
- They should be dimensionally stable under stress.  
- They should be biodegradable after their intended response at the implanted site.  
- They should be easily moldable in order to conform to the craniofacial defect.  
- They should be easily sterilizable.  
- They should be stable and promote long-term integration of implants.

The biomaterials used as grafts could either be natural or synthetic and are categorized as follows:

# 2.1 Natural Biomaterials

Natural biomaterials are the biomaterials that can be obtained naturally from organisms. For craniofacial bone regeneration, natural biomaterials comprise bone grafts such as autografts, allografts, and xenografts.

Ideally, the bone graft material should possess the following properties as [10]:

1. Osteogenesis: The formation of new bone by osteoblasts derived from the graft material itself.  
2. Osteoinduction: The ability of a material to induce the formation of osteoblasts from the surrounding tissue at the graft host site, resulting in bone growth.  
3. Osteoconduction: The ability of a material to support the growth of bone over a surface.  
4. Structural integrity: Structural strength of the grafted material in compressive strength, and resistance to torsion and shear.  
5. Osteointegrative ability: The capability of the graft to integrate and bond to the host bone.

# 2.1.1 Autografts

Autografts, autologous, or autogenous bone grafts are the bone grafts that are harvested from one site and implanted into another site within the same individual. They may either be cancellous, cortical (non-vascularized or vascularized), or corticocancellous grafts. For craniofacial reconstruction, possible sources of autologous bone grafts could be calvarium, chin, retromolar pad area of mandible, iliac crest, tibial plateau, rib, etc. [11]. The main disadvantage of autografts is the morbidity of donor site, and other possible advantages and disadvantages are outlined in Table 1.

# 2.1.2 Allografts

Allografts are the graft tissues that are obtained from genetically nonidentical members of the same species. These are potential alternatives to autografts in craniofacial reconstruction. Bone allografts are unique in that the cellular component is typically removed to minimize their rejection. In addition, they are thoroughly treated to eliminate any possibility of disease transmission. Allograft is available as cortical, cancellous, or corticocancellous graft in the form of powder, chips, wedges, pegs, dowels, or struts. It can also be customized to desired shapes [12]. Allografts are commercially available as Freeze-Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA), Demineralized Freeze-Dried Bone Allograft (DFDBA), and Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM) in various bone banks accredited from American Association of Tissue Banks [13].

DBM is mainly used for defects and is available commercially in various forms as moldable pastes, putty, strips, gel, granules, and freeze-dried powder. This DBM is often mixed with harvested autograft, bone marrow, or other allografts to increase autograft volume and augment bone healing. The advantages and disadvantages of allografts are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1 Advantages and disadvantages of three types of commonly used natural bone grafts [18]  

<table><tr><td>Bone graft</td><td>Advantages</td><td>Disadvantages</td></tr><tr><td>Autografts</td><td>Optimal osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive properties; gold standard for bone grafting; no risk of immunogenicity and disease transmission</td><td>Pain and morbidity in the donor site, limited quantity and availability, need for additional surgery, hematoma, infection, the need for general sedation or anesthesia, longer operative time, and blood loss</td></tr><tr><td>Allografts</td><td>Osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, no donor site morbidity, possible with local anesthesia, high availability, easy handling</td><td>Lack of osteogenic properties, potential antigenic response and disease transmission, variable osteoconductivity, limited supply, loss of biologic and mechanical properties due to its processing, nonavailability worldwide due to religious and financial concerns and increased cost</td></tr><tr><td>Xenografts</td><td>Osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, low cost, high availability</td><td>Lack of osteogenic properties, the risk of immunogenicity and transmission of infectious and zoonotic diseases, poor outcome</td></tr></table>

# 2.1.3 Xenografts

Xenografts or heterologous grafts are another alternative to autografts and are harvested from nonhuman species, i.e., animals. They possess osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties, but lack osteogenic properties. The advantages and disadvantages of xenografts are outlined in Table 1.

A deproteinized bovine bone graft, commercially known as "Bio-Oss," is the most common bone substitute used in dentistry for guided bone regeneration [14]. Apart from Bio-Oss, another commonly used xenograft in dentistry is "Gen-Os." Gen-Os is a corticocancellous heterologous bone graft harvested either from porcine (Porcine Gen-OS) or equine (Equine Gen-OS) [15].

Also, porous pure hydroxyapatite (commercially available as "Interpore" and "Pro-osteon") derived from marine coral is used as a bone substitute in dentistry for orthognathic surgeries, alveolar ridge augmentation, and periodontal bone defects [16, 17].

# 2.1.4 Natural Degradable Polymers

The use of natural degradable polymers as potential bone substitutes can be attributed to their close resemblance of native extracellular matrix. These polymers can be categorized either into proteins (collagen, gelatin, fibrinogen, elastin, keratin, silk), polysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans, cellulose, amylose, dextran, chitin), or polynucleotides (DNA, RNA) based on their chemical composition [19]. These polymers are mainly used as bone tissue scaffolds and are highly osteoinductive due to their similarity to extracellular matrix. They can be fabricated from decellularized bone tissue obtained either from autologous, allogenic, or xenograft [20]. These natural polymers are highly biocompatible and undergo extensive hydration to form hydrogels under physiological conditions. However, these hydrogels lack adequate mechanical strength, rendering them impossible to use in bone regeneration systems in vivo. Thus, hybrid scaffold systems are developed, wherein these hydrogels are loaded onto ceramic scaffolds to improve mechanical stability [21].

# 2.2 Synthetic Biomaterials

Synthetic biomaterials range from biometals to biocomposite materials and could either be biodegradable or nondegradable. These advantages of synthetic grafts are their wide availability, uniform quality, reduced morbidity, and sterility. However, in vivo performance of synthetic bone grafts is inferior to autografts due to the lack of inherent osteogenic and osteoinductive potential.

# 2.2.1 Biometals

Biometals are used in craniofacial bone reconstruction in various forms as bone reconstruction plates, screws, implants, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. They could either be degradable or nondegradable and are selected based on application.

# 2.2.1.1 Biodegradable Metals

These are defined as the metals that are expected to corrode gradually in vivo, with an appropriate host response elicited by released corrosion products, then dissolve completely upon fulfilling the mission to assist tissue healing with no implant residues [22]. Also, from the materials science point of view, Zheng et al. [22] classified biodegradable metals into three categories as "Pure metals," "Biodegradable alloys," and "Biodegradable metal matrix composites." At present, a lot of research is directed at this particular class of biometals in order to design an ideal material to be used as temporary implants and scaffolds so that it could obviate the need for revision surgeries and promoting a safe and effective bone repair.

Currently, magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are gaining wide popularity as biodegradable temporary implant material in craniofaial applications due to its excellent biocompatibility and better matching of mechanical properties such as the density, elastic modulus, and yield strength with that of bone. However, the major drawback of Mg is its high rate of corrosion in physiological environment. Various metals, such as calcium, zinc, tin, and zirconium, have been alloyed with magnesium in order to control their degradation rate. However, additional research is still required in this area [23].

Apart from  $\mathrm{Mg}$ , a lot of research is also focussed on developing other biodegradable metal alloys such as iron-based and zinc-based alloys. Unlike  $\mathrm{Mg}$ , these alloys do have low rate of corrosion in physiological environment. These alloys are gaining wide attention from researchers and are still at an experimental stage [22].

# 2.2.1.2 Nondegradable Metals (Titanium and its alloy)

Titanium (Ti) is the material of choice for fabrication of bone plates, screws, craniofacial and dental implants, tissue engineering scaffolds, meshes for guided bone regeneration, etc., owing to its biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and superior mechanical properties. However, the potential drawbacks of these alloys are their high elastic modulus relative to the bone, cost, and low wear resistance [8, 24]. Mismatch between the elastic modulus of titanium (110 GPa) and bone (10–30 GPa) results in "stress-shielding effect." Hence, lot of research is directed to minimize the elastic modulus mismatch between titanium and bone.

Titanium and its alloys exist in three forms as  $\alpha$ -form,  $\beta$ -form, and  $(\alpha + \beta)$ -form. Elastic moduli of  $\alpha$ - and  $(\alpha + \beta)$ -type titanium alloys such as Ti and Ti-6Al-4V ELI are higher than those of  $\beta$ -type titanium alloys. Thus,  $\beta$ -titanium alloys are more favorable for the development of titanium alloys in biomedical applications [25]. Currently,  $\beta$ -titanium alloy systems, Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr system, known as Gum metal (Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr) and a Ti-35Nb-7Zr-5Ta system, known as TiOsteum® are gaining attention in biomedical field owing to their low elastic modulus and better osseointegration properties [8, 25].

Apart from  $\beta$ -titanium alloy systems, Takizawa et al. introduced titanium fiber plate with Young's modulus similar to bone to prevent the stress-shielding effect commonly observed with traditional titanium plates. Also, porous structure suitable for cell adhesion could be formed from titanium fibers to be used as a bone repair scaffold [26].

Additionally, novel porous titanium structure is also advantageous to reduce elastic modulus mismatch between implant and bone tissue. Ti-based biomaterials with customized porosity are crucial for cell adhesion, viability, differentiation, and growth, aiding as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. They facilitate bone-ingrowth and achieve long-term biological fixation [27].

Also, Titanium mesh, commercially available as "BoneShields, Ti-Micromesh, Tocksystem," is widely used as synthetic nonresorbable plate in Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) to cover large bony defects [28].

Furthermore, surface morphology of the titanium implant is modified either using additive or subtractive techniques such as plasma spraying, anodization, laser peening, and grit blasting to improve wettability, cell-implant adhesion and attachment, cell proliferation, and osseointegration [8].

# Tantalum Alloy

Tantalum has been introduced as an ideal bone graft material due to its cytocompatibility and osteoinductive nature. Porous tantalum bears a similar porous structure and mechanical properties to natural bone, facilitating bone ingrowth, "osteocorporation," and revascularization [27].

Tantalum-based trabecular structured biomaterial is developed by means of trabecular metal technology [29] (Trabecular Metal™ Material, Zimmer Biomet TMT, Parsippany, NJ, USA). Recently, Zimmer Inc. developed a dental implant with porous tantalum components in midsection (commercially available as "Trabecular Metal™ Dental Implant") to treat immunocompromised patients and for placement in immediate loading implant cases [30].

# Stainless Steel

316L is the medical-grade stainless steel (SS) used for biomedical applications. 316LSS is widely used as internal fixation devices, such as screws, bone plates, pins, and wires, to treat craniofacial bone fracture. However, in future, biodegradable metals and polymers might replace 316LSS as internal fixation devices. The main limitations of this alloy are the adverse effect of metal ions and fretting debris due to wear and corrosion in body fluids as well as the stress-shielding effect on bone due to higher elastic modulus. Nickel and chromium present in the 316LSS are the potential allergens. So, medical-grade high-nitrogen nickel-free austenitic stainless steel (commercially available as Biodur 108, Panacea P558, P2000, and BIOSSN4) is developed, wherein the nickel is replaced by nitrogen for austenitic structure stability and it improves the mechanical properties of steel significantly [31].

# Niobium and Zirconium Alloys

Zirconium  $(\mathrm{Zr})$  belongs to the same group as Ti and possess lower magnetic susceptibility than Ti. It is due to this property, Zr is emerging as a potential alternative to Ti, which when implanted in patient distorts MRI scans. Niobium is added to Zr to enhance its wear and corrosion resistance in body fluids. Nb-2Zr alloy exhibited excellent corrosion resistance, fatigue strength, and crack propagation in simulated bodyfluids [32].

# 2.2.2 Synthetic Biopolymers

These biopolymers are highly crystalline thermoplastics and could either be homopolymer, copolymer, or heteropolymers. Polymers can be broadly classified as degradable or nondegradable on the basis of the reactivity of their chemical backbone. Natural biopolymers were discussed under natural bone substitutes and synthetic biodegradable and nondegradable polymers will be described in this section.

# 2.2.2.1 Degradable

This synthetic class of biomaterials is widely used in bone tissue engineering as scaffolds and as temporary bone implants owing to their strength and biodegradability, wherein they undergo hydrolysis in response to local environmental factors like pH, enzymes, temperature changes, etc., yielding carbon dioxide and water as the metabolic by-products. Also, the rate of biodegradation and strength of the scaffold could easily be customized by varying certain variables such as the type of polymer used, porosity, and fabrication techniques. However, Scaffolds composed of synthetic polymers are osteoconductive, allowing ingrowth of bony tissue, but are not osteoinductive in their native form [8].

Saturated aliphatic polyesters, such as Poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), PLGA copolymers, and Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) are the widely used synthetic polymers for tissue engineering purposes. PCL is also used as a temporary implant due to its slow rate of biodegradation (2-4 years). Biodegradable polyurethane, commercially available as "Degrapol® (Abmedica)" is currently being used to develop a highly porous scaffold for tissue engineering applications [21].

Also, these polymers are used as resorbable membranes in Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) procedures. These synthetic barrier membranes are usually made of either PLA or PGA and several commercial formulations of these polymers are tabulated in Table 2 [28].

# 2.2.2.2 Nondegradable

Poly(ethylene)(PE)(HDPE,UHMWPE), Poly(propylene) (PP), Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), Polyether ether ketone (PEEK), etc., are the nondegradable polymers used in biomedical applications. For craniofacial applications, PTFE, PMMA, and PEEK are widely used. PTFE and e-PTFE were appealing first-generation biomaterials for use in GBR. Recently, Ti-reinforced e-PTFEs were developed to enhance mechanical properties of e-PTFE and are used to augment large bony defects. These PTFE membranes are marketed under the trade names Cytoflex, TefGen-FD, Gore-Tex, and Cytoplast™ Ti [28].

PMMA is widely used as a bone substitute material in skull reconstruction procedures and also as a drug carrier for embedding bioactive substances to promote bone healing. It is supplied in the form of a powder and liquid (Cranioplastic™) which when mixed forms a paste that can be shaped intraoperatively to fit the defect precisely. However, its use has been limited due to its potential risks, such as the release of toxic unreacted methylacrylate monomers, lack of osteoconductive or osteoinductive properties, and exothermic setting reaction [33].

Apart from PMMA, several other polymers such as PEEK (poly-ether-ether ketone), polypropylene polyester knitwear, and PEKK (poly-ether-ketone ketone) are used as cranial implants due to similar properties to the surrounding bone, especially with regard to young's modulus [34].

# 2.2.3 Bioceramics

"Bioceramics" is a term applied to ceramics with biological functionality. These can be classified as bioinert (alumina and zirconia), bioresorbable (tricalcium phosphate), or bioactive (hydroxyapatite, bioactive glasses, and glass-ceramics) based on their chemical surface reactivity.

# 2.2.3.1 Bioinert Ceramics

High purity alumina and zirconia are the bioinert ceramics used in medical applications. They do not play a significant role in craniofacial applications but are widely used in dentistry as dental prosthesis and implants. Currently, tetragonal zirconia polycrystal, particularly  $3\mathrm{mol}\%$  yttrium oxide (yttria)-stabilized zirconia, is emerging as an alternative to traditional titanium dental implants owing to its promising mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, white opaque hue, and low plaque affinity. However, failure rates of zirconia implant systems tested so far were generally higher compared with titanium implants [35]. To date, zirconia implants are manufactured largely as single-piece system. Nonetheless, few two-piece zirconia implants (NobelPearl™, ZERAMEX® XT, and Straumann® PURE Ceramic two-piece Implant) are evolving. Further research and clinical investigations based on the longevity and success of these evolving two-piece zirconia implants are necessitated.

# 2.2.3.2 Bioactive Ceramics

Bioactive ceramics are defined as "bioceramics that bond directly with bone without having fibrillar connective tissue between them." These include hydroxyapatite, bioactive glass, and bioactive glass-ceramics.

# Bioactive Glass and Glass-Ceramics

These are amorphous silica-based biomaterials. When implanted in vivo, these glasses react with physiological fluids and forms a crystallized hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer at the glass/bone interface. This HCA layer mimics inorganic bone component and forms a strong bond with bone without intervening fibrous tissue. The rate of activity and physiological response depends on chemical composition of the glass (ratio of the network former,  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  to network modifier,  $\mathrm{CaO} + \mathrm{Na}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{K}_2\mathrm{O}$ ) and the specific surface area (morphology of scaffold, porosity, etc.). 45S5 ( $\mathrm{Na}_2\mathrm{O - CaO - P}_2\mathrm{O}_5 - \mathrm{SiO}_2$ ) is the first bioactive glass formulation, consisting of  $45\%$  silica. Despite its high bioactivity in physiological fluids, their applications were limited as filler or coating on polymer-based scaffolds and are not used in load-bearing situations or large bony defects due to their low fracture toughness values and poor mechanical strength [36]. These formulations are marketed as GlassBone® (Noraker), BonAlive® (BonAlive Biomaterials Ltda), Vitoss® (Stryker), and Perioglass® (NovaBone) [37].

Subsequently, scientists focussed on improving the mechanical properties of the bioactive glass matrix, which led to the development of apatite/wollastonite (A/W), Ceravital and Bioverit glass-ceramics. A/W glass-ceramics demonstrate increased fracture toughness values than bioactive glasses due to the assembly of apatite phases reinforced by  $\beta$ -wollastonite ( $\mathrm{CaSiO}_3$ ) and can be used in load-bearing applications [38].

# Hydroxyapatite

Synthetic hydroxyapatite (S-HA) is a stable calcium phosphate-based bioceramic and closely mimics natural calcium apatite  $(\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\mathrm{PO4})_6(\mathrm{OH})_2)$  mineral present in human bone. As a bone graft material, it is biocompatible, osteoconductive, bioactive, has a high affinity for proteins and growth factors, and has high wear resistance. It can be prepared either as dense sintered blocks or as macroporous forms. Dense S-HA is nonbiodegradable and is not osteoinductive. But, Porous S-HA, commercially available as "Osbone®Dental" has osteoinductive potential and has low degradation rate in body fluids. This biomaterial is stiff and strong but brittle, limiting its use to nonweight-bearing regions like maxillofacial applications limited to use in situations where there is no physical loading of the apatite as in maxillofacial applications [39].

# 2.2.3.3 Bioresorbable Ceramics

Tricalcium phosphate  $(\mathrm{Ca}_3(\mathrm{PO4})_2)$  (TCP) is a bioresorbable calcium phosphate-based bioceramic with a  $\mathrm{Ca} / \mathrm{P}$  ratio of 1:5. It exists either in  $\alpha$  phase or  $\beta$  phase.  $\alpha$ -TCP degrades faster than  $\beta$ -TCP. The degradation rate of  $\beta$ -TCP is 3-12 times higher than that of HA.  $\beta$ -TCP is highly compatible and is the widely used synthetic graft material for bone reconstruction purposes in orthopedic and maxillofacial surgery. However, its use is limited as filler and coatings on implant surfaces or scaffolds due to insufficient biomechanical strength and mechanical properties. Some of the commercially available TCP products are Ceros®, ChronOS®, Cerasorb M®, Vitoss®, IngeniOs™, Macrobone, etc.

Consequently, bioactive  $\beta$ -TCP is combined with mechanically stable HA, to develop a composite material "Biphasic calciumphosphate (BCP)." BCP (marketed under the trade names "Osteosynt®, Triosite®, MBCP®, Hatric®, OptiMX®") is available in block form or granular form and demonstrates superior osteoinductive effect than S-HA alone [39].

Furthermore, BCP is doped with metal ions such as  $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ ,  $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ,  $\mathrm{Co}^{2+}$ ,  $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ ,  $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ , and  $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$  to simulate the mineral constituent of bone and it enhances the osteoinductive capability of the biomaterial [40].

# 2.3 Biocomposites and Their Hybrids

A biocomposite is a material composed of two or more distinct constituent materials (one usually being naturally derived), which are combined to yield a new material with improved performance over individual constituent materials. These biocomposites can overcome the limitations of single bone substitute materials. These are formed by optimizing the combination or by surface modification and have the ability to stimulate specific reactions in the bone defect area at the molecular level [41].

A biocomposite can be constructed by either of the following procedures as follows:

1. Incorporating bioceramic particles or fibers as a dispersed phase into the polymer matrix.  
2. Coating polymer, metal, or ceramic with a thin layer of bioceramic. Most commonly used biocomposites as bone substitutes are xenohybrids, which are a combination of xenografts and synthetic bone graft substitutes. "PepGen P-15" is a commercially available xenohybrid composed of an organic bovine mineral with a synthetic biomimetic of the 15 AA sequence of Type-1 collagen [42].

# 3 Advancements in Biomaterials for Craniofacial Regeneration

# 3.1 Biomaterials for Controlled Delivery

# 3.1.1 Drug-Loaded Biomaterials

Drugs such as antibiotics, statins (simvastatin), and anti-inflammatory drugs can be enclosed within biodegradable synthetic polymer scaffolds, such as PLA, PGA, PLGA, and PCL, or natural hydrogels, such as fibrin, collagen, gelatin, chitosan, and alginate. The rate of drug delivery in natural hydrogels can be controlled by means of physical or chemical cross-linking. Additionally, with the advancement of nanotechnology, nanoparticle delivery systems, which can penetrate through the capillaries into cells are developed as carriers for therapeutic agents. These biomaterials help in local delivery of drugs at tissue site. These drug-loaded biomaterials are commercially available as Simplex®P, Osteoset-T®, Collatamp®, Septocoll®, Septopal®, Herafill® beads, and Stimulan® [43].

# 3.1.2 Growth Factor Delivery

Various growth factors such as TGF- $\beta$ , FGF, VEGF, PDGF, IGFs, and BMPs play a significant role in craniofacial growth and development. At present, various delivery vehicles based on natural or synthetic polymers, ceramics, and their composites have been devised in the form of sponges, nanofibrous membranes, micro/nanoparticles, and hydrogels, to either chemically or physically entrap GFs into or onto the substrate. Few commercial products based on rhBMP-loaded carrier are approved by FDA for clinical use. These include Infuse® (an absorbable collagen sponge loaded with rhBMP-2 growth factor), OP-1® Putty (a bovine-derived collagen infiltrated with rhBMP-7), and GEM 21S® (rhPDGF incorporated into a  $\beta$ -TCP porous carrier) [37].

# 3.1.3 Stem Cell Delivery

Stem cell delivery using hydrogels and tissue engineering scaffolds is another promising application of these biomaterials. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) incorporated tissue engineering scaffolds produce promising results in bone defect repair. These scaffolds function as native extracellular matrix and aid in the attachment and growth of encapsulated cells, thereby preventing anoikis. Also, these biomaterials protect stem cells against host immune attack and can trigger major cellular processes necessary for bone regeneration. Currently, all the commercial bone grafts incorporating MSCs were based on DBM and these include Allostem®,  $\mathrm{Map3^{TM}}$ , Osteocel Plus®, and Trinity Evolution Matrix™ [37].

# 3.1.4 Bioprinting and Additive Manufacturing

The advent of rapid prototyping technology has revolutionized the field of craniofacial bone reconstruction. The terms 3D printing and 3D bioprinting are used interchangeably in the field of rapid prototyping. However, "3D printing" is the term used to describe the fabrication of inert or bioactive scaffold materials without the presence of living cells, whereas, 3D bioprinting refers to printing of cells and scaffolds together (cell-laden biomaterials) or dense aggregates of cells free from scaffold [37]. Currently, 3D bioprinting is advancing further to 4D bioprinting by incorporating a fourth dimension "dynamic stimulus-responsive environment" [44].

3D printing has been used largely in craniofacial reconstruction to fabricate custom cranial implants using various biomaterials such as titanium and PEEK. Recently, FDA has approved a custom 3D printed titanium craniofacial implant manufactured by BioArchitects [45].

Additive manufacturing modalities like extrusion printing, inkjet printing, or laser printing can be used for bioprinting. The main advantage of this 3D printing is customization, precision, and ease of fabrication. Using 3D printing, internal and external 3D architecture of scaffold systems can be easily customized as per the specific requirements.

Currently, "OsteoFlux" (3D printed CaP osteoinductive material sold by Vivos Dental AG), is the commercially available pre-3D printed scaffold system for craniofacial regeneration [37].

# 4 Conclusion

For the past few decades, the field of craniofacial reconstruction has witnessed an immense advancement with the advent of novel biomaterials, concepts, and technologies. But, so far, neither of these available bone grafts, except for freshly harvested autografts, have osteogenic or truly osseoinductive properties. Hence, an ongoing quest for perfect bone substitute material to replace autografts still persists. However, the amalgamation of additive technology with tissue engineering might unlock new potential and possibilities in craniofacial regeneration techniques in near future.
