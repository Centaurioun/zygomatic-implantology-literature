# 3D Printing in Dentistry: Fundamentals, Workflows and Clinical Applications

Les Kalman

Abstract 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, has technologically exploded in the last few years. Improved accuracy, increased efficiency, lower cost, smaller units, and novel materials have significantly changed the fabrication landscape. Currently, additive manufacturing has been utilized industrially for the fabrication of motorcycle chassis by BMW and brake calipers by Bugatti. This exemplifies that the additive manufacturing workflow through a digital platform presents numerous desirable qualities. Moreover, the performance of additive manufactured high-performance vehicle components demonstrates that this fabrication process delivers functionality.

The health sciences have also seen a vast expansion of 3D printing. The development of unique materials and regulatory approvals has resulted in several patient-specific 3D printed structures restoring form and function.

Dentistry is currently experiencing a trend toward 3D printing. Implant dentistry was one of the first disciplines to experience 3D printed guides for predictable surgeries. A revolution in materials and technologies has resulted in further evolution, including the printing of prosthodontic frameworks, dentures, and implant components.

This chapter will explore the exciting advancement of 3D printing and its applications to industry and medicine, with an in-depth presentation of its application to dentistry. A glimpse into the past, a review of what is current, and a look into the future of 3D printing, will be presented.

The objectives of this chapter are for the reader to appreciate the fundamentals of 3D printing, understand the workflow and current materials, and identify clinical applications of 3D printing.

# 1 Introduction

As a photographer, there's nothing more satisfying than enlarging one of your images as a print or canvas as a true representation of the image you have captured (Fig. 1). Having a print of an image that you have painstakingly composed, created, edited, processed, and printed is truly gratifying. Having your creativity, as something you can hold, display on a wall, or auction off to charity, brings that gratification to the next level. But the process is challenging, as a poor initial image will result in an even poorer enlargement, and that is disappointing. To be able to enlarge an image requires a proper camera body, with an appropriate sensor and related megapixels, and a superb lens. Assuming that ideal exposure criteria resulted in an ideal image (Fig. 1, UL), the next steps are arduous and critical. Images are transferred/exported from the camera into an appropriate image software program, for editing or post-processing (Fig. 1, UR). Once the image has been modified and perfected, it must be reviewed in great detail, to ensure clarity, sharpness, and balance (Fig. 1, LL). The print medium must be decided upon, such as canvas or photo paper, along with the desired enlargement size. The medium will have an impact on the final result and may be limited by technology. The product is then printed. The type of printer is essential to create or fabricate a product that is acceptable. A poor printer will result in a poor output. Once printed, the product is further processed, in the case of a cavass print it is stretched, mounted, and delivered (Fig. 1, LR).

Inadequacies in any of the aforementioned steps will result in a poor and useless final product. This printing process is a cascade of events that are dependent upon each other for the production of an ideal result. It is interesting that a collection of millions of pixels arranged properly in two dimensions to produce a picture can have such an impact or leave an impression. The process of image acquisition, workflow and fabrication, is analogous to the 3D printing process.

# 2 Fundamentals

The scope of 3D printing is immense. The materials, processes, products, and applications are changing daily. This very brief overview is only meant to offer relevant background for those interested or involved in 3D printing in dentistry. The reader is encouraged to further their knowledge with recent journal publications, social media platforms, newsletters, exhibits, and conferences.

# 2.1 What Is 3D Printing?

3D printing refers to the production or fabrication of a three-dimensional object from a three-dimensional file (Fig. 2). 3D printing is a generic term, referring to a collection of different processes and different variables. The commonality is the use of a virtual Computer Aided Design (CAD) (Fig. 2, L) file to fabricate a tangible object [1] (Fig. 2, R).

3D printing tends to be synonymous with additive manufacturing, defining the fabrication process. With additive manufacturing, a product is created or built by adding material sequentially to create a specific object. This workflow requires material added in a very specific order to create the desired end result. Examples to illustrate this process include make-up application, Lego assembly and welding. This is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, which by definition indicates the removal of material from a larger volume to fabricate the end product. Examples of this fabrication process include wood carving, milling, and die threading. Some fabrication workflows employ a combination of additive and subtractive manufacturing, called hybrid manufacturing.

3D printing has also been referred to as rapid prototyping, desktop manufacturing and on-demand printing. These terms give reference for the ability to fabricate a product fast, in-office and at any time, respectively. 3D printing may be commonly defined by the process of fabrication or the technology [2], which is based on the variability of materials and the production pathways. Some examples include [2]:

FDM: Fused Deposit Modelling  
SLA: Stereolithography  
- DLP: Digital Light Projector  
- SLS: Selective Laser Sintering  
- DMLS: Direct Metal Laser Sintering  
ALM: Additive layer Manufacturing  
SLM: Select Laser Melting  
EBM: Electron Beam Melting  
DOD: Drop on Demand  
Material Jetting  
Binder Jetting

Explaining all the technologies is beyond the scope of this chapter. The technologies relevant to dentistry will be explored. Aside from the various technologies, there are numerous materials available for 3D printing, including plastics, metals, and ceramics (see Sect. 3.2).

# 2.2 Brief History

Although 3D printing may seem like a new technology, it isn't. In 1981, Dr. Kodama applied to patent a rapid prototyping device, which was unsuccessful due to funding issues. Another unsuccessful patent was filed for rapid prototyping in 1984 by a French team. In the same year, Charles Hull applied to patent stereolithography, issued in 1986, and started his own company [3].

# 2.3 Why Use 3D Printing?

To understand why 3D printing should be used, it should be contrasted with other methods of production and fabrication. For instance, the conventional fabrication of a single prototype, device, component, or part can be very challenging. It may be fabricated by welding materials together or curing layers of plastic to create a desired form. Once fabricated, these forms require further shaping, sanding, polishing, and finishing. This is time consuming, expensive, frustrating, and the end result may not be satisfactory. Similarly, the mass production of a product through automation requires significant costs, time, and experience within an industrial setting. The production must be closely monitored to ensure accuracy and precision of parts. With the introduction of desktop 3D printers and a digital workflow, prototype fabrication can be greatly simplified. A prototype may be created and refined virtually, and then fabricated by 3D printing with many material options, design changes, and customization at a relatively inexpensive cost and through a relatively simple workflow. 3D manufacturing facilities can deliver mass production through an alternate workflow with high accuracy, precision, and efficiency, with easily adjusted modifications for customization at a reduced cost. Analogous to digital design in 3D printing, editing a document in a software program (Word) is so much more inviting than traditional typing.

3D printing should be utilized by individuals that are interested in [4]:

Efficiency  
- Convenience  
Cost-effectiveness  
- Customization, for either mechanical parts or for patients  
Desirable physical properties  
- Fabrication of complex geometries that may not be possible by other means  
A LEANer approach to manufacturing  
Less environmental impact

3D printing does have its disadvantages, which include limited information of mechanical properties and the required post-processing techniques to improve the surface finish.

# 2.4 Need to Know Information

The most common file for 3D printing is the STL [5]. It is an abbreviation for stereolithography [5]. The file only stores information on surface geometry. It is one of about 30 file formats associated with 3D printing. The STL file works with a " slicer" to transfer and translate the information to be printed (Fig. 3). 3D printer specifications are very critical and relevant to success. Resolution, or print quality, is critical in dentistry. Poor resolution, measured in microns, would result in inadequate prints (Fig. 4).

3D printed structures require supports to hold the final printed product (Fig. 5). The supports need to be removed after a product is printed. The practice of removing supports and refining the fabricated product is called post-processing.

# 3 3D Printing in Dentistry

It has been stated that mother is the necessity of invention. From the author's perspective, 3D printing has had its initial introduction to dentistry through implantology. The prosthodontically driven surgical placement of dental implants requires the accurate placement of an endosseous implant [6]. If the surgical result is accurate (Fig. 6), then the restorative outcome will be compromised or worse, it will fail. It

# 3.1 Workflows

Dental records are an ethical and legal requirement of patient treatment [7]. Records are required to assist with diagnoses, facilitate treatment planning, aid patient presentation, and communicate with the laboratory [7]. The spectrum of records includes photographs, radiographs, CBCT, traditional impressions and models and virtual impressions and models. 3D printing is a form of dental records.

The starting point for 3D printing in dentistry is the generation of a digital file [8], which may be that of a patient's tooth, dentition, arch, impression, cast, or prosthesis. The digital or virtual patient image may be acquired from a computed tomography (CT), cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), or intra-oral hard or soft tissue scanning [8]. Files may be merged for increased information and improved planning. For instance, the CBCT may be merged with an intra-oral scan to provide information about osseous structures, and teeth and soft tissues, respectively. The digital file of a patient's prosthesis can be generated by a variety of desktop scanners with the appropriate resolution.

Digital files may need to be digitally tweaked (Fig. 7) to ensure that they are suitable for 3D printing [9]. For instance, the digital file of a patient's maxilla may seem appropriate, but once the file is assessed in different planes, it is clear that only the outer surface has been digitized (Fig. 8). The digital file must be imported into a third-party software program to digitally "box the impression" (Fig. 9). The digital file will then be of suitable form and volume for 3D printing [9]. Some digital impression programs many have this featured within their software not necessitating third-party software. If the digital file requires printing, as for a diagnostic model of a patient's dentition, then the file may be printed. If treatment planning is required, then the digital file must be imported into a dental planning software application. There are some dental software applications that enable digital impressions and planning into one. Digital planning in dentistry is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the understanding that several steps are required for the planning, and subsequent 3D printing, is important.

# 3.1.1 In-Office Printing

With advances in technology and a reduction in 3D printer size, in-office 3D printing has become attractive to many clinicians. The in-office workflow requires a printer, software, and printing material. Other requirements include physical space in the clinic, adequate time for the process, revenue to offset the time and costs and fortitude of the individual, as the learning curve for 3D printing may be steep for some.

Rather than reviewing specific printers, as 3D printing technology is expanding and improving rapidly, the intent of this section is to provide important technical features so that the clinician or technician may be able to formulate an informed decision based on their requirements and preferences.

Three common technologies in 3D printing in dentistry are stereolithography (SLA), digital light processing (DLP), and material jetting [10]. Each technology can deliver the required accuracy and precision for dental applications. Quality may vary from different systems.

SLA utilizes a vat of liquid resin that is selectively exposed to a laser beam across an area that is to be printed [10]. This technology offers high accuracy and a smooth surface finish with a wide variety of materials and large build volumes for dentistry. It is considered the most affordable approach for applicable dentistry printing but tends to be limited for smaller 3D printing projects.

DLP utilizes a similar chemical process but a projector, instead of a laser, is employed. This technology offers a simple workflow, high speed, and a wide range of materials but lacks the smooth surface finish and accuracy. This technology is more costly than SLA but offers a greater printing volume [10].

Material jetting delivers drops of liquid resin onto a build tray with an instant cure. Although this technology was common many years ago, it has started making a comeback, due to the (now) lower cost, high speed, and customization [11], especially multicolored layers. It will be interesting to see how far this technology will advance.

Several variables should be considered before deciding on a particular 3D printer [12], which includes:

- Convenience: ease of use (will training be provided and if so how?)  
- Reliability: how many hours can it run before issues develop and how will these be managed?  
- Cost: both the capital investment of the printer, materials and running costs (servicing, upgrade) and the cost per 3D printed component  
- Return on investment: the clinician should consider how the technology would benefit the practice and patients

Before selecting a printer, exercise proper due diligence. Attend trade shows, ask questions, schedule a demonstration, order sample parts, and communicate with colleagues regarding their experiences. The time commitment to the 3D printing workflow can be significant and the clinician should be well prepared for the investment.

# 3.1.2 Outsourcing

If in-office 3D printing does not seem appealing, then there is the alternative workflow of outsourcing. There are numerous lab-based workflows that will scan, design, print, and post-process your 3D printing requirements. Many have user-friendly online platforms for the simple and convenient transfer (uploading) of digital files with the appropriate selection of materials and applications. A team member will review the digital files and requisition and advise on the suitability. The 3D printed product is then fabricated and couriered to the individual. There are a range of products available, including diagnostic models, working models, appliances, guides, dentures, and provisionals.

Many 3D printing service providers may also assist with many other aspects of 3D printing related digital workflows. For example, CBCT scans may be evaluated and read; virtual treatment planning may be completed, followed by the 3D printing of appropriate guides. Dental labs may also be providing these types of workflows. The reader is encouraged to reach out to their laboratory and enquire on the services provided.

There are several other service providers available. Many non-dental generic 3D printing providers have online platforms for the 3D printing and delivery of digital files. The user may select the material and dimensions. The platform software processes the necessary conversion. These are ideal providers for patient education models and products.

There exist several service providers that specialize in materials. For instance, 3D printing in metal can be achieved by select service providers that utilize industrial grade metal 3D printers with an extremely specific technical workflow. Many possess a simple platform for product submission and the technicians will translate what your requirements may be and provide a completed finalized product.

It has been the experience of the author to utilize off-site service providers for patient and research-based 3D printing needs. The service providers possess specialized knowledge and experience to provide the appropriate 3D printed products.

# 3.2 Materials

Materials that can be 3D printed are being developed at an extremely rapid rate. A general classification of the most commonly used materials for 3D printing in dentistry [13] is presented below.

Plastics

- Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)  
- Polylactic Acid (PLA)  
- Nylon

- Metals

Titanium alloy  
- Stainless steel  
Chromium Cobalt

Ceramics  
Carbon Fiber  
Biomaterials

- Gelatin  
Cellulose

Explaining the composition, properties, and applications are beyond the scope of this chapter. The author recommends that the reader follow a protocol for material section that includes:

- Understanding the application of the material (study model versus surgical stent)  
- Ensuring that the material and application has been approved by the appropriate regulatory body  
- Appreciating the properties of the material (available from suppliers and labs)  
- Confirming that the material is compatible with the 3D printer (if in-office use)  
- Selecting the proper material for 3D printing

# 3.3 Applications

Patient applications that utilize 3D printing for dentistry vary tremendously geographically, as related to regulatory approval. This section will be based on a general consensus of clinically acceptable, regulatory approved, clinical applications of 3D printing.

# 3.3.1 Models

Diagnostic models are an important component of patient records and may be required for pretreatment, diagnoses, treatment planning, and communication [14]. 3D printed diagnostic models (Fig. 10) would be the end result of a patient's digital impression, once the appropriate digital tweaking has occurred, to ensure that the file suitable for 3D printing. Proper printer resolution is required for practicality.

Working models are the records required for the delivery of specific patient treatment. 3D printed working models could be utilized for a multitude of treatments, including indirect restorative procedures (Fig. 11) (inlays, onlays, crowns) and prosthodontics (bridges, implant dentistry).

# 3.3.2 Removable Appliances

Removable appliance has seen a tremendous increase in the application of 3D printing, especially clear aligners [15]. Advances in software and the predictability of 3D printing, namely cost and convenience, have resulted in a surge in 3D printed clear aligners [15]. Occlusal splints (Fig. 12) have also gained 3D printing popularity, due to the workflow and the regulatory approval of materials. Mouth guards may also follow the same trend.

# 3.3.3 Guides

There has been a significant surge in guided surgery in implant dentistry, due to advances in imaging and 3D planning software [16]. The guide assists the surgeon with the location of drilling, as is the case with endodontic guides (for endodontic access), bone reduction guides (for the predictable removal of bone pre-surgically), and implant guides (for the position of the osteotomy). The implant guide (Fig. 13) may also determine the position of implant placement [16]. Once patient imaging and treatment planning has occurred, 3D printing of the guide may be completed in a suitable material for the implant surgery (Fig. 14).

# 3.3.4 Dentures

The workflow for 3D printed dentures offers an accurate and efficient alternative pathway. It is the opinion of the author that 3D printing will have a significant impact on this prosthodontic workflow. Appropriately, a detailed case presented has been presented to outline the workflow.

Removable complete dentures are an important form of patient rehabilitation that increases the patient's oral health quality of life [17]. Complete dentures are typically rendered through several (5-6) clinical and laboratory appointments [18]. The clinical appointments can prove frustrating and time-consuming for both the clinician and patient. The laboratory component relies on flanking and processing, which may create problems through material distortion and possible technical errors. Dentca provides a novel hybrid workflow, utilizing modified patients records and 3D printed dentures [19]. This approach has been illustrated in the following clinical case.

# 3.3.4.1 Case Study

A 45-year-old male with a non-contributory medical history presented at an outreach clinic session (Fig. 15, L). His chief complaint(s) included pain and difficulty in chewing. A complete dental examination was completed with the appropriate radiographs (Fig. 15, R). Diagnoses included multiple caries and generalized severe periodontal disease. The patient also had poor oral hygiene with generalized heavy plaque and calculus. Treatment options were presented to the patient with an appropriate informed consent. The patient decided upon extraction of the remaining dentition with rehabilitation with complete dentures. 3D printed dentures were decided as the modality, to evaluate the process and expedite the delivery.

# 3.3.4.2 Clinical Procedures

# Oral Surgery

The maxillary and mandibular teeth were extracted, with an appropriate preprosthetic alveoplasty. Six months were provided to allow for resorption and healing. An examination was performed to confirm healing and denture suitability (Fig. 16).

# Prosthodontics

After registering online with Dentca for the CAD/CAM dentures, the required clinical products were delivered. These products were proprietary and required for the clinical procedures.

# Appointment 1

Selection of suitable tray size was initially determined. Medium size rays were selected for both arches (Fig. 17). Impressions were completed by first using Aquasil Ultra polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) heavy body (Dentsply). While the material sets, border moulding was performed through muscle activation. Once set, the impression was completely dried. A light body PVS material (Kerr) was then applied to the impression as a thin wash layer. The impression was reinserted to capture fine detail. Once set, the impression was assessed for quality.

Modification of the impression was required for the second step. The impression was sectioned with an #12 scalpel at the defined location. The tray was separated into two pieces (Fig. 18), and the anterior portion was utilized as an intra-oral device to establish vertical dimension and centric relation.

Once modified, a supplied pin was inserted into the tray portion. Both tray portions were then reinserted into the oral cavity. Vertical dimension was then assessed. Clinically, this was slightly difficult. The pin was completely down, yet the vertical dimension seemed excessive. The pin was modified with a hand piece bur and reinserted. An adequate vertical dimension was then determined.

Centric relation (CR) was then assessed. The tray portions and pin were reinserted intra-orphically. The patient was guided into CR, and this was repeated. A hand piece bur was used to create a dimple on the upper tray portion, to register the pin position at CR. The depression provided a physical lock of the maxillo-mandibular relationship of CR. Quick Bite (Clinician's Choice) was also utilized to register the position of the tray portions intra-orphally (Fig. 19). All materials were removed and disinfected appropriately.

Incisal length determination was performed utilizing a unique method. A lip ruler was supplied to measure from the incisive papillae to the upper lip line. The patient's measurement was  $7\mathrm{mm}$  in length. Tooth selection was completed by

# Appointment 2: Try-In

For the try-in appointment, Dentca provides white 3D printed dentures (Fig. 20). The try-in requires the confirmation of all previous clinical data. Any change needed may be executed on the try-in dentures.

During the try-in appointment, clinical evaluation seemed outstanding, except for a slight anterior open bite with a mildly excessive vertical dimension. The posterior teeth of the try-in dentures were reduced to eliminate the open bite. The vertical dimension was re-assessed. Fit, retention, esthetics, and phonetics were assessed. The patient was satisfied with the try-in. After adjustments were completed, Quick Bite was used to register the new relationship (Fig. 21). The try-in dentures were couriered to the lab for final fabrication.

# Appointment 3: Delivery

3D printed dentures were fabricated by (1) printing the bases (Fig. 22) and the denture teeth (Fig. 23) separately. The teeth were bonded to the bases (Fig. 24) and the dentures were post-processed for delivery (Figs. 25 and 26).

Complete 3D printed dentures were delivered for final try-in and delivery. Appearance and finish were of very high quality (Figs. 25 and 26). During denture delivery, assessment of fit, extension, retention, occlusion, function, esthetics, and phonetics were performed. Very minor occlusal adjustments were required. The patient was very satisfied with the result. Post-delivery instructions were given to the patient and post-delivery appointments were booked. Post-delivery appointments were unremarkable.

# Discussion

The Dentca hybrid 3D printed denture approach seems to provide an efficient and accurate method for clinical procedures and denture fabrication of complete dentures. Although the method requires the clinician to work with a new procedural

# Conclusions

Dentca's 3D printed dentures offer the clinician a hybrid alternative to the conventional method for complete denture delivery. The clinician must commit to learning new techniques with new equipment. However, the clinical outcome may be very rewarding.

In dentistry, the delivery of efficient yet uncompromised quality of care is crucial for both the patient and clinician. Dentca's 3D printed dentures offer a viable option for the efficient and accurate delivery of complete dentures. The timely rehabilitation of edentulous patients has particular value, both for the clinician and patient.

3D printed dentures may also be fabricated from several different workflows. Currently, a standard impression is required to compress the tissues. Digitally scanning of the impression or cast typically follows. There are various software platforms to digitally design the entire denture, including individual tooth position. 3D printing may follow several paths, from individual teeth, to arches. A standard accepted protocol has yet to be established.

# 3.3.5 Provisionals

Based on a digital workflow, the 3D printing of provisionals seems to be an increasingly population procedure. Chairside luting of the provisionals with a variety of materials may provide an efficient and effective clinically acceptable restorative workflow [20]. The clinician must be aware of materials [21] that have been approved through their regulatory bodies.

# 3.3.6 Metal Prosthetic Frameworks

Casting and milling remain the industry standard for the fabrication of metal frameworks [22]. However, the metal prostheses may be manufactured through a digital workflow [22] and 3D printing in metal (Fig. 27). The metal is typically chromium-cobalt. The frameworks are 3D printed and undergo the appropriate post-processing. Esthetic materials can then be layered onto the metal (Fig. 28). 3D printing metal frameworks offer many benefits to clinicians, yet the regulatory approval and acceptance by the dental community has been limited.

# 4 Developments

Advances in technologies, materials, and applications are continually expanding the 3D printing space. Dentistry is slowly advancing, while medicine and industry continue to lead.

# 4.1 Dental Research

As the conversion from casting and milling to 3D printing in metal commences, the applicability, utility, and physical performance of 3D printed components is crucial. Those questions provide an ample platform for research and innovation projects to assess and evaluate 3D printed products.

In implant dentistry, milling remains the platform for component fabrication. The subtractive manufacturing pathway has its disadvantages, and 3D printing in metal may be an alternative additive manufacturing platform.

The use of 3D printing in metal was utilized for a research investigation of an abutment. Specifically, a novel dental implant abutment (Fig. 29) was patented (U.S. Patent No.: 9, 642,686) for its design and technique. The abutment has been supported by publications to illustrate its advantages [23, 24]. The digital design of the abutment and the 3D printing in metal were performed at the ADEISS Centre [24] (London, Canada). The digital design was completed with Fusion 360 software (Autodesk, San Rafael, California, USA). The digital file was then 3D printed in dental grade titanium Ti64 (titanium 6-aluminum 4-vanadium) with an industrial Renishaw AM 400 Laser Melting System (Renishaw PLS, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom), which used Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology. The process melts and fuses layers of metallic powders, with an average diameter  $30 - 50\mu \mathrm{m}$ , with a  $400\mathrm{W}$  laser [25], to 3D print the final component. The metal 3D process works by

Indirect prostheses (inlays, onlays, and crowns) are typically fabricated from esthetic materials (lithium disilicate, zirconia) [26]. Unfortunately, the cost of materials may be a barrier for a patient, especially marginalized populations, to consider the treatment option. An investigation (in progress) by the author is investigating 3D metal printed indirect restorations. The digital workflow has resulted in the successful 3D printing and the cementation of the prostheses (Fig. 30). An evaluation of the results will be published in the near future. 3D printing in metal will provide increased accessibility to treatment options by patients with limited resources for this treatment modality.

Dental research continues to push the advancement of 3D printing, including material advancements (printing ceramics), novel processes (bioprinting), and collaborative technologies (3D printing coupled with smart devices). In addition, 4D printing has started to gain momentum.

# 4.2 Industry

3D printing results in high accuracy and precision. It may be the only fabrication pathway available for research, based on complex geometries, or very unique structures [27]. Such is the case of the brake caliper for the Bugatti Chiron. Currently, 3D printing in metal is utilized for its fabrication [28]. The caliper is responsible for braking, that is, stopping the vehicle. The Chiron remains one of the fastest, most powerful super sport cars in the world [29]. That 3D metal printing is utilized for the fabrication of the caliper exemplifies the customization and reliability. In addition to complex geometries, the performance of 3D printed components has been exceptional. This may be inferred from the Chiron's caliper, as it is required to slow the world's fastest production car, or the many other applications of 3D printing in performance motorsports. BMW currently utilizes 3D printing in metal for the fabrication of their motorcycle frame [30].

3D printing also provides an alternative pathway for the mass production of components [31], such as a novel dental implant abutment (Fig. 31). Production would require a high degree of precision, ensuring that each component is identical to each other in quality. The application of 3D printing remains low, on a global scale [32], but increased research and data may support further applications.

# 4.3 Medicine

Medicine continues to utilize 3D orienting on many platforms. 3D printed patient models (Fig. 32) are employed for complex surgeries [33]. These models are typically composed of different colors and materials to provide a true to life representation of the patient. 3D printed models may require tens to hundreds of man-hours with highly specialized 3D printers. The models are essential for communication, both between the surgeon and the patient and the surgeon and the team, and are essential for the simulated procedure.

3D printing for patient-specific applications continues to expand [33]. Patients have received various 3D printed anatomical replacements, namely rib cages [34] and a bone implant in the finger [35]. As the regulatory process improves, patient applications will increase.  
3D printing is largely associated with the fabrication of a structure. However, there are advances in 3D printed structures that perform functions. It has been estimated that a bioprinted pancreas will be transplanted within the next 5 years [36]. The opportunity for 3D printing to play a role in the patient-specific improvement of health and quality of life is exciting as it is hopeful.

# 5 Conclusions

3D printing, and the associated digital workflow, will continue to evolve, advance, and have an impact on dentistry. Similar to the conversion of film cameras to digital cameras, 3D printing will continue to disrupt the dental industry. But with any technology, the clinician should weigh the pros and cons to make an informed decision whether or not to adopt the technology. 3D printing, and any other form of technology, is just another tool in the hypothetical toolbox of the clinician. The tool should provide a benefit in our quest to improve the oral health of our patients. The tool cannot take the place of fundamentals or principles. Moreover, the implementation of new technology should benefit the patient and/or the clinician without a compromise in quality of care.
