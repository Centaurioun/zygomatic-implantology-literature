# Lasers in Implant Dentistry

Sanjay Miglani and Swadheena Patro

Abstract Both the terms Lasers and Dental Implantology have revolutionized the concept of dentistry and are considered as a proven treatment option. Dental implants and lasers are practised worldwide. Lasers have established their various applications in dentistry and they have a potential role in dental implantology too. The simultaneous expansions of lasers and dental implantology together have a predictable outcome. Both hard and soft tissue lasers have their use in dental implantology ranging from pre-surgical preparation and through various stages of implant placement.

The mechanism of lasers working is through stimulated emission. On targeting the biological tissue, they get reflected, absorbed, or scattered in surrounding tissues, thereby reducing the bacterial contamination absorbed by the implants and surrounding tissues or may also have an effect of rising in tissue temperature where the laser is reflected back by the implant. The most commonly used lasers are solid-state lasers, Nd:YAG, Nd:YAP, Er:YAG, Er, Cr:YSGG, semiconductor diode lasers and gas lasers like  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers. These lasers have exhibited excellent coagulative properties.

In comparison to traditional methods, lasers are gentle, less invasive and less painful. Their characteristics are important as per the different reaction they produce on the implant surface. Thus, thorough knowledge and understanding is needed for the mechanism of laser action in implantology.

This chapter would highlight at a glance the various types of lasers and its various applications at different stages of dental implantology.

# 1 Introduction

Dental implantology has revolutionized the concept of dentistry and is considered as a proven treatment option [1]. The rigorous evolution in implant engineering and design over the decade has resulted in a success rate of  $95\%$  and above [2, 3]. Thus, making implant is a viable treatment plan for missing teeth [4, 5].

Lasers have established itself in the medical and dental field in 1960 by Maiman [6, 7, 8]. Drs. William and Terry Myers modified an ophthalmic laser (Nd:YAG) to dental laser in 1989 [9]. They are broadly classified as hard and soft tissue lasers based on their interaction with the tissues.

Lasers mainly work through stimulated emission. Lasers interact with biological tissues by either getting transferred to surrounding tissues or reflected, scattered, or absorbed [10]. There is an escalation of the use of lasers since 10-12 years. With the advent of soft tissue lasers of various wavelengths applicable to implant dentistry at various stages of the treatment phases, lasers are more cost effective, portable and reliable. Romanos et al. explored the uses of lasers in implantology and concluded its potential benefit in implant dentistry [1]. The advantages of lasers include haemostasis, decreased swelling, improved visibility, minimal damage to the surrounding tissues, decreased infection due to photosterilization effect and less post-operative pain [11, 12]. Dental implants and lasers are practised worldwide. The simultaneous expansions of laser and dental implantology together have a favourable outcome.

This chapter outlines the role of dental lasers in various stages of implant dentistry, and thereby improving the pre-surgical, surgical, and post-surgical and prosthetic phases of implant dentistry [13]. Lasers help in dealing with complications specifically from placement of implant to prosthetic delivery. The various wavelengths of lasers exhibit various characteristics that enhance the clinical approach and overall experience of patient. The clinician must have an elaborate knowledge, understanding of the potential benefits and use of each individual laser that the particular is indicated to achieve the desired outcome of a given procedure corresponding to their wavelengths [13]. Both hard and soft tissue lasers like Er:YAG, Er:Cr:YSGG, Diode  $10.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $9.3\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers have a role in implant dentistry.

# 2 Fundamentals of Lasers

A profound science and technology of today's world called laser-light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation has its own share of history, originating in the era of Albert Einstein (1916) [14] who gave the conceptual building blocks of laser; a cornerstone development in the history of lasers was Theodore Maiman building the first laser on May 16, 1960, at Hughes Research Laboratories. This chapter will give an insight into the science behind laser technology.

# 2.1 Light

It is a form of electromagnetic energy that travels in waves at a constant velocity. Photon is the basic unit of this radiant energy. Light shows properties of both particles and waves; therefore the waves of photons project two fundamental properties: (1) wavelength and (2) amplitude [13].

# 2.2 Wavelength

As mentioned earlier, a wave has a trough (lowest point) and a crest (highest point); the horizontal distance between two consecutive troughs or crests is known as wavelength denoted by  $(\lambda)$  and is measured in metres (m). Waves, rising and falling about the zero axis, a certain number of times per second, is described as oscillations. The number of oscillations per unit time is called frequency, which is measured in hertz (Hz). Hertz is also defined as the number of pulses per second of emitted laser energy [13]. The higher the frequency, the shorter is the wavelength; therefore wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.

Ordinary light, i.e. the white light, is generally diffused and not a focused beam. However, the laser light beam is monochromatic (i.e. single colour), coherent (i.e. the frequency and amplitude of all the waves are alike) and directional (i.e. the beam of light is very less divergent). These features not only distinguish laser from ordinary white light, but also helps in accomplishing the treatment objectives of the lasers [13]. The beams emitted from laser instruments are collimated, i.e. all the waves produced are parallel to each other, over a long distance; however once the beam enters any optical fibre tips of any delivery system, it diverges at the tip. Spatial coherence is a major factor that enables lasers to carry out surgical procedures in medical field.

# 2.3 Amplitude

A wave has a trough and a crest; hence the vertical height of the wave from the zero axis to its peak as it moves around a fixed axis is called amplitude. Amplitude is associated with the brightness and the intensity of a wave. The larger the amplitude, the greater would be the amount of potential work that could be performed. The S.I. unit of energy is Joules.

# 2.4 Amplification

It is a process of intensifying the amplitude of a wave; this part of the process occurs inside the laser. The centre of the laser is called the laser cavity and there are three components that make up the laser cavity.

- Active medium: This constitutes chemical elements. Lasers are named after the material of active medium; for example, gas lasers, wherein there is a presence of a canister of carbon dioxide gas,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . In a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser or solid-state crystal lasers erbium doped YAG (Er:YAG) lasers are used in dentistry where the host material is yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) and doped with erbium, or semiconductor which comprises a diode (positive-negative, i.e. p-n junction of an electronic circuit), for example, Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).  
- Pumping mechanism: It surrounds the active medium. It is a source of energy that pumps energy into the active medium. The energy from the pumping mechanism should be sufficient in quantity and duration so that the occupation of higher energy level exceeds that of lower level; this is called population inversion which allows amplification.  
- Optical resonators: These are the two mirrors placed parallel to each other in the laser cavity, one at each end of the optical cavity, or they can be two polished surfaces at each end in case of a semiconductor diode laser. They reflect the waves back and forth and help to collimate, amplify the developing beam. The other mechanical components included are focusing lenses, cooling systems and controlling mechanisms [13].

# 2.5 Stimulated Emission

Stimulated emission is the process by which laser beams are produced inside the laser cavity. In the year 1916 Albert Einstein proposed this theory. Using Bohr's model, Einstein further postulated that when an additional quantum of energy is absorbed by an already energized atom, it results in release of two quanta. Thus, the production of laser beam relies on the concept that, energy is radiated as identical photons, travelling as coherent wave. These photons in turn energize more atoms resulting in amplification of light energy [15, 16, 17].

# 2.6 Radiation

The electromagnetic spectrum is broadly divided into two divisions: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation, with gamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet light falling under ionizing radiation category, while all the wavelengths fall under non-ionizing radiation.

Most common laser devices used in dentistry have emission wavelengths of approximately 500 nanometre (nm) to  $10,600\mathrm{nm}$ , which places them in the non-ionizing section of the spectrum called thermal radiation [18].

# 2.7 Laser Delivery Systems

Laser energy should be delivered to the surgical site by a method that is ergonomic and precise [19]. Optical fibre, hollow wave guide and articulated arm are the three modalities for the same [14].

Nd:YAG lasers and KTP diode have flexible and small fibre optic systems with bare glass fibres that project laser energy to target tissues. Erbium and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers are constructed articulating arm or semiflexible hollow waveguides. Some of these systems employ sapphire tips while others employ non-contacting tips for contact with target tissues. All dental lasers falling under invisible light spectrum like  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , diode, Nd:YAG and erbium are provided with a separate aiming beam which is delivered coaxially along the waveguide, which in turn directs the operator to the exact location on the target tissue.

# 2.8 Spot Size

Active beam is focused by lenses, at the point where the amount of energy is the greatest with hollow waveguide or articulated arm delivery system. For incisions and excisions in a surgery, this focal point is necessary. The focal point for contact delivery systems is near the tip of the fibre which has the greatest energy. With noncontacting delivery systems like  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  the focal point may range from 1 to  $12\mathrm{mm}$  from the tissue surface. If the handpiece is moved away from the focal point, it may cause the beam to be defocused, resulting in more divergence and in turn delivers less energy to the surgical site.

# 2.9 Emission Modes

Dental lasers use two modalities such as "constant on and "pulsed off and on". These are dependent on function of time to emit light energy [19].

Pulsed lasers are further categorized into gated and free running modes for delivering energy to target tissues. These are:

1. Continuous wave mode: Beam is emitted at only one power mode till the operator depresses the foot switch.  
2. Gate pulse mode: Characterized by periodic alteration of laser energy. This mode is achieved by opening and closing of a mechanical shutter in front of a beam path. All surgical devices that operate in continuous wave mode have this gate pulse feature.  
3. Free running pulse mode: Also referred to as free pulsed mode. The emission is unique in those large peak energies of laser that are emitted usually for microseconds followed by a relatively long time when the laser is off.

# 3 Laser Wavelengths

# 3.1 Diode Laser

Diode laser comes in varying wavelengths manufactured and available in 810, 940 and  $1064\mathrm{nm}$  more commonly [13]. They are supplied through a fibre contact mode and energy is targeted or delivered to soft tissues [1], thus making it more suitable for soft tissue procedures [20], mainly tissue containing melanin and haemoglobin. It works on the principle of conditioning or carbonization [21, 22]. The heat range is between 500 and  $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Through vaporization it cuts the tissue when contacted with the heated tip. The  $980\mathrm{nm}$  is more absorbed in water in comparison to  $810\mathrm{nm}$  wavelength, thus making it safer and potentially more suitable for implants [13].

Lasers mainly work on the principle, i.e. more the absorption lesser will be the collateral thermal heat directed towards the implant [13]. Studies have shown, even at higher power setting  $980\mathrm{nm}$  diode lasers are safer to use near titanium surface of the implant [23]. Studies show that  $810\mathrm{nm}$  diode exhibits a high rise in temperature at the implant surface [24]. According to Romanos et al. [25] lasers of  $810\mathrm{nm}$  can damage the implant surface.

When compared to Nd:YAG lasers the depth of the penetration is less, thus making it more convenient for the operator of better control of the laser and collateral thermal damage. Frequent cleaning of the fibre tip is needed as the debris collects on its tip [26]. Disadvantages include low cutting speed and gated pulse delivery mode, leading to rise in temperature in the tissue. Thus, the operator must be aware of the power density, especially when working close to implant surface [24].

To summarize, a  $980~\mathrm{nm}$  diode laser can be safely used for implant procedure, keeping its limitations such as the cutting depth, speed and efficiency. The advantages are its small size and relatively low cost [13].

# 3.2 Nd:YAG Laser

These lasers share common properties as of diode. They are fibre optic contact, free running pulse beam of energy of  $1064\mathrm{nm}$ . They have a higher depth penetration in comparison to diode, are more readily absorbable in haemoglobin/melanin tissue and are poorly absorbed in water. They have excellent coagulative and haemostatic properties but due to their high penetration depth they may have potential to damage both soft and hard tissues as well as implant surface too [23].

The Nd:YAG laser has a potential indication in periodontal therapy and has marked a positive effect in treating pockets [27]. However, studies done by Block et al. [28] show that laser has the potential to dissolve the surface of plasma-coated titanium implants. Craters and cracks are also seen on titanium surface [13]. Similar studies done by Romanos et al. [29] and Schwarz et al. [30] have contraindicated the use of free running pulse Nd:YAG laser for treatment of titanium implant surface as the high peak power and moderate reflection rate can cause the melting of metal surface. Walsh [27] and Chu et al. [31] contraindicated the use of laser near the implant. However in an in vitro study Gonçalves et al. [32] reported that the use of Nd:YAG laser in non-contact mode with a long pulse duration caused no damage to the titanium surface. Till date, no studies have shown the safety of this laser in implant dentistry. To summarize, Nd:YAG laser is useful to use in any implant procedure or peri-implant surgery. Its use will continue in periodontal therapy successfully [23].

# 3.3 Carbon Dioxide  $(CO_{2})$  Laser

The  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser works at a wavelength of  $10,600\mathrm{nm}$ . It is delivered in gated pulse or continuous mode, in non-contact mode by mirrored handpiece. It is also available in extremely short pulse of high peak power labelled "super-pulsed" and ultra-speed "ultra pulsed" mode. In comparison to other lasers,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser is readily absorbed in collagen, water and hydroxyapatite. From a very long time, because of their efficacy and speed in cutting soft tissues, it has been used in surgical procedures [33]. It exhibits strong haemostatic and bactericidal in nature with minimum wound contraction thus minimizing scarring [13]. Studies have shown that  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lesser is effective against Porphyromonas gingivalis [34]. They provide disinfection and reduction in bacteria without much significant change on implant surface [14].  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser has minimal depth penetration, thereby causing less lateral thermal damage [23, 35]. The depth of penetration is usually in the range of  $0.2 - 0.5\mathrm{nm}$  in soft tissue [14].

Earlier, the devices produced high carbonization due to high energy density created but with the newer devices the energy density ranges from 180 to  $300\mathrm{mJ} / \mathrm{cm}^2$  with a speed of  $400 - 800~\mu \mathrm{s}$ , improving its working speed and efficiency and less carbonization and tissue charring. The technology has further advanced, with even shorter pulses with high peak power. Thus,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser can effectively cut deeper producing less carbonization when speed is increased and pulse width is decreased. The energy density is now in the range of  $50 - 300\mathrm{mJ} / \mathrm{cm}^2$  with a speed of  $30 - 80~\mu \mathrm{s}$  [14]. This has increased the potential of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser in treating periodontal pockets and incision  $4 - 5\mathrm{nm}$  depth efficiently and speedily.

The energy is mostly absorbed in water (not pigments making) and is a safer option to use in implant dentistry [36, 37]. It is effectively and safely used in treating peri-implantitis and mucositis [13, 14] as the energy does not penetrate into implant surface; its effect is confined to bacteria's intracellular water. It exhibits excellent haemostatic properties, better visualization reducing procedure time and limiting post-operative complication [38].

The laser forms a thick carbon layer of approximately  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  when comes in contact with the bone; the water molecules gets dehydrated forming a layer, thus making it safe to use, as the surface layer absorbs energy and bone damage is clinically insignificant [39]. However  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser can be used to re-establish bleeding for healing if needed.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser is the most promising and versatile soft tissue laser for implant dentistry. A recent  $9300\mathrm{nm}$  wavelength is delivered through an articulating arm. To date, not many studies have described the use of this laser wavelength in treating peri-implantitis and thus should be used with care and caution in this clinical application.

# 3.4 Erbium Laser

Er:YAG includes wavelength of  $2940~\mathrm{nm}$  and Er:G:YSGG has a wavelength of  $2780~\mathrm{nm}$ . It delivers in free running pulse mode. The energy is delivered both in contact and non-contact mode. It is delivered by mirror handpiece and articulated arm, waveguide or trunk fibre and handpiece with a quartz or sapphire fibre tip. The delivery system has a water spray to prevent heat buildup and rehydration of target tissue for better absorption.

Erbium lasers are highly absorbed in water and hydroxyapatite. Initially when it came into use, these lasers were applied for only hard tissue procedure. They are good in ablating tooth structures and bone. Microexplosion is created in the hydroxyapatite during the ablation process without carbonization or charring with minimal heat produced. It can ablate soft tissues too, especially more effective in vascularized tissue keeping its limitation. It is least effective in achieving haemostasis of all the lasers. As erbium laser's primary target is water; thus it can be applied for treating peri-implantitis and mucositis safely [40, 41]. They exhibit excellent bactericidal properties as the energy emitted ruptures the bacterial cell membrane when absorbed into intracellular water. To conclude, Er laser has more application in hard tissues than in soft tissues when compared to other soft tissue lasers as it is poor in achieving haemostasis.

# 4 Laser Application in Clinical Practice

# 4.1 Pre-operative Frenectomy and Tissue Ablation

At times soft tissue alterations are required before the placement of implant. Frenectomy is done to release the tension of the tissue around the implant site with high muscular attachment close to surgical site. Restoration of muscles aims to achieve less post-operative pain and swelling and thus contributing to success of implant surgery. Laser plays an advantage tool for both patient and clinician. It helps restoring tissues without causing much bleeding, swelling and post-operative pain [14].

# 4.2 Preparation of Surgical Site

It is the first step before implant placement. Prevention of contamination and sterilization of the surgical site is one of the key important steps of implant surgery. Antimicrobial rinse such as chlorhexidine is used before the initiation of surgery [42, 43]. These methods are partially effective, as oral cavity is a harbour to bacteria and practically not possible to prevent contamination of the site with saliva during the procedure, to rinse repeatedly at every step.

Lasers can be used for sterilization of the site, as they are bactericidal, by exposing them for a few seconds. It is instantaneous and is profoundly effective [1, 37]. The contact lasers like diode or erbium could be used by touching every square mm of the surface, which needs a slow deliberated application technique. Larger the osteotomy site, longer is the sterilization procedure. A large diameter of fibre optic cable  $(800 - 1000\mu \mathrm{m})$  of contact laser can be used for the sterilization procedure.

# 4.3 Decontamination and Implant Placement

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser has an edge over contact laser as it is a non-contact type. It is easier to increase the spot size of the tissue by placing a wide aperture handpiece on the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser to apply the laser beam out of focus, thus increasing spot size. Sterilization is achieved in few seconds of large osteotomy site. During the surgery procedure wherever necessary, laser energy can be used to sterilize the surgical site as and when required.

In cases where immediate implants are loaded following sterilization of the site is deemed necessary. The gross amount of soft tissues is removed with spoon curette followed with laser to remove any tissue tags. The laser is used to decontaminate the surface of the extraction socket. Before raising the flap the decontamination of soft tissue of surgical site can be done by erbium lasers and bony surface at lower power setting with a water coolant spray [44] as these lasers are less effective in achieving haemostasis as compared to other lasers. They leave the bone bleeding that helps in healing of the socket.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers can be used at lowest power densities to remove the soft tissue tags and decontaminate the bony surface. It has an excellent haemostatic property; thus the effect of haemostasis must be overcome by healing process.

# 4.4 Osteotomy

The preparation of the osteotomy must consider various lasers, suitable for cutting through both hard and soft tissues.

# 4.4.1 Soft Tissues

Cutting through soft tissues, clinician decides the various pattern of entry. In certain cases of minimal entry, punch procedure is followed. Here 1-2 or  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of soft tissue is removed depending on location and biotype [13]. A  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ /Erbium laser is preferred over a diode or Nd:YAG as it works in seconds over minutes (as it takes less time in comparison to diode or Nd:YAG). Achieving haemostasis with erbium is difficult. However lasers are much more convenient and less time taking than conventional techniques. As the size of the entry site increases, it leads to complexity of flap design. Cutting speed and haemostasis becomes difficult as it gets deeper through multiple layer of keratinized (attached) and mucosal (not attached).  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser is best suitable as it provides excellent haemostasis, unobstructed vision, high cutting efficiency through all tissue biotypes and thickness [39].

Laser advantages: Through lasers we achieve a sterile cut, chances of being less infected. With laser incision the post-operative complications are reduced. These are swelling and inflammation as it seals all the blood vessels and lymphatic channels [45, 46]. Due to reduced swelling, sutures are less likely to pull through or undone. Antibiotics and analgesics are infrequently required. These advantages are beneficially in both major and minor surgical procedures.

# 4.4.2 Haemostasis

Excellent application of laser is haemostasis. Patient must be under anticoagulants; history must be received and updated. INR (international normalized ratio) must be ordered. Studies state that if INR is less than 4.0, anticoagulant regimen can be altered before initiating dental surgery [47, 48]. The final decision rests on the physician.

Use of lasers leads to increased tissue healing and decreased post-operative swelling. As compared to scalpel wounds laser provides (1) less tissue damage, (2) less traumatized wound and (3) precision in the depth of tissue damage [36].

# 4.4.3 Hard Tissue

Erbium lasers are the most preferred to ablate the hard tissue. It is less damaging as compared to conventional technique, as it creates less friction since it is a noncontact laser. The temperature is minimal due to reduced friction. Erbium lasers have shown better results in bone healing and new bone formation than conventional bone drills [44, 49, 50]. Till date many studies have not validated the use of  $9 - 3\mu \mathrm{m}$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser. However the entire osteotomy procedure cannot be done using this laser. Researchers are still working on to replace the bone drills with erbium drills for osteotomy.

# 4.4.4 Block Graft Procedure

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  or erbium laser in low energy setting can be used as indelible marker to mark measurement on bone surface, thereby negating frictional and mechanical stress from a drill on bone. The receptor site can be marked and visualized and similarly the donor block can be delineated and marked prior to cutting. Once the required size is cut, the erbium laser is used to create a screw hole, thereby eliminating the frictional and mechanical stress of the drill. Erbium laser can also be used to modify the block.

# 4.4.5 Lateral Window Sinus Lift

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  or erbium laser can be used to create a marking on the bone surface without damaging its integrity [51]. Erbium lasers can be used to cut through the bone; however the erbium laser will also cut the soft tissue attached to the bone which is a potential problem [51]. Cutting with bur requires shell for window creation not damaging the Schneiderian membrane (nasal mucous membrane). The best tool so far is piezo surgical device for sinus lift, causing vibrations through the bone, not cutting the soft tissues [52].

# 4.4.6 Uncovering Implants

The implant is covered by soft tissues and newly formed bone up to  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of thickness during the healing process. To access the implant body, both the soft and hard tissues are removed. Except for Nd:YAG laser all lasers can be used for removal of soft tissues.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers work best, and have excellent visualization and quick removal.

Erbium laser is safe and efficient to remove the bone of any thickness. A study was done comparing the use of Er:Cr:YSGG and diode laser in the second stage of implant surgery to uncover implants and was found that post-operative pain was less in diode and erbium laser but statistically not significant [53].

# 4.5 Mucositis and Peri-implantitis

One of the main complications in implant dentistry is infection developed at a later stage once the implant integrates with the bone. Mucositis is a soft tissue infection around the abutment crown implant complex, at the cervical third of the implant. Peri-implantitis is an infection around the body or apex of the implant leading to the loss of bone [54]. Resulting in inflammatory reaction, presence of anaerobic plaque associated with a biofilm leads to swelling and inflammation of soft tissue and bone loss around the implant. Many factors contribute,like quality of the tissue surrounding the implant, implant design, surface texture, alignment mechanical loading on the implant during occlusion and presence of bacteria. Clinically there may be inflammatory colour change in surrounding tissue, bone loss, bleeding, suppuration and fistula formation. In extreme cases implant may have to be removed.

# 4.5.1 Conventional Therapy

Surgical debridement along with antibiotic coverage is done. Topical tetracycline, chlorhexidine, citric acid and plastic instruments are used as therapeutic tools [52, 55]. Bone grafting is done for regeneration of peri-implant hard tissue. Studies

# 4.5.2 Laser-Assisted Therapy

Erbium and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers are used for treating peri-implantitis and mucositis and provide a new dimension for treating peri-implantitis and mucositis.

# 4.5.2.1 Erbium Laser

The following steps are done.

1. With an appropriate laser incision [57], implant is accessed.  
2. After exposing the implant and surrounding bone, the laser energy is used to vaporize the infected tissue.  
3. Decontamination of implant surface and bony crypt are done using laser.  
4. A thin layer of bone layer is ablated, necrotic bone is removed and the area is decontaminated.

Decontamination and debridement are done using a single instrument. If needed, bone grafting can be done. Thus, healing is seen due to decreased inflammation and post-operative pain [1, 13].

# 4.5.2.2  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  Laser

If  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser is used, the following steps can be undertaken.

1. An incision is done, exposing the implant, bone and diseased soft tissue.  
2. Tissue is ablated, implant and bony surface are decontaminated but  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser forms a carbonization of bone; thus before grafting scrapping of carbonization layer is done mechanically with a curette and bleeding is re-established. An increased success rate is seen due to a more sterile environment being created.  
3. A diode laser can also be used for removal of granulation tissue and decontamination of implant surface.

# 4.5.3 Non-surgical Therapy

Lasers can be used for treating crestal mucositis with bone loss. Deppe and Horch [58] used  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers to sterilize the exposed implant surface to rehabilitate ailing implant and have shown better results than the conventional areas.

# 4.5.3.1 Erbium Lasers

Schwarz et al. conducted a study using Er:YAG laser [59] to treat peri-implantitis of moderate to advanced lesion of 20 patients, at least having one implant. Er:YAG laser versus mechanical debridement with plastic curette and antiseptic therapy with chlorhexidine digluconate  $(0.2\%)$  was used to treat on patients. The gingival recession, probing depth, bleeding on probing, plaque index, and clinical attachments were evaluated at 3- and 6-month period. Er:YAG lasers show better results.

# 4.5.3.2  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  Laser

The studies done by Romonas [23] referred that an approximately  $3\mathrm{W}$  power setting  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser can decontaminate peri-implantitis affected restoration. He started a thorough decontamination of implant site which can be done when  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser is reflected off the implant surface, vaporizing the bacteria in deep bony lesion leading to a better healing and osseointegration. Deppe et al. [36] have shown decontamination by  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser of ailing implants that lead to peri-implant bone growth in beagle dogs.

The laser energy delivered around the implant by placing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  tip into the sulcus, procedure can be repeated 3-4 times every 7-10 days, coinciding with the time taken for the formation of sub-gingival biofilm [60]. Substantial reduction in bacterial count is seen, diseased soft tissue is vaporized. The results have shown the formation of bone up to  $1 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  where there was a  $6\mathrm{mm}$  of bone loss. Study conducted by Alagl et al. [61] has shown that erbium laser (Er:Cr:YSGG) is less effective in reducing bacterial contamination like Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on implant surface.

New technologies like laser therapy and photodynamic therapy have shown to be potent in healing peri-implantitis [62, 63]. Researchers have been constantly trying to review and authenticate the use of lasers in treating peri-implantitis and osseointegration; the current data on various agents used for decontamination have concluded that there is no existing decontamination approach and failed to show influence of any current particular decontamination protocol on surgical therapy [64, 65]. Further clinical investigation needs to be done to check and determine the superiority of any existing decontamination protocol [66].

# 5 Future of Laser in Implant Dentistry

The practice of laser technology in dentistry and its application have expanded implant dentistry. Use of lasers seems to be a promising tool for increased and improved results. The application of laser like Erbium laser in osteotomy has a more potential outcome than conventional technique of drills. With erbium laser depth is controlled, less friction than drills which leads to overheating of the bone [67], less traumatic, sterile as they cut, reduce the risk of post-operative infection and a better outcome [44].

Studies done by El-Montaser et al. [68] have shown better healing of implant site with erbium laser than bur. Better in growth of new bone is formed around titanium metal implants and osseointegration. Studies have shown the use of low-level laser techniques resulted in better wound healing. Presence of collagen fibrils, increased cell reproduction and increased prostaglandin levels are seen [69]. Mikhail et al. did a study comparing the effect of non-laser and low-level laser therapy, on the osseointegration of immediately loaded implant and inferred a significant bone healing and speeding osseointegration process due to laser bio-stimulatory effect [70]. Studies on the bio-stimulatory effect of PRF augmented with diode laser as compared to PRF alone shows no satisfactory difference between the two in postoperative pain, implant stability and bone density [71].

# 6 Conclusions

Lasers play a very important role in implant dentistry. It has its potential role in secondary stage surgery, decontamination of failing implants and healing periimplantitis and osseointegration. Concern does arise about the implant surface being melted due to overheating [72]. Lasers have a significant benefits and advantages to modern dentistry, in specific to implant dentistry. The soft and hard tissue lasers like diode, erbium and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  provide a more relaxing experience to the patient and high quality of care. Each laser has its own advantages and limitations, unique effects on dental tissue. Thus, depending on the clinical goal, skill and experience of the practitioner, lasers can be a tool for implant dentistry.

This chapter emphasized most of the procedures if not all that can be accomplished and enhanced with the laser. It is imperative on the clinicians to embrace laser technology as a practice in their profession imparting clinical benefits and positive patient outcome.
