# Use of Three-Dimensional Dental Impressions in Maxillofacial Surgeries

Irfan Mohammed

Abstract The construction process of 3D solid structures was first introduced by Charles Hull in the year 1983. His technique involved printing three-dimensional structures by using the technique of stereolithography. Today this technique has evolved a lot and took a very important place in modern dentistry. There exist many user-friendly 3D scanners which can be used in dental clinics. The prime objective of the 3D impression-taking process in oral surgeries is obtaining a high-quality copy of one or several implants. This requires structures, healthy adjacent and antagonist's teeth and other maxillofacial regions, establishing a proper interocclusal relationship and then converting this information into accurate replicas of the missing or abnormal implanted structures. This chapter addresses the technical aspects and applications of digital impressions in maxillofacial surgeries.

# 1 Introduction

Dental Imaging has advanced a lot since W.C. Roentgen has discovered X-rays in early 1896. Many landmark improvements have been in the dental imaging system over a century. It was until the 1990s when the development of digital radiography for dental use was commercialized by the Trophy company who released the RVGui system [1, 2]. Many other companies such as Kodak, Gendex, Schick, Planmeca, Sirona, and Dexis were also involved in design and technology pioneers of digital radiography which exist today in the dental imaging market.

The use of digital technology in dentistry in its various forms, maybe it is with radiography, crown preparation, or robotic surgeries, has been slow but steady and it seems to have been growing with a steep rise every year and have governed partly by involvement of multidisciplinary professionals involved with dental innovations and technological research involved in this area. Clinical adoption of new technologies has not only saved our time in clinical practice but it has also increased the durability, perfection, and  $100\%$  esthetic accuracy in dental prosthesis made using digital dentistry [3].

There are many reasons to adopt digital radiography in daily clinical practice:

- It practically eliminates environmental burdens by removing toxic chemicals along with silver and iodide bromide.  
Accuracy in image processing is increased.  
- Increased efficiency of patient treatment by decreasing image capture and visualization process.  
- Reduced radiation dose to the patient and operator.  
- Improved ability to involve the patient in the diagnosis and treatment planning process with co-diagnosis and patient education.  
- Reduced image distortion and improved the final result in patient treatment.

Today computers interface with every facet of dentistry in clinical practice. In the early 1990s, computers were used only in dental clinical accounting and patient record maintenance, but today computers make part of almost all the dental treatments, starting from imaging to milling they are everywhere. These computers have not only increased efficiency and reliability in the financial side of clinical practices but they have also given durability to the dental prosthesis, hence advantage to both patient and dental practitioners [3]. Today one can have virtual patient for diagnosis at anywhere and anytime (Fig. 1), gone were those days where patient has to make various visits to the dental clinic to get his prosthesis done. Today with just two to three visits the dental protocols are ready and delivered to the patients. The digitization of three-dimensional imaging (Fig. 2) has improved communication among fellow and distance practitioners and has enhanced team-based approaches to (a)

surgical planning, surgical simulations, and telesurgery that can be performed remotely using robotics.

Among all the benefits brought by three-dimensional dental technology, the role within oral and maxillofacial surgeries involving facial reconstructions is rapidly progressing with a promising future for the patient and dental surgeon. The efficacies of these new technologies were assessed and found to be far better than the conventional and traditional methods used in the past, the drawback was found only with the increased cost equipment installation, but which can be overcome with optimum surgical results, less treatment time, and minimum or no radiation exposure to the patient.

# 2 CAD/CAM Bucco-Maxillofacial Surgeries

In certain circumstances, facial prosthesis will be better than reconstructions with surgery, for example, in cases with high recurrence, patients undergoing radiation therapy, elderly patients that should undergo multiple reconstructive surgeries, and patients requiring a temporary prosthesis; sometimes the prosthesis is the only option for the suffering patient whose physical condition is not appropriate for reconstruction surgical procedure.

Types of CAD/CAM techniques in dentistry:

- Stereolithography  
- Fused deposition modeling  
- Selective laser sintering  
- Laminated object manufacturing  
Multi-jet modeling inkjet technology  
- Three-dimensional printing (3D printing)  
Solid ground curing

With the help of CAD/CAM technology, we can construct or fabricate customized tools to be used during the maxillofacial surgery in an efficient and accurate manner [4-6].

These surgical tools include various forms:

- Customized anatomical replicas.  
- Cutting guides for osteotomy design.  
- Implant placement guides.  
- Anatomical replicas used in the preoperative bending of reconstruction plates.  
- Customized bone appliances design.  
- Fabrication of customized implants.

All surgical custom designs start with imaging process, where digital images are converted into a 3D format known as STL file format (Stereolithography file format) which is native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems. STL has several backronyms such as "Standard Triangle Language" and "Standard Tessellation Language." STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object without any representation of color, texture, or other common CAD model attributes [7].

# 3 CAD/CAM Maxillofacial Pathology and Reconstruction

Preplanned osteotomies and segment positioning using CAD/CAM have made maxillofacial surgeries more efficient and with promising postoperative success (Fig. 3). The use of microvascular surgeries and advanced techniques in this field has become more widespread in maxillofacial pathology reconstruction with the (a)  


(b)

help of CAD/CAM [8], and has helped to recover large and complex buccofacial defects in a short intraoperative time.

# 3.1 The Principal Aim of Using CAD/CAM in Maxillofacial Pathology Reconstruction

The Principal Aim is the reduction of intraoperative time and ischemic time to the flap following ligation of the vascular pedicle, accurate superpositioning of the flap and anticipated reconstructed segment contouring [6].

Surgical steps/procedure are:

- First, planned resection virtual surgery is performed after uploading the imaging data.  
- Margins are drawn which is followed by the interval of bone removal, and an image of the bone used for reconstruction is adjusted to the defect using virtual osteotomies.  
- The collected data from the surgical plan is then used for the fabrication of cutting guides.  
- The guides are designed with predetermined angled slots that allow the entry of surgical cutting blades for osteotomy of the bone.  
- The guide's holes allow them to be secured to the bone during instrumentation.  
- In instances where postoperative radiation is not anticipated, guides may also be used for the simultaneous placement of implants.

It is to be noted that before transection of the pedicle it can be performed the osteotomies, implant placement, and attachment of the reconstruction plate to the bone flap.

# 4 CAD/CAM Correction of Temporomandibular Joint Disorders

It was only possible with CAD/CAM technology the development of customized TMJ prostheses and it is evolving in reconstruction improvement day by day. Today long-term success in TMJ prostheses is seen due to minimal bony re-contouring process which is required to fit the unit in position. Also the reduction of operative time by decreasing the surgery table adjustments and special preparations for the surgery, all these advantages have reduced or completely eliminated multiple surgical procedures and the creation of complex anatomy in the surgery region (postoperatively) [6, 9]. The improved stability created by CAD/CAM can improve the long-time success and durability of the prosthesis.

# 5 CAD/CAM Orthognathic Surgery

Treatment planning, intraoperative process, and postsurgical analysis and evaluation have been highly influenced by three-dimensional imaging and CAD/CAM technologies which have greatly impacted the approach to orthognathic surgery (Fig. 4).

A considerable amount of data is collected during the presurgical evaluation. This includes the following:

Clinical examination  
Dento-facial measurements  
- Profile and intraoral photographs  
- Dental impressions  
- Bite registrations  
Cone-beam CT scan  
Virtual facebow

Following are the surgical data collection steps/procedures:

1. Acrylic resin jig with attached fiducial markers is used for the initial bite registration.  
2. The bite jig is attached to a gyroscope and a virtual facebook is performed, which provides a numerical value for pitch.  
3. The CT scan is performed with the bite jig in place. Using the data obtained from the gyroscope, the CT image can be reoriented to the patient's natural resting head position.  
4. Next, the dental casts are sent for processing.  
5. For better accuracy, digital imaging of the dentition is performed via a laser surface scan of the dental casts.

6. This data is then integrated with the CT scan. The DICOM files from the CT scan may be used for both 3D and 2D assessment.  
7. Cephalometric analysis is performed using traditional landmarks in order to quantify the dental and skeletal relationships.

The three-dimensional analysis will help in identifying and quantifying facial asymmetries during the treatment plan. Cast surgery is performed after data collection and cephalometric analysis. This can be a time-consuming process and the accuracy of planning for complex movements can be challenging particularly for patients with asymmetries.

The real-time dental-skeletal relationship obtained by the 3D image assessment by performing various virtual surgical movements. In addition, this allows for the identification of various skeletal interferences that may arise, especially with mandibular setbacks. Repositioning of maxilla and mandible is done after confirmation of the surgical plan and with the help of CAD/CAM, the occlusal splints are fabricated. Finally, 3D imaging allows for an enhanced understanding of the postsurgical change during recall. Using stable skeletal landmarks in regions that were not changed by surgery, the pre- and postoperative CT images can be superimposed to demonstrate the final outcome.

# 6 CAD/CAM Esthetic Facial Surgery

Today CAD/CAM technology plays a very crucial role in custom facial implants fabrication. Many facial deficiencies and anomalies can be corrected by excellent facial contouring with custom implants made by CAD/CAM. Modified stock implants can fulfill the void of immediate implant procedures which requires little or no modifications prior to placement in the facial region in order to minimize contouring irregularities or surgical space fillings. Sometimes during this contouring or while surgery, implant correction procedures may prolong operative time and minor visible irregularities may persist after surgery.

Assessment of the operative region before the surgery using 3D CT scan imaging technology allows the surgeon to take better decision regarding the surgical approach and techniques used in correcting the hypoplastic regions. On the other hand, the CAD/CAM technology allows for the fabrication of a precision custom implant with increased predictable improvements of enhancement also which directly helps in better adaptation to the underlying skeletal structures giving an ideal anatomical contouring.

Gone those days where the patient required to take facial impressions and custom implants made without digital technologies which required lots of required patient compliance and most of the time impressions did not accurately capture the underlying skeletal structures making inaccurate impressions and quiet messy procedure.

There are a variety of ways to produce custom implants; most of them follow the same following methodology:

- Creation of a stereolithographic model and a modeling putty is provided.  
- The area of interest is molded and adapted with modeling material.  
- This is then sent to a manufacturer for the fabrication of the final implant.  
- In this process, virtual planning is available as well which has the advantage of allowing for mirroring of the digital image which aids in the correction of facial asymmetries in unilateral defects.

# 7 CAD/CAM Maxillofacial Prosthetics

To esthetically correct the maxillofacial defects it is better served with a prosthetic implant approach along with microvascular surgery for excellent results in some cases. Retention is the prime problem in some of these cases. Various options are available to overcome these problems like including tissue adhesives, carriers such as eyeglasses, and osseointegrated implants and many more. Three-dimensional digital technologies have changed the treatment planning for the implant-associated maxillofacial prosthesis to a great extent. The accurate placement of intraoral and extraoral implants is only possible with advanced 3D digital impression technology; the no functionality created by improper spacing, depth, and angulation which was faced in the past is now overcome by the advantages of using 3D technology in dentistry. Apart from creating accurate implants, the three-dimensional imaging helps in the assessment of residual bone available and identification of the distances from vital anatomical structures [3, 5].

When it comes to interdisciplinary work the digitization of data images allows for enhanced collaborative communication among the surgery team members. The superimposition of soft tissue reformat with the help of 3D imaging over the skeletal structure helps us to overcome the problem of variability of over lying soft tissue thickness which otherwise poses another challenge to extraoral implant-retained prostheses.

Sometimes the trial pattern has marginal deficiencies while fabricating which needs to be adjusted; this is because some software cannot be used for superimposing or they do not superimpose accurately. The other way to overcome this problem is to take the digital data of a patient defect using photographs or scans, next superimpose the patient's data with data from the data bank. By doing this the margin and shape of the prosthesis can be adjusted according to the area of the defect. Hence the software selection is very important during the reconstruction process.

One of the areas that has developed most significantly has been the construction of metallic structures for prosthodontics. More recently, the additive technique of selective laser melting (SLM) was developed for construction of RPD infrastructure. SLM produces three-dimensional metal structures directly from a CAD model, with layers of powder materials which have been melted and layered over each other using a laser. It allows for the creation of complex geometries with concave and thin zones at the base of the metal structure which are very difficult to achieve using subtractive methods [3, 4].

# 8 CAD/CAM Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery

Template guided approaches and surgical navigations obtained via CAD/CAM are part of digital surgeries in modern dentistry. Data obtained from the 3D imaging technique is used for navigation to provide directional and spatial assistance to surgeons during the surgery.

The use of CAD/CAM techniques in maxillofacial surgeries has several advantages over manual procedures such as clinicians have digital data that can be used repeatedly for the purpose of making a trial pattern or facial prosthesis. Trial pattern made with CAD/CAM technique can be adjusted for its thickness so that the final facial prosthesis can be made as light as possible while maintaining its shape and texture [10], apart from this it creates shorter fabrication time, requiring less excellent clinical skills but high software and technological knowledge.

It is very important to note that the image guidance is provided in real time and the imaging is obtained prior to surgical navigation. To overcome volumetric deformations associated with MRI data, CT scans are most commonly used which are precise images [10]. Image slices around  $1\mathrm{mm}$  assure the accuracy of imaging techniques. The data obtained is then uploaded to the computer module. Anatomical landmarks are registered on the patient and interrelated with the same regions on the uploaded imaging.

The landmarks vary from the surface landmarks, screws placed and secured to bony prominences, or using landmarks attached to a mask secured to the patient. The landmark registration is performed using a stylus, which is recognized by a camera linked to the imaging display module. Each landmark is confirmed between the display image and the patient. The camera links to the registered stylus using either infrared, electromagnetic, or ultrasound data transfer [11].

During surgery, it is important to verify the previously registered landmarks. In some cases, the error may be introduced from any kind of surface tissue movement or following surgical manipulation. According to the literature, the accuracy of anatomical localization is near about  $1\mathrm{mm}$ .

The main aim of this technology is to reduce morbidity and invasiveness and assist with image-guided localization of surgical landmarks. Access to the operation site is a common challenge of most surgeries, and also restricted visualization by anatomical structures and cosmetic demands. Deep orbital regions are sometimes difficult to reach and particularly challenging, in such cases the digital image guidance is helpful to avoid accidents with vital structures here such as the optic nerve. Normative values reference is used to determine safe dissection distances from the intraorbital rim to each structure situated nearby. These reference values become immaterial if there is extensive comminution of the rim which also complicates proper reduction and subsequent esthetic outcome of traumatic bony defects. Verification of reduction is lost with the loss of bony landmarks. As a result, the accuracy in the projection of the involved bone is challenged and results in compromised facial esthetic.

Mirroring technique is used:

- To correct the unilateral facial defect the surgical navigation software can help restore facial symmetry through the use of mirroring.  
- The image of the uninjured side is replicated, a mirror image is created and superimposed to the injured side.  
- The malpositioned bone is then repositioned in its right anatomical position three-dimensionally until a desired projection is obtained and verified using the navigation module [12]. Fixation is then applied.

In some situations where the bilateral destruction is very vast that the mirroring techniques are not possible in such situations, the surgeon can go for the patient's siblings or children's facial impressions where the facial appearance and contours are more likely to match the reconstruction process.

# 9 CAD/CAM Robotic Maxillofacial Surgery

Minimally invasive surgery has evolved to include robotic or computer-assisted surgery. Robotic surgeries using smaller incisions and endoscopy technology have reduced manpower in the surgery hall; it has even benefited the postoperative patient care process by reducing blood loss, suture dimensions, decreased pain, and decreased use of analgesics postoperatively and all these have directly contributed to faster patient recovery.

The robotic surgeries have been around for many years but their use was limited to medical surgeries like cardiac, urological procedures and obstetrics, but in recent years it has been used in T1/T2 tumors treatment involving head and neck region. This technology is known as TORS (Transoral Robotic Surgery), which has eliminated the aggressive mandibulotomy procedures in many complex cases of oropharyngeal tumors and reduced surgical unnecessary mutilations of buccofacial region.

Following are the basic concepts of robotic surgeries:

- All the delicate and complex surgical movements are controlled by robotic arms distantly from a console.  
- Direct instrument manipulation is eliminated completely.  
- Most of the time the surgical procedure is performed from remote locations.  
- Visualization is improved with high-end laparoscopic instruments and the delicate high precision robotic arm movements allow for more degree of surgical movements.

- Basic components involved include the surgeon's console, robotic arms with attached instruments, and a hi-definition camera, which transmits images to the console.  
- Scaled-down micro-movements of the remote robotic arms are transmitted from the surgeon's finger movements from the console.

The initial setup of the Robotic unit may cost very high, but public funded units and government hospitals can install one of this surgical equipment which will decrease inpatient time and reduce other postoperative costs for government and patient, the drawbacks which involved also include the time and investment required to train the surgery staff and preoperative setup duration (Fig. 5).

# 10 The CAD/CAM Implant Manufacturing Procedure

There are two types of implant manufacturing procedures:

- Subtractive manufacturing  
- Additive manufacturing  
- Subtractive manufacturing: which cuts off a piece of material to form the final shape.  
- Additive manufacturing: which builds up the material by stacking.

Subtractive manufacturing, the traditional machining technique, has the disadvantage in which it is difficult to make complicated shapes by computer numerical control (CNC) milling and there is a lot of material waste. Additive manufacturing, known as rapid prototyping or 3D printing, has the advantage of being very sophisticated, with less material waste, faster production times, and the ability to produce complex structures (Fig. 6) (a)

Types of additive manufacturing processes:

Binder jetting (BJG)  
- Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS)  
- Electron beam melting (EBM)  
- Laser engineered net shaping (LENS)  
- Fused deposition modeling (FDM)

# 11 Conclusion

Technological developments are not intended to replace physical examinations or human to human health care assessment and service providing but to help as adjunct to investigation and care to provide, the outcome of the surgery exclusively depends on the surgeon's decision based on diagnosis and patient history gained by physical examination; hence physical examination along with the help of technology will continue to transform the health care industry.

The drawbacks of these modern technologies are their high costs and sophisticated digital tool and techniques expertise which keep us away from advantages of using these technologies in our day-to-day clinical practice, but some of our fellow professionals have used their creativity to breakthrough these difficulties. Gamarra et al. used a camera phone and free software to convert two-dimensional photographs into three dimensions to obtain digital data in the fabrication of facial prosthesis. This statement does not encourage to make use of free software to treat patients but it serves as the humanitarian use of scientific advancement removing the cost factor and making technology affordable to bring prosperity to the human race; it is very important to remove the financial barriers which deprive human race from basic rights of health.

Always the patient should be given information about the treatment plan along with the limitations of the prosthesis. This is very important because of the patient's very high expectation of his new prosthesis. Many health research on the quality of life of patients with cancer in the head and neck areas show high levels of emotional stress, physical limitations, facial or body shape changes, and poor social relationships. Our face is a prime identity in society; hence we as buccofacial surgeons should make the treatment process as transparent as possible to our patients.

CAD/CAM technology has made surgeries much easier than before but we cannot lose sight of traditional methods such as imaging that may allow for a closed or limited access approach during surgery; there can be situations where the surgeon has to perform open approach as a result of equipment failure or complications during surgeries. These technologies have helped us treatment and evaluation predictions even before surgeries and made our understanding much refined regarding complex anatomical structures which are difficult to access in some situations. Today we have better understanding of anatomical limitations which are unique to each patient apart from facilitating surgical procedures. The technology has also enhanced our learning by using these technologies as educational tools to our future buccofacial and dental surgeons.

Today the modern digital dentistry has made reconstruction intentions more quantized and applied more accurately offering more tailored end products with less intraoperative effort. Esthetic was never before much accurate than now and this was only possible by virtual surgical decisions before performing the surgery, predicting the soft tissue response to skeletal manipulation that has both functional and esthetic implications.

Digital workflows cannot be used for emergency situations due to their time-consuming process which can delay emergency post-traumatic surgery implants. It takes few days to weeks to construct the PSI in laboratory establishment outside the hospital or clinic; however, this can be overcome by 3D printers which are relatively inexpensive and modern researches have made them more accurate, making it possible to manufacture anatomical structures within the operating premisses reducing the time and risk of transport.
