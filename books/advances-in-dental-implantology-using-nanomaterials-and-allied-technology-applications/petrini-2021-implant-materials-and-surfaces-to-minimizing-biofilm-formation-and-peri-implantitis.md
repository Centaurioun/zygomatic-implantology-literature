# Implant Materials and Surfaces to Minimizing Biofilm Formation and Peri-implantitis

Abstract The objective of research in implantology is to provide materials and surfaces that could accelerate the healing and osteogenesis, minimize the failures, and provide long-term success.

The production of treated surfaces with additive or subtractive techniques have permitted to increase the bone-implant contact, to accelerate the loading protocols and decrease the early failures; some authors have hypothesized that the increased wettability of these novel surfaces could also increase the bacterial adhesion and the risk of peri-implantitis; however, there are many parameters that influence the biofilm formation.

One of these is represented by the average roughness, Ra, but also other factors, like free energy, chemistry, and titanium purity, have a great role in the establishment of the microbiota.

In this chapter, we will discuss the novel materials and surfaces that could decrease early failure and improve long-term success in implantology.

# 1 Introduction

Recent advancements in all implantology fields, in techniques, biomaterials, and implant micro and macro design, have permitted to simplify the surgical procedure, to accelerate the treatment time and to adopt immediate loading protocol with lower insertion torque values, compared to the past [1, 2]. However, although the concept of implant survival is different from those of successful criteria, implant failure is still a significant concern for implantology [3].

Early implant failures have been associated to endogenous host factors that could affect the bone healing, like the bone quality and quantity, the presence of systemic or metabolic diseases, and smoke, but also to exogenous factors like implant features, the surgical technique, and implant site infections [1, 4]. Late failures are a consequence of bone resorption promoted by an inflammation mediated by bacterial or prosthetic factors.

In particular, Albrektsson et al. have defined the marginal bone loss around dental implants as "immune-osteolytic reactions," because the delicate balance between the osteoblast and the osteoclast results in bone resorption as a consequence of systemic and local factors and habits of the patient [5].

Systemic factors: comprehend the genetic and systemic disease.  
- Local factors: comprehend cement or impression material debris in the periimplant sulcus, bacterial contamination of the implant components, and technical issues such as loose screws, mobile components, or fractured materials.  
- Habits of the patients: like smoking.

As recently stated by the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, peri-implant health is characterized by the absence of erythema, bleeding on probing, swelling, and suppuration. Peri-implant health can exist around implants with reduced bone support and it was not possible to define a range of probing depths compatible with health [6].

The peri-implant disease comprehends two different pathologies: mucositis, characterized by a prevalence of  $43\%$  (95% CI: 32–54) and peri-implantitis that is present in the  $23\%$  (95% CI: 14–30) of cases as recently reported by a review [7]. The first is characterized by a reversible inflammatory process similar to gingivitis that occurs in the peri-implant soft tissues and that not necessarily transform in peri-implantitis [8]. In histological studies of mucositis, the inflammatory infiltrate did not extend the "apical" of the junctional/pocket epithelium into the supracrestal connective tissue zone [6].

Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory disease that causes the destruction of the bone around dental implants (Fig. 1). In this photograph it is possible to appreciate the clinical signs of peri-implantitis: inflammation of the peri-implant tissues, bleeding and/or presence of suppuration at gentle probing and the increase of pocketing deep. The prevalence of peri-implantitis ranges between  $15\%$  and  $20\%$  after 10 years [9]. Figure 2 represents radiological signs of peri-implantitis on the fixture. The intraoral radiography permits to appreciate the clinical signs of peri-implantitis;

Criteria for diagnosis of peri-implantitis comprehends bleeding (BOP) and/or suppuration on probing, increasing pocket depth, and signs of increasing crestal bone loss [8]. However, the use of BOP as a diagnostic tool is not appropriate for peri-implantitis since up to  $90\%$  of implants with stable bone conditions bleed on probing [5].

Although these symptoms are very similar to those of periodontitis, recent literature has shown that they are characterized by a different onset and progression. They are both originated by the contemporary presence of bacteria and excessive host response [10]. However, contrary to periodontitis, there is no consensus about what species of bacteria could lead to dysbiosis causing the pathology. Periimplantitis is characterized predominantly by nonculturable gram-negative species compared with periodontitis [11].

In particular, a recent article by Lafaurie et al. has shown the microbiological differences between periodontitis and peri-implantitis [11]. The microbiological surveys have shown that both diseases are characterized by the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, however, periodontitis is characterized by a higher presence of some species, like Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, and Tannerella forsythia [11]; on the contrary, a greater presence of enteric rods, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans was recovered more frequently and at higher levels in periimplantitis.

Other differences between periodontitis and peri-implantitis are connected to the absence of periodontal ligaments around implants, so the peri-implantitis affecting directly the bone can be considered an osteitis. In particular, Albrektsson has defined this disease as "immune-osteolytic reactions" [5].

A histological study on dogs, published by Carcuac et al., has shown that samples from peri-implantitis sites were characterized by higher size, were more close

In a later study on humans, the same author has shown that periodontitis lesions were surrounded on one side of the pocket by epithelium and on the other side by a portion of non-infiltrate connective tissue [13]. On the contrary, peri-implantitis lesions were characterized by a greater infiltrated connective tissue, twice larger; it extended more apically in the pocket epithelium and it was not surrounded by a not infiltrated connective. Peri-implantitis sites were characterized by a higher vascular density, but the vascular diameter was larger on periodontitis sites. The density of inflammatory cells, like CD68-(macrophages), was greater on peri-implantitis sites, and in particular, Myeloperoxidase MPO-positive cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and CD138-positive cells (plasma cells) occurred in three to six times larger numbers than their counterparts in periodontitis lesions [13].

The study of the aetiological factors and modalities of prevention of peri-implantitis is fundamental: there is not a specific bacterial complex that initiates the disease, on the contrary, emerging importance is gaining the interaction between titanium surface and peri-implant microbiota [14].

Potential mechanisms of peri-implant bone loss include [9]:

The microbial biofilm  
Cement excess  
- Implant malposition  
Metal ion/particle release

Additional trigger mechanisms for peri-implant bone loss comprehend [5]:

- Susceptible host  
Prosthetic factors  
Surgical factors  
Biomechanical factors

# 2 Titanium

The material normally used for the realization of endosteal dental implants is commercially titanium pure (cpTi); it is more rarely associated with other elements such as vanadium (V), aluminum (Al), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), and zirconium (Zr) that they often generate better mechanical properties, but have a different response in terms of biocompatibility compared to the pure form [15].

It is important to highlight that at about  $883^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  pure titanium transforms from the allotropic  $\alpha$ -form with a closed packed hexagonal crystal structure, to the  $\beta$  with a body-centered cubic structure. However, the presence of such elements in the alloy tends to stabilize the  $\alpha$  form, like Al, O, and N, and others tend to stabilize the  $\beta$ , like V, Mo, Nb, Fe, and Cr [16]. The ratio of the two allotropic forms in the titanium alloys influences the mechanical properties of strength, ductility, modulus of elasticity, cycle fatigue, and fracture toughness.

Titanium is in the fourth period of the table of elements, that is, the transition metals, in the group 4B; it is characterized by a low atomic and ionic volume and a high melting and boiling points. It is a light, hard material with a low density,  $40\%$  less than steel, but with equal resistance; it weighs  $60\%$  more than aluminum but with double the resistance.

The main characteristics of titanium are:

- The excellent biocompatibility  
- Low density  
The great electrochemical stability  
High mechanical resistance  
- Sufficient rigidity and tenacity

All these features make the titanium the ideal material for the production of fixtures.

The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) classified commercially pure titanium (cpTi) in grades from 1 to 4, based on the content of oxygen (increasing from 0.18 to 0.40) and iron (increasing from 0.20 to 0.50): this increase is accompanied by the improvement of the mechanical characteristics. Grade V refers to the titanium alloys Ti-6Al-4V [17]. Titanium (Ti) and its alloys in contact with air or water form a titanium dioxide  $\mathrm{(TiO_2)}$  layer, characterized by biocompatibility, high resistance to corrosion and to the fluids excreted or secreted from the human body, minimizing the metallic ion release [18-20]. Thanks to these characteristics they are widely used for biomedical applications or dental implants production; however chemically and/or physically superficial treatments are able to trigger specific molecular events at the cell-material interface, influencing the speed, strength, and degree of osseointegration [21, 22].

Titanium shows more than one state of oxidation, so from titanium originate titanium monoxide (TiO), titanium dioxide  $(\mathrm{TiO}_2)$ , and titanium trioxide  $(\mathrm{Ti}_2\mathrm{O}_3)$ . The crystal lattices in which titanium oxide exists, anatase, rutile, and brookite influence the iatrogenicity; anatase is better in attracting calcium and phosphate ions from the physiological environment to form an appetite coating. However, rutile is characterized by both basic and acidic hydroxyl groups on the surface and by surface energy, so the mixture of rutile and anatase could help to improve the osteogenic activity of titanium [23].

When titanium fixtures are inside the bone structure, the stoichiometric relationship between Ti/O is in relation to the distance that occurs with the external environment, richer in oxygen. Furthermore, within the bone structure, the layer of titanium oxide undergoes gradual maturation, increasing its thickness from  $7\mathrm{nm}$  up to  $200\mathrm{nm}$ , meanwhile its composition changes, for the establishment of a balance with the tissues surrounding and the formation of precipitates. Steinemann reports constant stability of the dioxide of titanium between  $\mathrm{pH}3$  and 12 in a special solution [24].

The Ti6Al4V alloy is characterized by higher tensile strength and toughness, which is similar to  $\mathrm{Cr / Co}$  alloys. It is largely used in orthopedic surgery where high and repeated stresses occur.

There are no significant advantages of using this alloy in dentistry: the presence of Al and V are particularly implicated in toxic phenomena and aluminum seems to negatively affect the expression of osteocalcin and the mineralization of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the release of particles from this alloy increases the release of inflammation-inducing mediators such as prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor [17].

# 2.1 Superficial Characterization of Titanium

The superficial characterization of titanium is fundamental both for increasing the initial bone-implant contact (BIC) and for the interaction with host and bacterial cells. The first implants used in the history were characterized by a machined smooth surface with a  $30 - 40\%$  of BIC (Fig. 3). Superficial treatments have permitted to increase this value to  $60 - 70\%$  [15]. Regardless of the material, the initial interaction between the cells and the implant surface is fundamental for achieving

According to Albrektsson and Wennerberg, the surface roughness can be classified into four categories, or roughness [25]:

- Smooth surfaces (average roughness value  $\mathrm{Sa} < 0.5\mu$  
Surfaces with minimum roughness (Sa  $0.5 - 1\mu$  
Moderate roughness surfaces (Sa  $1 - 2\mu$  
- Rough surfaces  $(\mathrm{Sa} > 2\mu)$

Superficial roughness can be obtained with subtractive or additive techniques. The more numerous subtractivetechniques are:

- Sandblasting, that is the bombardment of the surface of titanium by granules of variable diameter, of  $60 - 90\mu \mathrm{m}$ , consisting of oxides such as trioxide of aluminum  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ , titanium dioxide  $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$ , zirconium dioxide  $\left(\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}\right)$ , and silicon carbide (SiC).

- Acid etching, by using sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, etc. (Figs. 8, 9, 10, and 11). The ripples that are present in Fig. 9 are better represented in Fig. 11. The laser-sintered titanium modified by acid treatment is characterized by the presence of elongated reliefs of different measure, height, and orientation.  
- Combination of sandblasting and etching.  
- Oxidation in a galvanic bath.  
- Spark erosion.  
- Laser sintered titanium.

The additive techniques employ the use of a plasma flow which deposits titanium powder (plasma) on the system spray, hydroxyapatite powder, or titanium microspheres. However, it has been shown that the nanotopographic features, like depth, width, (an)isotropy, and spacing (ridge-groove ratio), interact with cells via membrane alteration and seem to be effective only if comprised between  $70~\mathrm{nm}$  and  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$  [22, 26]. Moreover, nanoscale characterizations permit to increase the surface area, to improve the available sites for protein adsorption and cell interaction and consequently the bone-to-implant contact [21, 27]. For these reasons, the nano-roughness  $(1 - 100\mathrm{nm})$  is becoming more popular than micro-  $(1 - 10\mu \mathrm{m})$  and macro- $(10\mu \mathrm{m} - 1\mathrm{mm})$  features [21].

Many methods have been described to modify the titanium oxide layer, like chemical (acid and alkaline) and electrochemical treatments (anodic oxidation), plasma spray deposition, sol-gel formation, ion implantation, and thermal oxidation [28-30]. It is important to highlight that the increase in surface roughness does not always promote an increase in the wettability. It depends both on the chemistry and

The wettability can be measured through the static sessile method that permits to evaluate the water contact angle [32]. The wettability of a titanium surface is fundamental because it can influence the initial protein adhesion to the surface, the interaction of the tissues with the pre-conditioned surface, the bacterial and biofilm formation and consequently the in vivo osteointegration and long-term success [33]. Traditionally, if a surface is characterized by water contact angles lower than  $90^{\circ}$  [34], it is considered as hydrophilic; however, Vogler considered the cut-off at  $65^{\circ}$  [35] (Fig. 12). Figure 13 represents water contact angle of the same machined surface treated with acids. The effect of acidification and increasing the roughness of a hydrophilic surface contributes to increase its wettability. As shown by the theory of contact angle hysteresis, the increase of roughness has the ability to promote an increase of the water contact angles in hydrophobic materials and a decrease of the same parameter on hydrophilic ones [36]. Figure 14 represents water contact angle after treatment with acids and sanded. The effect of sandblasting increases the roughness of a hydrophilic surface and contributes to further increase its wettability. The wetted area is inversely proportional to the contact angle as seen in Fig. 15.

The water contact angle is important also because the lower is the angle the greater is the wetting area, so during in vivo procedures, the blood will wet easier the implant surface [31]. However, there is still controversy in the literature about the ideal water contact angle of dental implants [32].

# 2.2 Microbiological Interaction with Surfaces Characterized by Different Roughness Wettability and Texture

The clinical performance, the plaque accumulation, the bacterial colonization, and the long-term success of dental implants are influenced by many fixture-related factors, like:

Materials [37]  
Macro-geometry  
- Type of connection between the fixture and abutment [38, 39]  
- Implant profile  
Surface

Superficial micro-architecture [40-42]  
Chemistry, wettability, and free energy [33]  
Texture [43]

It is known that increased free energy and roughness values are associated to increased plaque retention and maturation; however, the role of these single parameters is not fully understood [44]. Bacterial colonization of the dental implants begins directly after exposure to the oral environment. The microbiota can be identified  $30\mathrm{min}$  after implant installation and within 2 weeks, with an established community similar to that found around natural teeth in the same mouth [45]. The superficial parameters that mainly influence bacterial adhesion are roughness, wettability, and texture [43]. The wettability of material is also fundamental: it has been shown that hydrophilic surfaces increase the cellular and bacterial adhesion;

It has been hypothesized that hydrophilic bacteria could prefer and adhere to hydrophobic surfaces and vice versa [43]. Moreover, it has been shown that in hydrophilic surfaces, an increase in the surface roughness (Ra) is related to a decrease in the water contact angle while for hydrophobic surfaces, an increase in the Ra is associated to an increase in the contact angle, because of the interposition of air bubbles between the surface and the water [46, 47]. Figure 16 shows microbiological analysis on titanium discs. It is possible to observe different types of titanium discs immersed in a mixture of saliva and S. oralis. This type of experimentation permits to monitor the different effects of titanium treatment on bacteria.

The relationship between surface roughness and biofilm formation has been largely studied but there is not a total consensus about this topic. Bollen et al. have found a threshold surface roughness of  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}$ , under which, a further decrease of roughness values did not further influence the quantity of bacterial adhesion [48].

Many authors have found a positive correlation between surface roughness and the adhering bacteria [49-51]. However, there is not a total consensus in the literature and some authors concluded that only Ra parameter is inadequate to describe the interaction with bacteria [52].

Coelho et al. concluded that although implants with increased surface roughness were the ideal solution in case of low bone density, they could increase the microbial adhesion, as in the case of surface colonization [53]. Moreover, an in vitro study analyzed the early biofilm colonization up to  $16.5\mathrm{h}$  on titanium surfaces with different surface roughness and concluded that there were no significant differences among different groups for what concerning the bacterial colonization [42]. Also Pita et al. have shown that biofilm formation was not affected by superficial roughness [40]. Other studies concluded that roughness increases the bacterial adhesion only in the first minutes, but then, with the biofilm formation these differences decrease and are nullified starting after the 15th h [54]. For the evaluation of cell viability, the biofilm on disc surfaces can be examined with a LIVE/DEAD Viability Kit (Fig. 17). This technique stains viable cells with a green fluorescent signal, and propidium iodide stains cells with impaired membrane activity red. Then, the images are observed at fluorescent microscopy. In this image, it is possible to observe many cocci joined together to form many chains.

A recent study of Wassmann et al. concluded that both surface roughness and wettability may influence the adhesion properties of bacteria on biomaterials; and that in this context, the predominant factor is dependent on the bacterial species [43]. Indeed, they found that wettability was the predominant factor for S. epidermidis and surface texture for S. sanguinis. In particular, S. epidermidis was characterized by a higher adhesion on hydrophobic surfaces, contrarily to S. sanguinis that was not affected by wettability but was increased proportionally to the surface roughness [43].

The nano-texture of the titanium is also fundamental for this reason. Wassmann et al. suggested that the only parameter of Ra analyzed through profilometer was not enough and that the use of AFM could permit to evaluate the nano-roughness of the materials [43]. A recent study analyzed the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of titanium surfaces coated with three different shapes of nanostructured ceria  $\mathrm{nano - CeO_2}$  (nanorod, nanocube, and nano-octahedron) [55]. The anti-inflammatory effects measured as decreased ROS production were shown in all surfaces; however, results showed that nanorod  $\mathrm{CeO_2}$ -modified Ti had more bacteria attachment of Streptococcus sanguinis in the early stages and exerted lower anti-inflammatory effect than the other two groups [55].

# 2.3 The Release of Titanium Particles and their Role in Peri-Implant Inflammation

Emerging evidence suggests also a possible role of metallic particles that are released during drilling sequences and implant insertion and function, on modulating the inflammatory response of the host and in the interaction with oral biofilm [14]. During implant insertion, indeed, the superficial oxide layer could be affected by many factors, both mechanical, like frictions, and chemical, like an acidic environment [56]. Moreover, the continuum exposition of the titanium oxide layer to saliva, bacteria, and chemicals can potentially dissolve it and corrosion cycles can be initiated, with the release of titanium particles in the surrounding tissues [56]. These factors could be exacerbated during the functional loading, in which particle release could increase for both action of chemical corrosion, friction and treatment for cleaning, disinfecting and debridement of the implants and abutments.

Titanium toxicity could manifest in several forms like hypersensitivity to titanium and allergic reactions, bone loss due to inflammation reactions due to implant corrosion, and yellow nail syndrome [9, 57]. Rarer are phenomena of titanium allergy, it was estimated to be about  $0.6\%$ ; they could manifest both immediately after the implant insertion and after many years: in these cases the implant removal permit to eliminate symptoms manifested as stomatitis or eczema [58, 59]. A possible mechanism that could lead to the onset of an inflammatory response is that  $\mathrm{TiO}_2$  nanoparticles ( $\mathrm{TiO}_2$ -NP) could adsorb CXCL8 (and IFN- $\gamma$ ), which leads to the disruption of neutrophil chemotaxis and modifies local inflammatory mediator concentration [17]. The release of titanium particles seems influenced by many factors, and in recent years a new field in research is developing, the tribocorrosion [17, 60]. This term was obtained by the union of three words:

- Tribology: analyzed the influence exerted by friction, wear, and presence of lubrication  
Corrosion: analyze the behavior of the material versus different environmental factors  
Biochemistry: analyze the interactions between cells and protein

Titanium corrosion is increased at lower  $\mathsf{pH}$  and is further enhanced in the presence of fluorine ions; on the contrary, it seems less influenced by organic acids [61]. However, the release of titanium particles is also influenced by the presence of inflammation or the formation of microbial biofilm that affects the surrounding  $\mathsf{pH}$  [17]. Moreover, other factors could influence in vivo the corrosion of titanium and its alloys: the contemporary presence of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$  and albumin have a synergic effect for what concerning the promotion of Ti6Al4V corrosion [62]. The release of titanium particles during surgery could be influenced also by other factors, like the superficial treatment of titanium and the friction with bone during the fixture insertion [63]. A comparative study of Martini et al. showed that particle release was higher in titanium plasma-spray-coated titanium screws (TPS-Ti) and fluorohydroxyapatite-coated titanium screws (FHA-Ti) [63]. Recent literature suggested that the release of titanium particles in peri-implant tissues could be involved in the etiology of mucositis and peri-implantitis [64]. Olmedo et al. have found significantly higher levels of particles inside and outside the epithelial cells and macrophages from the exfoliative cytological test in peri-implantitis sites than controls [65].

At last but not the least, it has been shown that the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) seems to have a crucial role in promoting Ti release from fixtures surfaces at the mildly acidic and neutral pH levels, and Ti particles could lead to inflammation and the peri-implant environment [66]. On the contrary, the contemporary presence of LPS and an acidic pH  $(\mathrm{pH} = 2)$  significantly inhibited Ti release. Also, the material used for abutment production seems to influence the titanium wear and the release of particles: different studies have shown increased titanium wear with the abutment in zirconia after loading cycles, but there is not a marked evidence about this topic [67, 68].

# 3 Zirconia

Zirconia is a crystalline zirconium dioxide that can be stabilized with calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), cesium oxide  $(\mathrm{CeO}_2)$ , and yttrium oxide  $(\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3)$ . This material is largely employed in dentistry, not only for the production of dental prosthesis but also for the fixtures, thanks to its properties of high flexural strength, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, osseointegration, low plaque surface adhesion, absence of mucosal discoloration, and esthetics [69]. Zirconia used in dentistry is mainly stabilized by  $3\%$  yttrium oxide thanks to its high resistance to solicitations. It has mechanical properties similar to stainless steel. The tensile strength ranges from 900 to  $1200\mathrm{MPa}$  and its compressive strength is around  $2000\mathrm{MPa}$ . For this reason, this material could also be used for the production of drills. Recent studies have shown that zirconia drills are more resistant to wear if subjected to a repeated number of cycles of decontaminants or sterilization processes. SEM observations and EDX analysis have shown that zirconia drills, contrarily to steel ones, after different cycles of decontaminants were not affected by significant changes, respect new drills [70]. On the contrary, stainless steel drills were affected by different treatments [71].  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  is not cytotoxic and is unable to generate changes in the cellular genome. Furthermore, zirconium oxide creates less inflammatory reactions at tissue level than to other materials such as titanium.

Another advantage of zirconia is the esthetic color that is more similar to dental hard tissues and for this reason, contrarily to titanium, it prevents bluish discoloration of peri-implant soft tissues and may be beneficial if soft tissue recession occurs in the long term [69]. Zirconia implants are mainly produced as one-piece components, in order to avoid technical problems connected to the fracture of some components [72]. Currently, the percentage of success of zirconia fixtures after 1 year is about  $96\%$ . One issue concerning the use of zirconia is aging: in presence of water or vapor, in presence of compressive stresses and microcracking, it is slowly transformed from the tetragonal phase into the monoclinic phase leads to slow development of roughness, thus producing a progressive deterioration of the material [73]. This process may be influenced by various aspects of the production process, such as the macroscopic shape and the superficial characteristics of an implant, but this has not yet been fully elucidated.

Another technical problem is fracture that seems to be influenced by the implant production method. In one piece, no-prepared, zirconia implants, fracture lines were mainly horizontal, on the contrary, in implants modified by grinding, the fracture lines were vertically parallel to the long axis and the fracture strength was decreased from  $2084\mathrm{N}$  when not prepared to  $804\mathrm{N}$  when prepared [74].

# 3.1 Comparative Studies of Zirconia Versus Titanium

For what concerning the clinical performance of zirconia implants, different in vitro and in vivo studies have analyzed the BIC and removal torque of zirconia vs. titanium fixtures with similar values of osteointegration [75, 76]. BIC ranged between  $26 - 71\%$  on zirconia and  $24 - 84\%$  in titanium implants. Removal torque was comprised between  $12 - 98\mathrm{Ncm}$  in zirconia and  $42 - 74\mathrm{Ncm}$  for titanium.

As for titanium, the superficial roughness in zirconia is able to influence the interaction with host cells and, in particular, the expression of adhesion molecules like integrins alpha5 and beta1 [72]. The surface topography appeared to play a major role in the success of zirconia implants. It has been shown that the initial attachment of osteoblast-like cells was significantly higher on specimens with a mean roughness of  $1.04\mu \mathrm{m}$  than those with lower values [77].

For what concerning the microbiological behavior, the polished zirconia exhibited lower surface free energy, wettability, and a lower percentage of bacterial adhesion compared with polished titanium surfaces [78]. These results have been obtained also by other studies [37] and, in particular, Rimondini et al. have found in vivo, lower level of both total bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods on zirconia specimens, versus titanium ones [79]. A recent study compared the inflammatory reaction after experimental plaque accumulation on titanium and zirconia implants versus natural tooth: titanium implants, seem to display a higher inflammation and higher IL-1 $\beta$  values [80]. On the contrary, natural teeth presented an increase in IL-6 and TNF- $\alpha$  than other groups.

For what concerning the inflammatory reaction around tissues, a comparative study analyzed different biopsies around titanium and zirconia healing caps: results have shown higher inflammatory infiltrate, micro-vessel density, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and expression of nitric oxide synthase around the first type of samples [81]. Comparing the level of metallic particles around titanium and zirconia implants, it has been found that zirconia particles were present only in peri-implantar tissues of patients with zirconia implants. On the contrary, titanium particles were found both in those with titanium and zirconia fixtures: these elements could be a consequence not only of corrosion, but also of wear due to friction during implant insertion and prophylaxis treatments, and we have not to forged that titanium dioxide is contained also in many products that are used in daylife, like toothpaste [82]. Other studies compared the expression of the inflammatory biomarkers around zirconia and titanium implants: interleukin-1RA, interleukin-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta.

Results suggest that there were no significant differences among the two materials, on the contrary a greater role is due to the different host responses [72]. Another study compared the inflammatory expression around natural teeth and zirconia: the latter were characterized by higher levels of inflammatory cytokines [83]. The bacterial interaction between bacteria and zirconia have been studied and compared with titanium. Wassmann et al. have shown that in zirconia samples, independent of hydrophobic or hydrophilic, the S. sanguinis adhesion was higher than the titanium samples [43]. In particular, they found not a significant role for what concerning the superficial wettability and roughness for zirconia groups, contrarily to what described for titanium. Contrarily, the same authors have found no differences between titanium and zirconia for what concerning S. epidermidis. The authors explained these differences with the nano-roughness that was not measured by a profilometer, but that was measured through the use of atomic force microscopy on zirconia samples.

# 4 PEEK

Polyetheretherketone, PEEK, has potential use in implantology and dentistry because it is characterized by mechanical properties that can be modulated by means of the addition of other elements, like carbon fibers, and in this way, it is

PEEK's Young's (elastic) modulus (3-4 GPa) is similar to human medullary bone and dentine, contrarily to those of titanium that is higher [85], but by the addition of carbonium fibers to PEEK, it is possible to reach an elastic modulus of 18 GPa, which is similar to the cortical bone that is 15 GPa [84, 86]. Other advantages of PEEK are the excellent chemical resistance, the wear resistance, the biocompatibility, the natural radiolucency and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility, the esthetics, because its color is similar to the tooth, and the possibility to be manufactured by means of 3D printers [87-89]. Figure 19 represents to evaluate PEEK wetting properties by using the sessile method. This technique consists of placing a microliter drop of physiological solution on the surface and then measuring the water contact angle. Figure 20 shows the evaluation of wetted surface area. Greater is the wetted area, greater is the hydrophilicity of the surface. In this case, we can appreciate a greater wettability with respect to the machined titanium shown in the center of Fig. 15, but lower with respect to the other two surfaces. Figure 21 shows the measurement of the water contact angle on a PEEK disc. In this

The wettability of PEEK is influenced by the fabrication process, like the injection molding or machining processes, and, as for titanium, smooth surfaces exhibit less osteoinductivity compared to more topographically complex ones [90].

However, it has been shown that the superficial characterization of dental implants with macro- and micro-porous structures can influence both the apposition

The interaction of bacteria with PEEK surface has been analyzed in few studies and results are controversial: some authors reported a lower antibacterial activity with respect to titanium [93] and others recorded lower level of bacterial biomass on PEEK samples [94]; however, other authors suggest that a higher role is exerted by superficial treatment with respect to the material [95]. Barkamo et al. have recently shown results about biofilm formation of different bacteria on PEEK and titanium surfaces: data were analyzed after 72 and  $120\mathrm{h}$  [96]. They concluded that no significant differences were found between smooth PEEK, machined cp-Ti, and Ti6Al4V but that blasted PEEK was characterized by a higher biofilm formation. However, a recent study showed the antibacterial and anti-adhesive properties of PEEK discs at 24 and  $48\mathrm{h}$  against an oral pioneer such as S. oralis, if compared with machined and double etched titanium [97]. Other studies should analyze the effects of this material on oral microbiota; however, current literature suggests that for the onset of peri-implantar inflammation, there are many variables that could interfere with tissues and it is not possible to consider only one variable alone: the material, its integration in the tissues, macro- and micro-architecture of the devices, the oral microbiota, the immune variation of the patient, and the presence of contaminants.

The use of PEEK comprehends also the production of implant abutments: a comparative study evaluated the biofilm formation on different materials [94]. PEEK abutments showed less superficial free energy and roughness, and also the lowest amount of adherent viable biomass was identified on these surfaces with respect to zirconia and titanium after  $20\mathrm{h}$ . However, these differences decreased and were nullified after  $40\mathrm{h}$  [94].

# 5 Conclusions

Recent advancements have shown that bacterial adhesion is influenced by many parameters [98], like:

- Materials of the fixture  
Surface roughness  
Free energy and wettability  
Peri-implantar chemistry

Actually, we do not have yet the ideal material and surface, but we have a great opportunity to choose among many varieties in order to find a better option for our clinical conditions.
