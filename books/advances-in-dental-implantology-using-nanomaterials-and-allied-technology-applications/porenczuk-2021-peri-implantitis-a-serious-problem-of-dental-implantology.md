# Peri-implantitis: A Serious Problem of Dental Implantology

Alicja Porenczuk and Bartlomiej Górski

Abstract Since decades, dental implantology has become a vital and ubiquitous rehabilitation treatment method, providing edentulous or semi-edentulous patients with an artificial dentition.

Along with the popularity of dental implants, the problems with their maintenance in the oral cavity have gradually evolved, leading to confusion over classification, recognition, treatment, and prevention of diseases correlated with them. In 2017, the World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions developed a new classification of periodontal diseases, in which peri-implant health problems were separately outlined. The experts came to an agreement that placement of dental implants has led to the occurrence of new clinical problems related to them. Peri-implant diseases, such as peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis, correspond to periodontal states, gingivitis and periodontitis, and, likewise, are considered serious and chronic diseases jeopardizing the undertaken rehabilitation treatment. Peri-implantitis, which is defined as a pathologic condition of all tissues supporting dental implant, can lead to its loss, if not recognized and treated on time. In this chapter, the etiology of peri-implant health problems was assessed. Moreover, risk factors influencing the state of periodontal tissues supporting dental implants were distinguished, facilitating recognition of patients at risk and establishment of possible treatment methods.

This chapter aims to bring closer prevalence and risk factors of peri-implantitis. Prevention and treatment methods are distinguished in this paper.

# 1 Introduction

The history of restoring missing dentition with dental implants reaches as far as 600 AD, when the ancient Mayas used pieces of shells as a replacement for lost mandibular teeth [1]. Since then, humankind has tried many means to gain an alternative dentition, such as transferring and implanting teeth from one patient to another (Dr. J. Hunter, 1700), or inserting artificial objects, such as gold implant tube into fresh extraction site (Dr. J. Maggiolo, 1809), a 24-gauge hollow latticed cylinder of iridio-platinum soldered with 24-karat gold (Dr. E.J. Greenfield, 1913) or orthopedic screw fixtures made of chromium-cobalt alloy (Dr. A. Strock and Dr. M. Strock, 1930) [1]. But it was not until 1978 when Dr. P. Branemark presented a two-stage threaded titanium root-form dental implant that started the era of a continuous progress in the field of dental implantology [1]. Nowadays, dental implants bring out new possibilities in the reconstruction of the lost dentition. With a high range of success, reaching up to  $100\%$  [2], rising accessibility and affordability, implantation is regarded as the most reliable treatment method for partially and/or completely edentulous patients. Along with the progress in technical aspects of implants such as their surfaces, shapes, and coatings, dental surgeons have gained new possibilities and experience in treating even the most extreme cases. For example, even in an esthetically difficult region of the incisive canal, where the bone loss is quickly visible after extraction and/or when the patient stays edentulous for a long period of time due to extraction and/or dental trauma, the success rate can now reach as high as  $84.6 - 100\%$  [2]. In a clinical study aimed to assess the success rate of dental screws placed in an unfavourable conditions, Lee and colleagues [3] observed implants with low primary stability at various follow-ups (min. 34 days/ max. 9.28 years). They proved that the clinical success depended on both the patient qualification to either "simple" or "advanced" surgery group and on a protected, unloaded healing. Based on that, their long-term treatment success rate reached  $95\%$  [3]. A wide meta-analysis comparing the success rate in groups of smokers and nonsmokers showed that the nonsmokers kept their implants in a significantly higher rate than the smokers [4]. In case of implants supporting full-arch rehabilitation, Papaspyridakos and colleagues [5] reported a cumulative success rate of  $98.7\%$  after more than 5 years from definite prosthesis insertion. All of these studies advocate the idea that rehabilitation using dental implants could be very effective, regarding patient's qualification for the procedure.

When the first dental implants were placed, clinicians worried mostly about their osteointegration with the alveolar bone, as reaching good osteointegration was the most important treatment goal at that time. However, along with broadening of the clinical indications for implant placement and making it less dependent on the financial aspect, a new challenge was defined—peri-implantitis.

# 1.1 Definition and Classification

Proceedings of the first European Workshop on Periodontology in 1994 defined peri-implantitis as an inflammatory reaction with loss of supporting bone around a functioning implant [6]. This broad definition provided no guideline on the criteria for recognition and treatment of this disease. The 2017 World Workshop introduced a new classification of the peri-implant health problems, which distinguished peri-implant health, peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis, and peri-implant soft and hard tissue deficiencies [7]. The term peri-implant health refers to all states that exist around dental implants with normal or reduced bone support. Peri-mucositis is defined as an inflammation of the mucous membrane surrounding dental implant, with or without visible plaque. In addition, it may precede peri-implantitis [8, 9]. Its characteristics covers inflammation of the gum (redness, swelling, pain when touched), bleeding on probing (BoP) with or without suppuration from the periodontal pocket, and no visible bone loss around dental implant on function seen on a radiograph. Peri-implantitis stands for a condition in which the inflammation around dental implant spreads on a wider area, covering both the mucous membrane and the bone support. Clinical and radiological symptoms of peri-implantitis cover inflammation of the gum (redness, swelling, pain when touched), bleeding on probing (BoP) with or without suppuration from the periodontal pocket, a visible, progressive loss of the bone support around dental implant on function seen on a radiograph. If not treated, it may progress in a nonlinear and accelerating pattern [10]. Hard and soft tissue implant deficiencies recognize the fluctuations of the dimensions of the alveolar process/ridge caused by various factors such as tooth's extraction, former periodontal diseases, medications, systemic diseases, trauma, endodontic infections, root fractures, thin buccal bone plate, tooth's malposition in the dental arch leading to an occlusal overload, pneumatization of the maxillary sinus, and pressure from dental prostheses [7].

# 1.2 Incidence and Prevalence of Peri-implantitis

Incidence, which stands for a frequency of cases of a disease with which it occurs in a period of time, defines how many new cases of peri-implantitis are there in a population (e.g., during month/year/longer period of time). Such longitudinal prospective studies are hard to perform [11]. On the other hand, prevalence shows how many cases are there in a specific population in a period of time (e.g., patients of one study, patients of one dental clinic), and it may be obtained from clinical studies performed by clinicians from academia or private clinics. Both rates are essential for a practitioner to estimate the range of the problem he or she may face in their own practice. However easy as it may seem, the numbers vary due to inconsistency of peri-implantitis' identification resulting from lack of its clear definition before the year 2017. Therefore, both the incidence and prevalence of peri-implantitis are still hard to be estimated. Several factors influencing proper calculation of its rate among patients may be outlined, such as differences in sampling procedures (inadequate sample size, counting only patients, counting only implants, counting both patients and implants, patients from private clinics/public schools), studies made on various implant systems, inadequate observation time (mostly less than 5 years), rating only radiographs (often without clinical examination), rating only BoP (without radiological examination), differences in BoP examination criteria (defining peri-implantitis using ambiguous pathological pocket depths (PD), using different instrumentation (standard periodontological probe, calibrated periodontological probe, standard dental probe, other), using nonstandardized probing force), and differences in estimated bone loss (often counted in millimeters (mm), defining progressive bone loss (often not defined in mm)) [11, 12]. Chosen studies from 2015 to 2019 (Table 1) show how many differences may be seen in evaluation of peri-implant health problems, especially the observation time, methods of patients' examination at follow-ups, lack of manufacturer names and/or types of placed dental implants, various numbers of implants (which in most cases exceed the number of treated patients), and taking or not taking the individual risk factors into account.

With all these differences, the prevalence of peri-implantitis is high, varying between  $1 - 47\%$  [11],  $10 - 40\%$  [12],  $4.6\%$  on the implant level and  $12.7\%$  on the patient level [14] or even  $34\%$  on the patient level and  $21\%$  on the implant level [18]. The meta-analyses of the subject estimated the peri-implantitis prevalence rate up to  $9.25\%$  (estimated weighted mean implant-based prevalence;  $95\%$  confidence interval (CI):  $7.57 - 10.93\%$ ),  $19.83\%$  (estimated weighted mean patient-based prevalence;  $95\%$  CI:  $15.38 - 24.27\%$ ) [19], and  $22\%$  (without recognition of implant/patient base;  $95\%$  CI:  $14 - 30\%$ ) [11]. It should be emphasized that the examination methods as well as the amount of the lost alveolar bone in most cases were individually determined by the operator. Moreover, most reports concluded that multiple factors, such as inconsistent definitions, reporting methods, study sample, and diagnostic criteria, prevented them from gaining objective, nonbiased epidemiologic results. For example, Dudek and colleagues [17] introduced their own classification scale to assess the prevalence of peri-implantitis, which they observed in only  $9.8\%$  of all implants, regardless of their type. Regardless of the chaos in the literature, from a clinical point of view, peri-implantitis must be treated as a serious threat in implantology and the findings in this area of dentistry taken into consideration upon patient's qualification for the surgery.

# 2 Bacteria Species in Peri-implantitis

Like periodontal diseases, peri-implantitis is caused by bacteria biofilm colonizing the implant area. The bacterial colonization of the crevice around dental implant and the biofilm's development has been a subject of many studies, which tried to explain how the bacteria survived on an artificial subject and gradually damaged it. The search for the bacteria responsible for the onset and progression of peri-implantitis

Abbreviations: yr. year, yrs. years, nd no data, BoP bleeding on probing, mm millimeter, mg milligram, mL milliliter, RTG radiograph, PI plaque index, PD pathologic pocket depth is still biased, as until recently there has been no widely accepted definition of this disease. The reliability of the conducted research is related to their methodology: sequencing techniques (conventional PCR, quantitative PCR, metagenomic techniques, DNA hybridization), culture methods, pairing/nonpairing study design (peri-implantitis vs periodontitis, peri-implantitis vs 'healthy' implant), risk factors (confounding factors yes/no), clinical evaluation (pocket depth yes/no, BoP yes/no), and previous history of periodontitis [20]. Taking all these factors into consideration, it was finally concluded that the species responsible for periodontal diseases are also present in the inflamed sulci around dental implants. Peri-implantitis has also been connected with an opportunistic microbiome and commensal-depleted pathogens [21]. The microbiome of peri-implantitis is quite heterogenous, though. A native study by Dudek and colleagues [17] determined the bacteria species present in the pathological pockets around dental implants using a standard PET test. The study confirmed the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are also found in periodontal diseases [17]. Contrarily, Lafaurie and colleagues [20] compared the frequency of bacteria related to periodontitis to those in peri-implantitis, and what they found out was that the red complex bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia) were found more often in peri-implantitis in only  $38\%$  of studies. Moreover, only  $42.8\%$  of the papers confirmed the presence of the orange complex bacteria (Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros) [20]. Contrarily to periodontitis, non-cultivable microorganisms, such as asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (AAGPRs, e.g., Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium brachy, Eubacterium saphenus, Filifactor alocis, Slackia exigua, Parascardovia denticolens), anaerobic gram-negative rods (OGNRs, e.g., Leptotrichia hofstadii, Kingella dextrificans, and Treponema lecithinolyticum), and opportunistic pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus were more likely to develop in peri-implantitis [20]. Quite recently, Soriano-Lerma and colleagues [22] revealed that the infection associated with peri-implantitis stems from common oral bacteria, or from environmental bacteria. They divided patients into three groups with different microbiome and described three strata. Stratum 1 was associated with the presence of Ralstonia and Sphingomonas. Both taxa are nonoral, gram-negative genera that may be found in environment (e.g., water supplies). They are also causative agents of nosocomial infections. In stratum 2 microbiota from purple and yellow complexes were found (Streptococcus, Veillonella, Neisseria, Rothia), all of which represent gram-positive facultative species, so-called early colonizers. The most prevalent was stratum 3, which included gram-negative, anaerobic species such as Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Treponema, Campylobacter, and Tannerella. The abovementioned genera belong to orange and red complexes that represent middle and late colonizers. There also seems to be some variations in compositions of biofilms on normal, healthy implants and on those affected by peri-implantitis. For example, the red complex bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis was present in  $0 - 65\%$  of cases of periimplantitis and in  $0 - 79\%$  cases of "healthy" implants, while Treponema forsythia was present in  $0 - 80.3\%$  in peri-implantitis and in  $0 - 80\%$  in "healthy" implants.

Only Prevotella intermedia was cultivated from  $22 - 66\%$  of sites with diagnosed peri-implantitis, while  $6.6 - 23\%$  colonized "healthy" implants [20]. What seems to distinguish healthy implant sulcus from those with peri-implantitis are counts of OGNRs (10-65% in peri-implantitis against  $6 - 13\%$  in "healthy" implants) and Staphylococcus aureus at the level of  $0 - 43.4\%$  (peri-implantitis) and  $0 - 19.1\%$  ("healthy" implants) [20]. These inconsistencies in percentage share of bacteria species in periodontal and peri-implant diseases indicate that these two entities differ, thus should not be considered alike, with clear differences on behalf of the opportunistic bacteria in peri-implantitis. Furthermore, external factors such as smoking or the titanium composition of the implant might modulate the peri-implant microbiome and transform it into a more pathogenic entity [23, 24].

# 3 Risk Factors

Dental clinicians are aware of the existence of multiple pathologies, whose appearance in patients, apart from their well-known etiology, can be attributed to other, sometimes not so obvious, elements. For example, dental caries is normally attributed to a plaque formation on tooth's surfaces, leading to the acidic degradation of its hard tissues. However, the onset and progression of caries may be facilitated by other factors, such as overhanging restorations enabling the biofilm's formation, deep pits and fissures seen in children and young adolescents favoring plaque accumulation, patient's health problems changing the immunologic response to bacterial activity, and so on. In accordance with this, peri-implantitis is caused by a biofilm created on a dental implant's surface, the bacteria species of which induce inflammatory response leading to the damage of the adjacent tissues [9]. The research on peri-implantitis depicted additional elements, called the risk factors, which facilitate the onset and progression of this disease. There are different reactions of bone to the presence of implants, such as zero bone loss, stable remodeling, progressive bone loss, bone demineralization and remineralization, corticalization, and bone growth (Fig. 1) [25].

The key point for a successful implant treatment seems to be crestal bone stability in the long run, while crestal bone loss is a phenomenon with multifaceted etiology (Fig. 2).

The authors of this chapter decided to picture the peri-implantitis' risk factors as a scheme (Fig. 3), followed by a short written description, which hopefully will give a clear feedback on this issue. We believe that patient's thorough clinical and radiographic examination, medical interview and treatment provided by trained specialists in oral surgery, prosthodontics and periodontics would limit the occurrence of the factors dependent on the human mistakes, providing long, functional years of the implanted screws.

# 3.1 Factors Related to Patient

# 3.1.1 Previous History of Periodontitis

It seems that patients suffering from chronic periodontitis are prone to develop peri-implantitis as well, as a confirmed history of periodontitis may increase the risk of future peri-implantitis even 3.63 times (Fig. 4) [18, 26-32].

Acute forms of periodontal disease are associated with higher rates of implant loss, even in patients who received a supportive periodontal treatment [15, 33]. Rodrigo and colleagues [15] conducted a 16-years observation study on this aspect, the results of which indicated a relevantly lower rate of implant placement success in patients provided with an additional supportive periodontal treatment (79.22–100%), compared to "healthy" patients (91.67–100%).

# 3.1.2 Plaque Index and Oral Hygiene

Daily oral hygiene aims at removal of the bacterial biofilm forming on a natural or artificial dentition. Plaque control is one of the most important preventive aspects of dental caries, periodontal and peri-implant health problems, as bacteria and their products of metabolism activate inflammatory response in tissues surrounding both the natural dentition and the dental implants [28, 30-32]. It is also one of the few elements that can be self-modified by patients [28]. On the other hand, it is advocated that the dental plaque alone should not be regarded as the peri-implantitis' risk factor, as differences in gene expression between patients with peri-implantitis and those with periodontitis were found [34], and other elements than the plaque emerged to favor its occurrence [29, 30]. Nevertheless, patients with poor personal oral hygiene and/or those with poor or none professionally administered hygiene are said to develop peri-implantitis more easily [26]. Even an effective plaque removal from the implant's surface does not prevent peri-implantitis, as the inflammatory process may spread through interaction between the biofilms localized on the adjacent teeth or implants [28]. A good access to interproximal niches, ensured by a well-designed prosthesis guarantees an adequate plaque removal, diminishing the risk of the inflammation onset [15]. The patients should therefore be educated by their dentists or dental hygienists of how effectively and safely remove the bacterial plaque, as Van Velzen and colleagues [35] reported several cases where floss remnants left in the crevices around dental implants caused an inflammation, which healed spontaneously after their mechanical removal.

# 3.1.3 Full Mouth Bleeding Score

The peri-implant tissues are noncomparable to those surrounding a natural tooth, therefore differences in their responses to bacterial action may occur. In periodontitis, the percentage value of full-mouth bleeding on probing in clinical examination divides patients into three risk categories—green (0–15%) meaning low risk level, amber (15–20%) indicating moderate risk level, and red (20–100%) standing for high risk level [36]. In relation to the patients with dental implants, the clinically stated BoP higher than  $10\%$  corresponds to an augmented level risk of peri-implantitis [31], while full mouth bleeding index higher than  $25\%$  is an indicator of an ongoing peri-implantitis at the patient level [37]. However, the probability of a clinically stated presence of BoP at a peri-implant site with a PD of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  is estimated to be only  $27\%$  [38], while suppuration has been reported in only  $10 - 20\%$  of cases [39, 40]. Hence, both the BoP and suppuration are considered weak clinical factors in peri-implantitis' diagnosis. Moreover, de Araujo Nobre and colleagues [29] emphasized that personal oral hygiene prevents plaque accumulation and, consequently, diminishes BoP value, meaning that it may be a prominent factor only in patients with poor oral hygiene. Nevertheless, high BoP informs the clinician about the ongoing inflammation in the peri-implant tissues, and, as such, should be seen as a risk indicator [30-32].

# 3.1.4 Maintenance After Implant Placement

The recall regimen is a foundation for the prevention of both the periodontal and peri-implant diseases (Fig. 5) [41].

The patients with dental implants should call in for a check-up appointment every 5-6 months [26, 42]. Lack of regular check-ups along with supportive periimplant treatment may increase progression of peri-implantitis in up to  $40\%$  of cases [27]. Contrary opinions undermine the need for every half a year recall, claiming that the percentage impact of this variable is only  $5.89\%$  [41]. In other words, patients' negligence in following check-ups with a dental surgeon may result in peri-implantitis development in approximately  $6\%$  of cases. Nevertheless, dentists should insist on their patients to follow a recall regimen in order to (1) provide education and motivation in a personal hygiene in the implant area, (2) provide professional hygiene, and (3) guarantee quick recognition and treatment of the unfolding disease.

# 3.1.5 Patient Sociodemographic Information

Atieh and colleagues [27] did not regard the patient's sex as a risk factor, on contrary to Rodrigo and colleagues [15], who proved that male gender acted protectively. The patient's age is a risk factor worth recognition, as elderly patients ( $>60$  years of age) are more prone to develop peri-implantitis [18].

# 3.1.6 Smoking

Smoking is one of the most important risk factors of peri-implantitis [27, 29, 43]. Statistically, smokers are at much higher risk of peri-implantitis than nonsmokers, especially those additionally affected with a history of periodontitis [44]. Tobacco downregulates the expression of bone matrix proteins through suppression of certain transcription factors for osteogenesis, or through activation of certain factors for osteoclastogenesis, which fastens the progression from peri-implant mucositis to peri-implantitis [45, 46].

# 3.1.7 Concurrent Health Conditions

Patient's systemic health problems such as diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, cardiac problems, hypertension, and various viral diseases may enhance peri-implantitis occurrence [47, 48]. However, not all researchers approve that health conditions have a major impact on peri-implant diseases [27], so this aspect needs further evaluation.

# 3.2 Factors Related to Prosthesis

# 3.2.1 Type of Implant-Supported Prosthesis and Prosthesis Design

The implant screw itself, its design and surface characteristics, may promote problems in the implant site. However, a clinician must not forget that implant's function is restoration of the lost dentition, so it should be regarded as unity with a prosthetic device it supports (e.g., a single crown, multiple crowns in a fixed dental bridge, or any other type of multipoint denture). It is underlined that retentive components of poorly designed prosthesis bear more risk of inducing peri-implantitis, as they favor bacterial plaque accumulation around the implant and obstruct its removal by the patient (Fig. 6) [9, 27, 49, 50].

Serino and Ström [50] revealed that more than  $90\%$  of patients with implants could not perform adequate oral hygiene due to improper prosthesis design. Another example shows that bone-level single crowns with an emergence angle of over  $30^{\circ}$  and a convex profile can be strongly associated with peri-implantitis [51]. Type of fibroblasts, thus there is no direct contact between zirconia and fibroblasts from the connective tissue. It was found that the epithelial cells attach to the surface of titanium stronger than the fibroblasts, and this connection is more tough to the abutment surface than to the connective tissue [65, 66]. The epithelial cells attach more efficiently on smooth than on the rough titanium surfaces [67]. As epithelial adhesion to glazed ceramic is very poor, this material should not be used subgingivally [52]. On the other hand, highly polished lithium disilicate surface allows for stable fibroblasts adherence [68]. Taking all of these elements into consideration, the dentist's role is to design the future replacement in a way that ensures mastication adapted to patient's occlusion and enables non-problematic access to oral hygiene. Fulfilling these criteria requires years of specialist training and experience in implantology, prosthodontics, and periodontology. Moreover, mutual understanding and communication between surgeon, prosthodontist, and technician secures the overall treatment's success.


# 3.2.2 Occlusal Overload and Remnants of the Cement

An occlusal overload, resulting from either patient's malocclusion or the prosthetic design, can be clinically seen in the patient's mouth as the presence of wear facets on the prosthesis. An excessive load on the implant increases the risk of periimplantitis development around it [32, 69]. Remnants of an adhesive in the crevice around the implant have a catastrophic effect on the health of the surrounding tissues [9, 13, 32, 48, 69]. Residual cement was recognized as a risk factor for the development of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis [70]. Linkevicius and colleagues [71] observed that peri-implantitis resolved in  $85\%$  of the cases, where the excess of the bonding agent was left in the pocket, especially in patients with history of periodontitis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that it is virtually impossible to remove all excess cement if the restorative margins are located subgingivally [72, 73]. The deeper the margin position, the more cement remnants were left. All residual cement was removed only when the margin position was visible. Moreover, standard abutments have inherent undercuts (the distance between the restoration emergence profile margin and the cementation line), which makes them inaccessible to thorough cleaning from the cement remnants [74]. Therefore, the adhesive cement has to be thoroughly removed while placing the prosthesis on the abutment. Apart from the adhesive remnants, its type also matters. For instance, methacrylates may surely induce inflammation of the implant surrounding tissues with subsequent development of peri-implantitis, while classic, chemically set cements, such as zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE), are far less irritant [13]. When peri-implant tissue inflammation occurs, with suspicion of the adhesive as a base of the problem, the recommended treatment comprises prosthesis removal from the abutment, professional cleaning of the crevice, involving scaling and chemical disinfection with chlorhexidine (CHX) or other disinfectants, and rebonding of the prosthesis with an antibacterial and resorbable cement, such as ZOE. If methacrylate cement is required, a reduction of its amount may also be helpful [48]. Placement of the prosthesis on the abutment using resin-based cement ought to be proceeded with a rubber dam isolation, and, after its initial polymerization, the crevice has to be precisely cleaned with a dental floss or hand instruments before further setting. As there is no reliable technique of intraoral cementation to guarantee a complete cement removal, custom abutments with supragingival cementation margins and without undercut should be used to avoid leaving cement remnants in the pocket. The alternative is to use cementless solutions (e.g., screw-retained restorations).

# 3.3 Factors Related to Surgery/Operator/Implant

Factors related to the implant and/or the surgery are the most controversial of all discussed. The reason for it is that as the literature findings are based on various study types, study design with/without clinical evaluation, various study groups (in terms of age, gender, patient characteristics), inclusions/exclusion criteria, whether the researchers have any clinical experience.

# 3.3.1 The Characteristics of the Implant Site

The presence of a keratinized gingivae is assumed to be a preventive factor of periimplantitis in patients with deficient oral hygiene [9, 75]. The beneficial effect of its presence was underlined by Monje and colleagues [76], who concluded that a thin-tissue gingivae phenotype poses higher risk of peri-implantitis. A wide band of gingivae surrounding a natural tooth or its artificial substitute prevents the bacterial biofilm's access into the crevice, which would be otherwise facilitated by a movable, thin mucosa [77]. Moreover, a thick gum barrier diminishes pain during brushing and flossing, helping to keep good hygiene and, in effect, diminishing inflammatory process around the implant (Fig. 7) [78].

It is stated that the presence of  $\geq 4\mathrm{mm}$  of keratinized mucosa around dental implant (2 mm buccally and 2 mm lingually) of an adequate horizontal thickness of  $2\mathrm{mm}$  is crucial for the prevention of peri-implant diseases [75]. Another very important parameter is vertical soft tissue thickness. It was reported in dogs that sites with vertical tissue thickness of  $\geq 4\mathrm{mm}$  had no bone loss after 2 months of healing period, whereas sites with a vertical thickness  $\leq 2\mathrm{mm}$  underwent significant bone resorption [79]. It was explained that bone resorption occurred in order to allow an adequate soft tissue attachment to develop as a defensive biologic phenomenon to keep bacteria further away from bone. Quite recently Linkevicius and colleagues [80] placed 80 bone-level implants in 80 patients, half of whom had  $\leq 2\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical soft tissue (group 1, thin tissue) and the other half had  $>2\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical soft tissue (group 2, thick tissue). At a 1-year follow-up, mean bone loss was  $1.18\mathrm{mm}$  in group 1 and  $0.22\mathrm{mm}$  in group 2. Based on the outcomes of the subsequent study that crestal bone loss could be reduced to  $0.22\mathrm{mm}$  around platform-switched implants provided vertical soft tissue thickness  $>3\mathrm{mm}$ , it was concluded that  $3\mathrm{mm}$  should be a threshold to differentiate between thin and thick tissues [81].

# 3.3.2 Implant Characteristics

A full osseointegration process combines two stages—primary stability resulting from a mechanical anchoring of the implant in bone, and secondary stability, which is obtained through bone's apposition and remodeling. The created link between the bone and the implant is called a functional ankylosis [82]. Albrektsson [83] distinguished six factors, which are essential to establish a proper connection:

1. Parameters of a dental implant's construction material (biocompatible, resistant to occlusal loads and corrosion).  
2. Geometry of the screw (providing maximal contact between the bone and the screw).  
3. Implant's surface characteristics.  
4. Bone's biological status.  
5. Surgical technique.  
6. Implant loading conditions.

Modern implants differ in surface topographies (presence of macro/microroughness) and coatings, which ensure a quick osseointegration, minimizing future complications [9, 84, 85]. Examples of such surface modifications cover TiUnite by Nobel Biocare, which is a moderately rough, thickened titanium oxide layer with high crystallinity, or SLA introduced by Straumann in 1998 (a macro-rough, sand-blasted, and acid-etched surface for a better cell attachment). The aim of these sophisticated surface topographies is to provide full direct implant-bone contact that guarantees good osteointegration without the patient's compliance. However, some researchers favor the idea that both the implant surface type and the particles freed from it may promote a change from a stable immune system, which is normally seen in a well-maintained osteointegration, to an active one leading to the implant's rejection [86]. For instance, patients equipped with TiUnite coated implants had greater implant pocket probing depths and radiographic bone loss, which could have been related to pits and grooves on the implant surface facilitating bacterial colonization and inflammation's onset [87]. It has also been advocated that implant surface modifications either have no impact on biological complications [27] or may severely complicate the peri-implantitis treatment [88, 89]. The factors linked to the implant's technological design are quite controversial. Some findings suggest that implant manufacturers, dimensions, location, antibiotics taken in tandem with the surgery, implant placement immediately after tooth extraction or in native bone, and the use of bone grafting materials should not be regarded as risk factors due to lack of supportive evidence [18]. However, the opposers claim that the narrower implant's diameter  $(\leq 3.5\mathrm{mm})$  or its smoother surface, the higher risk of peri-implantitis [15]. All things considered, the presence or the absence of a polished implant neck and the type of implant-abutment connection are considered to be the most crucial implant design factors with reference to crestal bone stability. A polished implant neck was connected with the pathogenesis of crestal bone loss, as it did not osseointegrate, thus this type of implants should be placed above the bone crest in such a way that only the rough part is submerged in the bone [90, 91]. As all modern implants are two-piece designed, all of them have a microgap at the implant-abutment connection, which might be associated with bacterial contamination and micromovements of the abutment. The stability of the abovementioned connection and the reduction of micromovements are provided with a conical connection. Quite recently it was reported that the smaller the angle of the inclination, the more resistant to lateral movements the abutment will be [92]. Consequently, due to the microbial leakage at the implant-abutment interface, an inflammatory cell infiltration in the connective tissue next to the microgap may develop resulting in a microgap-related bone loss [93]. The introduction of platform switching has shifted the bacterial leakage inwards and away from the bone towards the implant. Vela-Nebot and colleagues [94] showed that a mean marginal bone loss for implant with platform switching was  $0.76 - 0.77\mathrm{mm}$  after a 1-year follow-up, compared to  $2.53 - 2.56\mathrm{mm}$  for implants with a regular connection. At least  $0.4\mathrm{mm}$  of platform switching is necessary to be efficient for bone protection.

# 3.3.3 Technical Performance of the Surgery

Drilling in bone is an inevitable step in dental implant placement, as the space in bone has to be mechanically adjusted to the shape, diameter, and length of the artificial root. The hole in the bone is later replenished by a new bone created in the osteointegration process. The mechanical preparation of the implant socket requires using special drills called osteotomes, which are allowed for rotation by a machine called physio dispenser enabling operation with desired parameters of speed, torque, and sterile water/saline cooling. A rise of temperature and compression of the periimplant bone are the consequences of this aspect of the procedure and may determine the future success of the treatment (compression-related bone loss). The cancellous bone's matrix is built of multiple trabeculae arranged along lines of stress providing bone's capacity to bear loads [95]. Therefore, the atraumatic surgical procedures minimizing the risk of bone loss should be implemented on a routine basis [9, 96]. The use of osteotome condenser drills may increase the primary stability and osseointegration [97], yet it may also disrupt the connectivity of the trabecular network, reducing its potential to transmit occlusal forces, thus the secondary stability is not obtained [95]. Moreover, using osteotomes applies high compressive force on the crestal bone, leading to its  $22 - 50\%$  more prominent decrease than during the conventional implantation [98], and to a  $41\%$  reduction in the amount of bone-to-implant contact [99]. Similar complications may be caused by high drilling torque, causing delayed healing [100, 101]. Drilling speed and the drill's diameter may also affect bone healing in the implant socket. In the trabecular bone, areas of osteocyte necrosis emerge when the drilling speed reaches  $1500~\mathrm{rpm}$  [97]. The larger the drill, the larger the area of damage (e.g., drill diameter  $1.6\mathrm{mm}$  distance of tissue necrosis  $1040~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  drill diameter  $5\mathrm{mm}$  distance of tissue necrosis 1400  $\mu \mathrm{m})$  , and less new bone created, which are associated with a higher drilling energy and rise of the temperature transmitted to the bone [97, 102, 103]. Thermal damage during drilling is inevitable, resulting in a local tissue necrosis when it lasts for more than  $1\mathrm{min}$  at a temperature higher than  $47^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . A rise of temperature above this level

The maximum rise of temperature was recorded at the depth of  $10\mathrm{mm}$ , compared to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  and  $1\mathrm{mm}$ , without water cooling [104]. The study indicated that higher temperature and its faster increase were more eminent on the drill than in the bone, therefore following the manufacturer's speed recommendations ranging between 1000 to  $1500\mathrm{rpm}$  with an adequate internal or external irrigation of the surgical site should substantially decrease the degree of the thermal damage. On the final note, it has to be reminded that blunt drills generate more heat than sharp ones, so their use should be avoided [109]. Another question arising is the sufficient amount of coolant to protect the surgical site from overheating. Sindel and colleagues [96] proved that the heat generated during drilling is not directly proportional to the coolant volume. In their study, the temperature of four drills of various diameter (2.8, 3.4, 3.8, 4.4 mm), rotating at  $800\mathrm{rpm}$  and a torque of  $55\mathrm{Ncm}$  without any irrigation was statistically higher than when water cooling of 12 and  $30\mathrm{mL}/$  min was administered. They also found no difference between 12 and  $30\mathrm{mL/min}$  irrigation. Based on their report it was concluded that an external irrigation of  $12\mathrm{mL/min}$  is sufficient in heat reduction during implant bed preparation, while excessive water cooling reduces the visibility of the surgical site [96]. Other studies speculated that the temperature rise was influenced by irrigation at a uniform speed of  $90\mathrm{mL/min}$  during drilling, but not by a drill type [106]. Contrarily, a test on a bovine rib proved that the drill's diameter had the largest effect on the temperature rise (Table 3), while the drilling force and speed had a similar effect, with the temperature decreasing almost equally with the increasing of both the force and the speed, due to their positive impact on the reduction of the drilling time [108].

In conclusion, recklessness and lack of experience in using the dedicated mechanical devices during implantation procedure may damage the bone's trabecular network, impair its ability to bear occlusal stress, and cause delay in a new bone formation around the implant [99].

# 3.3.4 Implant Position and Angulation

The position of the implanted screw and its angulation has its part in the periimplantitis occurrence in patients (Fig. 8) [69].

More than  $40\%$  of the implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis presented with a too-buccal position [76]. The critical buccal bone thickness for preventing buccal lingual bone resorption is estimated to be  $1.5 \mathrm{~mm}$  [110]. An insufficient amount of crestal bone favors peri-implantitis development as a consequence of the implant's micro-rough surface contamination by the plaque-associated bacteria causing its chronic infection [110]. On the other hand, an apico-coronal implant position might dictate the long-term stability of the peri-implant tissues [9]. The depth of the implant placement is considered as risk factor when it measures  $\geq 6 \mathrm{~mm}$  from the cement enamel junction of the adjacent tooth [111]. The implant location in the maxilla bears the risk of peri-implantitis [30], while in mandible is regarded safe [18], apart from the lower anterior region [15]. Generally speaking, implants with platform switching can be placed either at the bone level or subcrestally (up to  $3 \mathrm{~mm}$  depending on implant design and local factors), while tissue-level implants need to be placed with its entire polished portion above the bone crest. Too deep placement of tissue-level implants will result in crestal bone loss. As mentioned previously, crestal bone stability requires previous development of soft tissue attachment that is determined by vertical thickness of gingiva. In vertically thick tissues, implant depth placement is decided upon the implant design. In order to increase the vertical dimension of soft tissues in case of thin phenotype, appropriate surgical approach should be chosen, that depends on anatomical limitations (e.g., subcrestal implant placement or soft tissue augmentation). All of these methods should protect the neck of the implant from exposure to peri-implant soft tissues in a process of crestal bone remodeling.

# 3.3.5 Bone Grafting and Antibiotics

There is no evidence to associate the use of a bone grafting material during surgery with peri-implantitis [27, 69], but some studies showed that grafts are less resistant to infection in comparison to the native bone [112]. Proceeding with an open flap technique during surgery is regarded as a risk factor, as it may be a cause of an interruption in periosteal blood supply from the elevated periosteum, which may further reduce the necessary blood supply to the cortical bone and impair its further healing [113]. Insertion of the implant in the bone may disturb the blood flow inside it (a process called an avascular necrosis), promoting peri-implantitis development [114]. The administration of antibiotics at any time (pre/post-surgery) acts as a protective factor against peri-implantitis [18].

# 3.3.6 Number of Implants and Distance Between Them

The literature states that risk factors are the bone level counted in the implant's middle third and the implant's proximity to other teeth/implants [28]. The mesiodistal position could be a risk factor of peri-implantitis as it dictates space for performing oral hygiene and bacterial plaque removal. Also, if the distance between two adjacent dental implants or one implant with the adjoining teeth measures less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , the process of bone remodeling may be impaired [115]. It is estimated that having more than two implants bears a higher risk of peri-implantitis [27].

# 4 Treatment

The treatment of peri-implantitis is still difficult and unreliable. It should be cause-related, as its etiology covers bacterial contamination and toxic activity of their by-products left on the implant surface. The therapy of all peri-implant diseases should be focused on minimization of the dental plaque deposition, while the prevention of peri-implantitis must cover prevention and treatment of its preceding form—peri-implant mucositis [116, 117]. The literature findings support the idea that lack of professionally administered supportive treatment of peri-implant mucositis can be attributed to a higher risk of peri-implantitis occurrence [116], therefore patient's motivation should be directed to an adequate plaque control. Effective teeth brushing, using mouth rinses, diminishing the influence of the patient-dependent risk factors, e.g., smoking, and balancing of the occlusion should be seen as prerequisites for a successful peri-implantitis treatment. The peri-implant mucositis responds well to the nonsurgical treatment, which is focused mainly on the patient's oral hygiene regimen. An efficient plaque removal ensures the effectiveness of peri-implant mucositis treatment methods [118, 119]. Colonization of the implant surfaces with bacterial biofilm occurs rapidly [120]. There are four types of bacteria adherence to the implant's surface [84]:

Type 1: random transport of bacteria to the surface

Type 2: initial, reversible adhesion

Type 3: strong adhesion to the surface by specific interactions

Type 4: surface colonization by multiple bacteria species, biofilm formation, and maturation

There are no widely accepted therapy standards of peri-implantitis treatment. The main goal is the plaque control in the implant area through debridement and decontamination [117]; however, it has to be emphasized that peri-implantitis does not respond to nonsurgical methods as well as peri-implant mucositis [121-123]. The nonsurgical treatment methods of peri-implantitis cover:

1. Patient's education and motivation in keeping good oral hygiene  
2. Decreasing role of patient-dependent risk factors  
3. Ultrasonic cleaning  
4. Sub-gingival closed flap debridement

The biofilm's removal from the implant's surface is a priority and the patient should be motivated to keep his hygiene at the level of type 2 of the bacterial adhesion (initial and reversible). Dudek and colleagues [17] treated peri-implant diseases according to their own classification scale (Table 1). In case of patients classified as stage I, the proposed treatment involved professional hygiene (scaling, ozone treatment, and decontamination with  $0.12\%$  CHX) and intensification of the home oral hygiene with additional mouth rinsing with  $0.12\%$  CHX. This treatment was effective in  $66.6\%$  of the stage I cases. Clinical studies on the effectiveness of a mechanical debridement alone using carbon/titanium fiber curettes, the Vector® system (Durr Dental, Bietigheim-Bissigen, Germany), or ultrasonic devices showed that BoP was only slightly improved, while PD remained unchanged or even worsened [124, 125]. A photodynamic therapy (PDT), which stands for an application of photosensitive dyes into pathological pockets and their activation with light of a specific wavelength, results in the eradication of periodontal pathogens [126]. A toluidine blue O-mediated PDT proved to be effective in eradication of Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus [127]. In a clinical procedure, a photosensitive dye, e.g., chloride (HELBO® Blue Photosensitizer; Photodynamic Systems GmbH) is applied submucosally from the bottom to the top of the peri-implant pocket, is activated for  $10\mathrm{~s}$  using a hand-held diode laser (e.g., HELBO® TheraLite Laser, HELBO® 3D Pocket Probe; Photodynamic Systems GmbH) with a wavelength of  $660\mathrm{~nm}$  and a power density of  $100\mathrm{~mW}$ , and is left in situ for  $3\mathrm{~min}$ . Subsequently, the pocket should be irrigated with  $3\%$  hydrogen peroxide, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedure should be repeated after one week. Patient should be instructed to continue flossing the day

In a 6-month observation study, Schär and colleagues [128] observed no statistically relevant differences between subjects treated with either PDT or local drug delivery in terms of BoP, PD, clinical attachment level (CAL), and mucosal inflammation. They suggested that an adjunctive PDT may be used as an alternative nonsurgical treatment. A review by an American Academy of Periodontology confirmed that PDT may provide similar clinical improvements in PD and CAL when compared with conventional periodontal therapy in both periodontal and periimplant patients [129]. Moreover, a study conducted by Romeo and colleagues [130] showed a  $70\%$  reduction in the PI values and a  $60\%$  reduction in PD values, when PDT was used as an additional therapy to supportive nonsurgical treatment. Based on that, PDT should be considered an additional procedure in both nonsurgical and surgical treatment methods of peri-implantitis [130].

The nonsurgical treatment methods of peri-implantitis may be considered successful if they fulfill the short-term goal, which is the reduction of a supragingival dental plaque and therewith preparation of the corrective (surgical) phase, and a long-term goal, which is maintenance of the treatment success after the corrective phase [131]. The surgical phase should be implemented only when the oral hygiene regimen is achieved, validated by the  $\mathrm{PI} < 1$  [131].

4. Explanation

The variety of treatment methods exceeds the rate of this chapter, but the chosen therapy methods are discussed below. In 2004, Lang and colleagues [132] introduced a treatment protocol known as a cumulative intercognitive supportive therapy (CIST) (Table 4), which relied on the clinical and radiological state of the tissues surrounding dental implant.

The range of the treatment methods was correlated to the stage of the disease, which resulted from both the clinical and radiological symptoms, such as presence of the dental plaque on four surfaces of the prosthesis placed on the implant, presence of BoP, evaluated PD counted in mm, and the presence of radiological signs of bone loss around the implant screw.

The peri-implantitis lesions with more than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of bone loss require initial therapy followed by either resective or regenerative surgery [133]. It must be emphasized that this protocol justifies using surgical methods only at the worst stage of the disease, with  $\mathrm{PD} > 5\mathrm{mm}$  and bone loss  $>2\mathrm{mm}$  seen on the radiograph. Further limitations of this protocol are the lack of diversity of the treatment methods depending on the configuration of the bone loss and lack of the treatment's prognosis. Therefore, Passi and colleagues [134] introduced a new protocol, called bleeding, bone loss, mobility, probing depth, proposed treatment, and prognosis (BMP) scale, which completes the CIST scale (Table 5).

Implant surface's debridement alone is considered insufficient to promote regeneration of the bone and/or its re-osteointegration with the alveolar process. Therefore, surgical treatment methods may be supplemented by other methods, including decontamination and antimicrobial treatment (Fig. 9).

The methods of implant surface decontamination include air-powder abrasives, citric acid, and antimicrobial agents, such as CHX,  $3\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ , and betadine. Geremias and colleagues [135] have evaluated three debridement methods (implantoplasty, open flap debridement alone and combined with an additional chemical decontamination using citric acid for two minutes) and came out with a conclusion that the growth of Streptococcus mutans was similarly arrested after implantoplasty and debridement following disinfection with citric acid. Both nonsurgical and surgical peri-implantitis treatment may be coupled with an antimicrobial therapy (Table 6).

Bacteria in peri-implantitis are sensitive to amoxicillin, penicillin G, combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole, and combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate [141]. The most common antibiotics used in peri-implantitis are metronidazole and amoxicillin (alone or combined), as their adjunctive action suppresses gram-negative bacteria development [137, 142], apart from the patients treated by an open flap debridement [143]. The oral administration of antibiotics cover the time before and after the surgery, while minocycline and tetracycline are mainly used as a local therapy, placed directly into the surgical area [136, 144]. Local and/or systemic administration of antimicrobial agents along with the nonsurgical peri-implantitis therapy was proven to be effective only if the bone loss is less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  [145]. Administration of the systemic antibiotics should also be preceded by bacterial susceptibility tests [133], and it has to be remembered that the repeated systemic application of antibiotics may increase the risk of reinfection resulting from their gained resistance to drugs [144].

The aim of the surgical treatment, such as open flap debridement, osteoplasty, and implantoplasty, is to dispose of the inflammatory granuloma around the implant screw when it is unveiled and can be mechanically cleaned under direct sight. Further procedures, such as regenerative therapies, depend on the clinical situation disclosed during reinspection of the implant screw. An implantoplasty is a surgical procedure which stands for a smoothening of the bacteria-contaminated implant's surface using a fine grid polishing diamond and a rubber polisher. In this procedure, the roughness of the implant surface is diminished, so the bacterial biofilm formation is disrupted. It is usually done with diamond coated or carborundum rotary burs; however, plastic curettes are also acceptable [146, 147]. An additional

The bone grafting materials are used simultaneously with the surgical procedure to regenerate the lost bone. These combined methods proved to be effective, as a diminished BoP, improved PD, CAL, and radiographic bone view were shown in a long-term clinical trial [146]. Schwarz and colleagues divided the bone defects around dental implants into categories (Fig. 10) [150].

The most common defects in human are mixed, vertical, and horizontal defects. Taking only the intrabony defects, the most common are defects Ie (55.3%), while Ia are the most rare (5.4%) [150]. The best results of the bone regenerative therapy with bone grafts are expected in Ie defects, as they have the best biological potential and provide good stabilization for the bone grafts. The therapy protocol proposed by Dudek and colleagues [17] for the patients classified as stages II and III (Table 1) was mainly surgical and involved bone regeneration using pure titan granulate Tigran Natix® White and collagen membranes OsteoBiol® (Tecnoss® Dental s.r.l., Italy), or implant removal and bone augmentation. These methods were effective in 41.6% of class II cases and in 26.9% of class III cases, which indicates far less successful rate of the proposed regenerative treatment than expected. The outcomes of a retrospective analysis showed that the initial bone grafting procedures (lateral ridge augmentation using a particulated bone substitute and collagen membrane for maxillary sinus floor elevation) at the implant sites did not influence the effectiveness of a combined surgical therapy of peri-implantitis [147]. Based on that, some researchers concluded that there are no indications for an additional bone grafting or use of barrier membranes during the surgical peri-implantitis treatment [151]. The need for an independent grafting vs combined surgical methods should be respected individually based on the clinical and radiological outcomes and the patient's wishes.

The coexisting defects of the mucosa around dental implant can be corrected using soft tissue plastic reconstruction therapies. Miller and colleagues have introduced a scale of the gingival recession defects in which four classes are recognized:

1. Class I—marginal tissue recession which does not extend to mucogingival junction, with no bone loss in the interdental area  
2. Class II—marginal tissue recession which extends to or beyond the mucogingival junction, with no bone loss in the interdental area  
3. Class III—marginal tissue recession which extends to or beyond the mucogingival junction, with bone loss in the interdental area. The presence of teeth malpositioning is detected, which interrupts with the necessary regenerative treatment

4. Class IV—marginal tissue recession which extends to or beyond the mucogingival junction and a severe bone loss of the alveolar process is detected, with exposure of more than one proximal root surface [152]

The subepithelial connective tissue grafts are mainly taken from the palate and, according to research, are the best treatment options in Miller Class I and II gingival recession defects, as they provide reliable results, such as an increase in keratinized tissue width, CAL level, and esthetics [153]. Shah and colleagues [154] recommend a two-stage procedure in case of a thin mucosa profile with a minimal width or lack of peri-implant keratinized gingiva—a subepithelial connective tissue graft from the palate in combination with a coronally advanced flap in order to cover the dehiscence in the first instance, and secondly, after a healing period of 3 months, a vestibuloplasty in combination with a free gingival graft to create an adequate peri-implant cuff of a keratinized mucosa. As the proper width and horizontal thickness of the keratinized mucosa surrounding dental implant is crucial for the prevention of peri-implant diseases, the connective soft tissue grafts are highly appreciated, as they provide reliable and long-term results (Figs. 11 and 12).

Implant failures can be divided according to the time of their occurrence (Fig. 13) [155]. The early failures occur before the implants are functionally loaded. In such cases, the osteointegration process is not obtained, so the implants are mobile and can be easily removed. On the other hand, late failures are observed after loading, and are mainly due to biological or prosthetic reasons (Fig. 14) [155].

Implant's explanation should be regarded as the last treatment option. Unfortunately, peri-implantitis remains the main reason for late implant failure [156]. The indications for this procedure must be thoroughly examined, and the only absolute indication for it should be the implant's mobility due to the advanced bone resorption [157]. The implant type might also affect the decision of its removal, as threaded screws are far more easy to be removed, on contrary to circumferential plateau design implants, whose surface area is more sophisticated, making their removal more risky in terms of extensity of the procedure. The patient's opinion should be also taken into consideration, as explanation might be emotionally and financially stressful [157]. The indications in favor of explanation include patients before radiotherapy with an advanced peri-implantitis (if the implants are positioned in the area of radiation), bone loss of more than two-thirds of the implant length, and hollow-cylinder implants (if they are early recognized on the radiograph as unsuccessful) [156]. It must be remembered that the idea of strictly following the level of bone loss of two-thirds of the implant length may not be applicable to short and tapered implants (e.g.,  $8\mathrm{mm}$  implants) [158]. During the explanation procedure, the bony defects should be regenerated to prepare the alveolar process for the

# 5 Conclusion

The high success rates of placing dental implants are mostly attributed to establishing a long-standing osseointegration of the screw. Along with the rising number of dental implants installed in patients, long-term complications may occur, involving bacterial contamination and loss of bone support. Peri-implant health problems, involving peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis, are complex diseases, which occurrence is modified by a specific bacteria flora infecting dental implants and multiple patient and nonpatient risk factors. The recognition and treatment of the peri-implant health problems is difficult and the dentists' experience in this field is a must. The treatment methods cover both the nonsurgical and surgical aspects, and their coordination depends on the clinician. The main goal is to prevent dental implants from bacteria attack through professionally administered and home oral hygiene. Well designed and balanced occlusion of the prosthetic devices based on implants screws are vital in the prevention of peri-implant health problems, and their impact on the patient's oral health lies within the dentist's experience.
