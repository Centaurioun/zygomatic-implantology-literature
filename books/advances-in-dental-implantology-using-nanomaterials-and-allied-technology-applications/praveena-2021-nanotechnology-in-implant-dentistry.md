Abstract Recent advancements in engineering tools and techniques coupled with the extrapolation of nanotechnology in the field of dentistry have rendered dental implant therapy as the most reliable treatment option for replacement of missing natural dentition. Nanotechnology has driven dental implants to a newer level. It assists in understanding and achieving cell-specific functions, and thus critical steps in osseointegration can be modulated by nanoscale modification of the implant surface. It is possible to mimic bone formation process occurring at nanoscale level to achieve better osseointegration and higher implant surface ratio. This review chapter also discusses the various methods and techniques of imparting nanoparticle-coated implants for the improvement of osseointegration using nanosurfaced features of the dental implants and their antimicrobial activity.

# 1 Introduction

Dental implants have been in the market place for a long period of time for restoring or replacing teeth. The challenges faced by dental surgeons during dental implantation are controlling the high chances of infections and achieving osseointegration. Many studies have been attempted to enhance the osseointegration of implants by various surface modifications. The aim of dental manufacturers is to provide dental implants with surface biological properties for the adsorption of proteins, the adhesion and differentiation of cells, and tissue integration. These biological properties are allied to chemical composition, wettability, and roughness of metal implants surfaces. However, the control of these surface properties at the protein and cell levels, thus in the nanometer range, remains a potential challenge for researchers and dental implants manufacturers [1].

Modern science and technology has undergone a major revolution with the evolution of nanotechnology and hence has been assimilated into various medical disciplines including dentistry. Bulk material when reduced to nanoscale, there is significant change in the optical, thermal, and antimicrobial properties [2]. This alteration of the desired physicochemical properties of nanomaterials has led to the conceptual development of "nanodontistry." The continuous ongoing quest for the introduction of newer materials for promoting better oral health has led to the discovery of various nanobiomaterials, advanced clinical tools, and better treatment modalities.

With the advent of hybrid science named nanobiotechnology, nanomaterials have noteworthy applications in implant dentistry [3]. The application of "nano" to implants, abutments, and bone substitutes drastically changed their biologic response. Nanotechnologies generate surfaces with controlled topography and chemistry that would aid in understanding biological interactions and developing novel implant surfaces with predictable tissue-integrative properties [4].

In this chapter, the biomedical applications of nanoparticles and nanopatterned surfaces in implant dentistry, including the recent nanocoated implant materials and technologies which are responsible for tuning the cell-specific interactions and promoting osseointegration, are discussed. The sequence of biological events in relation to the surface is related. Mechanisms of interaction with blood, platelets, and mesenchymal stem cells on the surface of implants are described.

# 1.1 Nanotechnology Definition

While many definitions of nanotechnology exist, the most widely used is from the US Government's National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). According to the NNI, nanotechnology is defined as: "Research and technology development at the atomic, molecular and macromolecular levels in the length scale of approximately  $1 - 100\mathrm{nm}$  range, to provide a fundamental understanding of phenomena and materials at the nanoscale and to create and use structures, devices and systems that have novel properties and functions because of their small and/or intermediate size" [5].

Nanotechnology or molecular engineering is the production of functional materials and structures in the range of 0.1-100 nm-nanoscale by various physical or chemical methods [6]. The term "nano" is derived from "nanos," the Greek word for "dwarf." A nanometer is  $10^{-9}$  a meter or one-billionth of a meter [7]. In simple terms, it is engineering at the atomic and molecular scale. It is a highly multidisciplinary field and cuts across many disciplines, including colloidal science, chemistry, applied physics, and biology.

# 1.2 Historical Review

Nanotechnology is not a new term. Although nanotechnology has been around since the beginning of time, the discovery of nanotechnology is widely attributed to the American Physicist and Nobel Laureate, Dr. Richard Phillips Feynman [7]. The first use of the word "nanotechnology" has been attributed to Taniguchi in 1974. In 1986, Eric Drexler introduced and popularized the term "nanotechnology" in his book "Engines of Creation" [5]. Dr. Robert A. Fretias Jr. is one among the pioneer scientists who has written about nanomedicine, nanodentistry, and their future changes [5]. It was introduced into dentistry as nanocomposites in the year 2002 by Filtek Supreme [8].

# 1.3 Classification of Nanomaterials

Siegel has classified nanomaterials [6, 9] based on dimensions as shown in Table 1.

# 1.4 Approaches in Nanotechnology

The fabrication techniques of the nanoscale materials can be divided into the following three approaches [7, 8]:

(a) Larger to smaller (top-down approach)

Top-down fabrication reduces large pieces of materials all the way down to the nanoscale (Fig. 1). This approach requires larger amounts of materials and can lead to waste if excess material is discarded. Here, larger materials are patterned and carved down to make nanoscale structures in precise patterns. Materials reduced to the nanoscale can suddenly show very different properties, enabling unique applications (Table 2).

(b) Simple to complex (bottom-up approach)

The bottom-up approach to nano-manufacturing creates products by building them up from atomic and molecular-scale components, which can be time-consuming (Fig. 1). This begins by designing and synthesizing custom-made molecules that have the ability to self-assemble or self-organize into higher-order structures.

(c) Functional approach

In this approach, components of the desired functionality are developed without regard to how they might be assembled.

# 2 Concept of Osseointegration

Modification of dental osseous implants at nanoscale level produced by various techniques can alter biological responses that may improve osseointegration and dental implant procedures. The high success rates for endosseous implants have resulted from many research approaches with the aim of enhancing and accelerating bone anchorage to the implant, thereby providing optimal support for the intraoral prosthetic devices. This innovatory breakthrough has first emerged from the research efforts of the Branemark group in the late 1960s by pioneering the placement of machined screw-type commercially pure titanium (cpTi) implants with minimum surgical trauma. The bone bonding ability, termed as "osseointegration" by Branemark et al. (1977), of this machined implant was principally the result of the proper surgical technique providing macrostability to the implant and the biocompatible nature of the bulk titanium [10].

Osseointegration of dental implants was earlier characterized as a structural and functional connection between newly formed bone and the implant surface, which became a synonym for the biomechanical concept of secondary stability [11]. Osseointegration comprises a cascade of complex physiological mechanisms similar to direct fracture healing (Fig. 2). The drilling of an implant cavity resembles a traumatic insult to bony tissue leading to distinct phases of wound healing [12]. New bone generates from the borders of the drill hole (distance osteogenesis) or by osteogenic cells on the surface of the implant (contact osteogenesis). In distance osteogenesis, osteoblasts migrate to the surface of the implant cavity, differentiate, and lead to the formation of new bone. Thus, bone grows in an appositional manner towards the implant. In contact osteogenesis, osteogenic cells migrate directly onto the implant surface and generate de novo bone [13].

After decades of research, better designs and materials have evolved, with increase in survival rate and low failure rate. The most frequent cause for failure is insufficient bone formation around the implant surface. In this, the implant surface and tissue interface play a critical role [14]. Implant surface composition, surface energy, surface roughness, and topography are the four material-related factors which can influence biological events at the bone-implant interface. Macro, micro, and nano are the three types of surface structures. Current surface structures are controlled, at best, at the micron level, but tissue response is mainly dictated by processes controlled at the nanoscale. Surface profiles of implants in the nanometer range play an important role in the adsorption of proteins and adhesion of osteoblastic cells, promote osteogenic differentiation, and may improve the osseointegration of the implants [15]. Hence, we need strategies to improve the current metallic dental implants, through surface modifications of the implant either by applying novel ceramic coatings or by patterning the implant's surfaces.

# 3 Interactions of Surface Dental Implants with Blood

The first biological event after the implantation is blood-implant contact [16]. Immediate response is adsorption of platelets and interaction of plasma proteins with the implant surface (Fig. 3). Plasma proteins with other substances such as glucose, amino acids, and various ions influence the wettability of implant surface

Red blood cells

Platelets

Fibrin

Fibronectin and vitronectin help in cell attachment by cell-binding RGD domain (arg-gly-asp tripeptide). RGD chain interacts with cell membrane [20] integrins, which in turn play a vital role in adhesion of many cell lineages.

# 3.1 Role of Macrophage Cells

Macrophage lineage depends on its phenotype, i.e., if the stimulus is for proregenerative (M2) macrophage phenotype, more number of M2 will be in that vicinity compared to proinflammatory (M1) phenotype [16]. Dominant proregenerative (M2) macrophage phenotype which aids in tissue regeneration forms the bone around the implant, by stimulating the osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells and suppressing the inflammatory response [16].

# 3.2 Interactions Between Surfaces and Mesenchymal Stem Cells

Blood coagulation is followed by various cell interactions. After migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the implant site by chemokine stimulus from surrounding tissues, it invades the three-dimensional microporous structure that allows diffusion of regulatory factors [21, 22] and helps in the migration, proliferation, and

Here MSCs can be differentiated into either fibroblastic or osteoblastic based on the stimulus. If the stimulus is for fibroblast cells, it initiates fibrous capsule formation obstructing the bond between implant and bone by forming collagen and thus results in an implant failure [23]. At the same time, it is desired to have more fibroblastic proliferation near gingival part of implant. Studies have revealed less fibroblast proliferation at nanosurface than conventional surface which facilitates better osseointegration [24].

Increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and calcium are observed in cell layers on nanosized materials after 21 and 28 days [25, 26]. Nanorough Ti and nanostructured Ti showed better results compared to nanosmooth surfaces [27, 28] and greatly enhanced osseointegration has been observed with micro- and nanopore surfaces [29, 30]. Adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of MSCs depend on local chemical environment, surface topography of implant, and its surface tension for predictable regeneration.

# 3.3 Nanosurface and Bacterial Proliferation

It is noted that a profound decrease in bacterial colonization on nanostructured  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{ZnO}$  regardless of the surface [31]. These observations need further research on biofilm formation and peri-implantitis around implants.

# 4 Surface Functionalization for Enhanced Osseointegration

The surface of a titanium implant plays a central role in determining the biological response of the host bone for several reasons (Fig. 6).

The surface characteristics of an implant regulate the healing mechanisms at the bone-implant interface since it is the only region contacting the bone. Surface functionalization had gained the interest of many manufacturers for enhancing the biomechanical anchorage and osseointegration of the implant at the histological level. Commonly used techniques [14] to alter surface properties of titanium are as follows (Table 3).

All these modifications regulate the morphology, physicochemical composition, and surface energy of the implant surface. Two categories of surface properties are commonly suggested for affecting the tissue response to the implant: surface topography and physicochemical composition.

# 4.1 Topographical Features of Titanium Surfaces

The fate of an implant after implantation is decided by the adsorption of biomolecules and the consequent interactions of cells on the implant surface. Rough topography increases the surface area of the implant and cell adhesion, thereby achieving higher bone-to-implant contact and better biomechanical integrity [32]. It has been shown that moderate roughness (Ra, between 1 and  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) and complex microtopographies are important for the enhanced osseointegration of titanium implants [33]. Implants with rough surfaces exhibited greater bone-implant interface compared to smooth surfaces [34].

Cellular interactions are affected by the surface topography. Surface roughness in the range from 1 to  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  influences the interface biology. Only limited studies documented better cellular proliferation on surfaces with microrough topography. Mustafa et al. [35] blasted the machined titanium surfaces with different microtopographies and found an insignificant increase in cell proliferation parallel to increasing roughness. However, numerous other studies demonstrated a negative correlation between surface microroughness and cell proliferation [36]. In the study done by Boyan et al. [37] it has been shown that on surfaces with rough microtopographies, osteoblasts secrete factors, such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), prostaglandins (PGE1 and PGE2), and TGF-  $\beta 1$  , that enhance osteoblast differentiation while decreasing osteoclast formation and activity [38]. These results reveal that on rough surfaces osteoblasts demonstrate a more differentiated phenotype, although the proliferation is negatively affected.

# 4.2 Physicochemical Composition of Titanium Surfaces

The surface chemistry, wettability, and charge are the other important parameters that affect the extent of bone response besides the surface topographical features [39]. Due to high affinity to oxygen, a very thin oxide film is formed on the titanium interacting surface when exposed to air [40]. Titanium dioxides have properties similar to ceramics. The chemical stability and corrosion resistance of its dense and protective oxide film determine the biocompatibility of titanium [41]. The crystal structure of this film is believed to be imperative for the success of implant integration. Anatase or rutile surfaces showed enhanced cellular proliferation and mineralized nodule formation, compared with amorphous ones [42]. Preliminary studies demonstrated that hydrophilic nature of titanium surfaces positively influences the cell differentiation and growth factor production [43, 44]. There are also differing results from other studies. Culture test of MSCs done by Bauer et al. [45] on nanotubular titanium surfaces having unlike wettability characteristics has shown improved cellular adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces compared with superhydrophilic surfaces. It is difficult to state that the hydrophilicity of surface is the only basis for enhanced outcomes with the current availability of uncertain results. The microtopography, the local chemical environment, and wettability altogether must be taken into consideration for eliciting the predictable results.

# 4.3 Nanotopographical Modification of Titanium Surfaces

After implantation, osteoblasts in the human body encounter various nanostructures during their cellular and tissue interactions creating an imperative need to produce better implant materials having also nanometer roughness. Several studies have recommended that nanophase materials formed from various chemistries such as metals, polymers, composites, and ceramics enhanced cellular activities when compared with conventional microrough materials [46]. Nanobiomaterials with nanoscale surface topography possess an increased percentage of atoms and crystal structures and higher surface area with high surface energy than the conventional ones leading to increased initial protein adsorption which is very crucial in regulating the cellular interactions on the implant surface. Webster et al. [47] reported increased osteoblast adhesion on nanophase materials. It has been proved that osteoblasts cultured on nanophase biomaterials exhibited improved osteogenic behavior than on conventional materials [48].

Although several methods are developed to produce nanoscale structures on titanium surface, the electrochemical anodization of titanium is the most popular and novel technique to produce controlled structures on implant surfaces for load-bearing approaches [49]. The titania nanotube arrays are the most promising type of titanium nanosurfaces for dental implantology [50]. Several studies have verified that cells cultured on these nanotubular surfaces showed better adhesion, proliferation, ALP activity, and bone matrix deposition [51]. Nanotubular surfaces drastically improved bone bonding strength by almost ninefold compared with grit blasted surfaces. The histological analysis showed greater bone-implant contact and collagen type I expression [52]. Cellular responses are considerably influenced by the nanomorphological features such as length, diameter, and wall thickness of titania nanotubes [53]. Although nanotubular structures on titanium offer a suitable infrastructure for better osseointegration [54, 55], still there is a need for further studies that would optimize the production of nanotubes for improved bioactivity.

# 5 Implant Coatings

In many cases, the failure occurs at the tissue-implant interface, which may be due to the implant material weakening its bond with the natural material. To overcome this, implants are often coated with a biocompatible material to increase their adherence properties and produce a greater surface area to volume ratio for the highest possible contact area between the implant and natural tissue.

In addition to the higher surface areas and improved adhesion properties of the nanoparticle coatings, improved coating techniques are also being developed. While high temperature processes such as plasma spray can melt ceramic particles and reduce their surface area and adhesion properties, new low temperature processes with electromagnetic fields can maintain the nanomaterial properties. This provides the maximum possible contact area between the implants and bone surface to improve the potential for ingrowth in the host bone.

Nanotechnology brings a variety of new high surface area biocompatible nanomaterials and coatings to increase the adhesion, durability, and life span of implants. Nanostructure modification of dental implants improves osseointegration through enhanced biomimicry of host structures. Ceramic materials such as calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite or HA) and calcium carbonate are the available calcium derivative nanoparticles (Table 4).

The composition of HA simulates the composition of the bone and teeth. HA like tricalcium phosphate does not undergo any resorption. Due to its chemical property

Nanoscale hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated implant surface will accelerate osseointegration and improve its quality relative to that of non-coated implants. The nanomechanical properties of the surrounding bone are evaluated by nanoindentation which shows the tissue quality significantly improving around HA-coated implants. Nano-hydroxyapatite is used as a single coating or in a combination with collagen, bioglass, or titanium dioxide in a composite coating to imitate the bio-environment of native bones [56].

Calcium carbonate is the other calcium derivative nanoparticle well known for its biocompatibility and osseoconduction. A direct contact has been reported between bone and calcium carbonate without any soft tissue interface.

# 5.1 Nanoparticle Coatings with Antimicrobial Activity

Dental implants are prone to failure as a result of bacterial biofilm accumulation. Implant surface designing should support the attachment of target tissue cells and prevent bacterial adhesion. Increasing the antibacterial ability and decreasing the bacterial compatibility of implant surfaces limits the biofilm formation. Zhao et al. [57] reviewed the in vitro and in vivo investigations for antibacterial coatings on Ti-based implants. Although progress has been made regarding antibacterial coating of implants, still there is no wide clinical utilization and in vivo information of antibacterial coating of implants.

Several studies reported that using antimicrobial medicines as nanoparticles-coated Ti can show sustained release pattern and improved antimicrobial efficiency (Table 5) [58].

# 5.1.1 Silver Nanoparticles

Silver ion  $(\mathrm{Ag^{+}})$  is a strong antibacterial agent with reasonable stability and broad spectrum antimicrobial effects. The size, shape, surface charge, concentration, and colloidal state are the most critical physicochemical parameters that affect the antimicrobial potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Nano-silver is comparatively less reactive than silver ions and therefore well suited for therapeutic and clinical applications [59]. AgNPs exhibit their antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. The most prominent modes of antimicrobial action are through adhesion of AgNPs to microbial cells followed by penetration inside the cells and subsequently releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals for modulation of microbial signal by transduction pathways [60]. According to Bressan et al., silver-containing materials could inhibit bacterial attachment onto the dental implants. Studies demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of silver-containing implants without genotoxicity or cytotoxicity and reported no local or systemic side effects [61]. Various techniques can be used to prepare silver-containing coatings.

Ion implantations prepared by micro arc oxidation (MAO) provide a porous biofunctional  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  coating with good adhesion to the surface of titanium implants [62]. Zhang et al. proved enhanced antimicrobial effect with superior biocompatibility and noncytotoxicity by coating  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  implants with silver nanoparticles using MAO method [62].

# 5.1.2 Zinc Oxide (ZnO) Nanoparticles

ZnO nanoparticles have been reported to show antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as against the spores which are resistant to high temperature and high pressure [63]. The proposed mechanisms for ZnO nanoparticles are the generation of hydrogen peroxide as well as the accumulation of the particles on the bacteria surface due to the electrostatic forces. In addition, ROS generation on the surface of the particles, zinc ion release, membrane dysfunction, and nanoparticle internalization could also be taken into account as the possible reasons of the antimicrobial activity of these nanoparticles. Memarzadeh et al. [63] observed that a  $75/25\%$  ratio of  $\mathrm{ZnO / nano}$ -hydroxyapatite coated substrates deposited by electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) could lead to enhanced osteoblast growth and produced a more biocompatible, osseoconductive, and antimicrobial implant. Their results also proved minimal toxicity for UMR-106 cells exposed to  $\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanoparticles with no release of TNF- $\alpha$  and IL-6 cytokines for MG-63 cells cultured on  $\mathrm{ZnO}$  substrates. According to proliferation and differentiation studies, the substrate exclusively coated with  $\mathrm{ZnO}$  nanoparticles showed more efficiency than that with composite surface coatings.

# 5.1.3 Copper Oxide (CuO) Nanoparticles

The exploitation of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO) has increased rapidly over the past decade because of their unique attributes to combat biofilm formation. The size, stability, and concentration determine the bactericidal activity of CuO nanoparticles [58]. CuO nanoparticles control the bacterial growth by passing through nanometric pores existing on bacterial cell membranes. CuO nanoparticles demonstrated high antibacterial activity while maintaining less cytotoxicity. Anu et al. [64] concluded that CuO nanoparticle-coated substrates deposited by standard slurry dipping method and chemical synthesis efficiently suppressed the dental infections. The results showed no inhibitory zones for uncoated materials, while the CuO nanoparticle-coated titanium dental implants showed significant inhibitory zones. Proliferation, adhesion, and spread of cells are markedly influenced by the formation of oxidation layer on Ti as per their hypotheses.

# 5.1.4 Quercitrin-Nanocoated Implants

Quercitrin is a natural yellow color flavonoid obtained from tartary buckwheat and from the bark of oak trees. Quercitrin has the inherent ability of enhancing both hard and soft tissue integration around the implant, thereby increasing the dental implant success and decreasing the risk of peri-implantitis. It is also hypothesized that quercitrin-coated dental implants show an inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis and thus can accomplish delayed bone resorption while promoting bone formation, producing more bony tissue just before the remodeling phase. Gomez-Florit et al. proved the soft tissue regeneration potential of quercitrin-nanocoated titanium surfaces by increased human gingival fibroblasts attachment. The anti-inflammatory properties are evaluated by mimicking the anti-inflammatory situation using interleukin-1-beta. The anti-inflammatory results showed increased collagen mRNA levels, decreased matrix metalloproteinase-1/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 mRNA ratio, and decreased proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 release under basal and inflammatory conditions [65].

# 5.1.5 Chlorhexidine (CHX) Nanoparticles

Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a broad antimicrobial and antifungal spectrum. In a research work by Barbour et al., CHX-coated surface can reduce the growth of Streptococcus gordonii, but the CHX is rapidly depleted, leading to a short-term antimicrobial effect [66]. Wood et al. investigated the use of CHX hexametaphosphate (HMP) nanoparticles as a porous aggregating coating on titanium dental implants. The prepared CHX-HMP nanoparticle-coated Ti showed sustained release of CHX and improved antimicrobial efficiency. According to their microbiological results, colony-forming units (CFUs) in the wells containing the CHX-HMP nanoparticle-coated Ti decreased as a function of time, whereas CFUs in the uncoated Ti remained constant. Also, their results revealed the existence of more live bacteria on uncoated Ti than on nanoparticle-coated Ti after 24 and  $48\mathrm{h}$  [67].

According to currently available data, there is a great interest among dental surgeons and implantologists in analyzing relationships between vitamin D3 and the osseointegration process. Besides a known role of vitamin D3 in bone metabolism, D3 is also very relevant for the normal functioning of the immune system, which is of particular importance for a successful integration of a dental implant in surrounding bone tissue. Based on the results of a combined electrochemical-theoretical study conducted by Jozefina et al. [68], bioactive vitamin D3 coating created the dental implant surface more osseoinductive and simultaneously more corrosion resistant during exposure to aggressive media (oral cavity fluids).

# 6 Tissue Regeneration Scaffolds

Nanostructures are being researched for the preparation and improvement of tissue regeneration scaffolds. Research areas include the ability to develop molecular sensitive polymers using the optical properties of nanoparticles as a control system, manipulating the stiffness and strength of scaffolds using hybrid nanostructures, and the use of nanotechnology to prepare molecular imprints to maximize long-term viability and function of cells on scaffold surfaces [5].

Some nanomaterials and nanotechnology fabrication techniques that are being investigated as tissue regeneration scaffolds that provide improved structures are as follows:

(a) Nanoscale polymers such as Poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) are being molded into heart valves and seeded with fibroblasts and endothelial cells.  
(b) Polymer nanocomposites are being researched for bone scaffolds.

Scientific challenges related to a better understanding of molecular/cell biology and fabrication methods for producing large three-dimensional scaffolds are among the many obstacles yet to be overcome.

Nanostructures are also being used to study the fundamental properties of implanted tissues. In areas of in vivo analysis, nanostructures are used as tracers for implanted cells and to study the response of the host to implanted tissues.

# 7 Structural Implant Materials and Bone Repair

Nanotechnology in implant dentistry restricts itself not only to implant surface modifications but also to other biomaterials used in this field that can be used as implants or temporary bioresorbable structures. Bone is a high strength material that is used as both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing. Bones are more than just structural materials as they also contain interconnected pores that allow body fluids to carry nutrients and permit interfacial reactions between hard and soft tissues. In the case of bone fractures, graft disorders, and dental applications, bones may require repair or replacement [5].

A variety of natural materials are used as bone substitutes. These include autografts from the patient's pelvis, allograft from another human, bovine material, or coral blocks. Natural materials tend to be brittle and can lose mechanical strength during sterilization. They can also cause inflammation, pain at the pelvis graft site, and potentially transmit disease. Bone cavities can also be filled with synthetic bone cement. C. Martin et al. have shown that nanostructured synthetic alloplasts fused with collagen promoted bone ingrowth compared to other materials, which could be a promising material to regenerate bone in severe bone defects due to atrophy after tooth/teeth loss [69]. Current bone cements containing polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) act as filler or grout, which is injected as flowable paste and then hardens in vivo. While PMMA cement can offer adequate mechanical properties and bonding, it is typically recommended only for non-weight-bearing bones. PMMA has also been linked to tissue damage, nerve root pain, and other side effects.

High strength nanoceramic materials, such as calcium phosphate appetite (CPA) and hydroxyapatite (HA), can be made into flowable, moldable nanoparticle paste that can confirm to and interdigitate with bone. As natural bone is approximately  $70\%$  by weight CPA including hydroxyapatite (HA), biocompatibility is thought to be extremely high with minimal side effects. As its dense surface and tight three-dimensional crystalline structures will allow for superior compressive strength to PMMA, nanoceramics may be suitable for both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing bones [5].

# 7.1 Bioresorbable Materials

Bioresorbable polymers are currently being used in degradable medical applications such as sutures and orthopedic fixation devices. With new production methods, nanostructures are being fabricated which could be used as temporary implants. Bioresorbable implants will be biodegradable and do not have to be removed in subsequent operation. Nanostructured implants are being designed to degrade at a rate that will slowly transfer load to a healing bone that it is supporting. Thus, it is possible in the near future to have nanomaterials used in the body to exceed current human performance on multiple dimensions and beyond current human limitations [8].

# 8 Conclusion

The futuristic view of multiple treatment opportunities offered by nanotechnological advances may sound unlikely, implausible, or even heretic. Yet, the theoretical and applied research to turn them into reality is progressing rapidly. Nanotechnology is still advancing and needs much more testing before appreciating its maximum potential in implant dentistry. Several nanosurface modification methods are widely being developed to enhance surface properties of titanium dental implant that result in rapid osseointegration and faster bone healing. Many in vitro and animal studies have shown that nanometer-controlled surfaces have a great effect on healing after implant placement. It affects the adsorption of proteins, blood clot formation, and cell behaviors occurring upon implantation. The techniques and methods developed should be applicable to clinical practice. Nanotechnology opens a new spectrum of possibilities for advancement in implant dentistry.
