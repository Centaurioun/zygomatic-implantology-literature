# 1 Introduction

Graphene, discovered in 2004 [1], is a thin sheet of  $\mathrm{sp}^2$  bonded carbon atoms [2, 3] as shown in Fig. 1. Graphene consists of carbon atoms and can be in the form of pure graphene (pristine graphene), graphene oxide (GO) containing  $-\mathrm{C - O - O - H}$ ,  $-\mathrm{C - O - C - }$ , or  $-\mathrm{C - O - H}$ , and reduced GO (rGO). Graphene has remarkable properties of high surface area, high mechanical strength, stiffness, elasticity, high electrical, thermal conductivity, good biocompatibility, and ease of functionalization compared to other materials, such as collagen and hydrogel [4-8]. Hence, it is attracted to various fields including dentistry and implantology [3, 9-11]. A nomenclature for 2D carbons has been mentioned which gives a description of their subject materials and allowed to move forward with a deeper understanding of graphene-based materials [12].

# 2 Production of Graphene

Graphene can be prepared from various methods according to the need and applications. The common methods for the production are mentioned below [3, 4, 13]:

(a) Exfoliation of graphite prepared mechanically (b) Epitaxial growth (SIC) (c) Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) (e) Molecular assembly (MA)


From the above techniques, various grades of graphene are produced in various amounts by varying defects and substrates (Fig. 2).

Mechanical exfoliation is the simplest of the preparation methods. In this technique, a piece of graphite undergoes repeated tape exfoliation and is then transferred to a substrate [14, 15]. This method still makes the highest quality crystals but is only useful for lab-scale experiments and prototyping as it is not possible to scale-up the process and used only for very small sample areas [16].

Epitaxial growth of graphite on silicon carbide has a long history [16]. The epitaxial graphene can be grown on SiC using a high-temperature sublimation growth process  $(1300 - 1800^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  in an ultrahigh vacuum or inert atmosphere [17]. The number of graphene layers, stacking of layers, and coupling to the substrate varies with crystal face orientation and growth conditions [18]. The produced graphene nanostructures are thus with atomically smooth edges. The graphene produced consists of certain structural and manufacturing defects.

Molecular self-assembly is a technique to induce a modulation on graphene for improving the electronic properties [19, 20]. For this purpose, metal phthalocyanines (MPc) are excellent candidates [21]. They consist of a coordinated metal ion surrounded by an organic macrocycle, and charge transfer between graphene and MPc has been reported. Commonly, MPc form a square lattice on epitaxial graphene on iridium 111 [Ir(111)] [22] and a Kagome lattice on epitaxial graphene on ruthenium 0001 [Ru(0001)] [23]. For this technique, molecular ordering is likely to be crucial for achieving potential shapes [19]. In addition, this process is sensitive to the interaction between the graphene and the substrate on which it is grown [24].

Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is a straightforward procedure with high potential for the mass production of graphene and is the main method for mass production [25, 26]. Common techniques of LPE have been reported, such as sonication [27], jet cavitation [28], high-shear mixing [26], and microfluidization [29]. Sonication is an effective exfoliation method and has the potential to produce monolayer or few-layer graphene at relatively high concentrations [27, 30]. This process involves three steps, viz., the preparation of dispersion of graphite in a specific solvent, the exfoliation of dispersion via sonication, and the purification of graphene [27]. Sonication results in the growth and collapse of the microbubbles in liquids which causes cavitation-induced pressure pulsations and shock waves, which will produce normal and shear forces on graphite [31]. Various factors affecting the exfoliation are the power of sonication (cavitation), the liquid medium for dispersion of graphene nanosheets, the rate of centrifugation, and shear forces [31-33]. The liquid provides an environment for stable dispersions of graphene during sonication. The mechanism of exfoliation of graphite using sonication is shown in Fig. 3 [33]. Jet cavitation helps to produce graphene sheets from exfoliation of graphite crystals in aqueous solution, and this method is a facile, low-cost, time-saving, and laborsaving route potentially for mass production of graphene [28]. High-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets and the graphene produced can be applied in conductive coatings [26]. Production of graphene by microfluidization can be possible by the exfoliation of graphite in aqueous solutions under high-shear rate  $\left[\sim 10^{8} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right]$  turbulent flow conditions, and this is a simple and scalable production route for conductive inks for large-area printing in flexible electronics [29].

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a scalable strategy for large-scale production of graphene with a controllable number of layers and crystallinity [34]. Figure 4 shows the adopted transfer process [35]. At first, graphene thin film is grown on Ni foil using CVD, and then it is transferred to a glass slide. This procedure is expensive and time-consuming, and often results in contamination of metal ions, wrin kling, and defects or breakage of graphene during transferring steps [35, 36]. Hence, an effective method would be growing graphene directly on selected semiconductor and dielectric substrates. The challenge is the direct growth of graphene using CVD both on insulators and on semiconductors as they have low catalytic activity for carbon [37].


Graphene can be grown on nonmetallic substrates like  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ , h-BN, or quartz using low-temperature plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) and this allows direct deposition of high-quality graphene (Fig. 5) [37, 38]. Graphene may be directly produced on dielectrics like  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$ ,  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ ,  $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ , h-BN,  $\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ ,  $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$ , quartz,  $\mathrm{MgO}$ ,  $\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ ,  $\mathrm{TiO}_2$ , etc., and semiconductors like SiC, Si, Ge, and GaN using a low-temperature PECVD technique [34]. The high temperature causes the dissociation of carbon atoms from methane that reacts with the metal substrate allowing the formation of the typical honeycomb carbon structure on its surface. Thereafter, the graphene films are transferred onto target substrates via different techniques [39, 40].


Chemical vapor deposition growth of graphene can result in 3D structure [34] as shown in Fig. 6 [41, 42] which can have high specific surface area, low density, and fast electron transport. They are great for energy-related applications, engineering, and nanotechnology including biomedical science.

# 3 Properties and Characterization of Graphene

Graphene has good mechanical properties, such as high electron mobility  $(15,000\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{V}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  [43], large surface area  $(2630\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{g}^{-1})$  [44], high thermal conductivity  $(5000\mathrm{Wm}^{-1}\mathrm{K}^{-1})$  [45], good electrical conductivity  $(250,000\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{V}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  [15], high modulus of elasticity ( $\sim 1$  TPa) [46], high stiffness and high strength  $(42\mathrm{N}\mathrm{s}^{-1})$  [46], unique friction and wear properties [4, 7] making it attractive for use in vast applications. Large surface, porous structure, and capability to make nanocomposite properties have biomedical applications in drug delivery and regenerative medicine. High strength, low friction, and good wear properties are used in coatings and nanocomposites. Good electrical conductivity is used in semiconductors, biosensors, and supercapacitors. The details in each application are discussed in later sections.


The surface structure of graphene can be studied from scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), surface profilometer, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [47-51]. Some important characterization of GO is shown in Fig. 7. In SEM, the surface morphology generally shows little rough structure as shown in Fig. 7a [50, 51]. The EDS spectra help to indicate the presence of various elements. Raman spectra of graphene, GO, and rGO show D band at approx.  $1320~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  and G band  $1570~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  as shown in Fig. 7b [52]. D bands signify the breathing mode of  $\kappa$ -point phonons with  $\mathrm{A}_{lg}$  symmetry, and the G band shows the tangential stretching mode of the  $\mathrm{E}_{2g}$  phonon of the carbon  $\mathrm{sp}^2$  atoms. The ratio of D band and G band  $(I_{\mathrm{D}} / I_{\mathrm{G}})$  is approx. 0.84-0.97 [47].

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to calculate the crystallinity and interplanar spacing of the graphene-based materials as shown in Fig. 7c. The measurement is performed in contact mode, and the height, deflection, and 3D images are captured at the micron and nanoscale. AFM also shows the surface morphology and allows observing the molecular and atomic level features as shown in Fig. 7d.  $R_{\mathrm{a}}$  can also be determined via the surface profilometer and AFM. XPS helps to study the elemental and chemical analysis of graphene. The XPS spectra also help to show the elements present in the graphene and investigate the binding energy between C–C and C–O–C and elements [53].

# 4 Classification of Graphene-Based Materials

Graphene is a very versatile material that can have great variability in terms of chemical structure, production methods modification, number of layers, forms, and production methods which are briefly summarized in Table 1.

# 4.1 Chemical Modification

The structure and production of the GO and rGO are shown in Fig. 8 [54]. Generally, GO is yielded by oxidative treatment of graphite by Hummers [55] and modified Hummers method [56]. The rGO is produced from GO by chemical, thermal, or electrochemical reduction. GO and rGO have the advantages of ease of production and the capability to render its functionalities and have wide applications than pris

Some important properties of graphene GO and rGO are given in Table 2.

# 4.2 Production Methods

Graphene can be classified into five categories according to the production, i.e., CVD processed (CVD-G), mechanically exfoliated graphene (ME-G), solution-processed graphene (S-PG), epitaxial growth (SiC-G), and molecular assembly (MA-G). Their characteristics may vary accordingly as shown in Table 3.

# 4.3 Number of Layers

Graphene film may contain monolayer, bilayer, or multilayer. Single-layer graphene has a thickness of  $0.35 \pm 0.01$  nm [59]. For multilayer graphene, it is generally accepted to be  $< 10$  layers as shown in Fig. 9a, b [6]. Various techniques to study graphene film thickness include Raman scattering, optical contrast, and scanning probe microscopy [60].

# 4.4 Physical Forms

Graphene sheet is single layer to multilayer as shown in Figs. 1 and 9b. Graphene 3D structures can be produced in various forms (flakes, foams, shells, and hierarchical structures) [34]. The images of 3D graphene flakes are shown in Fig. 6a. Graphene, GO, or rGO flakes help to produce composite materials. Planar graphene (2D) can be also produced for lower to high performance devices [4]. The 2D graphene layers having pore size of submillimeter can be built into 3D porous graphene forms [62]. The 3D foam has large surface area, lightweight, good thermal and electronic conductivity, provides pathways for ionic transport, high strength, and stiffness properties.

(b)

Graphene can be reinforced in various composites (e.g., epoxy and polyketone) and metal composites (e.g., Cu, Al, and Ag) [9, 63-66]. Graphene is a conducting material which is atomically thin and flat and can be used for manufacture of energy storage devices [67]. The graphene can be applied in the thin electronic devices of various capacities as the electrodes can be made from 1-2 layer graphene or multilayer rGO.

# 4.5 Chemical Doping on Graphene

Although graphene has outstanding properties for possible applications in engineering and biomedicine due to  $\mathfrak{sp}^2$  carbon atoms, it can be further modified to improve its electronic properties, i.e., doping [68-70]. Fermi level production typically occurs in graphene known as n- or p-type doping (Fig. 10a) [71]. Two methods bonding for doping occurs: substitution of carbon atoms or incorporation of dopants by physical or chemical bond (Fig. 10b) [72].

Doping of nitrogen (N) with graphene is usually n-type doping that occurs by the opening of a bandgap by replacing a carbon atom in the graphene lattice which is used for the application in biosensing [69, 73].

# 4.6 Graphene-Based Nanocomposites

Development of nanocomposites has a long history. Polymer nanocomposites have shown superiority due to the addition of fillers (glass or carbon fibers) [74]. Various graphene-based nanocomposites can be produced with metals (Ag, Zn, Au, Mg, and Ni), nonmetals, and polymers for various applications, including biomedical applications [9, 65, 73, 75]. Important properties of graphene nanocomposites include improved surface properties [3, 64], mechanical properties [64], protective coatings, anticorrosion coatings [76, 77], friction reduction [64], antibacterial applications

[78], biocompatibility [76, 77, 79], etc. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can be decorated on GO to produce GO/Ag nanocomposite (Fig. 11) [47, 79]. The nanocomposite can be used as a coating and an antimicrobial agent [47]. The  $I_{\mathrm{D}} / I_{\mathrm{G}}$  ratio of GO/Ag nanocomposite may be slightly increased due to an increase in the disorder of the GO/Ag matrix [47, 80]. The details of other graphene nanocomposites for various applications are discussed in the later parts.

# 5 Graphene for Dental and Implant Applications

Graphene has useful potentially promising properties for biological applications. In addition, the use of graphene materials in fabricating nanocomposites with different polymers has been explored [3, 9]. The biomedical applications of graphene-based materials include various applications, such as antibacterial, coating material and anticorrosion, friction reduction, drug delivery, and therapeutics (Fig. 12) [76]. Graphene is also considered as an alternative candidate for implant coatings as it is chemically inert and highly durable.

# 5.1 Antibacterial Application

Bacteria and fungi survive in nature by forming biofilms (self-produced polymer matrix consisting of polysaccharide, protein, and extracellular DNA) on surfaces of teeth, prostheses, or implant-anchored restorations [81]. The biofilm formation on dental implants can result in a serious infection leading to its failure.

An implant is a prosthetic device placed in the human body for various purposes, and in dentistry, it is widely used for replacing teeth or aids in the retention of the dental prosthesis [82]. There is always a challenge to produce implant having good osseointegration inhibiting the bacterial colonization to prevent infection, simultaneously [83-85]. Despite long-term survival rates of dental implants, the complications and peri-implant diseases (peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis) are common and, in severe cases, it results in the loss of the implants and their prostheses [86, 87]. Peri-implant mucositis is the inflammation limited to the peri-implant mucosa in the absence of continuing marginal loss following initial bone remodeling. It is reversible through an early intervention and removal of etiology. Peri-implantitis is a pathologic condition characterized by inflammation of soft tissue with further loss of supporting bone exceeding the bone remodeling around the implant, thereby leading to its loss. The peri-implantitis and bone resorption generally start from the implant neck due to the complex environment in this region. The bacterial colonization of implant surfaces is a major cause of peri-implantitis and its failure.

Many materials are known for antimicrobial properties, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), AgNPs, nanodiamond (ND), and graphene-based nanomaterials [88]. Although AgNPs show the antibacterial characteristics, practical applications of

AgNPs are often hampered by their aggregation and subsequent loss of antibacterial activity [88, 89]. In addition, concerns about the cytotoxicity of AgNPs towards human cells have been noticed [90]. Hence, the concentration of AgNPs should be minimal to avoid complications. Therefore, AgNPs can be decorated on GO to produce GO-Ag nanocomposite for increasing antimicrobial activity [47, 53]. AuNPs have been used more on microbial identification rather than antimicrobial applications [91, 92]. In addition, NDs are highly stable in corrosive media, which limits their decomposition or transformation to materials with potential toxicity and decreased activity [88]. Hence, graphene-based materials are biocompatible having strong antimicrobial properties to prevent bacterial colonization [78, 83, 93]. Agarwalla et al. [93] studied the surface and wettability characteristics of graphene coating on titanium (Ti) and their microbial biofilm interaction for Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Graphene was deposited on Ti (Control) via a liquid-free technique and transferred once, repeated twice and five times. They found that repeated twice showed high quality and coverage, and decreased biofilm formation for all species. For the graphene transfer process, wet transfer onto substrates employs hazardous chemicals limiting the clinical applications. A dry transfer technique based on a hot-pressing method allows to coat Ti substrates with high-quality graphene and coverage area  $>90\%$  with a single transfer [83]. The increased hydrophobicity of graphene films was correlated with the decreased biofilm formation for various species. All these findings show that the graphene coatings produced by dry transfer technique on Ti implants is a promising strategy to prevent biofilm formation on implants.

Graphene coatings enhance cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Gu et al. [94] modified the surface of Ti implants and studied the antibacterial and osteoinductive effects of single-layer graphene sheets. CVD-grown single-layer graphene sheets were transferred to Ti disks, followed by a thermal treatment of  $2\mathrm{h}$  at  $160^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to enhance the adhesion strength of graphene. Graphene coatings of Ti enhanced cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation showed antibacterial activity to Ti substrate which was not affected by the thermal treatment. Similarly, another study found that the graphene layer promoted the osteogenesis differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and surface bioactivity [95]. Hence, graphene can be used as a bioactive layer to improve the surface properties of NiTi-based dental and orthopedic implants.

GO can be functionalized to increase antimicrobial activity. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can be decorated on GO to produce GO/Ag nanocomposite for increasing antimicrobial applications (Fig. 11) [47, 53]. The nanocomposite showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [53]. Zhao et al. [58] fabricated gelatin-functionalized GO (Gogel) surface coatings on nitinol substrates. The antimicrobial property and biocompatibility were studied. The Gogel showed the best cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of mouse osteoblastic cell performance. In addition, they found that E. coli was inhibited on Gogel and GO. The bacterial cell membrane failed their integrity and showed the low live/dead ratio of E. coli after incubation on Gogel and GO in fluorescent images. Hence, the GO-based coatings have both antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility.

Chen et al. [96] conducted a study on the interaction between GO and four phytopathogens. They studied the antimicrobial activity of GO against two bacterial pathogens, Xanthomonas campestris pv. undulosa (X. campestris pv. undulosa) and pseudomonas (P. syringae), and two fungal pathogens, Fusarium oxysporum (F. oxysporum) and Fusarium graminearum (F. graminearum) (Fig. 13). They reported that  $90\%$  of the bacteria were killed and  $80\%$  macroconidia germination was suppressed along with cell lysis by the GO.

In addition, Chen et al. [96] proposed a mechanism where GO connects the multiresistant bacterial and fungal spores with GO sheets decreasing the potential of bacterial membrane causing cell lysis and the electrolytes leakage of fungal spores (Fig. 14).

# 5.2 Coating and Anticorrosion

Metallic biomaterials are widely used in joint replacements, dental implants, orthopedic fixations, stents, orthodontic, and endodontic applications [97]. Coating on metal alloys becomes sometimes an important aspect to prevent the release of metal ions such as Ni, Ti, and Ag [97, 98]. Although various polymer composite coatings have been tried on metal alloy especially NiTi, there has always been difficult to make successful coatings [99-111]. The drawbacks of polymers coating include roughness, porosity, nonuniformity, and toxicity of the components [112]. The polymer coating on metal may become rough or detach from the metal surface after long-term use. Although graphene is only one atom thick, it is extremely inert and impermeable to gasses (oxygen) and liquids (water) [4]. The use of graphene as a coating and preventing corrosion has been widely studied and found that it can be used as a corrosion barrier film because it is chemically inert, atomically stable, and highly durable [77, 113-116]. In addition, it can be grown directly on from simple to complex metal surfaces. Graphene coating protects metal (Mg, Zn, Ni, Al, etc.) surfaces from corrosive environments [113, 115, 117]. Singh et al. [118] found that graphene composite coating reduced the corrosion of Cu. The promising potential observed from anticorrosion effects of graphene suggested that it can be used in orthodontics (archwires), endodontics (files and reamers), and prosthodontics (metal prostheses) [75, 77, 113].


Hikku et al. [119] tested the corrosion of graphene/polyvinyl nanocomposite coating for aluminum-2219 alloy (Al-2219). They found that GPVA-coated Al-2219 showed good corrosion property compared to others (corrosion rate for Al-2219 was  $45.25\mathrm{mm}$  year $^{-1}$ , for polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-coated Al-2219 was  $2.576\mathrm{mm}$  year $^{-1}$ ) and graphene-blended polyvinyl alcohol (GPVA)-coated Al-2219 alloy showed  $3.853\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{mm}$  year $^{-1}$  in  $3.5\%$  NaCl solution as shown from Nyquist plot, a Bode plot, and Tafel plot (Fig. 15). In conclusion, based on these findings, it shows that graphene has a promising anticorrosion potential.

Graphene as a coating material has the potential to improve implant surface properties and corrosion reduction [120-122]. Podila et al. [120] grew graphene on Copper via CVD and then transferred onto nitinol implant substrates and studied the effect of graphene coatings on cell adhesion and morphology. They found that the graphene coating on nitinol substrates improved the biological response (cell adhesion, smooth muscle actin expression, and protein adsorption) compared to uncoated nitinol. Thus, graphene-coated nitinol is a viable candidate for a stent material. In addition, surface modification of Ti can enhance the osseointegration of implants. Suo et al. [121] developed homogeneous and crack-free GO/chitosan/hydroxyapatite (GO/CS/HA) composite coating by electrophoretic deposition on Ti substrates. Their results showed that the wettability and bonding strength of the coating were enhanced compared with HA, GO/HA, and CS/HA coatings. Furthermore, the coating greatly increased the cell-material interactions in vitro and enhanced osseointegration in vivo. Hence, the GO/CS/HA-Ti could be a potential alternative in implant dentistry.

$\mathrm{Mg}$  is a promising safe biodegradable implant material, but its corrosion speed and hydrogen gas production need to be controlled for biomedical applications. Catt et al. [117] developed a conducting polymer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) and GO composite coating as a corrosion control layer using electropolymerization. They found that the PEDOT/GO coating significantly reduced the rate of corrosion as evidenced by lower  $\mathrm{Mg}$  ion concentration and  $\mathsf{pH}$  of the corrosion media. In addition, the coating decreased the evolved hydrogen. PEDOT/GO corrosion protection was attributed to three factors: an initial passive layer preventing solution ingress, buildup of negative charges in the film, and formation of corrosion protective  $\mathrm{Mg}$  phosphate layer through redox coupling with  $\mathrm{Mg}$  corrosion. In addition, the coating showed no toxicity to cultured neurons showing the biocompatibility of the coated implants in vitro. These results suggest that PEDOT/GO coating is an effective treatment for controlling corrosion of  $\mathrm{Mg}$ -based medical implants.

GO coating is also a promising material for regenerative dentistry. Zhou et al. [116] evaluated the bioactivity of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) on GO-coated Ti (GO-Ti) substrate in vitro as compared to sodium titanate (Na-Ti) substrate. They found that with GO-Ti substrate, PDLSCs exhibited significantly higher proliferation rate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and upregulated gene expression level of osteogenesis-related markers of collagen type I, ALP, bone sialoprotein (BSP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteocalcin (OCN) compared to Na-Ti substrate. Moreover, GO promoted the protein expression of

BSP, Runx2, and OCN. These findings suggest that the combination of GO and PDLSCs provides a promising construct for regenerative dentistry.

# 5.3 Friction Reduction

There is a role of friction in dentistry and implant dentistry. Friction is a part of the resistance to movement as a bracket slide along an archwire [123]. A considerable amount of force is lost during friction in orthodontic teeth movement [123, 124]. Hence friction reduction becomes often an important part to accelerate the teeth movement in orthodontics.

Various biomaterials have been studied for friction reduction in biomedicine, such as polymers, hydrogel, chitosan derivatives, silicone, protein lubrication, and ZnO NPs [125-127]. But the results show that the friction reduction property is not as expected and coating is not stable, and further research is needed to develop stable coating with good lubricating properties.

The lubrication and friction reduction properties of graphene film coatings have been studied widely and show that they have promising friction reduction properties [49, 128, 129]. One study shows that GO in water improved the lubrication with a friction coefficient of 0.05. Similar results were found by other studies that used graphene coatings [49, 129]. Hence, graphene can help to reduce the friction of various metal-based prostheses [128]. GO/AgNPs coatings can be used as a coating material to reduce friction. Rokaya et al. [64] developed GO/AgNPs coatings on medical-grade NiTi alloy using electrophoretic deposition and studied the mechanical and tribological properties. The coating thickness ranged from 0.46 to  $1.34\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The friction coefficients of the coated NiTi alloy were significantly lower compared with that of the uncoated NiTi alloy. From these studies, it shows that thin film of graphene-based coatings having favorable hardness and Young's modulus helps in friction reduction.

The role of friction in implant dentistry is a clear understanding of the factors influencing secure preload necessary to prevent screw loosening. Bulaqi et al. [130] studied the effect of coefficient of friction and tightening speed on screw tightening. They found that the coefficient of friction is the most influential factor on efficiency. Increasing the tightening speed lowered the response rate to the frictional resistance, thus diminishing the coefficient of friction and slightly increasing the preload. Increasing the tightening speed has the same result as reducing the coefficient of friction. Hence, GO coatings can be used for the reduction of coefficient of friction.

# 5.4 Drug Delivery and Therapeutics

Biomaterials have been used as controlled release reservoirs for drug delivery [131]. Therapeutics drug delivery to bones to treat skeletal diseases or prevent postsurgical infections is challenging due to complex and solid bone structure that limits blood supply and diffusion of therapeutics administered by systemic routes to reach effective concentration. Various materials are used for the drug delivery: polymers in the form of tablets, implants, microspheres, nanoparticles, drug-eluting stents, and polymeric scaffolds to achieve the goal of controlled drug delivery [132], and nanoscale drug delivery systems include nanoparticles, nanocapsules, nanotubes, nanogels, and dendrimers [131]. But the key issue faced by most of the above drug delivery systems are low efficacy and therapeutic profile [133]. Other limitations include suboptimal bioavailability, limited effective targeting, and potential cytotoxicity [131]. Drug delivery systems should be synthesized with controlled composition, shape, size, and morphology and their surface properties should be manipulated to increase solubility, immunocompatibility, and cellular uptake. Hence, graphene-based materials have favorable properties for advanced drug delivery systems and therapeutics as the planar structure of graphene has an excellent capacity to immobilize metals, drugs, biomolecules, probes, and cells [134, 135]. Graphenes have a large surface area and can be easily functionalized which provides opportunities for drug delivery [4, 136]. They can bind to drug molecules and thus form as carriers of small molecules to the desired spot [4, 137]. In addition, it can pass through the membrane barrier as it is lipophilic. In addition, GO-based gene delivery can be achieved through conjugating hybrid gene carrier polyethylenimine (PEI) to GO which improves binding of DNA and condensation and makes efficient transfection (Fig. 16) [138].

Ti and their alloys are employed as mainstream implant materials in dentistry and orthopedics. Recently, Ti drug-releasing implants, with emphasis on nanoengineered Ti nanotubes structures, are developed for solving key problems to improve implants osseointegration, overcome inflammation and infection together with providing localized drug delivery for bone diseases [139]. Graphene may be integrated with Ti nanotubes to bones that can address many disorders and postsurgical condi

GO can be functionalized covalently with chitosan for successful drug delivery and gene therapy. Bao et al. [140] used chitosan with GO (CS-GO) as a nanocarrier to transport a water-insoluble drug and a plasmid DNA (pDNA) into human cancer cell lines efficiently. But further investigations are needed before clinical use. Moreover, GONPs have the potential to exert inhibitory effects on tumor cells [141-143]. GO with amine groups  $(\mathrm{GO - NH_2})$  leads to increased reactivity of the NPs. Krasteva et al. [144] evaluated GO-NH $_2$  as new molecules for the therapy of colorectal cancer. They found that GO-NH $_2$  can result in cytotoxicity effect on cancer cell through the induction of reactive oxygen causing DNA damage and apoptosis.

GO is also an efficient carrier for the delivery of therapeutic proteins [135]. La et al. [135] coated Ti substrates with GO using layer-by-layer assembly of positively charged GO sheets  $(\mathrm{GO - NH_3^+})$  and negatively charged GO sheets  $(\mathrm{GO - COO^{-}})$ . Later, a therapeutic protein (bone morphogenetic protein-2, BMP-2) was loaded on the GO-coated Ti substrate with the coating layer of  $\mathrm{GO - COO^{-}}$ $(\mathrm{Ti / GO^{-}})$ . The GO coating on Ti substrate enabled the loading of large doses and the sustained release of BMP-2 with preservation of the structure and bioactivity of the drug. The extent of in vitro osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells was higher when they are cultured on Ti/GO-carrying BMP-2 than when they are cultured on Ti with BMP-2. Eight weeks after implantation in mouse models of calvarial defects, the Ti/GO-/BMP-2 implants showed more new bone formation compared with Ti, Ti/GO-, or Ti/BMP-2 implants. Hence, GO is an effective carrier for the controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins, such as BMP-2, which promotes osteointegration of orthopedic or dental Ti implants.

Graphene-based materials are also useful in the treatment of cancer. The conventional cancer therapy/chemotherapy has sometimes failed to treat cancer because of lack of targeting capacity, its side effects, or its toxicity. The major challenge is the lack of efficient gene delivery vectors or vehicles and small biomolecules are digested easily in the body [145]. Graphene-based materials (especially GO and rGO) are also promising candidates for cancer therapy [37, 136, 146, 147]. Due to their unique physicochemical and optical properties including the extremely large surface area, modifiable active groups, and strong photothermal effect, they can act either as tunable carriers or as active agents for advanced chemotherapeutics delivery and cancer therapy [136]. In addition, the pH-dependence of GO emission provides the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells, therefore killing the cancer cells [146]. Similarly, gene therapy has become successful in the treatment of genetic disorders and cancer as gene therapy has advantages of high potency with low off-target toxicity, and can treat tumor recurrence and drug resistance [11, 133, 148-152]. Figure 17 shows the gene therapy with the use of transgenes that can produce proteins or convert a compound into a drug after introducing into tumor cells. Therefore, combing photothermal therapy, targeted drug delivery, and chemotherapy would have great potentials for efficient cancer therapy. Graphene

# 6 Conclusion

Although the applications of graphene show several challenges, many attempts have been tried and have shown promising results regarding biofunctionalization and applications. Through the multidisciplinary approach among biomedicine, dentistry, chemistry, and engineering, it may assist the deeper understanding of graphene-based materials bioapplications efficiently.
