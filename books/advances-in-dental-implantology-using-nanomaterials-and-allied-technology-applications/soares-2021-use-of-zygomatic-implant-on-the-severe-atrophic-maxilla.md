# Use of Zygomatic Implant on the Severe Atrophic Maxilla

Marcelo Melo Soares, Andrea Castilho, and Claudia Caminero Soares

Abstract Osseointegrated implants are the most effective tool for rehabilitation of total or partial edentulous patients; however, the presence of bone atrophy is an obstacle for the use of implants. On severely resorbed maxilla the limitations for the installation of conventional implants requires alveolar reconstructive procedures with the use of autogenous bone grafts harvested from iliac intraoral donor sites or autologous bone graft, increasing morbidity and cost of the treatment.

As an alternative to the use of large bone reconstruction, Brænemark in 1984 proposed that the zygoma bone can be used as anchorage for long implants supporting prosthetic rehabilitation. Actually, zygomatic implants are the most effective option to bone grafts on the rehabilitation of edentulous patients with severe resorbed maxilla.

Despite the high rate of success of zygomatic implants for edentulous patients, their indication on partial edentulous has been restricted to hemimaxillectomized patients. In this chapter we will discuss the importance of virtual planning to correctly disseminate the masticatory forces on these implants and the importance in technology as a fundamental factor of treatment success.

# 1 Introduction

Dental implants have revolutionized the rehabilitation of the masticatory function in edentulous patients, providing a predictable, functional, and esthetic alternative to conventional dentures. However, long-term edentulism, with severe bone loss and sinus pneumatization, leads to significant reduction in bone anchorage [1, 2]. Trauma, craniofacial deformities, or ablative surgery sequelae may reduce the amount of bone available, resulting in bone discontinuity and compromise the quality and quantity of the remaining soft tissue available for graft coverage [3-6]. The insufficient height and width of the alveolar ridge at the implant site in the severely atrophied maxilla constitutes a therapeutic challenge for surgeons, requiring advanced reconstructive alveolar surgery, increasing costs and morbidity [4, 7-9].

The original purpose of zygomatic implants (ZI) was the rehabilitation of patients with congenital deformities who underwent ablative surgery like maxillectomy tumor resection [10]. The severely atrophic maxilla shows less or no alveolar bone for implant anchorage, poor vascularization, and insufficient soft tissue for the coverage of grafts. The challenges faced by the surgeons in the rehabilitation of these patients are similar to those of maxillectomy patients [4, 9, 11]. Brænemark expanded the indications for zygomatic implants (ZI) and introduced ZI as an alternative system to overcome the problems associated with the rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla [1, 10, 12].

Although the planning and execution of ZIs is more complex than that of conventional implants, the functional and esthetic results are very gratifying, with a success rate of  $96 - 98\%$  and a low rate of complications, making ZIs a reliable alternative for the rehabilitation of the complex severely atrophic maxilla [13-17].

# 2 Indications

The success of any bone graft is dependent on the quality of the soft tissue cover, graft stability, the osteogenic potential of the recipient bed, and the grafted material. A favorable flap placement and graft stabilization is achievable in the maxilla because it is fixed bone and has excellent vascularization. However local inflammatory factors such as chronic periodontitis, recurrent infections, traumatic surgeries, and previous graft failures may compromise flap mobility and dramatically reduce maxillary vascularization, compromising the success of reconstructive bone grafting procedures [5, 13, 15, 18]. The Schneider membrane is highly vascular and has high osteogenic potential, being one of the best graft receptor beds in the face, and one of the factors for the high success rate of sinus lift procedures. However factors such as age, systemic or sinus diseases, smoking, and others reduce this capacity of the sinus membrane, leading to extensive resorption of the sinus grafts [2, 9]. The primary indication for ZIs is cases where the prognosis of the grafts is poor or where contraindications to conventional reconstructive surgery exist [4, 14, 19].

ZIs may also be an alternative to grafting procedures by facilitating immediate loading, reducing the rehabilitation time, necessitating a less invasive surgery compared with autogenous bone graftings by eliminating the donor bed, reducing the total cost of treatment as it can be performed in a single procedure, and eliminating bio-material or extraoral graft removal costs [6, 7, 14, 20, 21].

ZIs indicated in elderly patients not only for the poor prognosis of grafts in this age group but also due to the use of artificial gums as a tool to correct the high bone loss, resulting in a more acceptable prosthesis [6, 16, 17, 22]. The palatinized head position of the ZIs at the first protocols resulted in the adoption of ZIs as a last resort in patients with advanced atrophy of the maxilla. However, the high success rate and the polarization of the position of the implant head over the intrasinus insertion of the implant body according to the concept of prosthetic reverse planning [23, 24] have led more and more surgeons and patients to choose ZI modality over maxillary grafting for fixed prosthetic rehabilitation (Fig. 1).

# 2.1 Contraindications

ZIs are contraindicated in patients with chronic maxillary sinus diseases, malar bone defects or malformations, patients with irradiated head and neck (with doses over 70 Gy), patients on immunosuppressants, immunodeficient patients, and patients with psychiatric problems and uncontrolled diabetics.

The relative contraindications for ZIs are young patients, presence of oroantral communications, partial edentulism, pregnancy or lactation, and severe uncontrolled periodontal disease.

# 3 Biomechanics of Zygomatic Implants

Although ZIs have long screws, only one-third of the implant body is in contact with bone, so proper selection and placement of the implant is essential for successful

The surgical technique influences the bone-implant contact with the extramaxillary exhibiting higher bone-implant contact area compared with the intra sinus approach [29, 30]. Axial loads are favorable for conventional implants with limitations to the lateral and rotational (momentum) loads [26, 31]. ZI shows a unique load distribution, because it is an inclined implant and the occlusal stresses are not borne significantly by the alveolar crest. Mathematical models demonstrate that the vertical and axial loads are lesser in ZIs because the load is transmitted in several directions due to the three-dimensional angulation of the implants [26].

The occlusal load is distributed through the infrazygomatic crest and divided into the frontal and temporal processes of zygomatic bone, with a stress concentration along zygomatic-maxillary suture, similar to the stress load distribution in the edentulous jaw. Stress under lateral loads, is generated at the connection of fixture and abutment, showing possible marginal bone loss around the head of the implant and components failures. To prevent rotational loads the ZIs must be connected to conventional (or zygomatic) implants as anterior as possible and a contralateral zygomatic (or conventional) implant nullifying twist and reducing load under the fixture-abutment joint [25, 32].

# 3.1 Finite Element Analyses (FEA)

FEA shows that stresses due to occlusal forces are mainly withstood by zygomatic bone, being transferred through the infrazygomatic crest and divided into the frontal and temporal processes of zygomatic bone in two directions. Since Stress under the zygomatic-maxillary suture was also reported, it is reasonable to conclude that height stress also occurs in vivo. The stress in the implant model is generated at the center of the implants and into the joint of the fixture-abutment connection. Vertical and lateral loads are not favorable from a biomechanical perspective because though the angulation and three-dimensional space distribution of the zygomatic and conventional implants theoretically prevent rotational loads by load-stress dissipation in several directions, they cannot avoid fixture-abutment stress under lateral load [25, 31].

Despite the versatility and reproducibility of FEA for the evaluation of forces on biological models, the majority of FEA studies on ZIs use homogenous models. When pre-load stress is considered, the forces under the fixture-abutment connection are reduced, showing that more detailed models are needed for a better simulation as this is a critical point for force concentrations and failures [33].

FEA of the bridge (Fig. 2) shows that the magnitude of stress support is not increased by the presence of bone at the alveolar ridge, regardless of the direction of the load, being more than two times of occlusal forces, when no alveolar bone is present on the head of the implant. Thus, it shows that although the presence of alveolar bone anchorage is beneficial for force distribution, the crestal position of the head is more important for the bridge force dissipation than the palatal position [34] because stress is more gradually redistributed over the maxillary sinus and cranial structures by the extra-sinus approach [25].

In FEA studies anterior conventional implants reduce the stress generated on the body of the ZIs. ZI shows superior results in FEA when compared to all-on-4 techniques. There is no stress load in the alveolar processes of anterior implants when associated with ZIs. All-on-4 fixed dentures have no bone safety margin with significant reduction of stress values in posterior alveolar bone, but increase in stress on anterior alveolar bone. The stress value for ZIs is around  $30\%$  [11, 33, 35].

# 4 Surgical Technique

The technique of ZIs has evolved since it was introduced by Brænemark in 1998. Several modifications were introduced in order to improve implant head position, increase bone anchorage, reduce morbidity, or consider anatomical variations in the atrophic maxilla. We will describe the most significant modifications of the original technique.

# 4.1 The Zygoma Implant Set

The zygoma set is very similar to the conventional  $4.1\mathrm{mm}$  implant set, with similar drill sequences, implant driver, cover screw and healing screw drivers, measurements of deeper gauge, zygoma retractor, lip commissure protector, assembler piece, adapter for drills, and a handpiece for manual implant insertion. Some implant sets also provide a very useful drill with lateral diamond cut surface for the opening of the antrostomy slot, resulting in a faster and safer procedure. All drills and instruments are adapted to the size and anatomy of zygoma.

The length of the drills and the angulation required to reach the zygoma have to be considered at the clinical evaluation, as the presence of mandibular teeth or prosthesis, mouth opening restrictions, etc. are the factors that may influence on the ease of the drilling process.

Although most sets are very basic, few sets offer an option of shorter and longer length of drills and options that can be useful for the adjustment of the implant position and variations according to jaw size. Based on this, some customization of the set may be helpful. Working with multiple sets will provide more than one standard drill size; the drills and deeper measurements gauge can offer more versatility on the first drilling and allows measurements on initial perforations.

Retractors are essential for proper surgical field visualization. The mouth opener used by orthodontists for appliance installation can provide an excellent general mouth view which can be improved by the utilization of a reverse Langenbeck retractor usually used for Le Fort I osteotomy, or a laster retractor, developed for the visualization of maxillary third molars. This will provide an excellent visualization of all the anatomic landmarks necessary for ZI installation (Fig. 3).

# 4.2 Classical Zygomatic Approach

The classical approach consists of a molar-to-molar palatal incision. A flap is reflected exposing the palatal and crestal bone. The detachment of the mucosal flap involves the exposure of the piriform rim with detachment of the nasal mucosa, the exposure of the anterior wall of the maxilla, the pterygoid buttress towards the zygomatic bone, with the infraorbital nerve and the zygomatic body and arch into the zygomatic malar suture, providing a complete exposure of the anterior maxillary and zygomatic structures. Using a round bur a large window is opened in the anterior wall of the maxilla in order to access the sinus. The Schneiderian membrane is reflected creating an accessory cavity inside the maxillary sinus for implant drilling. The zygoma base is drilled while protecting the membrane and the implant body is inserted into the maxillary sinus [1, 7, 10] (Fig. 4).


# 4.3 Sinus Slot Approach

The sinus slot technique was proposed by Stella and Warner and consists of a molar-to-molar crestal incision with a bilateral posterior vertical releasing incision. The palatal mucosa is exposed just enough to expose the crest and bur position. The flap is reflected from the base of piriform rim up to the inferior aspect of the infraorbital nerve and zygomatic buttress and half of the body of zygoma.

A perforation through an alveolar bone in the direction of the zygoma body is made with a fissure or a Lindemann bur, on the position planned for the implants head after a depth gauge is placed on the hole. The path of the implant is simulated and the superior point is marked. A second bur is then used to prepare a small window (slot) connecting the alveolar ridge (or the implant head), through the sinus, with the base of zygoma. The slot produces a small antrostomy that allows the reflection of Schneiderian membrane, allowing safe drilling for the implant and proper irrigation on the top of the drill [23, 24] (Fig. 5).


# 4.4 Extramaxillary Approach

The extramaxillary approach consisted of a supra crestal incision similar to the one described by Stella, allowing the visualization of the maxillary anatomical structures and zygoma bases. A spherical or a Lindemann bur is used to perforate the alveolar crest, emerging on the vestibular face of alveolar ridge, drilling until the base of the zygoma body. The drilling osteotomy is progressively widened according to the zygomatic implant protocol. No antrostomy is performed on the extramaxillary approach [30] (Fig. 6).

In majority of cases, the decision of a slot or extramaxillary technique is related to the anatomy of maxilla and zygoma, because severe atrophy results in the palatal dislocation intensifying the zygomatic buttress curvature. An extramaxillary approach is preferred in such cases to obtain a better implant head position. On the other hand, in the cases with smooth maxillary zygomatic curvature, the implant path may require a slot for membrane protection, drilling visualization and irrigation.

# 4.5 Minimally Invasive Approach

Several authors refer to the use of guided surgery as minimally invasive surgery. However, the incision, reflection, and drilling are exactly the same as the conventional approach, the only one difference being the use of a guide cast in order to orient the drill direction. The concept of minimally invasive procedure relies on the significant reduction in the surgical manipulation of the tissues, improving the efficiency of the surgical technique. Arthroscopy is a good example of minimal invasive procedure for the manipulation of soft tissues around a joint, improving the efficiency of the procedure and reducing morbidity. Because the extramaxillary technique does not prioritize the need for palatal anchorage, the visualization of the alveolar crest is not essential for ZI insertion and its success. Hence the incision can be shortened and displaced to the vestibular mucosa without compromising the final result.

In the minimally invasive approach, a small incision  $(2 - 4\mathrm{cm})$  is made on the jugal mucosa close to the buccal fornix, the maxillary fossa, and zygomatic buttress, and a tunnel is prepared from the alveolar crest to the inferior half of the zygoma body. After the flap reflection, a spherical or a Lindemann bur is used transmucosally, from the planned implant head position, towards the base of the zygoma through the alveolar bone. If necessary, a slot is opened; however, if the drill path passes outside of the sinus, no antrostomy is necessary, resulting in an extramaxillary implant (Fig. 7).

After the determination of the implant entry point on the zygoma base, the implant site is prepared by a widening drill sequence and the implant is inserted through the trans mucosal approach into the drilled path. Despite the excellent visualization provided by the classic approach, it requires an excessive denudation of maxillary bone, with reflection of the vestibular sinusal and palatal mucosa which may compromise the bone vascularization, leading to bone resorption, infection, increasing surgery time, and swelling.

All of the other approaches provide proper visualization of the surgical field. However, the minimally invasive approach allows minimal reflection preserving soft tissues and vascularization. Despite the advantages of soft tissue preservation, namely reduction of pain and swelling, the major advantage of the minimally invasive approach is the preservation of the keratinized gingiva essential for the long-term survival of conventional implants due to the protection of attached gingiva and reduction of peri-implantitis. This factor contributes to the success of ZIs by reducing bleeding and discomfort, and possibly reducing sinus infection, frequent complaints related to ZIs.

Although there are advantages of the minimally invasive approach, it requires a large learning curve for the technique, and demands a profound knowledge of anatomy. Hence it is recommended only for experienced surgeons [36].

# 4.6 Implant Head Position

Branemark originally proposed that ZIs should be placed from a palatal alveolar bone position into the zygomatic bone via the maxillary sinus. The palatal approach was supposed to increase implant stability since the implants would be anchored on four bone cortices. Although bone anchorage is crucial for implant survival, other factors must also be considered. The palatinization of ZIs produces a huge volume of the prosthesis, making maintenance of oral hygiene harder, an important factor for the increase of peri-implantitis around ZIs [20, 30, 34]. This results in tongue obstruction, interfering with deglutition and speech. The palatal volume is also an obstruction for the tongue interfering with the speech of some patients. This can be critical in patients with cleft and cancer deformities who already have speech problems.

Stella et al. [24] compared the prostheses in ZIs with the head positioned on the alveolar ridge and on palatal bone, and concluded that the results were superior in the implants positioned on the alveolar ridge. Based on their results, the authors proposed a modification of the original technique, consisting of the insertion of the implants based on the best prosthetic position resulting in an extramaxillary path for the zygomatic insertion of the implant instead of depending on the palatal bone anchor.

The extra sinus technique shows the advantages of improvement in the implant path visualizations and reduction in the frequency of sinus invasion by antrostomy, with a significant reduction in the sinus infection [30, 36, 37].

# 4.7 Drill Sequence

There are several sets for ZI technique; however, all ZI sets basically follow the instrumentation for the conventional  $4.1\mathrm{mm}$  implants. Obviously, the length of the drills and measurement gauges are adjusted to the alveolar crest/zygoma distances, being longer than conventional implant drills. The first drilling is performed with a perforation drill which is spherical in shape. The perforation drill (a Lindemann or similar can also be used) is used to cross alveolar bone and mark the entry point for the sequential drilling on zygoma.

If the antrostomy drill is available, the blind top is inserted in the zygomatic perforations and a slot is opened with the lateral cutting surface on the maxillary lateral wall. If the set does not provide a specific drill, a spherical or egg drill can be used in order to create the antrostomy and reflect the sinus membrane. After the protection of the sinus membrane (in the intra sinus approach), the drill sequences (drills of 2.3, 2.8 mm, pilot and 3.5 mm) are used in order to widen the implant path perforation.

A crucial challenge of the ZI drilling is irrigation because automatic irrigation is not enough. The cisterns are designed to irrigate the top of the conventional drills but are unable to reach the longer zygomatic drills. In order to achieve proper irrigation, two systems are needed: the conventional mechanical irrigation provided by the drilling system for the crestal area and a manual (with a  $20\mathrm{ml}$  syringe and saline solution) irrigation for the top of the drill.

ZIs can be easily installed with the use of the driller. Due to the high torque provided by the dense zygomatic bone, we recommend the hand approach, at least for the final screwing of the implant. The length of the implants range from 30 to  $55\mathrm{mm}$  (may vary according to the manufacturer). The most common implant lengths are 35 to  $45\mathrm{mm}$  for posterior position and 45 to  $47.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the case of all-on-4 for anterior position [32].

The size selection will vary according to several factors, like ethnic characteristics, patient's size, severity of the atrophy, implant emergence position, and technique adopted (intra or extra sinusal path).

# 4.8 Postoperative Care

ZIs should preferably receive immediate loading. Patients operated in primary care settings may have to wait for dehospitalization for casting; however, they can be immediately rehabilitated with the provisional fixed acrylic prosthesis. However, metal frameworks (titanium or zirconia) with acrylic teeth may need an extra day for their fabrication in the laboratory but provide a much superior load distribution, reducing bending and twisting forces. After 3-6 months ceramic teeth can be delivered [32].

Immediate loading does not mean immediate stomatognathic functional rehabilitation. Consumption of hard food, speech, muscle and articular proprioception will time for adjust and adapt to the new oral situation. Several factors like atrophy, presurgical prosthesis quality, previous temporomandibular joint or muscle problems, and surgical techniques exclude important factors and use will influence on time needed for the prosthetic reestablishment, physiotherapy, and speech therapy in some patients.

Teeth extraction or alveolar ridge incisions are followed by soft tissue changes in the osseointegration period, causing air escape or food retention, and will require adjustments of the prosthesis. On the other hand, the minimally invasive approach will reduce the soft tissue accommodation, as the incision and reflection is not in the prosthetic area, reducing the postoperative revisions.

ZIs can be placed by a variety of approaches, all with similar success rates ranging from  $95\%$  to  $100\%$ . A systematic review of 68 studies found a 12 year implant-level cumulative survival rate of  $95.21\%$ , which is close to that of conventional implants [4, 7, 17, 21].

# 5 Complex Cases

ZIs are a valid alternative rehabilitation of edentulous patients with an atrophic maxilla, showing good and predictable results. These results and the experience with maxillectomized patients encourage us in the use of ZIs for complex cases with similar problems or partial edentulism.

# 5.1 Orosinusal Communications and Zygomatic Implants

Orosinusal communications are surgical sequelae that can occur as a result of ablative procedures or iatrogenic complications. Posterior teeth extraction is the most common cause of orosinusal fistulas. However sinus lift procedures and sinus implant intrusions are recently emerging as orosinusal fistula causes.

Orosinusal fistulas may cause inflammation and infections of the craniomaxillary sinus via oral contamination with the formation of granulation tissue and polyps of the sinus membranes. Fistulas smaller than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  may close spontaneously, but fistulas larger than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  require surgical procedures in order to close the orosinusal communication. These are complex cases for rehabilitation as the bone defect caused by the fistula, and loss of the Schneiderian membrane makes bone graft a very unpredictable procedure. Since the use of ZI is well documented for the rehabilitation of maxillectomized patients [22, 38], with predictable long-term results, it is a valid alternative for the rehabilitation of complex partial maxillary edentulism, sometimes with sequelae to those of ablative surgery, but without the comorbidities of the patients with cancer (Fig. 8).

The surgical approach for the ZI must be individualized. In cases where there is no alveolar bone, the presence of fibrous tissues due to previous procedures and the need for flap closures with proper vascularization hinder the zygomatic approach and visualization. The minimally invasive approach with a short incision and dissection through the soft tissue into the base of zygomatic bone is the best option for reducing the risk of creating a new fistula. Reinforcement of the flap with Bichat fat pad and the protection of the soft tissue with platelets rich plasma are recommended in such cases.

# 5.2 Orthognathic Surgery and Zygoma Implants

Although excellent results are reported for ZIsin hypoplastic maxillae, this approach is not able to correct the maxillary skeletal discrepancy and the relationship of the upper and lower arches remains unfavorable to bite force distributions. The rehabilitation of these patients requires prosthetic compensation, generating an anterior cantilever that can lead to failure of the implant or framework [39].

The Le Fort I osteotomy procedure is routinely used to correct maxillomandibular discrepancies. Chiapasco [3] described the use of Le Fort I osteotomies and bone graft to correct maxillary hypoplasia in edentulous patients encouraging several surgeons to perform Le fort I osteotomies with bone grafts for the advancement of the atrophic maxilla.

In order to improve the prognosis and reduce morbidity in the rehabilitation of the severe atrophied maxilla, we adopted the strategy of Le Fort I maxillary reposition with simultaneous ZIs. We planned immediate loading of the ZIs [17] with a rehabilitation period of 3-4 days.

The operation was performed under general anesthesia with nasal endotracheal intubation and local infiltration with xylocaine with epinephrine. The incision was made from the right to the left second bicuspid, and a mucoperiosteal flap was elevated to expose the maxilla and malar prominence. A Le Fort I osteotomy was performed using the piezo surgery device, and the nasal septum and pterygopalatine plate were osteotomized with the septum and curve chisel, respectively. After the osteotomies, the down fracture was gently performed and the maxilla was fixed on the multifunctional guide by screws, and repositioned according to the surgical planning. The anterior plates (Lindorf plates) were fixed on the piriform buttress. With the anterior maxilla properly fixed by miniplates, the intermaxillary fixation was released and the ZIs were installed on the right and left sides. The intermaxillary fixations were done again and the posterior plates, when necessary, were positioned on the zygomatic buttress. The surgical guide is used for reference in the maxillary advancement as well as the guide for the positioning of the implant casting.

The anterior implants (conventional or zygomatic) were installed, and minipillars (abutments) were screwed on the implants for casting. The intermaxillary fixation was released and the surgical wounds sutured by polyglactin 4-0. On the day after the surgery, (add impressions were taken and) the implants were cast at the dental office for prosthodontic finalization. After 24-36 hours the prosthesis was installed (Fig. 9).

# 6 Conclusion

ZIs require a long learning curve; however, their results, predictability and versatility for ordinary as well as complex maxillary atrophy cases, makes an important tool in the techniques available to the surgeon.
