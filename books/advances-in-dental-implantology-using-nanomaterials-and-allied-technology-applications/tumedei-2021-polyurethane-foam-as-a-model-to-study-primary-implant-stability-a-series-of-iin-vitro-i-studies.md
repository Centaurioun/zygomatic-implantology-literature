# Polyurethane Foam as a Model to Study Primary Implant Stability: A Series of In Vitro Studies

Margherita Tumedei, Luca Comuzzi, Morena Petrini, Adriano Piattelli, and Giovanna Iezzi

Abstract Primary stability of dental implants is defined as the absence of movement of an implant after surgical insertion. Primary stability is influenced by bone density, bone quality, surgical technique, and implant body geometry. A direct relationship seemed to exist between implant primary stability and bone density. So far, several nondestructive methods have been suggested to evaluate implant stability, such as insertion torque measurement (IT) and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). IT measures the compression induced by implant placement into the surgical site and it determines the primary implant stability, which is considered the most important factor for successful implant treatment. The ISQ values, obtained through the RFA, reflect the micromobility of the implant, which is in turn determined by factors such as bone density, surgical technique, implant design, and healing time. Polyurethane foam has been proposed for in vitro tests to simulate the consistency and the density of the bone. These rigid blocks have been produced as an alternative test medium to human cancellous bone. This material displays mechanical properties in the range of human cancellous bone as described by the ASTM (American Society Testing Materials) F-1839-08 2012 standard. Its features make it an ideal material for comparative testing of different implant materials. The physical features of polyurethane are homogenous throughout their volume, so as to obtain a good standardization of the procedures with the exclusion, then, of factors inherent to anatomical and structural differences of bone. Polyurethane blocks of different densities have been used, e.g., to evaluate the primary stability of different types of implants (cylindrical vs. conical implants), different lengths (short implants vs. standard length implants), and different diameters (narrow, regular, and wide implants).

# 1 Introduction

Primary dental implant stability (PS) is the absence of implant micromotion immediately after placement, and it has been reported to play a relevant role in osseointegration [1-3]. PS is closely related to the bone quality and quantity, to the implant macrodesign, to the implant length and implant diameter, to the surgery, and to the implant fitting into the site [1-5]. There is also a correlation between bone density and the amount of the bone-to-implant contact (BIC) [1], and between BIC and PS [2]. There are several different techniques to measure bone: Insertion Torque (IT), Removal Torque (RT), and Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA); this latter technique produces a value called the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) [6]. Polyurethane foam has been used, since a few years, as a standard material for instrument testing according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM F-1839-08) [7]. Polyurethane foam has been extensively used as an alternative material to animal and human cadaver bone for biomechanical tests evaluating, e.g., dental implants, because it shows consistent mechanical characteristics, has features quite similar to bone tissue, is very reliable, easy to use, and does not require a special handling [6, 8, 9]. Moreover, it has constant mechanical characteristics, and it can be used for comparative testing of different types of implants. The structure of polyurethane is homogenous, and with this material it is possible to standardize the study procedures, eliminating the anatomical and structural differences present in animal or human cadaver bone [2, 3]. Different types of solid rigid polyurethane  $120\mathrm{mm}\times 170\mathrm{mm}\times 31\mathrm{mm}$  foam blocks (SawBones H, Pacific Research Laboratories Inc., Vashon, Washington) with homogeneous densities are present in the market. The densities of polyurethane foam that we have used vary from 10 PCF (pounds per cubic foot) to 20 and 30 PCF. To all these blocks, a  $1\mathrm{mm}$  thin layer of 30 PCF can be added, to simulate cortical bone (Fig. 1).

Bone density during insertion of the implants plays a determinant role in the primary stability of dental implants [5, 6], and it could be, then, necessary to try to understand, in a deeper way, the correlations between bone density and primary implant stability so to be able to plan an implant treatment in a proper way [6]. To get mineralized tissues at the interface with the implants there is an absolute need to obtain a primary implant stability, i.e., the initial biomechanical engagement and interlocking between bone and implant must be strong enough to not allow any relative micromovements between these two structures immediately after implant insertion [2-4, 8]. Poor bone density has a negative influence on primary stability [2, 8, 9]. Higher bone quality, on the other hand, has been found to be closely correlated with a higher primary implant stability [1, 3]. The main factors influencing primary stability are, then, the percentage of bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and the compressive stresses at the implant-bone interface [2]. Higher stability values were described in denser bone compared to softer bone [3]. Primary stability is, moreover, related, besides bone quantity and bone quality, to implant macrogeometry and macrodesign (length and diameter) and to the surgery used to prepare the implant insertion sites [1]. A low primary stability has been correlated with a higher risk of implant failure and loss, while, on the contrary, better conditions for the formation of mineralized tissues at the bone-implant interface are realized when there is a high primary stability [1]. Moreover, it must also be stressed that a high level of primary stability is associated, in a positive way, also with secondary implant stability [1]. It is, then, extremely important to be able to assess, in an accurate way, the primary stability of the implants [1]. We have already said that so far, several noninvasive methods have been suggested to evaluate implant stability, such as insertion torque measurement (IT) and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). IT measures the compression produced by the implant during its insertion into the site [9] and is closely correlated to the primary implant stability. RFA is used to follow the progression of implant osseointegration over time.

In the last year, we have performed several in vitro studies, using polyurethane foam, to make an evaluation of the primary implant stability using implants of different lengths, different diameters, and different macrodesigns.

In the following sections, we will report the most relevant features and conclusions of the most important and interesting studies performed.

# 2 Short (SI) vs. Standard Length (SL) Cone Morse Connection Implants

Short implants (SI) (with a length of less than  $8\mathrm{mm}$ ) have been used especially in atrophic alveolar ridges of the posterior jaws [10-12] (Fig. 2).

With SI there is no need of maxillary sinus augmentation procedures, zygomatic implants, guided bone regeneration procedures, onlay grafts, inlay grafts, distraction osteogenesis, and lateralization of the inferior alveolar nerve with no increased morbidity, higher costs, and higher risks of complications [13-18].

Systematic reviews followed by meta-analyses have shown a similar survival of short and standard length implants, no differences in marginal bone loss (MBL), lower biological complications in SI, good primary stability in SI, but higher mechanical complications in SI [13-18] (Fig. 3).

In the past few years, implants with a reduced length (4, 5, and  $6\mathrm{mm}$ ) (Ultrashort or Extrashort Implants) have been used [11, 19] (Fig. 4).

There are also implants with a still reduced length (2.5/3.5 mm) (NanoShort Implants) [20]. SI with a Cone Morse connection and a conical shape (Test Implants: Test Implant A—diameter 5.5 mm and length 6 mm) (Test Implant B—diameter 5.5 mm and length 5 mm) were used for the present in vitro investigation (Fig. 5).

Implants (4 mm diameter and 10 mm length) with a Cone Morse connection and a conical shape were used as Control Implant A and as Control Implants B (Fig. 6).

The conclusions of the present in vitro study, using polyurethane foam sheets, were:

- Implants with a conical shape presented a high stability even in blocks with a low density (10 PCF).  
- No differences were found between 5 and  $6\mathrm{mm}$  long implants.  
- Very good values of insertion torque and pull-out tests were found in Short Implants in both polyurethane densities.  
- The ISQ values of both Short Implants were very high, with a very good clinical sensation of high stability of the implants.  
- SL presented slightly lower values of insertion torque and pull-out torque.  
- SL presented very high ISQ values.

In conclusion, when comparing SI and SL, SI had a similar if not better performance in low-quality polyurethane foam blocks (10-20 PCF), corresponding to D3 and D4 bone (Fig. 7).

# 2.1 Primary Stability of Dental Implants in Low-Density (10 and 20 PCF) Polyurethane Foam Blocks: Conical vs. Cylindrical Implants

The implant macrodesign, conical or cylindrical, has been reported to play a key role in the implant performance and stability. Implants (4 mm diameter and 10 mm length) with a Cone Morse connection and a conical shape were used as Test Implants. A cylindrical screw-shaped implant was used as Control Implant: 13 mm length, diameter of the platform 4.1 mm, and body diameter 3.75 (Fig. 8).

In Test implants, the insertion torque was quite low in the 10 PCF blocks (16-28 N cm). Better results were found in the 20 PCF blocks, with a very good stability of the implants. The pull-out values for Test Implants were slightly lower than the insertion torque values. High ISQ values were found in Test Implants (57-80 N cm). Control implants, on the other hand, presented very low insertion torque values (6-12 N cm) in both polyurethane densities (10 and 20 PCF). Also the pull-out values were very low (5-10 N cm). Furthermore, the ISQ values were in the very low range (10-37).

The conclusions of the present study were as follows: implants with a conical shape performed much better, in low-density polyurethane foam blocks, than implants with a cylindrical shape. Cylindrical implants, for the shape and pitch of their threads, are, probably, not indicated in low-quality bone density, such as in the posterior areas of the jaws.

# 3 Insertion Torque (IT), Pull-Out Torque Values, and Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) in NanoShort (2.5/3.5 mm Length) Implants

A marked reduction in the implant length of implants has been reported in recent years, with the use of Extrashort and Ultrashort implants (5-6 mm length) [10-12, 19]. These implants seemed to be able to osseointegrate and to be functionally loaded [19]. Also NanoShort implants with a still reduced implant length (2.5/3.5 mm length) are available in the market. Systematic reviews followed by meta-analyses reported that Short Implants (SI) could be a suitable alternative when compared to more invasive procedures used to treat atrophy of the posterior jaws [10, 12-19] (Fig. 9).

NanoShort implants presented a good primary stability in 20 and 30 PCF densities. They can, then, be used in the posterior regions of the mandible, where the bone quality is good and is similar to 30 PCF polyurethane. Values of PCF 10-20, on the contrary, are comparable to D3 bone type. The present study showed that NanoShort Implants could reach a good stabilization (Fig. 10).

In the case of the NanoShort Implants used in the present study, probably a conical shape would have been better than a cylindrical design, and also a different pitch

In conclusion, NanoShort Implants, evaluated in the present study, showed a good primary stability and could, probably, be used in posterior jaws atrophy, instead of a more complicated vertical ridge augmentation (Fig. 11).

# 4 Effects of a Self-condenser Dental Implant on Insertion and Pull-Out Torque Values

The dental implant self-condensing design used in this in vitro study showed a high level of stability in all experimental conditions, and could represent a useful tool for a one-stage surgical approach in the presence of limited residual native bone in alternative to a delayed approach (Fig. 12).

# 5 Discussion and Conclusions

The primary stability of the implant, the bone tissue quantity and quality, the implant macro- and microdesign, and the surface characteristics are all necessary factors for the successful osseointegration of implants. Achieving and maintaining adequate implant stability are key prerequisites for the long-term outcome of osseointegrated implants. Primary stability is mechanical stability in the bone tissue after dental implant placement with an absence of mobility of the implant. Primary stability derives from the mechanical engagement of the device with the cortical bone. This interface is determined by the surgical technique and by the size of the implant (length and diameter, design and macrotopography). Bone density has been reported to be a critical factor for implant primary stability. It has been classified into four different categories, based on the perception of the subjective operator during osteotomy perforation (D1 is the hardest and D4 the softest). Different geometries of the implant shape threads have been proposed to improve the primary stability in different densities of bone [21, 22]. Obtaining primary stability, after placement of dental implants in the posterior maxilla, represents a critical factor due to the poor bone density of this anatomical region, especially for an immediate functional loading protocol [23-26]. Maximum torque of the implant placement provided the rotational stability of the implant.

In conclusion:

- The use of artificial bone substitutes is useful to eliminate the interspecies bone qualities.  
- High values of insertion torque, resonance frequency analysis, and removal torque indicated good stability of the implants.  
- Implants placed in dense bone presented a higher primary stability.  
- The thickness of the cortical layer increased the resonance frequency analysis values.  
- Tapered implants presented an increased primary stability.  
- Short implants performed in an equal, if not better fashion, than standard implants.  
- There is a positive association between primary stability and bone density.
