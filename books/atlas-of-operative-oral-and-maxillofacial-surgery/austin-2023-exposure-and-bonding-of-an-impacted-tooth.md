A method of facilitating the eruption of severely impacted and/or malpositioned teeth with orthodontic guidance.

# Indications

1. Appropriate arch length to accommodate the impacted tooth within the alveolar arch  
2. Appropriate interdental space for the incorporation of the impacted tooth within the alveolus  
3. Erupted or impacted tooth on the contralateral side of the arch to provide appropriate symmetry  
4. Appropriately developed impacted tooth with no associated malformations or pathology

# Contraindications

1. When repositioning impacted teeth will create a structural weakness in the roots of adjacent teeth  
2. When other structures (i.e., adjacent roots, supernumerary teeth and odontomas) are in the path of the anticipated distraction vector  
3. Impacted teeth that appear malformed or associated with pathology

# Closed Technique

1. Local anesthesia is administered in the form of blocks and infiltration. Subperiosteal injection into the area of the anticipated mucoperiosteal flap will hydrodissect the tissue and aid in hemostatic flap reflection.  
2. Primary teeth in the path of distraction and/or functioning as a space maintainer are extracted.  
3. A crestal incision is created within the area of the edentulous space or extraction site of the retained deciduous tooth. Incisions are designed to bisect the attached tissue overlying the alveolar ridge. This will allow the impacted tooth to be distracted through keratinized tissue and will lead to optimal periodontium supporting the tooth.

4. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is raised, with or without distal releasing incisions depending on the access needed to locate the impacted tooth (see Figure 2.5 in Case Report 2.1 and Figure 2.14 in Case Report 2.2).  
5. The impacted tooth is frequently identified as an area with a bulge and/or by the identification of the dental follicle. Thin superficial bone overlying the impacted tooth can be removed with a periosteal elevator (see Figure 2.14 in Case Report 2.2). If significant bone removal is required to expose the clinical crown of the impacted tooth, a small round bur with copious irrigation is utilized.  
6. Once the clinical crown of the impacted tooth is exposed, the dental follicle is removed with cautery (see Figure 2.6 in Case Report 2.1 and Figure 2.15 in Case Report 2.2). Cautery allows for quick and easy removal of the follicle and greatly adds to hemostasis.  
7. If needed, local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor can be injected into the surrounding tissue and around the clinical crown of the tooth to aid in hemostasis.  
8. A suction tip is placed at the tooth-bone interface to further enhance hemostasis and to aid in the creation of a dry field. A dry field is paramount to ensuring that the composite adheres and has a strong bond.  
9. Once a dry field is established and maintained, the bracket is placed toward the incisal or occlusal tip of the impacted tooth in the position of the ideal vector for the distraction of the tooth into the space created by the orthodontist or within the space created by the extraction of the primary tooth.  
10. Once the bracket is secured in the appropriate position, the chain attached to the bracket is tested with cotton pliers or pickups to ensure a strong bond between the composite and the impacted tooth. Excessive composite flange is removed with a round bur with copious irrigation.

11. The chain is secured to the orthodontic arch wire with 4-0 silk sutures. Excessive chain links are removed in order to minimize slack within the chain (see Figure 2.9 in Case Report 2.1 and Figure 2.16 in Case Report 2.2) as excessive chain slack can lead to bracket detachment.  
12. The area is closed primarily with interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures (see Figure 2.11 in Case Report 2.1). Alternatively, the soft tissue flap may be repositioned at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of labially positioned teeth in order to create an apically repositioned flap.

# Open Technique

1. Steps 1-8 of the Closed Technique are performed.  
2. The soft tissue flap is laid over the impacted tooth in order to gauge where tissue should be removed to perform the open exposure. Tissue is removed with a laser, electrocautery, or scalpel to expose the clinical crown of the impacted tooth. Alternatively, if the tooth is visible within the oral cavity with either a cusp tip protruding through the mucosa or a palpable bulge, the overlying tissue can be excised with no flap elevation (see Figure 2.17 in Case Report 2.3).  
3. A surgical pack (see Figure 2.18 in Case Report 2.3), a cellulose crown (see Figures 2.21 and 2.22 in Case Report 2.4), or an appliance (a cleat or chrome steel crown) is placed over the clinical crown of the impacted tooth and the impacted tooth is allowed to erupt autonomously to the level of the occlusal plane over time with no direct orthodontic guidance.

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics are prescribed based on the invasiveness of the procedure.  
2. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed.  
3. Patients return to their normal activities the next day.  
4. Orthodontic traction should begin as soon as possible after exposure, typically, between 5 and 21 days after exposure. Immediate traction is initiated for teeth that have been luxated to address ankylosis.

# Complications

# Early Complications

1. Bleeding: Often from not identifying bleeding tissue on closure. Alternatively, since most expose and bond patients are very young, this may represent an underlying, undiagnosed coagulation disorder.  
2. Bracket detachment: From inadequate moisture control during the use of composite. It is important to reattach the bracket within 72 hours before extensive healing of the mucoperiosteal flap occurs.

3. Infection: Rare. Treated with antibiotics and oral rinses such as Peridex. If an abscess is identified on examination or with radiographs, an incision and drainage procedure is indicated.  
4. Damage to adjacent teeth or to the impacted tooth: Often occurs with bur damage during the uncovering of the impacted tooth. May lead to a vertical periodontal defect and/or irreversible damage to the involved tooth.

# Late Complications

1. Bracket detachment: Frequently due to an ankylosed tooth or excessive force by the orthodontist.  
2. Failure of tooth movement (ankylosed tooth): Treatment options include re-exposure of the impacted tooth with more aggressive bone removal, attempted luxation of the tooth with a dental elevator, and the creation of a bone tunnel through the alveolus to facilitate movement. If the above fails, consider tooth removal and closure of the space via orthodontic means or with a dental implant. Alternatively, interdental osteotomy and segment repositioning may be considered. Care should be taken during surgical exposure to avoid trauma to the CEJ and the periodontal ligament as this may lead to ankylosis and/or root resorption.  
3. Periodontal defects: Less likely with conservative flap elevation, the use of orthodontic brackets, conservative bone removal around only the clinical crown, and distracting the impacted tooth through attached keratinized gingiva. Utilizing a bonded bracket to engage the impacted tooth instead of ligating a steel wire around the CEJ will discourage periodontal defects and promote a more optimal periodontal result.  
4. Intrusion of adjacent teeth: Constant orthodontic traction on an ankylosed tooth may lead to the intrusion and displacement of the adjacent teeth (see Figures 2.45 and 2.46 in Case Report 2.8). Treatment typically involves the extraction or surgical repositioning of the ankylosed tooth and orthodontic alignment of the adjacent displaced teeth.

# Key Points

1. The most commonly impacted teeth are wisdom teeth, followed by the maxillary canine teeth. The maxillary permanent canines typically erupt into the oral cavity at 11-12 years of age. In  $1 - 3\%$  of the population, one or both maxillary canines fail to erupt or erupt non-ideally.  
2. Radiographs allow the operator to know the exact position of the impacted tooth, its labial or lingualpalatal position, any interferences caused by other structures (i.e., adjacent teeth roots, supernumerary teeth, or odontomas), and whether the tooth is

malformed or associated with a pathologic condition. Radiographs should include any combination of orthopantomograms, periapical films, occlusal films, and/or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging. When utilizing periapical and occlusal films, it is important to understand Clark's rule (i.e., the SLOB rule, for "same lingual; opposite buccal").

3. Communication with the orthodontist is important prior to the ligation of the bracket. Having a clear concept of the overall orthodontic treatment plan and the eruption vectors will lead to more precise bracket placement and ideal treatment outcomes.  
4. Some orthodontists prefer to have the expose and bond procedure completed several weeks prior to the placement of full orthodontics. In these instances, the impacted tooth is exposed and bonded, and the silk suture is tied around the teeth adjacent to the site where the tooth will be distracted. For example, for an impacted maxillary canine, the silk suture is tied below the CEJ of the adjacent lateral incisor.  
5. The more vertically upright the impacted tooth is positioned, the higher the success rate for distraction into the alveolus and the less chance of ankylosis.  
6. Patient age is a key determinant in orthodontic success and total treatment time. The chances of successful orthodontic eruption of impacted teeth are highest under the age of 20 and decrease with advancing age.  
7. A closed technique involves raising a full-thickness mucoperiosteal tissue flap, removing necessary bone, attaching a device to the impacted/malpositioned tooth (such as an orthodontic bracket with dental composite), and either primarily closing the tissue elevation or suturing the flap at the CEJ of the impacted/malpositioned tooth (apically repositioned flap) (see Figure 2.20). The apically repositioned flap may be utilized for labially impacted teeth when there is concern of the impacted tooth erupting into an area of non-keratinized mucosa, thus increasing the risk of gingival recession. The results of performing primary closure over the impacted tooth versus apically repositioned flaps are controversial. Proponents of the apically repositioned flap believe it facilitates a more ideal mucogingival complex. Opponents of the apically repositioned flap believe it causes an increased and unaesthetic width of attached tissue and gingival scarring.  
8. A open eruption technique involves creating an incision that bisects the attached mucosa and removing sufficient bone to expose the clinical crown of an impacted tooth just as in the closed eruption technique. Next, the flap is repositioned over the impacted tooth, and a perforation is created within the tissue overlying the impacted tooth's clinical crown. The tissue perforation is packed with a surgical packing (see Figure 2.18), typically, a periodontal pack (Coe-Pak,

GC American Inc., Alsip, IL, US or Barricaid, Dentsply, Milford DE, USA), a cellulose crown (see Figures 2.21 and 2.22), or an appliance (a cleat, bracket, or chrome steel crown), and the tooth is allowed to erupt autonomously to the level of the occlusal plane. The open technique is primarily utilized for palatally impacted maxillary canines when there is concern of adjacent root resorption from the vector of orthodontic distraction from a closed technique. The open technique is also utilized in pre-orthodontic patients approximately 6–12 months prior to the beginning of comprehensive orthodontics to reduce the amount of time that the patient will be in full orthodontics.

9. Success rates are typically higher with the closed technique. Complications associated with the open technique include a higher reported incidence of postoperative discomfort and re-exposure of the impacted tooth compared to the closed technique. Multiple studies have shown little clinical significance in the final outcome of open versus closed surgical techniques.  
10. Incisions are always crestal. All incisions are designed to bisect the attached tissue overlying the alveolar ridge. This will allow the impacted tooth to be distracted through keratinized tissue and will lead to optimal periodontal support of the tooth. Incisions placed within alveolar mucosa may lead to the eruption of the impacted tooth through unattached tissue and compromise the periodontal support of the tooth once it is aligned within the alveolus.  
11. Adequate clinical crown exposure and a dry field are keys to the success of the bonding of the composite to the impacted tooth. It is also paramount to select a composite specifically designed for orthodontic bonding.  
12. The bracket should be placed so that when the chain is activated by the orthodontist, the vector of the chain pull coincides with the anticipated path of eruption of the impacted tooth. The bracket should be placed close to the incisal or occlusal tip of the impacted tooth in order to give the orthodontist optimal control over the movement of the tooth.  
13. Orthodontic traction should begin as soon as possible after exposure, but no later than 3 weeks after exposure. Immediate traction with an elastic or power chain should be initiated for teeth that have been luxated to address ankylosis.  
14. The management of impacted mandibular canines and premolars can be less predictable than their maxillary counterparts. Due to the density of the mandibular bone, temporary anchorage devices (TADs) are frequently used to provide sufficient anchorage for orthodontic traction. On average, impacted mandibular canines and premolars have a lower success rate due to the amount of traction force necessary to

move the impacted tooth through the dense mandibular bone, the increased percentage of horizontal positioning, the increased distance from the occlusal plane, and patient compliance with increased treatment times.

15. For impacted teeth that fail to erupt with either open or closed techniques, a secondary procedure may be performed in order to remove additional surrounding alveolar bone from the impacted tooth. However, if the clinician has a high suspicion that the impacted

will fail future orthodontic efforts, consideration should be given to extraction and dental implant placement. If a dental implant is being considered, it is important to not remove any additional alveolar bone as this may impair the ability to place the dental implant into an ideal position. In many cases, due to the underdevelopment of the alveolar crest of bone, augmentation in the form of buccal onlay grafting and soft tissue augmentation may be required prior to, or simultaneously with, implant placement.

Case Report 2.6. Open technique: Impacted mandibular molars. A 14-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of multiple impacted mandibular molar teeth. An open exposure was performed on the lower first and second molars to the CEJ. At the time of open exposure and orthodontic bracket placement, the mandibular molars were luxated to ensure that they were not ankylosed and an orthodontic wire was placed to protract the crowns of teeth

#19 and #30. As the impacted mandibular molars were aggressively luxated and mobilized, orthodontic traction was implemented immediately. The sites were left open and the patient was scheduled for weekly irrigations to ensure no food entrapment within the exposure sites and to ensure optimal tissue healing. Final treatment included the extraction of all third and second molars and restoring the patient to first molar occlusion (see Figures 2.30 through 2.34).

Case Report 2.7. Complication: Ankylosed maxillary canine. A 17-year-old female presents after attempted expose and bond times three at another facility. Upon discussions with the previous practitioner, tooth #6 was ankylosed and the last procedure performed was the removal of significant buccal bone in an attempt to facilitate orthodontic manipulation. The ankylosed canine tooth was extracted and the area was reconstructed prior to guided implant placement with a particulate onlay graft and connective tissue graft (see Figures 2.35 through 2.43).

Case Report 2.8. Complication: Ankylosed maxillary impacted canine. A 36-year-old female presents for the expose and bond of tooth #11. A thorough informed consent discussion was had with the patient regarding the possible complications of the procedures and the decreased success rate of the procedure due to the patient's age. Tooth #11 was uneventfully exposed and a bracket was placed. After 9 months of orthodontic traction, the patient presents with severe intrusion of her maxillary teeth due to ankylosis of the impacted canine. The patient will be treated with tooth extraction, combined hard and soft tissue grafting, and three-unit bridge fabrication (see Figures 2.44 through 2.46).
