# Orthognathic Surgery in the Cleft Patient: Le Fort I Osteotomy

Joshua A. Stone and John T. Brothers

Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Texas Southwest Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA

A means of establishing maxillary form and occlusal function in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.

# Indications

1. Improve facial symmetry  
2. Establishment of a class 1 dental occlusion when possible, or functional occlusion when needed  
3. Placement the components of the craniofacial skeleton in an ideal aesthetic position  
4. Closure of alveolar clefts in patients that did not receive alveolar cleft repair at a younger age  
5. Presence of obstructive sleep apnea, not controlled with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)

# Contraindication

1. When goals can be accomplished with orthodontic maneuvers alone  
2. Dental malocclusion not associated with dentofacial deformities  
3. Medical contraindication to general anesthesia or bony healing  
4. Psychological instability

# Technique Modifications to Le Fort I Osteotomies for Unrepaired and Repaired Unilateral Alveolar Clefts

1. In addition to the standard vestibular incision for a Le Fort osteotomy, extensions are made vertically along the alveolar cleft and oronasal fistula to the palatal aspect of the fistula in the unrepaired cleft alveolus, thus separating the oral and nasal mucosa. The palatal aspect of these incisions must be undermined to provide for a tension-free closure. However, the palatal mucosa must remain intact to avoid any interruption of blood flow. There will be an adhesion of palatal mucosa with nasal mucosa in most cases. When this is

encountered, the nasal mucosa will be cut with Mayo scissors after downfracture, cheating toward the nasal side.  
2. Osteotomies and bony separation are completed in the same manner as in a traditional Le Fort I osteotomy. Of note, when using the double ball osteotome to separate the nasal septum, maintain firm control over the osteotome as it will tend to deviate toward the cleft palate due to the lack of bony support in this area. With an unrepaired unilateral alveolar cleft, once the Le Fort I osteotomy is completed, the maxilla is in two pieces. Downfracture is completed. Tessier mobilizers are placed posterior to the tuberosities and the maxillary soft tissue pedicle is carefully stretched, and the segments are mobilized.  
3. Descending palatine arteries are ligated with medium vessel clips superiorly and separated inferiorly with electrocautery. This step is optional if greater anterior movement is required.  
4. The deviated nasal septum and vomer are trimmed. Bony interferences are removed.  
5. The alveolar cleft defect is closed by moving the two segments of the maxilla together with the aid of the surgical splint.  
6. Autogenous or allogenic grafting may be utilized to fill any residual defects within the alveolus and nasal floor provided adequate closure can be attained.  
7. Corticocancellous blocks can be utilized to graft at the level of the anterior maxillary wall osteotomies when the gap is greater than  $5 - 7\mathrm{mm}$ .  
8. The incisions are primarily closed with care to completely close the oronasal fistula in a watertight, tension-free fashion. This requires incisions akin to a standard dentoalveolar bone graft. Additionally, the nasal mucosa will require repair. Depending on if the palatal mucosa was intact or contained a fistula preoperatively, the palatal mucosa may require repair as

well. Very limited palatal dissection is completed with a focus on maintaining blood supply to the maxillary segments.

9. The patient is placed into elastics or MMF as desired.  
10. Twenty milligrams of Exparel is provided, nondiluted. This is injected with a 25-gauge or greater diameter needle in a supraperiosteal plane at the end of the procedure.

# Technique Modifications to Le Fort I Osteotomies for Unrepaired and Repaired Bilateral Alveolar Clefts

Unrepaired bilateral cleft patients typically exhibit severe maxillary dysplasia with hypoplastic lateral segments. The premaxillary segment is frequently mobile, malpositioned, and associated with residual oronasal fistulae, bony defects, and soft tissue scarring. Due to these circumstances, the following surgical modifications are recommended:

1. Vestibular incisions extend from the zygomatic buttress region to the alveolar defects. Within the region of the alveolar cleft, the incision is continued along the mesial line angles of the cleft defects.  
2. The premaxillary segment incisions are placed adjacent to the alveolar cleft edge on each side and connected palatally.  
3. The nasal and oral mucosa are separated. Care must be taken to maintain the labial vestibule of the premaxillary segment.  
4. Osteotomies are completed as normal. However, with an unrepaired bilateral alveolar cleft, once the Le Fort I osteotomy is completed, the maxilla is in three pieces.  
5. Downfracture is completed. Tessier retractors are placed posterior to the tuberosities, the maxillary soft tissue pedicle is carefully stretched and the segments are mobilized.  
6. If the maxilla is under tension with the movement required, consideration should be given to ligating the descending palatine artery with medium vascular clips and cutting inferiorly with electrocautery.  
7. The deviated nasal septum and vomer are trimmed. Bony interferences are removed.  
8. The premaxillary segment is osteotomized from a palatal approach with an osteotome, with concomitant removal of the vomer bone. Alternatively, a single vertical incision can be made between the central incisors at the level of the ANS to the mid root. Dissection to the nasal floor is then carried out. A double ball osteotome can then be used to separate the premaxillary segment.  
9. The lateral segments are brought into contact with the premaxillary segment utilizing a prefabricated splint. This will close the alveolar cleft defects.

10. Autogenous or allogenic grafting may be utilized to fill any voids within the alveolus provided adequate closure can be attained.  
11. Corticocancellous blocks are interposed in areas of bony voids along the Le Fort osteotomy.  
12. Closure of all incisions is performed.  
13. The patient is placed into elastics or MMF as desired.  
14. Twenty milligrams of Exparel is provided, nondiluted. This is injected with a 25-gauge or greater diameter needle in a supraperiosteal plane at the end of the procedure.

# Postoperative Management

1. Airway security in the immediate postoperative phase is essential. Oral pharyngeal airways should be avoided.  
2. Adequate pain control, antibiotic coverage, and the use of prophylactic steroids is indicated.  
3. Frequent monitoring of the gingival perfusion of the anterior maxilla via assessing capillary refill (perfusion) is imperative in bilateral clefts patients status post orthognathic surgery.  
4. Patients must maintain adequate oral fluid intake to avoid dehydration.  
5. Meticulous oral hygiene is necessary to minimize postoperative infection. Tooth brushing can begin on postoperative day 2. A water flosser may be used at 2 weeks on the lowest setting. Chlorohexidine rinses are recommended.  
6. Caloric intake and adequate nutrition are essential. The patient may begin soft mechanical diet (non-chew) beginning immediately postoperatively and extending through week 6.  
7. Sinus precautions should be observed. Patients should avoid nose blowing, open mouth sneezing, and swimming. Ocean and Afrin nasal spray may be used in the immediate postoperative period.  
8. For patients requiring MMF, it is typically released 3-4 weeks postoperatively. Light elastics are used to maintain or reprogram occlusion, and passive mouth opening exercises are recommended.  
9. Orthognathic splints are removed at 6 weeks postsurgery, at which point orthodontic therapy can be resumed.

# Complications

1. Relapse: Cleft-orthognathic patients typically exhibit a higher degree of surgical relapse than noncleft-orthognathic patients. This is due to a tighter and less forgiving soft tissue envelope found within cleft patients. Relapse often requires a second orthognathic procedure to correct.  
2. Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) after maxillary advancement: The amount of maxillary

movement is not predictive of the risk of developing velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). It is important to prepare patients for the possibility of VPI preoperatively. Speech therapy may be sufficient for mild to moderate cases. Severe cases may require surgical correction based on nasoendoscopic findings.

3. Alar base widening: Minimized postoperatively with the placement of an alar cinch suture.  
4. Incision dehiscence: Typically occurs from failure to obtain a tension-free closure at the time of surgery. May also occur as a result of early and excessive masticatory function.  
5. Septal deviation: Most cleft-orthognathic patients present with some degree of nasal and septal deviation. An inferior septoplasty should be performed when superiorly repositioning the maxilla. Additional rhinoplasty and septoplasty procedures may be required on an individual case-by-case basis.  
6. Damage to teeth: Increased in cases requiring interdental osteotomies.

# Key Points

1. A coordinated treatment plan is established by the surgeon and orthodontist. In cleft-orthognathic surgeries, additional support in surgical planning is provided by other members of the craniofacial team, such as pediatric dentists, speech pathologists, nutritionists, and psychologists.  
2. Preoperative considerations unique to cleft patients undergoing orthognathic correction of maxillary hypoplasia and asymmetries include assessment of associated alveolar cleft (unilateral or bilateral, and whether previous and adequate bone grafting was performed or it is unrepaired), assessment of velopharyngeal and speech function, presence of oronasal fistula, psychological evaluation, and required movements to correct the dentofacial deformity (Le Fort I alone versus double jaw surgery, conventional orthognathic surgery versus maxillary distraction osteogenesis, and the amount of transverse correction required).  
3. The majority of cleft-orthognathic patients have an associated alveolar cleft. Ideally, dentoalveolar bone grafting should be completed by 9-12 years of age. This effectively converts a multisegment maxilla into a single-segment unit. Additionally, this improves the blood supply to the premaxillary segment in bilateral

cases. In situations where dentoalveolar bone grafting has not been performed or in cases where inadequate bone is present, simultaneous bone grafting combined with orthognathic surgery may be necessary.

4. Placement of a splint wired to the dentition at the time of down fracture is helpful to control segments. This prevents fracture of the alveolar graft or tearing of the cleft alveolar mucosa. If segmental surgery is being completed, this requires a splint fabricated to the preoperative occlusion.  
5. Repositioning of the maxilla and associated soft tissues may alter the velopharyngeal sphincter. To adequately plan for any potential speech issues after surgery, a speech pathology evaluation and nasoendoscopy are indicated prior to surgery.  
6. Surgical imaging is necessary in planning orthognathic surgery. For the cleft-orthognathic patient, a 3D computed tomography (CT) scan is of value to allow the surgeon to familiarize themselves with the aberrant bony anatomy of the maxillary, nasal, and palatine bones. Medical models can be fabricated from preoperative CT scans in order to obtain additional information.  
7. Segmental Le Fort surgery is possible in cleft patients. In unilateral case, no additional modification above a standard cleft orthognathic will need to be undertaken. However, if completed in a bilateral CLP patient, preservation of the anterior vestibular mucosa must be achieved to maintain blood supply to the segment.  
8. The palatal and vestibular tissue surrounding the maxilla in a cleft patient undergoing Le Fort I osteotomy surgery may demonstrate significant scar tissue with minimal elasticity. As such, extreme maxillary movements in the anterior and transverse directions can be particularly challenging, if not impossible. For anterior maxillary movement ( $>8\mathrm{mm}$  advancement), the surgeon may consider distraction osteogenesis. For transverse movements ( $>5\mathrm{mm}$ ), the surgeon may benefit from a surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) rather than, or in addition to, conventional orthognathic surgery.  
9. Psychological evaluation is a consideration for any young adult undergoing orthognathic surgery; however, children with clefts have a unique situation in which they have undergone multiple surgeries and are often extremely self-conscious about their facial morphology.

# Case Reports

Case Report 35.1. Unilateral cleft lip and palate – One-piece maxillary osteotomy. An 18-year-old male presents with a history of a unilateral CLP. The patient had received all aspects of cleft care at the appropriate timing, including an alveolar bone graft reconstituting the maxilla. The orthodontist overseeing the patient's care chose to use canine substitution to manage the site. On

physical examination, the patient presents with maxillary hypoplasia, malocclusion, and without evidence of VPI. The patient's dentofacial deformity was surgically corrected with a Le Fort I one-piece maxillary osteotomy and mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) (see Figures 35.1 through 35.8).

Case Report 35.2. Unilateral cleft lip and palate – Segmental maxillary osteotomy. An 18-year-old male presents with a history of a unilateral CLP. The patient had received all aspects of cleft care at the appropriate timing including an alveolar bone graft reconstituting the maxilla. The orthodontist overseeing the patient's care chose to maintain the lateral incisor space for future implant placement and restoration at the #7 site, and canine substitution at the #10 site. This patient developed

a significant anterior open bite that was present between teeth #4 and #13 with a step in the occlusion between the canine and first premolars. Additionally, the patient exhibited a transverse maxillary deficiency. The patient underwent preoperative segmental orthodontics and his dentofacial deformity was definitively treated with a Le Fort I three-piece segmental maxillary osteotomy and mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) (see Figures 35.9 through 35.17).

Case Report 35.3. Bilateral cleft palate with segmental maxillary surgery. A 13-year-old female presents with history of a bilateral CLP. Alveolar bone grafting has not been completed due to lack of access to care. On examination, the patient with severe maxillary hypoplasia and retrognathia and the premaxilla is mobile. The first stage of treatment involved interval bilateral maxillary dentoalveolar cleft grafting with anterior iliac crest

bone graft (AICBG) and alloplastic graft medium with great healing resulting in a solid and nonmobile premaxilla. Orthodontic therapy after dentoalveolar cleft repair was performed to allow for lateralization of the canines and to prepare for segmental maxillary surgery. The patient underwent VSP and Le Fort I segmental surgery to reconstruct her maxillary hypoplasia and congenital dentofacial deformity (see Figures 35.18 through 35.35).
