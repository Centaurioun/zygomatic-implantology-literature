# Implant Placement Considerations

When a patient presents for implant placement to restore their occlusion and function, the surgeon should be able to predict which patients have the best chance of success. Certain factors affect implant and graft site healing, the long-term survival of implants, and the longevity of the final restorative prosthesis.

# Clinician-Related Etiology of Implant Failure

# Malposed Implants

Implant position is a key factor to both the long-term survival rate of the implant and of the definitive restoration. An integrated and restored malposed implant has a high chance of implant failure secondary to bone loss and/or restoration failure.

# Implant Placement Errors

Excessive implant angulation: Ideal implant placement allows occlusal forces to be distributed along the long axis of the implant body and equally to the supporting bone. Excessive angulation of implants creates cantilever forces that negatively stress the surrounding bone and the restorative abutment as compared to axially loaded implants. Increased implant angulation may lead to premature implant failure and/or abutment fracture. Angulations up to  $25^{\circ}$  may be corrected with angled screw channel abutments. Angulation differences between adjacent implants may require splinting to decrease the stress on the implants and on the final restorations. Severe angulation often requires malposed implant extraction with grafting and secondary delayed implant placement.

Proximity of implant to adjacent teeth: Implant placement in close proximity to adjacent teeth roots may lead to vertical bone loss due to necrosis of the interseptal bone from compromised blood supply. Implants should be placed no closer than  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from adjacent teeth roots and  $3.0\mathrm{mm}$  from adjacent implants. Implants placed too close to the adjacent clinical crowns can compromise the

restorative space of the final restoration. A minimum of  $1.2\mathrm{mm}$  (preferably  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) of space is required for single-unit crown fabrication from the implant shoulder to the adjacent tooth's contact point.

Vertical implant position: Sufficient vertical restorative height (VRH) is necessary for ideal form, function, and aesthetics of the definitive restoration. Implants placed too deep (subgingival) may require bone profiling to seat the healing abutment or definitive restoration and may necessitate custom restorative abutment fabrication to compensate for the excessive VRH. Implants placed too high (supragingival) may not have adequate VRH and may have compromised aesthetics due to implant collar show or a visibly short clinical crown. The vertical position of the implant will also affect the design of the final restoration. For single-unit implant supported crowns and bridges, a minimum of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of VRH is required for a screw-retained prosthesis. For a cement-retained prosthesis,  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of VRH is necessary. For full-arch considerations, the VRH requirements are as follows: locator abutments require at least  $9\mathrm{mm}$  of VRH, a bar prosthesis requires at least  $12 - 15\mathrm{mm}$  of VRH, and a fixed hybrid prosthesis requires at least  $15\mathrm{mm}$  of VRH.

Horizontal implant position: Implants placed too far to the facial/buccal or lingual/palatal may suffer from large and non-hygienic final restorations that can harbor food and plaque and stimulate peri-implantitis and bone loss around the crestal aspect of the implant. Implants not spaced ideally within the edentulous site (mesial-distal implant position) may necessitate the fabrication of large cantilever restorations that lead to abnormal torsional (bending) forces on the implants that can lead to implant fracture and failure.

# Placement of Implants into Soft Bone (Low Implant Insertional Torque Value)

A high implant insertional torque value is an accurate predictor of implant success. Implants that fail to achieve at least  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  of insertional torque have a less favorable success rate. Causes of low insertion torque values

can be an inappropriately prepared implant osteotomy or soft bone. Soft bone can be determined on CBCT scan by evaluating both the contrast and the Hounsfield units of the bone at the implant recipient site. The etiology of poor quality/density bone includes previously infected sites, a chronic apical lesion, a previous lytic or cystic lesion, and posterior maxillary bone. The surgeon should avoid placing implants into soft bone believing that for some reason, the bone will get denser over time.

# Suboptimal Definitive Restorations

Insufficient restoration support: The definitive restoration must have sufficient support to offset the forces associated with mastication and function. Having an insufficient number of implants and/or inadequate bone support (narrow diameter or short implants) may not provide adequate support for the final prosthesis.

Peri-implantitis: Peri-implantitis is defined as an inflammatory reaction involving the lateral surface of a dental implant which results in bone loss. Peri-implantitis has a multifactorial etiology. Two of the most common causes of peri-implantitis include bone loss from the local spread of periodontal disease and bone loss from an inflammatory reaction to cement. The periodontal condition of the patient should be assessed and treated prior to and after implant placement. A screw-retained prosthesis is typically preferred to a cement-retained prosthesis in order to minimize the occurrence of cement extrusion into the gingival sulcus after crown placement. Frequently, when the dental laboratory fabricates a cement-retained crown, there may not be a spacer introduced to provide space for the cement. In this situation, the amount of cement needed to secure the crown is minimal. The restorative dentist may place cement within the crown and then place the crown onto an abutment. Pressure is placed and cement is extruded around the abutment causing peri-implantitis of the sulcular tissues with resultant loss of bone and potential implant failure.

Unhygienic restoration: Suboptimal implant position or a poorly designed final restoration can lead to the accumulation of food and plaque along the margin of the implant crown with resultant peri-implantitis, infection, bone loss, exposed implant threads, and subsequent implant failure. Placing implants too far to the facial or palatal/lingual surfaces can create an unhygienic ridge lap (see Figure 12.1). For edentulous patients with a history of poor oral hygiene habits or hygiene ability (decreased manual dexterity), locator attachments are preferred to fixed restorations due to cleanliness and ease of maintenance.

# Poor Treatment Planning

A treatment plan must be developed that takes into consideration long-term consequences of implant therapy. Placing short implants into marginal bone may result in implant integration and allow for prosthesis fabrication. However, functional occlusal forces on short and/or malposed implants can result in loss of marginal bone and implants, often one at a time in a sequence of loss over a span of time. Eventually, the patient will need an appropriate bone graft and a new implant-supported restoration. Compromising implant positioning at the initial surgery will carry with it a higher chance of eventual failure. If a patient experiences implant failure, they may not desire another implant placed and may decide on a different restorative option.

If a patient has marginal bone upon presentation, reestablishment of a proper foundation of bone support by grafting will lead to optimal long-term success. If a patient denies having a graft for ideal implant site development, subsequent implant placement will most likely be compromised. The placement of implants in a compromised position is usually performed by inexperienced surgeons who are trying to satisfy patient desires. Frequently, patients desire implant placement without bone grafting in order to avoid cost and morbidity. However, compromised implant positioning and under-engineering will often result in later failure. When failure occurs, the degree of the long-term problem increases significantly and the next reconstruction will be more difficult.

# Related Etiology of Implant Failure

Poor bone quality: Placing implants into soft bone is associated with a higher occurrence of implant failure. Bone quality may be accessed preoperatively by evaluating the contrast and Hounsfield units of the implant site on the preoperative CBCT scan, at surgery during osteotomy preparation and finally, with the insertional torque value of the implant. Implants with an insertional torque value of less than  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  have a higher rate of failure.

Smoking: Patients need to be informed (and understand) that smoking has an increased risk of implant failure. Smoking and nicotine potentially decreases the vascularity of the soft tissues, negatively impacts implant integration and may lead to bone loss and eventual implant failure.

Alcohol: Daily alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of implant failure. Patients need to be informed and recognize that over time, their alcohol habits may lead to bone loss and eventual implant failure.

Opioid usage for chronic pain management and anti-depressant medications: Chronic opioid and antidepressant medications are significant predictors of implant failure.

Penicillin allergy: Penicillin allergy is associated with an increased risk for non-integration in the early healing period.

Bruxism and short implants (9 mm of less): Bruxism and the placement of short implants as single tooth replacements in the posterior maxilla is associated with an increased risk of implant failure. For patients desiring a single maxillary molar implant, grafting is often necessary to allow the placement of longer implants, especially in the patient who, because of their weight and frame, are prone to nocturnal bruxism. The use of occlusal splints (night guards) are recommended in bruxers to minimize nocturnal parafunctional forces on the implant and its associated restoration.

Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is associated with an increased risk for implant failure. Typically, these patients are aware of the problems that osteoporosis has on their bones. All patients with osteoporosis should be informed and comprehend the added risks of implant surgery. It is also necessary to discuss with patients who have taken long-term bisphosphonates about their increased risk of healing issues, especially that of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ).

Advanced age and frailty: As patients age, there is an increased risk for implant failure. As your practice matures over several years, try to follow your patients to anticipate age and frailty effects on a patient's resistance to common challenges around implants.

Cancer development after implant placement:

Development of malignancy necessitating chemotherapy

is associated with late implant failure. These patients may not be attentive to their mouth issues during their cancer therapy. If you are informed about a patient's development of a malignancy necessitating a therapy that reduces their immune response, frequent follow up, and increased hygiene therapy may be beneficial.

# Key Points

1. Treatment planning is key to success. A treatment plan must be developed that considers the long-term consequences of implant therapy. A comprehensive treatment plan should take into consideration the morphology of the edentulous site, the bone quality, implant selection and location, contributing patient comorbidities, parafunctional habits, and final prosthesis design.  
2. An open-ended discussion of the risks and benefits of implant surgery are a necessary aspect of the informed consent process. The patient should be aware of all possible complications and of the probability of each potential complication.  
3. Implants should be placed at a safe distance from adjacent anatomical structures:

$1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from adjacent teeth roots  
1.5mm from the buccal and lingual/palatal plate of bone  
$2\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the mandibular canal  
$3\mathrm{mm}$  from implant to adjacent implant

4. Short implants utilized within softer maxillary bone and/or used as a distal support for mandibular full-arch restorations may benefit from implant splinting to minimize the occurrence of bone loss and implant failure.

# Case Reports

Case Report 12.1. Malposed implants and a failing implant-supported fixed hybrid restoration. A 65-year-old male referred by his general dentist for the evaluation of failing implants. The patient had teeth removed and implants placed for an immediate fixed full-arch provisional, which was finalized into a hybrid type prosthesis 4 months after implant placement. The patient had difficulty cleaning the implants and developed gingival inflammation with exudate. Mobility was detected within the right maxillary and mandibular segments of the implant-supported fixed hybrid restorations. Radiographs illustrated malposition of the implants with long cantilevers and fractured framework. The framework failure etiology was from improper implant placement with resultant excessive forces and eventual implant mobility and failure (see Figures 12.2 and 12.3).

Case Report 12.2. No treatment planning and unrestorable implants. A 54-year-old female presents for the restoration of dental implants placed at another facility. Implants were placed with no consideration to implant spacing, parallelism, vertical restoration height, and angulation. Posterior maxillary implants were placed into poor quality bone with resultant implant mobility. The implants were not restorable. The patient sought legal action against her previous implantologist and was awarded a settlement (see Figures 12.4 and 12.5).

Case Report 12.4. Implant failure in a patient with chronic tobacco, alcohol, and opioid usage. A 65-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of failing and painful dentition. The patient with a 2 pack/day history of smoking cigarettes, drinks alcohol daily, and takes opioids daily for chronic shoulder and back pain. The patient has non-restorable teeth and desires fixed, esthetic restorations. The patient was initially treated with full mouth extraction and bone grafting to determine his healing ability and to augment key sites for future implant placement. All sites healed uneventfully and implants were placed into ideal positions within the lower arch.

Figure 12.7. Three-dimensional view shows the implant with no lingual bone support. The implant was subsequently mobile and was removed.

The patient was restored with a fixed provisional hybrid type mandibular prosthesis. The maxillary arch was restored with a conventional maxillary denture. After 2 weeks of functioning, the patient fractured the left posterior cantilever. After 8 weeks of masticating, he fractured the mandibular prosthesis a second time. Against the authors advice, he continued to masticate a normal diet, smoke, and consume alcohol and opioids daily. The bilateral posterior mandibular implants failed and the patient was converted to overdenture attachments utilizing the four anterior implants for a removable mandibular prosthesis (see Figures 12.8 through 12.13).

A 68-year-old female with a documented history of osteoporosis presents with a fractured right mandibular first molar after root canal therapy and function. The patient's osteoporosis was managed with Prolia (Denosumab) injections every 6 months. Tooth #30 was extracted and an allograft was placed. The site healed uneventfully and an implant was placed with excellent primary stability. Four months after implant placement, the patient developed minor discomfort to the implant site.

Case Report 12.6. Implant failure in a patient with a history of malignancy and chemotherapy. A 30-year-old female patient presents with a chief complaint of painful and mobile teeth. Clinical examinations and radiographs revealed severe bone loss to the maxillary anterior teeth, short roots to the maxillary canines, and grade  $3+$  mobility to the mandibular teeth, which were splinted together. The patient medical history was significant for cervical malignancy treated with surgery and chemotherapy in her teenage years. The patient desired the extraction of her painful teeth and restoration with a fixed solution. Her maxillary treatment plan included the extraction of her mobile anterior maxillary teeth #6 through #11, implant placement at sites #6 and #11 and the placement of a fixed implant supported bridge. Her mandibular treatment plan included the extraction of teeth #20 through #29 with the placement of 6 mandibular implants for a fixed hybrid style prosthesis. The patient's implant surgery was uneventful and the maxillary arch was reconstructed with a fixed bridge and

the lower arch was loaded immediately with a fixed provisional prosthesis utilizing the four anterior implants. The bilateral  $6\mathrm{mm}$  posterior implants were not immediately loaded. The two implants within the right anterior mandible failed and were replaced. A removable prosthesis was made after implant failure. Conus type abutments were placed on the six implants. Cross arch splinting of the posterior implants was not achieved and the fit of the temporary removable prosthesis to the copings was not ideal and resulting in a small amount of movement. At a routine follow-up appointment, the mandibular removable prosthesis was removed and the left posterior implant coping remained on the implant. Both posterior  $6\mathrm{mm}$  implants were found to be mobile and were removed. A tissue borne mandibular overdenture was fabricated and functioned well for the patient on the 4 remaining  $14\mathrm{-mm}$ -long anterior implants. It was speculated that the tooth loss and implant failure were related to the adolescent chemotherapy and cancer treatment (see Figures 12.17 through 12.24).

The debridement of the cement at the implant margin arrested the progressive bone loss and the implant was salvaged. A new cement-retained crown was fabricated and placed on the anterior maxillary implant. Proper crown contour, a fully seated restoration and a screw-retained design allowed for ideal healing, healthy soft tissue architecture around the cervical portion of the implant crown, and decreased probing depths (see Figures 12.25 through 12.31).

Case Report 12.9. Implant failure due to poor treatment planning, insufficient bone support, and lack of keratinized tissue. A 62-year-old female patient presents for a consultation regarding salvaging her preexisting implants. The patient reports that she underwent a tibial bone sinus lift and vertical onlay graft to the left posterior maxilla. She states that her implants were placed 6 years ago and that she is unhappy with her functional and aesthetic result. On examination, all implants with gross bone loss resulting in implant thread exposure. The anterior maxillary implants were placed within unattached tissue, were positioned too close

together to promote interseptal bone health, and had insufficient facial bone support. The mandibular implants were placed with a lack of bone support and without regards to the VRH of the final restorations. The mandible was definitively treated with implant extraction and the placement of three anterior mandibular implants for a locator-supported removable prosthesis. The patient deferred the treatment of the maxilla due to denial of the failing implants (see Figures 12.34 through 12.38).

# General Principles of Surgical Infection Management

1. Cultures should be obtained via sterile technique to guide antibiotic therapy. Care should be taken to minimize contamination of cultures with oral bacteria or skin flora and thus, lead to false results. Extraoral aspiration after cleansing the skin with a disinfectant can minimize the risk of culture contamination (see Figures 13.1 and 13.2).  
2. Cultures should be obtained prior to the administration of antibiotics. However, if incision and drainage is to be delayed or if the patient is septic, then the administration of preoperative broad-spectrum IV antibiotics are warranted.  
3. Incisions should be placed within non-involved skin and mucosa when possible. Incisions placed within necrotic or inflamed tissues result in delayed healing and unaesthetic scars.  
4. Incisions should be placed within aesthetic areas when possible. Incisions should parallel resting skin tension lines and should be placed within natural skin creases.  
5. Incisions should be placed to allow for gravity-dependent drainage when possible.  
6. Sharp dissection is recommended within the superficial layers only (skin, subcutaneous tissues, and mucosa). Blunt dissection is continued through the deeper layers to minimize damage to vital structures. Dissection patterns should parallel vessels and nerves to minimize iatrogenic damage to these structures.  
7. Each space should be explored completely to ensure complete disruption and evacuation of purulence and to avoid compartmentalization of the space.  
8. All explored spaces require drain placement. The exception is the peritonsillar space.

9. Drains should be removed when they become nonproductive. Drains are removed based on the patient's physical examination and drainage output. Drains are typically left in place for 72-120 hours. Nonproductive drains left in place for extended periods of time may lead to recontamination of the space.  
10. Wound margins are cleaned daily to remove blood clots, debris, and discharge.

# Vestibular Space

# Boundaries

Superior: Buccinator muscle

Inferior: Buccinator muscle

Anterior: Intrinsic lip musculature

Posterior: Buccinator muscle

Lateral: Vestibular mucosa

Medial: Mandible or maxilla with overlying periosteum

Contents: Areolar connective tissue, parotid duct, long buccal, and mental nerves

Connections: Canine (infraorbital) space and buccal space

Signs and symptoms: Vestibular fluctuance

Approach: Drainage is achieved via an incision parallel to and in the depth of the vestibule, ideally at the height of fluctuance. Blunt dissection is utilized to explore the vestibular space. Vertical incisions are utilized in the region of the mental foramen to avoid injury to the mental nerve (see Figure 13.3).

# Key Point

The vestibular space is a potential space between the vestibular mucosa and the underlying muscles of facial expression.

# Buccal Space (Buccinator Space)

# Boundaries

Superior: Zygomatic arch

Inferior: Lower border of the mandible

Anterior: Labial musculature (zygomatic and depressor muscles at the angle of the mouth)

Posterior: Pterygomandibular raphe

Lateral: Skin of the cheek

Medial: Buccinator muscle and the overlying buccopharyngeal fascia

Contents: Buccal fat pad, Stenson's duct, transverse facial artery and vein, and the anterior facial artery and vein

Connections: Canine space, submandibular space, masticator space, and infratemporal space

Signs and symptoms: Cheek edema (see Figure 13.5)

Approach: The buccal space may be drained intraorally or extraorally. Intraoral drainage is best accomplished via a mandibular or maxillary vestibular incision with dissection through the buccinator muscle (see Figure 13.3). Extraoral drainage is achieved via a submandibular incision (see Figure 13.6). Blunt dissection is directed superiorly and superficial to the buccinator muscle to enter the buccal space (see Figure 13.7).

Figure 13.7. Anatomy of the buccal and palatal spaces.

# Key Points

1. Isolated buccal space abscesses do not cause trismus. Trismus, in the presence of a buccal space abscess, is an important and ominous finding that should alert the clinician to the posterior spread of infection.  
2. In the pediatric population (age 3 months-3 years), it is important to differentiate between a true buccal space abscess of odontogenic origin and from Haemophilus influenzae cellulitis.

# Palatal Space

# Boundaries

Superior: Palate

Inferior: Periosteum

Anterior: Alveolar process of the maxilla

Posterior: Periosteal attachment to the palate and the maxilla

Lateral: Maxillary alveolus

Medial: Midline space (however, abscesses are typically contained laterally due to firm periosteal attachment)

Contents: Greater palatine nerve, artery, and vein, and nasopalatine nerve

Connections: None

Signs and symptoms: Localized palatal swelling

Approach: Drainage is achieved via an incision through palatal mucosa into the abscess cavity that parallels the regional vasculature, in particular the greater palatine neurovascular bundle (see Figure 13.3).

# Key Points

Palatal space infections typically arise from the palatal roots of maxillary molars and premolars (see Figure 13.7).

# Canine Space (Infraorbital Space)

# Boundaries

Superior: Infraorbital rim

Inferior: Oral mucosa

Anterior: Quadratus labii superioris muscles (levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, levator labii superioris, zygomaticus minor, and zygomaticus major)

Posterior: Levator anguli oris (caninus) muscle

Lateral: Buccal space

Medial: Nasal cartilages and subcutaneous tissue

Contents: Angular artery and vein and the infraorbital nerve

Connections: Vestibular space and buccal space

Signs and symptoms: Obliteration of the nasolabial fold and periorbital edema

Approach: Intraoral drainage is accomplished via an incision located within the depth of the vestibule, immediately adjacent to the abscessed tooth (see Figure 13.3). Blunt dissection is carried superiorly through the levator anguli oris (caninus) muscle and into the canine space.

# Key Points

1. Canine space infections typically arise when an anterior maxillary periapical abscess (typically from a canine) erodes through the buccal plate superior to the attachment of the caninus muscle.  
2. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the infraorbital nerve during exploration of the canine space.  
3. The facial veins are generally valveless (allowing bidirectional flow). Infections of the canine space can result in septic thrombophlebitis or emboli of the angular vein. Cavernous venous sinus thrombosis can result from ascension from the angular vein, to the inferior ophthalmic vein, and into the cavernous sinus. Prompt and aggressive treatment of canine space infections are necessary to avoid this exceeding rare, but potentially devastating sequela.

# Submental Space

# Boundaries

Superior: Mylohyoid muscle

Inferior: Superficial (investing) layer of the deep cervical fascia

Anterior: Inferior border of the mandible

Posterior: Hyoid bone

Lateral: Anterior bellies of the digastric muscles

Medial: No true medial border as it is a midline space

![](images/957fa0de63e4edc55b29c27c070598a25d29f2352cbf52fc59684c3467603c71.jpg)  
Submental space  
Figure 13.8. Anatomy of the submental space.

Contents: Anterior jugular veins and lymph nodes

Connections: Submandibular space

Signs and symptoms: Submental edema and erythema (see Figure 13.11)

Approach: Drainage is accomplished via a horizontal midline incision just anterior to the hyoid bone within the submental skin crease (see Figure 13.13 in Case Report 13.1). Incisions placed near the hyoid bone provide gravity-dependent drainage as the hyoid bone is the most inferior boundary of the submental space (see Figure 13.8). Blunt dissection is directed superiorly through skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the platysma muscle to enter the submental space. Care must be taken to avoid the anterior jugular veins. The submental space may also be drained intraorally via a vestibular incision continued through the mentalis muscle. The intraoral approach fails to provide dependent drainage.

# Key Points

1. The submental space is commonly involved via medial extension of submandibular space infections. Other potential sources of infection include direct spread from the mandibular incisors and symphyseal fractures.  
2. The spread of infection from the submental space posterolateral to the anterior digastric muscles allows for direct bilateral extension of infections to the submandibular and sublingual spaces. Bilateral brawny cellulitis of the submental, sublingual, and submandibular spaces is termed Ludwig's angina.

# Case Reports

Case Report 13.1. Submental space. A 24-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of anterior mandibular facial edema, floor-of-mouth elevation and tenderness, and a history of dental abscesses (see Figures 13.9 through 13.16).

Superior: Inferior and lingual surfaces of the mandible and the mylohyoid muscle

Inferior: Investing fascia with the digastric tendon at the apex

Anterior: Anterior belly of the digastric muscle

Posterior: Posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle

Lateral: Platysma muscle and investing fascia

Medial: Hyoglossus and mylohyoid muscles

Contents: Facial artery and vein, marginal mandibular nerve, mylohyoid nerve, submandibular gland, and lymph nodes

![](images/a8e9403fa08b59df65803117a1ac63b5852739d6470a227b8593610283231de7.jpg)  
Figure 13.15. Blunt finger dissection with the surgeon's dominant hand is utilized to ensure that the entire submental space has been explored. The finger of the non-dominant hand is placed within the floor of the mouth to allow for bimanual palpation of the entire submental space.

Connections: Lateral pharyngeal space, submental space, sublingual space, and buccal space

Signs and symptoms: Swelling at the inferior border of the mandible that extends medially to the anterior digastric muscle and posteriorly to the hyoid bone

Approach: Drainage is accomplished via an extraoral submandibular approach (see Figure 13.6). A  $2 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  incision is placed  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  caudal to the inferior border of the mandible, parallel to the resting skin tension lines at the level of the hyoid bone and at the point that will allow for maximum gravity-dependent drainage (see Figure 13.20 in Case Report 13.2). A hemostat is introduced through the skin incision and is directed toward the inferior border of the mandible. The hemostat is then directed lingual to the mandible to enter the submandibular space. Blunt dissection continues superiorly along the lingual aspect of the body of the mandible and is continued superiorly to the mylohyoid muscle.

# Key Points

The submandibular approach provides extraoral access to the sublingual, submandibular, buccal, masticator (pterygomandibular and masseteric), and lateral pharyngeal spaces.

# Sublingual Space

# Boundaries

Superior: Oral mucosa of the floor of the mouth

Inferior: Mylohyoid muscle

Anterior: Mandible

Posterior: Open

Lateral: Lingual cortex of the mandible

Figure 13.17. Anatomy of the sublingual and submandibular spaces.

Medial: Muscles of the tongue

Contents: Sublingual gland, lingual nerve, Wharton's duct, hypoglossal nerve, and the sublingual artery and vein

Connections: Submandibular space and the lateral pharyngeal space

Signs and symptoms: Floor of the mouth and tongue elevation, dysphasia, and sialorrhea

Approach: Drainage is best accomplished via an extraoral submandibular approach (see Figure 13.6). Once the submandibular space is explored, blunt dissection continues superiorly along the lingual aspect of the body of the mandible and is continued through the mylohyoid muscle to enter the sublingual space. Nondependent drainage can be achieved via an intraoral incision placed at the anterior and lateral portion of the floor of the mouth, parallel and lateral to the submandibular duct (see Figure 13.3). Blunt dissection proceeds through the oral mucosa and directly into the sublingual space.

# Key Points

1. Infections of the sublingual space are typically odontogenic in origin. Whether an odontogenic infection occurs within the sublingual space or the submandibular space is a result of the spread of the infection in relation to the attachment of the mylohyoid muscle (see Figure 13.17). Infections originating superior to the attachment of the mylohyoid muscle (teeth anterior to the second molar) will occur within the sublingual space. Infections originating inferior to the attachment of the mylohyoid muscle (second and third molars) will present within the submandibular space.

2. Posteriorly, the sublingual space is contiguous with the submandibular space, allowing for rapid spread of infection.

Case Report 13.2. Combined submandibular-sublingual spaces. A 27-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of right-sided facial edema, floor-of-mouth elevation and tenderness, right posterior mandibular pain, and a history of dental abscesses (see Figures 13.18 through 13.24).

# Parotid Space

# Boundaries

Superior: External auditory canal and mastoid tip

Inferior: Inferior border of the mandible

Anterior: Masticator space

Posterior: Carotid space and posterior belly of the digastric muscle

Lateral: Superficial layer of the deep cervical facia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin

Medial: Superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia and the parapharyngeal space

Contents: Parotid gland, facial nerve, intraparotid and extraparotid lymph nodes, retromandibular vein, and the external carotid artery

Connections: Masticator space, carotid space, and parapharyngeal space

Signs and symptoms: Pain and edema to the parotid region

Approach: Drainage is best accomplished via a modified Blair incision (see Figure 13.30 in Case Report 13.3) which allows for wide surgical exposure and gravity-dependent drainage of the parotid space. An incision is designed that combines a preauricular incision with an L-shaped cervical extension at least  $2\mathrm{cm}$  or fingerbreadths below the inferior border of the mandible. Both limbs of the incision are hidden within natural skin creases. The incision is carried through the platysma

muscle, and a subplatysmal flap is elevated to expose the inferior aspect of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. The parotid space is entered by blunt dissection through the parotid fascia (SDCF). Wide exposure of the parotid gland/space is obtained and drains may be placed dependent to gravity. Alternatively, a rhytidectomy incision may be used if aesthetics are a primary concern. Rhytidectomy incisions limit access to the entire parotid and make gravity-dependent drainage more difficult.

# Key Points

1. Most bacterial infections of the parotid gland are retrograde via the oral cavity and are commonly associated with a decrease in salivary flow.  
2. Bacterial infections present with an acute, painful enlargement of the parotid gland. Bacteria frequently associated with bacterial parotitis include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae and  $H.$  influenza.  
3. Bimanual palpation or "milking" of the gland may produce purulence at the orifice of Stenson duct adjacent to the maxillary second molar (see Figure 13.27 in Case Report 13.3).  
4. In adults, sialolithiasis is associated with approximately  $50\%$  of parotitis.  
5. Causes of acute parotid enlargement other than bacterial sialadenitis/parotitis include viral infections

(paramyxovirus [mumps], coxsackie [hand, foot, and mouth], lymphocytic choriomeningitis, herpes, influenza A, parainfluenza, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus).

6. Causes of chronic parotid enlargement include chronic sialadenitis/parotitis, sarcoidosis, previous radiation, benign and malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases (Sjogren's syndrome, HIV, etc.) and tuberculosis.  
7. The parotid space is divided into its superficial and deep lobes by the facial nerve.  
8. The superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia invests the parotid gland and is referred to as the parotid fascia.  
9. Biopsy at the time of incision and drainage procedures is warranted to obtain and definitive diagnosis of the patient's condition, even if sialolithiasis is present. A salivary gland biopsy may be performed from the involved gland (preferred procedure) or from the minor salivary glands of the lower lip (if no procedure is performed on the involved gland) (see Figure 13.25).

# Masticator Space (Masticatory Space, Masseter-Mandibulopterygoid Space)

The masticator space consists of four subspaces:

Masseteric (submasseteric) space  
Pterygomandibular space  
Superficial temporal space  
Deep temporal space

# Boundaries

Superior: Temporal crest

Inferior: Pterygomasseteric sling and the inferior border of the mandible

Anterior: Orbital rim and the anterior border of the ramus

Posterior: Posterior border of the mandible

Lateral: Parotideomasseteric fascia (superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia)

Medial: The greater wing of the sphenoid bone, the squamous portion of the temporal bone, and the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia deep to the medial pterygoid

Contents: Muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, medial, and lateral pterygoids), internal maxillary artery, mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, and the buccal fat pad

Connections: All subspaces are interconnected (see Figure 13.42). Connections also exist between the buccal, lateral pharyngeal, and infratemporal spaces.

Signs and symptoms: Trismus and edema

![](images/c8b758343784d0c4188f3640734dec792e5adecab99d88daab7b4088afb0a90f.jpg)  
Figure 13.42. Anatomy of the masticator space.

# Key Points

1. The masticator space contains the masseteric (submasseteric), pterygomandibular, deep, and superficial temporal spaces (see Figure 13.42).  
2. Individual subspaces will be discussed in detail in the following four subsections.

# Masseteric (Submasseteric) Space

# Boundaries

Superior: Zygomatic arch

Inferior: Inferior border of the mandible

Anterior: Anterior border of the ramus

Posterior: Posterior border of the ramus

Lateral: Parotideomasseteric fascia (superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia)

Medial: Vertical ramus of the mandible

Contents: Masseter muscle, masseteric artery, and vein

Connections: Superficial temporal space and pterygomandibular space

Signs and symptoms: Trismus and posterior mandibular angle edema

Approach: Drainage is best accomplished via an extraoral submandibular approach to allow for gravity-dependent drainage (see Figure 13.6). After entering the submandibular space, blunt dissection is continued posteriorly through the pterygomasseteric sling to enter the masseteric space located between the body of the masseter and the lateral ramus of the mandible. Alternatively, the masseteric space may be accessed intraorally (see Figure 13.3) via a vertical incision lateral and parallel to the pterygomandibular raphe. Sharp dissection is carried through the buccinator muscle, and blunt dissection is continued to enter the masseteric space.

# Key Points

1. Common sources of infection include pericoronitis, third molar abscesses, and mandibular angle fractures.  
2. The intraoral approach is often impractical due to the presence of trismus and the inability to establish dependent drainage.

# Pterygomandibular Space

# Boundaries

Superior: Lateral pterygoid muscle

Inferior: Pterygomasseteric sling

Anterior: Anterior border of the ramus

Posterior: Posterior border of the ramus

Lateral: Ascending ramus

Medial: Superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia

Contents: Inferior alveolar artery, vein, and nerve; lingual and mylohyoid nerves

Connections: Masseteric space, infratemporal space, and lateral pharyngeal space

# Signs and symptoms: Trismus

Approach: Extraoral drainage is accomplished via a submandibular approach (see Figure 13.6). Once the inferior border of the mandible is reached, blunt dissection proceeds posteriorly through the pterygomas-teric sling to enter the pterygomandibular space located between the body of the medial pterygoid muscle and the medial ramus of the mandible. Intraorally, the space may be accessed through an incision placed lateral and parallel to the pterygomandibular raphe through the buccinator muscle (see Figure 13.3). Blunt dissection is carried into the pterygomandibular space on the medial side of the mandible. In addition, the intraoral approach may be carried inferiorly through the pterygomandibular space, passing through the pterygomasseteric sling into the submandibular space. This may then be connected to a submandibular approach, and a through-and-through intraoral-extraoral drain can be passed with resulting gravity-dependent drainage.

# Key Points

1. Common sources of infection include pericoronitis, third molar abscesses, mandibular angle fractures, and needle track infections caused by inferior alveolar nerve blocks.  
2. Symptoms of needle track infections include pain, trismus, and localized abscess formation visible on computed tomography (CT) scan.

# Superficial Temporal Space (Superficial Temporal Pouch)

# Boundaries

Superior: Temporal crest

Inferior: Zygomatic arch

Anterior: Lateral orbital rim

Posterior: Fusion of the temporalis fascia with the pericranium at the temporal crest

Lateral: Temporalis fascia

Medial: Temporalis muscle

Contents: Middle temporal artery and vein

Connections: Masseteric space and deep temporal space

Signs and symptoms: Trismus and temporal swelling

Approach: Refer to deep temporal space

# Key Points

1. The temporal space is divided into superficial and deep spaces by the temporalis muscle.  
2. The temporal spaces are commonly involved by the secondary spread of infection from neighboring contiguous spaces.

# Deep Temporal Space (Deep Temporal Pouch)

# Boundaries

Superior: Attachment of the temporalis muscle to the temporal crest

Inferior: Superior surface of the lateral pterygoid muscle

Anterior: Infratemporal surface of the maxilla and the posterior surface of the orbit

Posterior: Attachment of the temporalis muscle to the cranium

Lateral: Temporalis muscle

Medial: Greater wing of the sphenoid bone and squamous portion of the temporal bone (terminating at the infratemporal crest)

Contents: Deep temporal artery and vein

Connections: Pterygomandibular space, and superficial temporal and infratemporal spaces

Signs and symptoms: Trismus and temporal swelling

Approach: Drainage of both the superficial and deep temporal spaces is achieved via a Gillies approach (see Figure 13.6). A  $2 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal temporal incision is made posterior to the hairline and  $3\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the anterior temporal crest. The incision is carried through the scalp, temporoparietal fascia, and deep to the temporalis fascia to expose the temporalis muscle and enter the superficial temporal space. Dissection can be carried bluntly through the temporalis muscle to enter the deep temporal space if necessary. Blunt dissection is carried inferiorly along the superficial or deep surface of the temporalis muscle to explore the spaces. When draining the superficial temporal space, it is best to combine the Gillies approach with a mandibular posterior vestibular incision with dissection superficial to the temporalis tendon. A through-and-through drain can be passed from the scalp incision to the intraoral incision to allow for dependent drainage.

# Key Points

Infections within the temporal spaces are able to communicate freely around the temporalis muscle (see Figures 13.43 and 13.44).

Figure 13.43. Coronal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan demonstrating left temporal space abscess.

# Infratemporal Space (Postzygomatic Space)

# Boundaries

Superior: Infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid and temporal bones, extending laterally to the infratemporal crest

Inferior: Open to pterygomandibular space

Anterior: Posterior surface of the maxillary tuberosity

Posterior: Temporomandibular joint and the deep lobe of the parotid gland

Lateral: Deep surface of the temporalis muscle and the coronoid process of the mandible

Medial: Lateral pterygoid plate and the lateral pterygoid muscle

Contents: Middle (muscular) division of the internal maxillary artery, mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, posterior portion of the buccal fat pad, and pterygoid plexus of veins

Connections: Deep temporal space, pterygomandibular space, buccal space, and orbital space (via inferior orbital fissure)

Signs and symptoms: Trismus

Approach: The infratemporal space can be drained utilizing an intraoral or extraoral incision. When only the infratemporal portion of the masticator space is

Figure 13.44. Axial contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan depicting left temporal space infection.

involved, a posterior maxillary vestibular incision is made through the buccinator muscle and carried posteriorly around the maxillary tuberosity to enter the infratemporal space. Blunt dissection is important within the infratemporal space to avoid hemorrhage from the maxillary arteries and their associated branches. When the pterygomandibular space is involved, both spaces may be drained via a submandibular incision, with dissection medial to the mandible through the pterygomasseteric sling. The infratemporal space may also be accessed via a Gillies approach extending through the deep temporal space, with a through-and-through drain passing deep to the temporalis muscle and entering the oral cavity through the posterior maxillary vestibular incision.

# Key Points

1. The infratemporal space is the medial extension of the deep temporal space.  
2. In addition, the infratemporal space provides a potential source for the posterior spread of infection to the cavernous sinus.  
3. Infections of the infratemporal space most often result from secondary spread; however, maxillary dental and sinus infections are known etiologies.

# Peritonsillar Space (Paratonsillar Space)

# Boundaries

Superior: Hard palate

Inferior: Piriform fossa

Anterior: Anterior tonsillar pillar (palatoglossus muscle)

Posterior: Posterior tonsillar pillar (palatopharyngeus muscle)

Lateral: Superior pharyngeal constrictor

Medial: Oropharyngeal mucosa

Contents: Loose connective tissue

Connections: Lateral pharyngeal space via perforation of the superior constrictor and buccopharyngeal fascia

Signs and symptoms: "Hot potato" voice, odynophagia, drooling, uvular deviation, palatal asymmetries, and medial displacement of the tonsil

Approach: Treatment of peritonsillar abscess includes aspiration and incision and drainage. When a periton-sillar abscess is suspected, aspiration confirms the diagnosis and evacuates purulence. An 18-gauge needle is inserted into the pointing area, the pharyngeal mucosa is penetrated, and aspiration is performed. If purulence is detected on aspiration, an incision-and-drainage procedure is performed. A #15 blade is utilized to create a curvilinear incision along the perimeter of the tonsillar capsule (see Figure 13.3) and through the point from which purulence was evacuated. A blunt hemostat is inserted into the incision and opened widely (see Figure 13.57). The entire peritonsillar space is explored with blunt dissection with the hemostat. The peritonsillar space is then copiously irrigated with saline.

![](images/75b061b8bea6787d58e9e1c321e3e25b051efa2cf8bdcf055349849fc017d0ec.jpg)

Figure 13.57. Exploration of the peritonsillar space with a blunt-ended hemostat. Drain placement is not recommended within the peritonsillar space.

# Key Points

1. When performing aspiration, the needle is advanced less than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in order to prevent injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve and the internal carotid artery, which may be aberrantly located within the parapharyngeal space.

![](images/90894f5f8e1c2d6e84cefec7c2ff9b637599af3644f4a983be440d0b40eb89ad.jpg)  
Figure 13.56. Coronal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan demonstrating a right peritonsillar abscess.

2. A drain is typically not placed within the peritonsillar space.  
3. Irrigating the peritonsillar space with half-strength hydrogen peroxide may aid in hemostasis.

# Pharyngeal Spaces (Lateral and Retropharyngeal Spaces)

Lateral Pharyngeal Space (Parapharyngeal Space, Pharyngomaxillary Space, Pterygopharyngeal Space, Pharyngopterygoid Space, Peripharyngeal Space)

# Boundaries

Superior: Skull base on the sphenoid bone

Inferior: Hyoid bone

Anterior: Pterygomandibular raphe

Posterior: Prevertebral division of the deep cervical fascia and the carotid sheath at the posterolateral corner

Lateral: Superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia overlying the mandible, the medial pterygoid, and the parotid gland

Medial: Visceral division of the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia (buccopharyngeal fascia) encasing the pharyngeal constrictors

Contents: Prestyloid: Fat, loose connective tissue; lymph nodes

Poststyloid: CN IX, CN XI, CN XII, carotid sheath, sympathetic chain, and lymph nodes

Connections: Masticator space, retropharyngeal space, carotid sheath, and submandibular and sublingual spaces

Signs and symptoms: Trismus, dysphonia, dysphagia, odynophagia, posturing, dyspnea, inability to control oral secretions, medial displacement of the lateral pharyngeal wall, uveal deviation, and edema

Approach: Drainage can be achieved via numerous approaches. Drainage via the submandibular approach (see Figure 13.6) involves dissection through the submandibular space (see "Approach" in the "Submandibular Space" section) with blunt dissection continued posteriorly and cephalically until the styloid process is palpated. Blunt finger dissection is directed medially toward the posterior tonsillar pillar. The space is fully explored by continued posteromedial dissection and palpation of the ipsilateral transverse process, posterior carotid sheath, and skull base. Drainage via an intraoral approach (see Figure 13.3) involves an incision placed within the posterior mandibular vestibule. Blunt dissection continues through the buccinator muscle and lateral and parallel to the pterygomandibular

raphe. Dissection proceeds medially and superiorly, deep to the medial pterygoid muscle to enter the lateral pharyngeal space. Care must be taken during dissection to avoid the ascending pharyngeal artery located on the superficial surface of the superior constrictor muscle.

# Key Points

1. The lateral pharyngeal space is shaped like an inverted cone with its base at the skull and apex at the hyoid bone (see Figures 13.60 through 13.63 in Case Report 13.5).  
2. The aponeurosis of Zuckerkandl and Testut divides the lateral pharyngeal space into anterior (prestyloid) and posterior (poststyloid) compartments and provides a barrier to the spread of infection.  
3. Due to its location, nearly all life-threatening odontogenic infections will pass through this space before entering the deeper, more inferior spaces of the neck.  
4. An arteriogram is indicated if coagulated blood or old blood clots are encountered within the lateral pharyngeal space, as these are signs of carotid sheath involvement.

Retropharyngeal Space (Retroesophageal Space, Retrovisceral Space, Posterior Visceral Space, Retropharyngeal Part of Visceral Compartment): Posterior Aspect of Grodinsky and Holyoke's Space 3

# Boundaries

Superior: Base of the skull

Inferior: To the fusion of the visceral (buccopharyngeal) and alar fascia at a variable level between C-6 and T-4, typically at the level of tracheal bifurcation

Anterior: Visceral (buccopharyngeal) fascia

Posterior: Alar fascia

Lateral: Continuous with the lateral pharyngeal space from the base of the skull to the hyoid bone. Inferior to the hyoid, the carotid sheath forms the lateral boundary.

Medial: Midline structure

Contents: Areolar connective tissue and lymphatic drainage from Waldeyer's ring

Connections: Lateral pharyngeal space, pretracheal space, danger space 4, the space of the carotid sheath, and the mediastinum

Signs and symptoms: Dysphagia, dyspnea, sepsis, neck pain, kyphotic curve posturing, widening of retrotracheal tissues, and symptoms of carotid sheath involvement

Approach: Drainage can be achieved via numerous approaches. The most common approach to the

retropharyngeal space involves an incision placed either anterior or posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (see Figure 13.6). These approaches can also be used to access the pretracheal, visceral, danger space 4, and prevertebral spaces. The anterior SCM approach involves a linear incision made at the anterior border of the SCM from the hyoid bone to a point just superior to the sternum. Sharp dissection proceeds to the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. The SCM, hyoid bone, cricoid cartilage, and carotid sheath are identified. The SCM and carotid sheath are retracted posterolaterally, while the thyroid gland, superior thyroid vessels, and superior laryngeal nerve are retracted medially. If necessary, the inferior thyroid artery, middle thyroid vein, and omohyoid muscle may be sectioned for access. Blunt dissection proceeds between the medial side of the carotid sheath and the pharyngeal constrictor muscles to enter the retropharyngeal space. The retropharyngeal space is explored by finger dissection, and soft drains are placed.

The posterior SCM approach involves a linear incision placed along the posterior border of the SCM muscle from the level of the hyoid bone to the omohyoid muscle. Sharp dissection proceeds to the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. The SCM muscle and carotid sheath are retracted anteriorly, taking care to identify and protect the cervical sympathetic chain attached to the posterior surface of the carotid sheath. The alar fascia is divided to enter the retropharyngeal space. The brachial plexus is protected by keeping the dissection above the omohyoid muscle. The retropharyngeal space is explored, and soft drains are placed

# Key Points

1. The retropharyngeal space is regarded as the main pathway for the spread of odontogenic infections to the mediastinum. As such, infections involving the retropharyngeal space should be managed aggressively, often with the establishment of a surgical airway. Retropharyngeal abscesses extending below the superior mediastinum are an indication for prompt thoracotomy.  
2. The posterior approach to the retropharyngeal space avoids the branches of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein.  
3. An intraoral surgical approach is acceptable for localized retropharyngeal infections in the pediatric population.

Pretracheal Space (Perivisceral Space, Paravisceral Space, Paratracheal Space, Anterior Visceral Space, Prevertebral Part of Visceral Compartment): Anterior Aspect of Grodinsky and Holyoke's Space 3

# Boundaries

Superior: Fusion of the middle and pretracheal (visceral) fascia at the level of the hyoid and thyroid cartilage

Inferior: Anterior portion of the superior mediastinum

Anterior: The middle ( sternothyroid-thyrohyoid) division of the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia

Posterior: The visceral fascia (deep division of the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia) that encloses the thyroid, trachea, and esophagus. Inferior to the level of the inferior thyroid artery, the pretracheal space is separated from the retropharyngeal space by a dense connective-tissue band extending from the lateral esophagus to the wall of the carotid sheath.

Lateral: Carotid sheath

Medial: Midline structure

Contents: Thyroid gland, trachea, esophagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves

Connections: Mediastinum and the retropharyngeal space

Signs and symptoms: Dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia, odynophagia, airway obstruction, anterior neck swelling, and overlying tissue erythema

Approach: Drainage is achieved via an incision placed anterior to the SCM muscle (see Figure 13.6) carried through skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma muscle, and the superficial and the muscular division of the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia. The carotid sheath is identified and retracted posterolaterally with the overlying SCM muscle. The larynx, trachea, and esophagus are identified and explored to expose the abscess for drainage. If necessary, the visceral fascia can be divided to enter the visceral space.

# Key Points

1. The pretracheal space communicates posterolaterally with the retropharyngeal space via a bridge extending around the sides of the thyroid gland, trachea, and esophagus.  
2. The bridge's superior boundary is the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage, and the inferior boundary is the inferior thyroid artery.

# Visceral Space

# Boundaries

Superior: The anterior aspect of the visceral space begins superiorly at the thyroid cartilage, while the posterior aspect originates at the base of the skull.

Inferior: Mediastinum

Anterior: Visceral fascia

Posterior: Visceral fascia

Lateral: Visceral fascia

Medial: Midline structure

Contents: Pharynx, larynx, trachea, esophagus, and thyroid glands

Connections: Retropharyngeal space, pretracheal space, and mediastinum

Signs and symptoms: Dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia, odynophagia, and airway obstruction

**Approach:** The surgical approach to the visceral space is an extension of the approach to the pretracheal space previously described.

# Key Points

Often confused with the visceral compartment, the visceral space is located deep to the surrounding visceral fascia.

Space of the Carotid Sheath (Visceral Vascular Space, Grodinsky and Holyoke's Space 3A, "Lincoln's Highway of the Neck")

# Boundaries

Superior: Base of the skull

Inferior: Root of the neck

Anterior: Carotid sheath

Posterior: Carotid sheath

Lateral: Carotid sheath

Medial: Carotid sheath

Contents: Carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve

Connections: Lateral pharyngeal space, retropharyngeal space, pretracheal space, and the mediastinum

Signs and symptoms: Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, acute deficits of CN-IX through CN-XII, "herald bleeds," septic shock, hematoma of surrounding tissues, and variations in heart rate or speech function

Approach: Drainage is achieved via a transcervical approach along the anterior aspect of the SCM (see Figure 13.6). Once identified, the carotid sheath is opened with an incision placed along the anterior surface between the internal jugular vein laterally and the internal carotid artery medially. After visualization of the contents of the carotid sheath, the carotid sheath can be thoroughly explored for suppuration.

# Key Points

1. The space of the carotid sheath is formed from the confluens of the three layers of the deep cervical fascia.  
2. Superior to the hyoid, the space of the carotid sheath communicates with the posterolateral compartment of the lateral pharyngeal space.  
3. Arteriography, venography, or contrast-enhanced CT are utilized to determine which vessels are at risk, fluid collections, and whether collateral flow to or from the brain is present.  
4. "Herald bleeds" are defined as recurrent unexplained hemorrhaging from the mouth, nose, and/or ear.

# Danger Space #4 (Grodinsky and Holyoke's Space 4)

# Boundaries

Superior: Base of the skull

Inferior: Posterior mediastinum to the level of the diaphragm

Anterior: Alar division of the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia

Posterior: Prevertebral division of the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia

Lateral: Fusion of the alar and prevertebral fascia at the transverse process of the vertebrae

Medial: Midline structure

Contents: Loose connective tissue

Connections: Retropharyngeal space, prevertebral space, and the mediastinum

Signs and symptoms: Mediastinitis, empyema, and sepsis

**Approach:** Drainage is achieved either via a transcervical approach anterior or posterior to the SCM (see Figure 13.6) or via open thoracotomy (see Figure 13.64). With the transcervical approaches, once the retropharyngeal space has been entered, blunt finger dissection is carried posteriorly through the alar fascia to enter the danger space. After exploration and drainage, a large soft drain is inserted into the space.

# Key Points

1. The danger space contains only loose connective tissue, and its two fascial layers (alar and prevertebral) are easily separated, allowing for rapid spread of infection to the posterior mediastinum.

Approaches to the mediastinum  
Figure 13.64. Approaches to the mediastinum.

2. As this is a closed space, oropharyngeal infections occurring within the danger space originate from the retropharyngeal space.

# Prevertebral (Grodinsky and Holyoke's Space 5)

# Boundaries

Superior: Base of the skull

Inferior: Coccyx

Anterior: Prevertebral division of the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia

Posterior: Vertebral bodies

Lateral: Fusion of the prevertebral fascia with the transverse processes of the vertebral bodies

Medial: Midline structure

Contents: Potential space

Connections: Danger space

Signs and symptoms: Neck and back pain and symptoms of deep neck infections

Approach: See "Approach" in the "Retropharyngeal Space" section.

# Key Points

1. Rarely involved with head and neck infections.  
2. Infections of this space most commonly arise from adjacent vertebral bodies, not from oropharyngeal sources (see Figure 13.65).

# Mediastinum

# Boundaries

Superior: First rib  
Inferior: Diaphragm  
Anterior: Sternum  
Posterior: Vertebral column  
Lateral: Pleura  
Medial: Midline structure  
Contents: Carotids, subclavians, aortic arch, thoracic duct, vagus nerves, trachea, esophagus, phrenic nerves, thoracic aorta, superior and inferior vena cavae, azygos vein, splanchnic nerves, the heart, and the lungs  
Connections: Retropharyngeal space, pretracheal space, space of the carotid sheath, and danger space #4  
Signs and symptoms: Pleural and pericardial effusions (tamponade), aspiration pneumonia, bronchial erosion, pyopneumothorax, purulent pericarditis, and esophageal necrosis and rupture  
Approach: Drainage of the mediastinum can be achieved via numerous approaches depending on which compartments are involved. Access to the mediastinum includes the transcervical, the median sternotomy, and the posterolateral thoracotomy approaches (see Figure 13.64). The transcervical approach involves an incision anterior

Prevertebral space

and parallel to the anterior border of the SCM muscle and is extended across the midline anteriorly, over the suprasternal notch. If necessary, tracheotomy tube placement can be incorporated within this incision. The superior portion of the incision is used to drain involved spaces to include the lateral pharyngeal space, the retropharyngeal space, the pretracheal space, and the space of the carotid sheath. At the inferior extent of the incision (overlying the suprasternal notch), the pretracheal space is entered, and blunt finger dissection proceeds subternally into the superior mediastinum to the level of the tracheal bifurcation. A posterior finger sweep is performed around the paraesophageal structures. Finger dissection continues posterior to the esophagus, the alar fascia is penetrated, and danger space 4 is entered. The superior division of the mediastinum can be effectively explored to the level of T-4. After drainage, debridement, and irrigation, soft silicone rubber suction drains are placed to avoid erosion of vital structures. Drains are placed to closed suction. Thoracotomy tubes may be

inserted to rule out empyema. The median sternotomy approach (see Figure 13.64) involves a vertical incision from the sternal notch to the xiphoid process. The sternum is divided and spread to allow access to both the right and left thorax. The pleura is opened in its anteromedial aspect. This approach is used for infections involving the anterior mediastinum. The posterolateral thoracotomy approach (see Figure 13.64) involves placing the patient in a lateral decubitus position. An incision is made obliquely between the spinous processes and the medial border of the scapula inferiorly to approximately one finger breadth below and in front of the tip of the scapula. The latissimus dorsi muscle may be divided; however, many surgeons prefer to spare this muscle and mobilize its lateral and inferior edge to facilitate additional exposure. The serratus anterior muscle is typically not divided, but is simply mobilized along its lateral border. The chest is entered through the fifth intercostal space. The posterior portion of the sixth rib is often divided to facilitate exposure and to minimize the risk of breaking the rib. This approach is used for infections involving the posterior mediastinum.

# Key Points

1. The overwhelming majority of cases of oropharyngeal mediastinitis originate from retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscesses, are polymicrobial in nature, and involve both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  
2. In patients with descending mediastinitis from odontogenic origin, the spread of the infection begins at a level superior to the hyoid bone. Drains are placed into all involved spaces and extend from the skull base to the mediastinum. Skin edges are loosely closed to allow for additional drainage.  
3. Treatment of descending mediastinitis involves early and aggressive surgical drainage, definitive airway management, and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy directed at both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  
4. The transcervical approach allows access to the superior division of the mediastinum only. Once the infection has extended beyond the retropharyngeal space, involves the posterior mediastinum, or spreads inferior to the level of T-4 or tracheal bifurcation, the transcervical approach should be combined with transthoracic drainage. In general, there should be a low threshold for combining transcervical and transthoracic exploration.  
5. Patients who have undergone previous transcervical mediastinum drainage and who develop sepsis or fail to improve should undergo prompt transthoracic drainage.  
6. The median sternotomy allows for drainage of infections that have spread inferior to the carina or the T-4 level and involve the anterior mediastinum. The posterolateral thoracotomy allows for drainage of infections that involve the posterior mediastinum.

7. Postoperative spiral CT scans of the head and chest with contrast should be used to evaluate drain placement. Additional drainage procedures are required in patients with undrained purulence, in patients whose purulent collections reaccumulate, and in patients whose clinical symptoms fail to improve.

Inferior: The periosteal attachment of the orbicularis oculi muscle

Anterior: Orbicularis oculi muscle

Posterior: Orbital septum

Lateral: The periosteal attachment of the orbicularis oculi muscle

Medial: The periosteal attachment of the orbicularis oculi muscle

Contents: Fat and areolar connective tissue

Connections: Canine space and orbital space

Signs and symptoms: Periorbital edema and ecchymosis

Approach: Drainage of the lower lid is achieved via an intraoral approach. An incision is placed within the maxillary buccal vestibule. Blunt dissection proceeds cephalically through the canine space (see Figure 13.3) to the orbital rim. The periorbital space is entered with a hemostat and explored. A dependent drain is placed and exits through the transoral incision. The preseptal space may also be approached via the orbital space (see the "Orbital Space" section.)

# Key Points

1. Infections of the periorbital space are most commonly from contiguous spread from the canine space.  
2. Periorbital space infections require urgent drainage to avoid spread to the cavernous sinus.
