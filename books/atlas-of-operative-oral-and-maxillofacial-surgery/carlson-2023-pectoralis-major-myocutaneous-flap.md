# Procedure: Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap (i.e., Pec Flap)

A soft tissue reconstructive surgical technique capable of providing oral lining and facial cover tissue. This technique has historically been designated the workhorse flap of head and neck soft tissue reconstruction due to its versatility and predictability. The pec flap is described and implemented in the immediate reconstruction of patients undergoing ablative cancer surgery, but it is also useful in the delayed reconstruction of facial trauma patients requiring soft tissue reconstruction. The pec flap is indicated in the reconstruction of soft tissue radiation necrosis of the oral and maxillofacial region.

# Indications

1. Salvage soft tissue reconstructive surgery for failed free microvascular flap reconstructions of the oral and maxillofacial region.  
2. Primary method of reconstruction of the oral and maxillofacial region, where systemic medical comorbidity (peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiopulmonary failure, renal insufficiency, etc.) refutes the execution of a microvascular flap for reconstruction due to small and large vessel diseases.  
3. Immediate reconstruction of oral lining (floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, mandibular gingiva) and lower third facial/neck tissue coverage in patients undergoing ablative cancer surgery of the oral and maxillofacial region.  
4. Delayed reconstruction of oral lining and lower facial/ upper neck tissue coverage in patients who have experienced avulsive trauma of the oral and maxillofacial region.  
5. Reconstruction of oral lining and lower facial/upper neck tissue coverage in patients undergoing surgical treatment of radiation tissue injury of the oral and maxillofacial region.  
6. Immediate muscular coverage of the carotid artery in patients who have undergone radical and modified radical neck dissections.

# Contraindications

1. Excessive trauma sustained by the subclavian artery during the placement of a central venous catheter that compromises the integrity of the thoracoacromial artery. Preoperative angiography is indicated when an injury is suspected to this primary pedicle that might otherwise result in inadequate vascularity to the pectoralis major muscle if myocutaneous flap development were to be performed.  
2. Midfacial, upper third facial, and maxillary soft tissue defects where the arc of rotation and length of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is overestimated and insufficient.  
3. Excessively large skin paddle is required to perform the reconstruction. Women can undergo pectoralis major myocutaneous flap development with closure of the donor site with larger skin paddles than men due to the redundancy of the female breast. Skin grafting of the chest wall is not advisable in the event of difficulty accomplishing a primary closure of the chest wall due to the likely development of postoperative symptomatic costochondritis.

# Anatomy

# Pectoralis Major Muscle

The pectoralis major muscle is a broad, flat, fan-shaped muscle that covers the pectoralis minor, subclavius, serratus anterior, and intercostal muscles on the anterior chest wall. The pectoralis major muscle originates from the medial one-half to two-thirds of the clavicle, the lateral portion of the entire sternum and the adjacent cartilages of the first six ribs, and the bony portions of the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. The muscle inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus.

The muscle's primary blood supply is from the thoracoacromial artery that arises as the second branch of the axillary artery coming off the subclavian artery. Secondary pedicles include the lateral thoracic and superior thoracic arteries. The pectoralis major muscle receives its motor

innervation from the medial and lateral pectoral nerves that develop from the brachial plexus.

Three major segmental subunits of the pectoralis major muscle exist including a clavicular segment, a sternocostal segment, and a laterally placed external segment. The clavicular segment arises from the mid-clavicular area and receives its blood supply from the deltoid branch of the thoracoacromial artery, and receives its motor innervation from branches of the lateral pectoral nerve. The sternocostal segment accounts for most of the pectoralis major muscle and receives its blood supply from the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial artery with its motor nerve supply from the medial and lateral pectoral nerves. The external segment has a variable blood supply with contributions from the lateral thoracic and thoracoacromial arteries.

The motor action of the pectoralis major muscle is to medially rotate and adduct the humerus. Development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is of little functional detriment as the latissimus dorsi muscle compensates for adductor activity once provided by the pectoralis major muscle.

The deltopectoral groove represents the anatomic junction of the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles through which the cephalic vein passes.

Bony landmarks of importance in the development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap include the clavicle and the manubrial notch, and xiphoid process that demarcate the midline of the chest wall.

Soft tissue landmarks of importance in the development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap include the nipple and, in the case of a woman and obese male, the infra-mammary crease.

# Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap Surgical Technique

1. Development of the recipient tissue bed prior to the development of the myocutaneous flap is paramount in the performance of reconstruction with the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. In the case of immediate reconstruction of an ablative soft tissue defect, the delivery of the cancer specimen permits a quantitative measurement of the defect with the subsequent design of this skin paddle size on the chest wall. Mild over-correction of skin paddle size is advisable due to the anticipated contracture of the skin paddle during flap development. In the case of an avulsive traumatic defect, the release of scar tissue in the recipient tissue bed permits a more accurate appreciation and increased measurement of the skin paddle requirement and subsequent design of this skin paddle size on the chest wall. Simultaneous recipient and donor site surgeries may result in the development of a skin paddle that is of insufficient size with resultant inadequate reconstruction of the defect.

2. Following the determination of the required skin paddle size, the skin paddle is designed on the chest wall in a configuration located medial and inferior to the nipple (see Figure 69.10 in Case Report 69.1). The measured skin paddle size is slightly overcorrected when designing the skin paddle on the chest wall to reduce tension on the closure at the recipient site, thereby reducing possible dehiscence at the recipient site. In the case of a woman, the infra-mammary crease represents the inferior aspect of the skin paddle.  
3. A curvilinear incision is designed on the chest wall that connects the medial aspect of the skin paddle to the region approximating the greater tubercle of the humerus.  
4. The dissection begins by incising the skin and subcutaneous tissues about the proposed incision. Utilizing the electrocautery unit, the deeper dissection occurs to the level of the pectoralis major muscle fascia that is maintained on the ventral aspect of the muscle (see Figure 69.11 in Case Report 69.1). This dissection proceeds superiorly to the region of the clavicle, supero-laterally to the deltopectoral groove, inferolaterally to the free margin of the pectoralis major muscle, and medially to the region of the lateral aspect of the sternum.  
5. The deep dissection about the skin paddle must not undermine the skin paddle and risk its viability. The circumferential dissection of the skin paddle extends deeply to the pectoralis fascia superiorly and to the rectus abdominus fascia inferiorly. Often, the inferior dissection will divulge that the skin paddle is not supported by underlying pectoralis major muscle. This realization does not jeopardize the skin paddle's viability. The skin paddle should be temporarily sutured to the underlying pectoralis major fascia and possibly to the inferiorly located rectus abdominus fascia to protect its blood supply during flap elevation.  
6. The elevation of the myocutaneous flap begins by elevating the rectus abdominus fascia off its muscle that inserts on the inferior aspect of the sixth rib. The entirety of the pectoralis major muscle is elevated off the ribs' superficial surfaces, as well as the intercostal muscles encountered thereafter. This technique continues from the free margin of the pectoralis major muscle laterally to the origination of the muscle medially. In general, approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  of pectoralis major muscle is preserved on the lateral aspect of the sternum in the development of the myocutaneous flap. Further superior dissection on the dorsal surface of the pectoralis major muscle will identify the pectoralis minor muscle. In addition, as the myocutaneous flap is mobilized superiorly, the axial vessels will be identified within the deep surface of the muscle. Retraction of the muscle during its elevation is important to avoid inadvertent trauma to the primary and secondary pedicles of the flap.

7. Perforators from the intercostal artery coursing through the intercostal muscles and perforators from the internal mammary artery coursing in the parasternal region should be anticipated, identified, and properly coagulated or ligated during the dissection to prevent postoperative bleeding.  
8. The insertion of the pectoralis major muscle at the greater tubercle of the humerus is identified superolaterally. The cephalic vein is identified in the deltopectoral groove. The disinsertion of the pectoralis major muscle is performed in an incremental fashion with the electrocautery unit while preserving the cephalic vein. Complete disinsertion is typically required to realize an effective arc of rotation of the myocutaneous flap into the recipient tissue bed.  
9. A bipedicled neck flap is required to transfer the myocutaneous flap into the neck and ultimately into the oral cavity. This bipedicled neck flap serves to communicate the dissection of the neck with that of the chest wall. The bipedicled neck flap is created deep to the platysma muscle and superficial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle. The bipedicled neck flap is created in this surgical plane from the neck approach as well as from the chest wall approach after which the communication is created that must have the breadth of five fingers to not constrict the flap's vasculature.  
10. The myocutaneous flap is transferred deep to the bipedicled neck flap and into the upper neck or oral cavity (see Figure 69.12 in Case Report 69.1). The previously placed skin paddle sutures are removed prior to initiating the closure of the skin paddle to the oral mucosa (see Figure 69.14 in Case Report 69.1) or facial/neck skin to complete the reconstruction.  
11. Two suction drains are placed in the chest wall donor site. One is typically oriented vertically toward the disinsertion of the muscle and one is placed in a dependent horizontal fashion. The chest wall is closed in anatomic layers with staples placed at the skin surface.  
12. Two suction drains are commonly placed in the neck. If a neck dissection was performed, one drain will be placed in the carotid sheath area and one drain will be placed in the submental triangle. The neck is closed in anatomic layers with sutures placed at the skin surface.

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients often maintain their endotracheal intubation with weaning ventilator support for approximately 24 hours postoperatively due to the magnitude of the pectoralis major myocutaneous surgery.  
2. Intravenous antibiotics are routinely ordered perioperatively and with a postoperative duration by the preference and experience of the surgeon.

3. Perioperative corticosteroid administration is of benefit to patients due to excessive airway swelling that might occur when oral lining reconstruction was performed. If significant, oral swelling can prolong the time required to maintain the endotracheal tube postoperatively and might require that the patient undergo a tracheotomy.  
4. The chest wall suction drains are maintained in place until trends in their drainage identify the ability to remove the drains, typically at 10 days postoperatively.  
5. The skin staples on the chest wall are also removed at approximately 10 days postoperatively.  
6. Patients undergoing oral lining reconstruction with the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap are usually fed via nasogastric feeding tube that is maintained until acceptable healing without signs of infection or wound breakdown is realized within the oral cavity. This required healing period is commonly two to four weeks postoperatively.

# Complications

# Early Complications

1. Bleeding: Rare, but may can result from ineffective coagulation or ligation of perforators from the intercostal or internal mammary vessels. In addition, ineffective coagulation of the disinsertion site at the greater tubercle of the humerus can lead to clinically significant postoperative bleeding. A return to the operating room is usually required for evacuation of a postoperative hematoma with coagulation of the offending vessel (s).  
2. Infection: Rare. Reduced with the use of copious irrigation of the oral cavity, neck, and chest wall intraoperatively and with the use of perioperative antibiotics. Drainage with culture-directed antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice.  
3. Dehiscence: Related to movement of the oral tissues during function, particularly in the region of the midline due to mentalis pull. Managed with conservative measures including local wound care, and complete healing is realized if reconstruction bone plate exposure does not occur. Developing and placing a skin paddle of slightly larger size than is required (overcorrection) will decrease tension on the closure and decrease the likelihood of dehiscence postoperatively.

# Late Complications

1. Skin paddle necrosis: Marginal or complete skin paddle necrosis is occasionally observed. Most cases occur in women with pendulous breasts, whereby a significant volume of fat separates the skin paddle and underlying muscle of the pec flap.

2. Lip incompetence: The weight of the myocutaneous flap is such that inferior migration of the lower lip may occur during healing. As such, maintenance of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve during neck dissection is essential to maintain motor innervation of the lower lip. The loss of motor innervation of the lower lip and the weight of the myocutaneous flap will prevent lip competence in the postoperative period. Failure to maintain lip competence compromises the patient's ability to successfully take an oral diet. This problem becomes clinically noticeable with the resolution of surgical edema and the development of scar tissue in the recipient tissue bed.  
3. Recurrent disease: The bulk of the pectoralis major muscle may hide early recurrence in the neck that might otherwise be readily detectable by palpation. As such, obtaining computed tomograms might be necessary in patients who underwent the placement of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap whose neck dissection specimens showed microscopic evidence of metastatic nodal disease with or without extracapsular extension.

# Key Points

1. The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is supplied primarily by the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial artery and secondarily by the lateral thoracic artery and the superior thoracic artery. The incorporation of primary and secondary pedicles in the myocutaneous flap reduces the complication of partial or total loss of the skin paddle. This is a departure from the originally described technique for the development of this myocutaneous flap based exclusively on the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial artery.  
2. The skin paddle of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap can reconstruct oral lining, facial skin coverage, or can be split to simultaneously reconstruct oral lining and facial tissue defects.  
3. The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is ideally suited to reconstruct oral soft tissue within the floor of mouth, ventral tongue, mandibular gingiva and inferior buccal mucosa and the skin of the lower third of the face. This flap does not practically possess an acceptable arc of rotation or length to reconstruct oral mucosa within the maxillary gingiva, palate, or the skin of the upper two-thirds of the face.  
4. A preoperative quantitative assessment of the ratio of the chest wall length to the neck length is important

to determine when considering the selection of a myocutaneous flap for oral and maxillofacial reconstruction. It is important to ensure that the distance from the proposed skin paddle to the clavicle exceeds the distance from the recipient tissue bed to the clavicle before committing to the use of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. A long neck and relatively shorter chest wall length will impair the arc of rotation of this flap into the recipient tissue bed. Conversely, a short neck and long chest wall is favorable in terms of the execution of the pec flap.

5. This myocutaneous flap is value-added in its ability to cover the carotid artery when performed in conjunction with a radical or modified radical neck dissection where exposure of the carotid artery occurs.  
6. The skin color of the chest wall is generally not identical to the upper neck/facial skin such that a color mismatch will occur when performing a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for facial/neck coverage reconstruction.

# Case Report

Case Report 69.1. Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction of oral cancer defect. An 86-year-old male patient presents for the evaluation of a left-sided facial swelling of 3-month duration. Physical examination demonstrated a  $4\mathrm{cm}$  exophytic growth to the left posterior mandibular ridge. CT scans identified a left-sided mandibular mass with bone erosion without lymphadenopathy. An incisional biopsy revealed a high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The patient was treated with composite resection of the left mandibular gingiva, mandible, and prophylactic three-level neck dissection. Final pathology of the composite resection identified that the tumor invaded into the bone with perineural invasion. Bone and tissue margins were negative. Eight of the 29 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The soft tissue defect was reconstructed with a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap with the skin paddle sutured to the oral mucosa for reconstruction of the oral lining. At 4 months postoperative, the patient developed a palpable mass to the left parotid gland. The patient underwent a left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Final pathology identified metastatic high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Unfortunately, the patient passed away 6 months postoperatively (see Figures 69.1 through 69.18).
