# Surgical Management Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws (MRONJ)

Eric R. Carlson

Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Tennessee Medical Center, University of Tennessee Cancer Institute, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA

# Definition of MRONJ

Exposed necrotic bone in a patient receiving intravenous or oral bisphosphonate therapy that has persisted for 8 weeks or greater and without a history of radiation or other metastatic diseases.

# MRONJ Staging and Treatment

Stage 0. No clinical evidence of necrotic bone, but nonspecific clinical findings, with positive radiographic changes and symptoms.  
Stage I. Exposed and necrotic bone, or fistula that probes to bone in patients who are asymptomatic and have no signs of infection.  
Stage II. Exposed and necrotic bone, or fistula that probes to bone, associated with infection as evidence by pain and erythema in the region of the exposed bone with or without purulent drainage.  
Stage III. Exposed and necrotic bone, or fistula that probes to bone in patients with pain, infection, and one or more of the following: exposed and necrotic bone extending beyond the region of alveolar bone resulting in pathologic fracture, extraoral fistula, oral antral/oral nasal fistula, or osteolysis extending to the inferior border of the mandible or sinus floor.

# Causes of MRONJ in Patients Receiving Bisphosphonate Therapy

Dentoalveolar surgery that impacts bone Dental implants

Duration of bisphosphonate therapy-increased risk with increased cumulative doses of the drug

Patients undergoing cancer treatment (chemotherapy)

Concurrent use of chronic systemic steroids

# Signs and Symptoms of MRONJ

Pain

Exposed necrotic bone

Purulent discharge

Fistula formation

Tissue erythema

Loose or mobile teeth

Paresthesia

# Diagnosis

History of bisphosphonate therapy

Exposed area of bone persisting for 8 weeks or greater

No history of head and neck radiation therapy

# Radiographic Evaluation of MRONJ

Numerous imaging modalities may be utilized to evaluate for surgical management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ), including plain film assessment and advanced imaging with computerized tomograms (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans), and positron emission tomography/computerized tomograms (PET/CT scans).

# Radiographic Evidence of MRONJ

Alveolar bone loss or resorption not attributable to chronic periodontal disease

Changes in trabecular pattern of bone

Regions of osteosclerosis

Thickening or obscuring of the periodontal ligament

# Treatment Strategies

Stage 0. Systemic management, including the use of pain medication and antibiotics  
Stage I. Antibacterial mouth rinse, clinical follow-up on a quarterly basis, and patient education and review of indications for continued bisphosphate therapy  
Stage II. Systemic treatment with oral antibiotics, oral antibacterial mouth rinse, pain control, and debridement to relieve soft tissue irrigation and infection control  
Stage III. Antibacterial mouth rinse, antibiotic therapy and pain control, and surgical debridement/resection for long-term palliation of infection and pain

# Indications for Marginal or Segmental Resection

1. Patients who display persistently exposed bone following sequestrectomies or minor debridement surgeries with persistent pain and symptoms.  
2. Exposed necrotic bone for greater than 8 weeks for palliative pain control or infection that fails conservative therapy.  
3. Patients in whom metastatic disease is suspected in their focus of osteonecrosis.

# Contraindications

1. Exposed, necrotic bone that spontaneously sequesters or can be easily removed in an office setting whereby a durable healing response is noted thereafter.  
2. Patients who are not acceptable candidates (inoperable) for general anesthesia due to significant medical comorbidity.  
3. Patients who are not in effective remissions of multiple myeloma as noted by higher-than-normal beta-2 microglobulin determinations or persistent M-spikes on serum protein electrophoresis studies.  
4. Patients with increasing (non-stable) burdens of metastatic disease related to their primary cancers that required the administration of intravenous antiresorptive therapy.  
5. Cancer patients who are not expected to live for a meaningful period of time postoperatively that would justify surgical resection of their MRONJ. This period of time is variably defined oncologically, but 6 months is arguably applied in planning surgical treatment for MRONJ.  
6. Patients who will not consent to surgical resection.

# Surgical Technique

Maxillary Resection (See Figure 15.1 through 15.3 in Case Report 15.1)

1. The approach to maxillary resection is transoral. A sulcular incision is placed about the maxillary teeth

when the patient is dentate and an incision at the alveolar crest is placed in regions of the maxilla that do not contain teeth or in fully edentulous patients. The length of the incision should be sufficient to appreciate the full extent of the necrotic bone as well as viable bone at the periphery of the resection. Anterior and posterior oblique soft tissue incisions are created to prevent tearing of the gingiva that would compromise future soft tissue healing, and to access the posteriorly located buccal fat flap. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is developed in the area of the planned resection.

2. A resection of the maxilla is planned with a  $1\mathrm{cm}$  linear margin of bone based on the preoperative CT and confirmed intraoperatively based on the appearance of the bone. A reciprocating saw is utilized to complete the resection with substantial saline irrigation to prevent burning of healthy surrounding bone. A gradual anterior slope is designed with anterior and posterior resection through an extraction socket, as indicated. Smooth, curvilinear anterior and posterior margins are created in the lateral wall of the maxilla. The pterygomaxillary junction is released, as required. An osteotome is utilized to complete the resection initiated by the reciprocating saw and the specimen is removed. Hemostasis is achieved and the bone margins are inspected and smoothed with a bone bur with substantial saline irrigation. The Schneiderian membrane is inspected and typically removed.  
3. The maxillectomy and Schneiderian membrane specimens are submitted to pathology for permanent section histopathologic analysis and a request to rule out cancer is made when the patient has an underlying history of cancer that resulted in the administration of intravenous antiresorptive medication. The buccal fat pad is teased into the maxillary sinus defect and secured to surrounding soft tissues to permit a two-layer soft tissue closure to prevent the development of a postoperative oral-antral fistula. The mucosa is advanced over the buccal fat pad and closed primarily in a tension-free fashion.

# Surgical Technique

Mandibular Marginal Resection (See Figure 15.4 through 15.6 in Case Report 15.2)

1. The approach to marginal mandibular resection is transoral. A sulcular incision is placed about the mandibular teeth when the patient is dentate and an incision at the alveolar crest is placed in regions of the mandible that do not contain teeth or in fully edentulous patients. The length of the incision should be sufficient to appreciate the full extent of the necrotic bone as well as viable bone at the periphery of the resection. An oblique releasing incision is commonly required

posteriorly to properly access the superior mandible for resection and to prevent tearing of the soft tissues that would compromise future soft tissue healing. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is developed in the area of the resection and surrounding bone with ease in gentle retraction of the soft tissues.

2. A  $1\mathrm{cm}$  linear bone margin is planned and initiated with a fissure bur under substantial saline irrigation. Teeth are removed, as required, and the marginal resection is completed through the mid-extraction sockets of teeth at the periphery of the resection.  
3. The specimen is removed and submitted to pathology for permanent section histopathologic analysis and a request to rule out cancer is made when the patient has an underlying history of cancer that resulted in the administration of intravenous antiresorptive medication. The margins of the marginal mandibular resection are smoothed with a bone bur. The oral mucosa is undermined and advanced to permit primary mucosal closure without tension.

# Surgical Technique

Mandibular Segmental Resection (See Figure 15.7 through 15.23 in Case Report 15.3)

1. The approach to segmental mandibular resection typically occurs through a transcutaneous approach, although a transoral approach can be utilized. A transcutaneous approach to the mandible occurs in anatomic layers with wide exposure of the necrotic bone of the mandible and surrounding viable bone.  
2. If a reconstruction bone plate is planned as the desired form of reconstruction, the plate is placed on the intact mandible and removed, followed by resection of the mandible and replacement of the bone plate. If an immediate microvascular fibular reconstruction is planned as the desired form of reconstruction, resection guides are placed on the planned distal and proximal segments of the mandible and bicortical screw holes are drilled followed by initiation of the resection according to the guides.  
3. Teeth are removed in the area of the resection and a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is elevated orally. A lateral decortication of the mandible is performed if a nerve graft is planned, and the nerve is identified in the proximal mandible.  
4. The mandibular resection is completed through the neck. The bone margins are smoothed with a bone bur and substantial saline irrigation. The oral mucosa is primarily closed without tension if a skin paddle is not required for oral lining.  
5. The bone plate is placed to stabilize the segmental defect of the mandible with or without immediate bone graft reconstruction. The nerve graft is performed prior to placement of the bone graft if the microvascular fibular

is performed. The transcutaneous approach is closed in a tension-free layered fashion and a drain is placed in the neck as part of the anatomical closure.

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients undergoing marginal mandibular resections and partial maxillectomies for MRONJ are commonly discharged to home following these surgeries, depending on the need for in-hospital management of comorbid disease, recovery from anesthesia, and pain management. If discharged to home, instructions are to avoid the use of a straw, to practice immaculate oral hygiene, to avoid smoking, and to maintain a soft non-chewing diet. An office visit is scheduled for 1 week postoperatively.  
2. Patients undergoing segmental mandibular resection for MRONJ are typically admitted to the hospital postoperatively. An intensive care unit admission is common for patients following resection and immediate microvascular fibular reconstructions, while a non-ICU setting is common for patients undergoing segmental resection and bone plate placement.  
3. Enteral tube feeds are commonly administered for short periods (30 days or less) for patients following immediate fibular microvascular graft reconstruction of the mandible.  
4. Patients undergoing segmental resection and immediate fibular microvascular bone graft reconstruction present to the office for neck suture removal and drain removal between 7 and 10 days postoperatively.  
5. Patients undergoing segmental resection and bone plate placement present to the office for neck suture removal and drain removal between 7 and 10 days postoperatively.  
6. Following, partial maxillectomy, marginal mandibular resection, and segmental mandibular resection with or without immediate bone graft placement, oral mucosal sutures are removed at approximately 3 weeks postoperatively.

# Complications

# Early Complications

Mucosal dehiscence with exposure of viable bone margins: Most commonly, these areas of dehiscence do not heal favorably in cancer patients, medically compromised patients, and patients who smoke such that consideration should be given to performing additional resection. Under these circumstances, patients who develop refractory disease related to a marginal resection of the mandible should be planned for segmental resection following additional imaging. Patients who develop refractory disease following segmental resection of the mandible should be planned for additional (extended) segmental resection following additional imaging.

Properly performed maxillary resections rarely develop refractory disease, but if refractory disease occurs, additional imaging should take place and additional maxillary resection should be performed.

Development of an oral-antral fistula following maxillary resection: A two-layer closure with a buccal fat pad and mucosal advancement flap is the best means to prevent an oral-antral fistula related to maxillary resection. When an oral-antral fistula develops following maxillary resection, correction should begin with repeat CT imaging to determine if additional necrotic bone exists.

Postoperative infection: Infections most commonly occur in patients who were infected at the time of resection of the mandible. Postoperative infections must be expeditiously addressed to avoid a biofilm on the mandibular reconstruction bone plate that would require its future removal. Culture-directed antibiotic therapy is warranted in all cases of postoperative infection related to resection for MRONJ. Oral antibiotics are typically begun and intravenous antibiotics are indicated if infections are refractory to oral antibiotics.

Bleeding: Postoperative bleeding is typically a reflection of inadequate hemostasis at the time of surgery. When postoperative bleeding occurs, surgical exploration and hemostasis are required.

# Late Complications

Recurrence of osteonecrosis: This complication most commonly occurs following mucosal dehiscence over viable bone that undergoes necrosis due to the inability for a compromised patient to effectively produce granulation tissue capable of mucosalization over the viable bone. Recurrence of osteonecrosis also occurs in cancer patients whose burden of metastatic disease is increasing. Recurrent osteonecrosis in multiple myeloma patients typically reflects a non-durable remission (recurrence) of their multiple myeloma.

Bone plate loosening: This complication typically occurs due to the development of osteonecrosis in the screw holes or the surgeon's improper adherence to rigid fixation principles.

Development of second primary focus of osteonecrosis: This is an unpredictable occurrence in the management of patients with MRONJ and supports indefinite follow-up examinations of patients. Second primary osteonecrosis does not represent failure of surgical resection of MRONJ. The same principles of surgical resection of MRONJ apply to the second primary focus of osteonecrosis as they applied to the primary focus of osteonecrosis.

# Key Points

1. All stages of MRONJ may be managed by resection of the mandible and maxilla with curative intent.  
2. Debridement provides palliation of MRONJ, but less frequently cure of disease compared to resection.

3. Bone graft reconstruction of mandibular segmental defects is possible with immediate and early delayed techniques with a variety of donor sites.  
4. The preoperative assessment of patients with MRONJ requires a risk stratification regarding their medical comorbidity and social habits in terms of their predicted ability to heal following resection. Patients therefore require medical optimization and the assessment of metastatic burden of disease in cancer patients. Inoperable patients should be approached with non-surgical methods as surgery would be fraught with failure.  
5. Affording smooth resection margins in bone and careful handling of soft tissues during closure predict healing of MRONJ defects.  
6. A meticulous and tension-free soft tissue closure with careful handling of the oral mucosa is paramount to reducing or eliminating the potential for postoperative soft tissue dehiscence and refractory bone necrosis.  
7. Patients should undergo long-term follow-up regarding resection of MRONJ to assess for late disease recurrence and second primary disease development.  
8. Late recurrence of the osteonecrosis is most commonly seen in cancer patients and is related to an increasing burden of distant metastatic disease.

Case Report 15.3. Mandibular Segmental Resection. A 62-year-old man presents with a medical history significant for multiple myeloma that had been diagnosed eight years earlier. He had been diagnosed with a solitary plasmacytoma of the second lumbar vertebral body (L2) 7 years prior to the establishment of his diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient underwent radiation therapy to L2 and a spinal fusion thereafter. He underwent the administration of pamidronate for 3 years followed by 5 years of zoledronate. He developed osteonecrosis of the mandible approximately 5 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient with no evidence of facial edema, no cutaneous fistulas, and no evidence of gross infection. On intraoral examination, the patient exhibited exposed necrotic and infected bone to the right posterior mandible with purulence. Radiographic evaluation depicted bilateral mandibular alveolar bone loss, trabecular bone changes, and regions of osteosclerosis. The patient underwent virtual surgery planning (VSP) for a bilateral mandibular resection and immediate reconstruction with a fibular microvascular bone graft (see Figure 15.7 through 15.23).
