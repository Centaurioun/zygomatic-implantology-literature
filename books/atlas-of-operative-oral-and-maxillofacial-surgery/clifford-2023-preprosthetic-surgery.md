# Procedure: Fibrous Tuberosity Reduction

A procedure performed to reduce excessive soft tissue from the maxillary tuberosities.

# Indications

1. Excessive soft tissue tuberosity  
2. Interference with prosthetic rehabilitation  
3. Infection, ulceration, and/or pain  
4. Masticatory dysfunction or trauma

# Contraindications

1. Adequate topography for a retentive and stable prosthesis  
2. Adequate space for prosthetic fabrication

# Surgical Technique: Wedge Reduction

1. The tissue to be excised is marked with a sterile marking pen based on the prosthodontic treatment plan (see Figure 3.1 in Case Report 3.1).  
2. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is administered via posterior superior alveolar and greater palatine nerve blocks. Additional local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected directly within the fibrous tuberosity to aid in hemostasis.  
3. A full-thickness elliptical incision is initiated over the posterior alveolar ridge in the area of desired tissue reduction. The intervening wedge of tissue is removed (see Figure 3.2 in Case Report 3.1). If additional tissue reduction is necessary after the initial wedge resection, additional tissue may be removed from the buccal and/or lingual flaps until the desired reduction is accomplished.  
4. The area is checked for adequacy of reduction and for hemostasis. Tension-free primary closure is performed utilizing 3-0 resorbable sutures (see Figure 3.3 in Case Report 3.1).

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics are prescribed based on the amount of tissue removed.  
2. A clear liquid diet is recommended for 24 hours, with the patient advancing to a regular diet as tolerated.  
3. Saltwater rinses are begun three times a day beginning the day of surgery.  
4. For patients receiving an immediate prosthesis, denture adjustments or relines to the prosthesis are initiated within 72 hours of surgery.

# Complications

1. Hemorrhage: Arterial bleeding from the greater or lesser palatine arteries is controlled with constant, direct pressure.  
2. Infection: Occurs from poor oral hygiene, food impaction, and necrotic tissue resulting from an ill-fitting prosthesis. Management involves improved oral hygiene, chlorohexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  oral rinses, and oral antibiotics.  
3. Tissue necrosis: Typically occurs from a poor-fitting maxillary prosthesis. Treatment involves the relining or removal of the offending prosthesis and the debulking of necrotic tissue.

# Key Points

1. Electrocautery may be used instead of, or in addition to, a surgical scalpel for soft tissue tuberosity reduction. Electrocautery has the advantages of quick application, more ideal hemostasis, and thermal contraction of the tissues. Care should be taken to maintain a layer of overlying periosteum to facilitate bone coverage and tissue regeneration.

# Case Report

Case Report 3.1. A 54-year-old patient presents after a prosthodontic consultation with a referral for the removal of excessive soft tissue from the left maxillary tuberosity

in preparation for a removable partial denture (RPD; see Figures 3.1 through 3.3).

# Procedure: Torus Mandibularis Reduction

A procedure performed to reduce or recontour a bony protuberance, or torus, of the mandible.

# Indications

1. Interference with prosthetic rehabilitation  
2. Infection or ulceration of overlying tissues due to trauma  
3. Pain or impingement of the lingual frenum  
4. Masticatory dysfunction  
5. Negative impact on speech

# C

1. Asymptomatic torus mandibularis  
2. Adequate skeletal relationship and soft and hard tissue architecture for stable and satisfactory prosthetic device fabrication  
3. Systemic factors that influence bone and tissue healing (intravenous bisphosphonates, head and neck radiation, etc.)

# Anatomy

Torus mandibularis are present in  $7.75 - 15\%$  of the population and are found bilaterally in up to  $80\%$  of cases. Mandibular tori occur above the mylohyoid ridge and are typically located within the canine and premolar regions.

# Surgical Technique

1. Torus mandibularis or mandibular tori reductions may be performed with local anesthesia alone or combined with moderate sedation or general anesthesia. Local anesthesia is performed with inferior alveolar and lingual nerve blocks. Additional local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected directly into the mucosa overlying the tori in order to hydro-dissect the thin tissue from the tori (see Figure 3.7 in Case Report 3.2).  
2. Depending on the presence of dentition, a full-thickness lingual circumdental (sulcular) or crestal incision is created within the area of the tori. The incision may be extending anteriorly and posteriorly to allow for complete and tension-free exposure of the tori.  
3. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is elevated and a subperiosteal retractor is placed. The retractor is positioned along the inferior aspect of the torus and reflects the tongue, the contents of the floor of the mouth and the full-thickness tissue flap medially.  
4. Large mandibular tori are typically reduced by scoring the entire superior length of the torus with a fissured bur to a depth of three-fourths of the vertical dimension of the tori. While maintaining a retractor beneath the tori and providing jaw support, a large dental elevator (see Figure 3.8 in Case Report 3.2) or osteotome is used to cleave the tori from the lingual aspect of the mandible in a controlled fashion. Any remaining irregularities after tori reduction are smoothed with an acrylic bur, a bone file, or a rasp. Smaller tori are reduced with an acrylic bur alone.  
5. The surgical site is irrigated, inspected for hemostasis, and closed primarily with resorbable sutures. Flap tears are managed with interrupted resorbable sutures.  
6. Immediate placement of a postoperative stent or tissue conditioned prosthesis is beneficial for large tori reductions.

# Key Points

1. Appropriate placement of a lingual subperiosteal retractor will aid in visualization of the mandibular tori, minimize iatrogenic tissue damage to the mucoperiosteal tissue flap, and protect the tongue and floor-of-the-mouth contents during the procedure.  
2. Care should be taken to remove all sharp edges of bone, particularly at the inferior aspect of the mylohyoid ridge, in order to prevent secondary revisions, lateral tongue ulcerations, and a painful prosthesis.  
3. For large tori, a wedge of excess tissue may be removed (see Figure 3.9 in Case Report 3.2) in order to facilitate closure and to allow for enhanced healing. Redundant tissue will take longer to heal and can interfere with immediate prosthesis placement.  
4. The tissue flaps are not closed in a watertight manner in order to allow for minor drainage from the surgical site to minimize the occurrence of a floor of mouth hematoma. Alternatively, small rents may be intentionally placed within the lingual tissues to allow for drainage. For patients that will receive an immediate prosthesis, care should be taken to relieve the prosthesis prior to placement. The prosthesis should be removed the next day for a 24-hour check and to assess tissue color and perfusion.

Case Report 3.2. A 66-year-old patient presents for the removal of his bilateral mandibular tori and tooth #20 prior to the fabrication of a mandibular RPD. The patient developed chronic food impaction beneath his large tori and occasional pain from frenal impingement as the tori are nearly touching in the midline (see Figures 3.4 through 3.13).

# Procedure: Torus Palatinus Reduction

A procedure performed to reduce or recontour bony protuberances of the midline palate.

# Indications

1. Traumatized mucosa overlying the torus  
2. Interference with speech or deglutition

3. Torus with deep undercutts resulting in food impaction and halitosis  
4. Masticatory dysfunction  
5. Interference with prosthetic rehabilitation  
6. Torus that extends beyond the dam area, preventing prosthetic seal  
7. Pain  
8. Removal prior to the initiation of intravenous bisphosphonates and/or head and neck radiation

# Contraindications

1. Asymptomatic torus  
2. Presence of torus with minimal or no impact on the planned prosthesis  
3. No masticatory impact  
4. No interference with speech or deglutition  
5. Systemic factors that influence bone and tissue healing (intravenous bisphosphonates, head and neck radiation, etc.)

# Anatomy

Maxillary palatal tori occur in approximately  $20\%$  of the population and are characteristically located within the midline of the hard palate.

# Surgical Technique

1. Maxillary tori reduction may be performed with local anesthesia alone or combined with moderate sedation or general anesthesia. Local anesthesia is performed with incisive and bilateral greater palatine nerve blocks. Additional local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected directly into the mucosa overlying the tori in order to hydro-dissect the thin tissue from the tori.  
2. A double-“Y” incision is outlined along the midline of the torus with anterior and posterior releasing incisions (see Figure 3.16 in Case Report 3.3).  
3. A subperiosteal dissection is performed to expose the entire torus and adjacent bone (see Figure 3.17 in Case Report 3.3). Bilateral subperiosteal retractors are placed in order to minimize iatrogenic damage to the tissue flaps.  
4. Large tori may be reduced utilizing a 701 bur to divide the tori into smaller subunits using a grid pattern. A mallet and curved osteotome are used to remove the smaller subunits. Smaller tori are reduced with an acrylic bur alone.  
5. Any remaining irregularities after tori reduction are smoothed with an acrylic bur, a bone file, or a rasp (see Figure 3.18 in Case Report 3.3).  
6. The surgical site is irrigated, inspected for hemostasis, and primarily closed with resorbable sutures (see Figure 3.19 in Case Report 3.3). Flap tears are managed with interrupted resorbable sutures.  
7. Immediate placement of a postoperative stent or tissue-conditioned prosthesis is beneficial for large tori reductions (see Figures 3.14 and 3.15).

# Complications of Mandibular and Maxillary Tori Reductions

1. Wound dehiscence: The mucoperiosteum overlying tori is frequently thin and friable. Postoperative tissue breakdowns are managed with excellent oral hygiene and saline rinses throughout the day and following meals. If a prosthesis is suspected to have contributed to wound dehiscence, the prosthesis is relieved, and a tissue conditioner is placed or the prosthesis is discontinued until healing is completed.  
2. Hematoma formation: Managed within the immediate postoperative period with direct pressure and prosthesis placement. Managed after 24 hours with needle aspiration or exploration with incision and drainage, based on the size of the presenting hematoma.

# Key Points

1. Prefabricated prostheses in the form of a complete denture or a palatal prosthesis (Figure 3.15) are beneficial with large tori reductions to minimize postoperative
