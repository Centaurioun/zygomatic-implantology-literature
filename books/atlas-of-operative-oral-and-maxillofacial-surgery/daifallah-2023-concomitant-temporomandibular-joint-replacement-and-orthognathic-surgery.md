Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders commonly coexist with dentofacial deformities. Ideal treatment often requires two components of surgery, one for the joint itself and the other to correct the facial deformity. If the degree of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is mild (Wilkes I-III), then orthognathic surgery may be indicated initially without TMJ surgery as this may improve TMD symptoms. For severe case of TMJ dysfunction that merit joint replacement, concomitant orthognathic surgery may be indicated. While undergoing orthodontic therapy prior to surgery, the patient should be treated conservatively for their TMD. Arthroscopy and arthrocentesis may be considered as well, prior or subsequently to orthognathic surgery. Patients with TMJ disorders and dentofacial deformity often have an increased or increasing occlusal plane angle, clockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex with hypoplasia of the maxilla and mandible, anterior open bite tendencies, and degenerative TMJ changes. Physical manifestations of the previous issues may result in the loss of vertical ramus height, microgenia, and collapse of the airway resulting in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

# Indications for TMJ Replacement

1. Avascular necrosis of the condyle  
2. Fracture with significant functional or posthealing deformities  
3. Neoplasms  
4. Degeneration or resorption  
5. Developmental deformities  
6. Arthritic conditions  
7. Ankylosis of joint with or without heterotopic bone formation

# Indications for Orthognathic Surgery with TMJ Replacement

1. Dentofacial deformity not correctable by TMJ replacement alone; including maxillary hypoplasia, cant, vertical maxillary excess, condylar hyperplasia, and severe facial asymmetries  
2. Severe TMD with OSA

# Contraindications for Concomitant TMJ and Orthognathic Surgery

1. Acute or chronic local infections  
2. Insufficient quality of bone to support prosthesis placement  
3. Perforations in mandibular fossa, articular eminence or zygomatic arch that would compromise support for the artificial fossa  
4. Partial TMJ reconstructions  
5. Known allergic reaction to any prosthesis components  
6. Psychological or neurological conditions that would make a patient unable or unwilling to follow postoperative care instructions  
7. Unreasonable expectations regarding treatment  
8. Skeletally immature patients - relative contraindication, may be performed knowing future surgeries will likely be indicated  
9. History of foreign body reaction to previous implants - relative contraindication  
10. Systemic disease with increased susceptibility to infection - relative contraindication

# Preoperative Management and Planning

1. Submillimeter slice CT or CBCT in axial orientation  
2. MRI of TMJs for diagnosis

3. Consider CT angiography in ankyloses or syndromic TMJ deformation  
4. Dentofacial measurements  
5. Clinical photos  
6. Panoramic, lateral, and anterior posterior cephalometric radiographs  
7. Cephalometric analysis  
8. Dental casts or intraoral scanning  
9. Collaboration with an orthodontist experienced in orthognathic surgeries  
10. Polysomnography if indication or concerns for OSA

# Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP)

1. Critical component of presurgical planning. Streamlines process permitting digital treatment planning, multiple surgical plans can be evaluated, more efficient surgery with less time required for presurgical lab work  
2. Intraoral scanner can replace the need for physical impressions  
3. Facilitates and more descript understanding of the anatomy of the surgery sites, thus increasing the accuracy of surgery and the quality of surgical outcomes  
4. Essential for fabrication of custom TMJ prosthesis

# Concomitant TMJ Replacement with Orthognathic Surgery Technique

1. Patient is placed  $0^{\circ}$  supine on the operating table with the head in a neutral position. Patient is intubated nasally with a headwrap to secure the endotracheal tube.  
2. An oropharyngeal partition is placed, followed by oral decontamination and isolation of oral cavity to minimize cross-contamination. The surgical sites are prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
3. Anatomical markings are made with a sterile marking pen. Key markings should include the outline of the mandible to include the coronoid process and condyle, the zygomatic arch, and the location of the preauricular and submandibular incisions (see Figure 43.33 in Case Report 43.3).  
4. Subcutaneous infiltration to the extraoral surgical sites with epinephrine containing local anesthetic. Care should be taken to not inject below the SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system), platysma, or temporoparietal fascia in order to protect the facial nerve. The preauricular incisions are made, followed by submandibular incisions.  
5. The preauricular approach begins with outlining the incision at the border of the facial skin with the helix of the ear. The incision extends superiorly to the superior helix. In patients with previous preauricular approaches (multiple operated joints), pre-existing scar bands/scartissue must be excised or incised through. For patients with previously operated joints, anatomy may be atypical with aberrant locations of vessels and the facial nerve.

6. After the incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the temporoparietal fascia is encountered (see Figure 43.34 in Case Report 43.3). A pocket is made anteriorly to the external auditory canal. The superficial temporal artery and vein may be encountered deep to the subcutaneous tissue, which may be ligated or retracted forward. Blunt dissection is continued toward the superficial temporal fascia until the shiny, white, smooth surface of the temporalis fascia is encountered. Care should be taken to avoid injuring the auricular cartilage, which may induce postoperative chondritis. The temporalis fascia is sharply incised parallel to the skin incision and reflected forward. This protects the branch of the facial nerve and anterior branch of the superior temporal artery. The deep temporal vein may be encountered and cauterized as it crosses the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The zygoma is encountered and dissection is carried inferiorly until the capsule of the TMJ is encountered (see Figure 43.35 in Case Report 43.3). The glenoid fossa may be entered superiorly, and the articular disc, if present, is visualized. The disc and condylar tissue may be removed at this time, and the site should be packed with moist gauze while the submandibular approach is made.  
7. The submandibular approach is planned and initiated  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible extending behind the gonial angle. The incision is carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the platysma, hemostasis is achieved with electrocautery. The skin is undermined to facilitate closure and to improve access. The platysma is sharply dissected, exposing the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia (SDCF). The SDCF is bluntly dissected with the aid of a nerve stimulator. If the submandibular gland is encountered, it should be retracted inferiorly. The marginal mandibular nerve is frequently identified within the SDCF or within the investing facia of the submandibular gland (see Figure 43.36 in Case Report 43.3).  
8. The inferior border of the mandible is palpated and blunt dissection is carried superiorly to the pterygomasseteric sling. The inferior border of the pterygomasseteric sling should be sharply transected through its avascular plane to expose the periosteum of the inferior border of the mandible. The masseter is carefully stripped from the lateral mandible to the level of the TMJ capsule. Care must be taken to avoid entering the oral cavity along the retromolar area. A sigmoid notch retractor is used to retract the masseter muscle and to protect masseteric artery.  
9. The capsular components and the disc are removed. Cut guides are applied through the submandibular incision and an osteotomy saw is used to cut along the guide. The osteotomy is completed, the condyle and

coronoid are removed, taking care to strip the muscles from the condyle and coronoid prior to their extraction.

10. Steps 3-9 are completed for the contralateral side for double joint surgery.  
11. Incision sites are packed and isolated. Sterile blue towels are placed around the mouth with a new over drape to access the mouth.  
12. The patient is placed into the intermediate splint and maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) is applied. The mouth is isolated and the patient is reprepped with Povidone-iodine paint.  
13. The fossa and condylar components of the joint prosthesis are implanted and fixated into position (see Figure 43.37 in Case Report 43.3). The fossa component is fixated first, followed by the condylar component (see Figure 43.38 in Case Report 43.3) to the vertical ramus. After implantation, the sites should be copiously irrigated.  
14. The preauricular and submandibular incisions are closed in a layered, tension-free manner.  
15. Afrin soaked pledgets are placed with the nasal cavity and the maxilla is infiltrated with local anesthetic. The intermediate splint is removed and a maxillary anterior vestibular incision is made with subperiosteal dissection of the maxilla in order to expose the buttresses.  
16. The Le Fort I osteotomy is performed and the maxilla downfractured. Septoplasty and turbinate reduction, if indicated, is performed at this time. The patient is placed into the final surgical splint and MMF is applied, ensuring that the condylar prosthesis is seated within the glenoid fossa component. The maxilla is held into its new position using fixation plates. The patient is released from MMF, and the final postoperative occlusion and joint function are assessed.  
17. The maxillary vestibular incision is irrigated and closed with resorbable sutures.  
18. Genioplasty, if indicated, is performed at this time.

# Postoperative Management

1. Skin incisions are protected with triple antibiotic ointment and petroleum impregnated gauze secured with a tubular elastic bandage padded with unfolded gauze.  
2. Patients are admitted for observation and pain management for a minimum of 24 hours.  
3. Anti-emetics are given PRN (pro re nata) to minimize the violent act of emesis with subsequent TMJ dislocation.  
4. A brief course of steroids and intravenous antibiotics are recommended.  
5. Incisions are cared for with the application of triple antibiotics ointment for 5-7 days.

# comitant TMJ Replacement and Orthognathic Surgery

1. Perforation of external ear canal (EAC): May result in chondritis. Managed with antibiotic drops and direct repair dependent on the size of the perforation. Minimized with an understanding of the anatomy of the TMJ region and by following a dissection plane parallel to the external auditory canal (EAC).  
2. Neurovascular injury: Including facial nerve injury, middle meningeal, maxillary artery, and trigeminal V3 hypoesthesia. Minimized by an understanding of the location of the nerves and utilizing a nerve stimulator during dissection.  
3. Malocclusion: Minimizes by following the appropriate surgical plan, ensuring accurate MMF, and ideal condylar prosthesis seating within the fossa component prior to fixating the maxilla.  
4. First bite syndrome: Exquisite pain that occurs with the first bite of meals with a supramaximal contractile response at the first bite. This pain does not recur with subsequent bites until the next meal. Thought to be due to loss of sympathetic innervation to the ipsilateral parotid gland, which leads to denervation of sympathetic receptors located on the parotid myoepithelial cells. These cells also possess parasympathetic receptors which become hypersensitive to parasympathetic stimulation. This may fade over time, several months up to 1 year, or be treated with chemodenervation.  
5. Frey syndrome: Gustatory sweating and flushing resulting from reinnervation of postganglionic parasympathetic neurons to nearby denervated sweat glands and cutaneous blood vessels. Initial treatment consists of anticholinergics or chemodenervation  
6. Infection: Can be categorized into acute and chronic with the 1-month mark differentiating the two. If acute, a TMJ replacement salvage protocol may be initiated, otherwise may require hardware removal. Requires differentiated from a superficial infection (stitch abscess).  
7. Jaw dislocation: Minimized by accurate surgical planning, the use of guides to place components within their appropriate positions and assessing joint function in the operating room prior to closing incisions. Minor postoperative dislocations on extreme openings may be managed with light elastics to aid in reprogramming muscle memory for the patient with a new prosthesis. Frequent postoperative dislocations with simple movements require physical examination and/or radiographs to ensure ideal seating of the condylar prosthesis against the posterior lip of the glenoid fossa prosthesis. After confirmation of condylar prosthesis seating, heavy elastics may be utilized for a short time period to allow for tightening of the TMJ muscles and ligaments to minimize the immediate postoperative laxity of the new joint.

# Key Points

1. For the appropriate patient, concomitant TMJ replacement with orthognathic surgery may reduce the time of treatment, reduce the number of surgeries, and improve outcomes. In cases of degenerative or arthritic conditions, joint replacement will arrest the progression of the disease entirely, whereas the disease process may continue if orthognathic surgery alone is undertaken.  
2. For milder TMJ disease that do not require joint replacement, a conservative approach is recommended until after orthognathic surgery. Orthognathic surgery alone may improve symptoms; however, further disease progression may require future TMJ surgery.

# Case Reports

Case Report 43.1. One-Stage Procedure: Unilateral condylar hyperplasia treated with bilateral total joint replacement and maxillary corrective surgery. A 39-year-old female presents with a 10-year history of occlusal changes and worsening facial asymmetry. The patient was diagnosed with right condylar hyperplasia

Figure 43.1. Preoperative facial view depicting right-sided condylar hyperplasia resulting in facial asymmetry, maxillary cant, and elongation of the right side of the mandible.

3. Virtual surgical planning (VSP) has made the procedure more predictable, improves accuracy, and reduces operating room time, as well as presurgical laboratory work. Further efficiencies can be accomplished with cut guides, 3D printed splints, and pre-bent or custom fabricated plates.  
4. Particular attention should be placed on sterile technique with any joint procedure. Care should be undertaken to protect open sterile surgical sites when transitioning intraorally including separate instrumentation, replacing drapes, re-prepping, and rescrubbing of the operator. The joint prostheses should be placed within a saline-antibiotic solution during try-ins. Try-ins should be limited to minimize tissue damage, edema, and contamination of the prostheses.

resulting in facial asymmetry, excessive maxillary cant, right posterior open bite, TMJ arthralgia, and a deviated nasal septum. The patient was treated with a one-stage surgery involving bilateral total joint replacement, Le Fort I osteotomy, and septoplasty (see Figures 43.1 through 43.13).

Case Report 43.2. One-Stage Procedure: Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) with bilateral condylar degeneration treated with bilateral total joint replacement, maxillary corrective surgery, and genioplasty. A 26-year-old female presents with polyarthralgia, progressively worsening apertognathia, retrognathia, facial asymmetry, and OSA. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis with severe resorption/degeneration of the bilateral mandibular condyles. The patient was treated with a one-stage surgery involving bilateral total joint replacement, Le Fort I osteotomy, genioplasty (anterior sliding osteotomy), inferior turbinate reduction, and septoplasty (see Figures 43.14 through 43.28).

Case Report 43.3. Two-stage procedure: Bilateral condylar hyperplasia without ankylosis treated with bilateral total joint replacement and maxillary corrective surgery. A 24-year-old female presents with severe apertognathia, facial asymmetry, and gross weight loss. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral condylar hyperplasia without ankylosis. The patient exhibited malnutrition and a small stature from the inability to masticate. The patient developed progressive apertognathia and elongation of the maxillomandibular complex as a result on her dentofacial deformity. As the patient could not be brought into occlusion, a two-stage procedure was planned. Stage 1 involved intraoral coronoidectomy and condylectomy. The condylar heads were intentionally left

in place to function as space maintainers. After intraoral gap arthroplasty, the posterior teeth were disarticulated and dental impressions were obtained in the OR. Additionally, a postoperative open bite CT scan (DICOM file) was obtained. The CT scan and the scanned dental models were exported to the total joint manufacturer for VSP. After the occlusion was set, the VSP treatment plan involved a bimaxillary advancement of approximately  $7\mathrm{mm}$ . At the patient's second stage surgery, preauricular and submandibular approaches were utilized to remove the condyles (previously sectioned) and bilateral TMJ Concepts total joints were placed. A Le Fort I osteotomy was performed to advance the maxilla to a more cosmetic and functional position (see Figures 43.29 through 43.40).
