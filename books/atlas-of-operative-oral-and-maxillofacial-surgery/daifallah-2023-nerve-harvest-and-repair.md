# Procedure: Trigeminal Nerve Repair

A method of exploring and repairing significant injuries (Sunderland IV to V degree injuries) to injured trigeminal nerve branches: the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), the lingual nerve (LN), and the infraorbital nerve (ION).

# Indications

1. Witnessed nerve injury: Partial or full diameter nerve damage on direct visual inspection during surgery (including third molar surgery, orthognathic surgery, surgery for maxillofacial trauma, dental implant surgery, and pathology surgery). Repair at the earliest opportunity under microscopic magnification by a trained microsurgeon offers the best outcomes.

Primary repair (immediate) is undertaken if conditions are favorable and there is access, microsurgical expertise, facilities, and time available.

Delayed primary repair (3-7 days) may be undertaken if the wound is contaminated or if the patient's condition, lack of microsurgical expertise, or facilities do not permit immediate repair.

Secondary repair (more than 1 week) may be undertaken if there is no improvement in clinical neurosensory testing.

2. Nerve injury with evidence of encroachment or disruption of the nerve canal (mandibular and infraorbital) on imaging (computed tomography [CT] or cone beam CT)  
3. Non-witnessed nerve injury: Loss or alteration of sensation in the nerve distribution after trauma or injury, without visual evidence of damage, but confirmed Sunderland IV or V degree injury by clinical neurosensory testing or adjunctive testing (magnetic resonance neurography, trigeminal nerve conduction, etc.).  
4. Nerve injury with neuropathic pain: Evidenced by a history of spontaneous or stimulus-evoked burning pain or neuralgic pain in the nerve distribution, with or

without allodynia, hyperpathia, or hyperalgesia confirmed by neuropathic pain testing.

5. Chemical nerve injury: Caustic agents have damaged the nerve (i.e., endodontic irrigation of socket in close proximity to the IAN).

# Contraindications

1. Nerve injury with mild or improving sensory loss or with only partial involvement of the nerve distribution  
2. Nerve injuries with mild or moderate sensory impairment by clinical neurosensory testing and with no evidence of nerve encroachment or disruption on imaging  
3. Nerve injury in the context of life-threatening or more critical injuries, or in unfavorable situations (e.g., a contaminated wound, an unfit patient, or microsurgical expertise or facilities unavailable) for which delayed or secondary nerve repair would be reasonable  
4. Nerve injury resulting from local anesthetic injections  
5. Neuropathic pain of central trigeminal origin or sympathetically mediated pain source  
6. Patient refusal to undergo nerve exploration and repair

# Nonsurgical Management

1. Nonsurgical treatment options for non-painful nerve injuries include observation, medical therapy in the early post-injury phase (e.g., vitamin B complex and steroids), and/or sensory retraining.  
2. Nonsurgical treatment options for nerve injuries with neuropathic pain include medication (i.e., gabapentin, clonazepam, and amitriptyline), therapeutic nerve blocks, physical therapy (i.e., TENS), and/or behavioral therapy.

# Anatomy

Lingual nerve (LN): The LN is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and descends between the medial pterygoid muscle and the ramus of

the mandible. It is joined by the chorda tympani, a branch from the facial nerve,  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the skull base. The chorda tympani carries taste fibers of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The LN lies anterior to the IAN and may be located at a variable height from the crest of the mandible  $(-2$  to  $7\mathrm{mm})$ . The LN may be located above the lingual plate in  $10 - 17.6\%$  of cases. The LN may be in contact with the surface of the lingual cortex  $(22.3 - 62\%)$ , for a maximum horizontal distance of  $7\mathrm{mm}$ . The LN crosses the lateral surface of the hypoglossus muscle and passes deep to the mylohyoid muscle. It lies superior to the submandibular duct and then crosses downward along the lateral aspect of the duct to turn up along its medial side, on the genioglossus muscle. The LN supplies the tongue as it travels forward along its side. The LN is mono- or oligofascicular proximal to the point where the chorda tympani joins it, and becomes polyfascicular near the submandibular ganglion. Its fascicular pattern changes every  $126\mathrm{mm}$  on average from this point forward. The LN supplies sensation to the dorsum, lateral and ventral surfaces of the anterior two-thirds of the ipsilateral half of the tongue, mucous membrane of the ipsilateral floor of the mouth, and lingual gingivae of the mandibular teeth.

Inferior alveolar nerve (IAN): The IAN is a branch of the trigeminal mandibular division. The IAN descends below the lateral pterygoid muscle, curving on the medial pterygoid muscle, to run between the sphenomandibular ligament and mandibular ramus, prior to entering the mandibular foramen. The IAN gives off the mylohyoid branch at the mandibular foramen. The IAN travels with the inferior alveolar artery and vein within the mandibular canal, which descends and proceeds anteriorly in a concave curve and ascends to the mental foramen. The mandibular canal wall has a diameter of  $2.0 - 2.4\mathrm{mm}$  and thins near the mental foramen in  $60 - 80\%$  of patients. The mandibular canal is located higher in the mandible in patients younger than 20 years of age and older than 60 years; it is, in order of vertical proximity, closest to the roots of the mandibular third molar, then the second molar, then the first molar, and furthest from the second premolar. The horizontal distance of the canal from the buccal cortex, in descending order, is the second mandibular molar, the first molar, and the third molar and second premolar. The mandibular canal curves superiorly and posterior-laterally to reach the mental foramen. The mental foramen is typically located at a third of the height of the mandible from the inferior border, and mesiodistally at the second or first premolar. Just before the mental foramen, the IAN branches into the incisive branch, which continues anteriorly under the apices of the incisors, and the mental nerve, which exits the mental foramen to enter the soft tissue as 1-4 branches (mean 2 branches) at an

angle of  $36^{\circ}$  to the fibers of the orbicularis oris muscle. The IAN tends to be polyfascicular with a decreasing number of fascicles more distally; the fascicular pattern changes every  $2\mathrm{mm}$ . The IAN supplies the ipsilateral lower lip (vermilion, skin, and mucosa), the chin, the labial-buccal alveolar mucosa from the midline to the molar region, and the ipsilateral teeth, with some midline crossover in  $31\%$  of cases.

Infraorbital nerve (ION): The ION is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve and enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure to progress forward with the infraorbital artery in the infraorbital groove, infraorbital canal, and infraorbital foramen. The infraorbital foramen is located roughly  $8\mathrm{mm}$  (range 6.2-10.7 mm) below the infraorbital rim and is most commonly located in the same vertical plane as the first maxillary premolar. The foramen has a mean diameter of  $4.5\mathrm{mm}$  (range 1-7 mm) and may present as multiple foramina (2-4) in  $15\%$  of cases. The ION exits the infraorbital foramen to lie between the levator labii superioris and the levator anguli oris muscles. Outside the foramen, the ION divides into several branches, including the inferior palpebral branches supplying the lower eyelid and cheek, the nasal branches supplying the lateral aspect and alar of the nose, and the superior labial branches supplying the upper lip and labial-buccal gingivae from the midline to the second premolar. While in the infraorbital canal, the ION gives off the anterior and middle superior alveolar branches that supply the maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars.

# Surgical Technique for Trigeminal Nerve Repair

1. The patient is positioned supine. The surgical table is positioned to allow two surgeons to sit on either side of the patient's head with an operating microscope (two operator eyepieces, microscope focal distance at  $250\mathrm{mm}$ ) over the patient's head.  
2. General anesthesia is obtained via nasal endotracheal intubation with the tube pointing toward the patient's forehead. A throat pack should be placed.  
3. For lingual nerve repair, a sandbag is placed under the patient's shoulders to elevate the mandible.  
4. The skin and oral cavity are prepped, and local anesthetic containing epinephrine is injected within the operation site for pain control and hemostasis.

# Lingual Nerve Repair

# Access Phase

1. The operating surgeon sits on the same side as the operation site.

2. A modified Dingman mouth gag is utilized to position the mouth open, using the tongue blade to keep the tongue away from the operative site (see Figure 75.1 in Case Report 75.1).  
3. An intraoral mucosal incision is initiated with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel over the ascending ramus to the distal of the mandibular second molar. A buccal extension from the distal of the molar to the buccal sulcus and a lingual extension to the lingual sulcus curving forward to the mandibular first molar are made. The buccal and lingual suprperiosteal flaps are raised with a periosteal elevator and Metzenbaum curved dissecting scissors. The flaps are secured to the modified Dingman frame with 3-0 or 4-0 black silk sutures (see Figure 75.2 in Case Report 75.1).

# Preparation Phase

4. The operating microscope is positioned over the operative field.  
5. The LN is exposed beginning at the healthy nerve proximal and distal to the injury site. Identification of the LN may be aided by locating its surrounding pouch of fat.  
6. The proximal and distal nerve segments are carefully retracted with a vessel loop at each segment.  
7. The nerve is released from the injury site (see Figure 75.3 in Case Report 75.1 and 75.9 in Case Report 75.3), which is usually adherent to the lingual surface of the mandible, with careful microdissection using curved microscissors.  
8. A modified background ( $1 \times 1$  in. neuropatty with the tubing of a small-gauge butterfly venipuncture system inserted and secured with silk sutures; the venipuncture needle is inserted into the lumen of an active suction tubing) is placed beneath the nerve injury site.  
9. The nerve injury is examined under microscopic magnification  $(25\times)$ . The nerve injury may be a complete transection with a neuroma at each end of the nerve stump or a partial transection with a neuroma in continuity.  
10. Excision of the neuroma is carefully performed with straight microscissors. The nerve ends are trimmed to expose the fascicular surfaces (see Figure 75.4 in Case Report 75.1). The nerve site is irrigated with heparin-saline periodically.

11. The nerve segments are reapproximated using 6-0 or 7-0 monofilament sutures (see Figure 75.5 in Case Report 75.1) passed through the epineurium of each segment to the adjacent muscle, so as to facilitate nerve repair without undue tension. A nerve gap of approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  or more usually cannot be coapted without tension and will require a nerve graft (see Figure 75.10 in Case Report 75.3).

# Microsuture Phase

12. The trimmed nerve endings are coapted using the vasa nervorum as a guide to align the nerve segments. 8-0 or 9-0 monofilament sutures on a cutting needle are used to place sutures through the epineurium, including a little perineurium. The first suture is placed at the 12 o'clock position, leaving a longer strand. A second suture is placed at the 4 o'clock position. The suture strands are held in position with microforceps to "flip" the nerve over for access to the other side of the nerve. A similar suture is placed at the 8 o'clock position.  
13. Sutures are placed within the intervening gaps at regular intervals in the coaptation site circumferentially. Typically, 6-8 sutures are required.  
14. The repair site is examined, and excess suture length is trimmed.  
15. Once nerve repair has been completed, the approximating suture and background are carefully removed. Gelloam may be wrapped around the repaired nerve, and the nerve is placed carefully into its bed.

# Wound Closure

16. The operating microscope is moved from the operative field.  
17. The black silk sutures retracting the buccal and lingual mucosal flaps are released and removed.  
18. The operative site is irrigated with saline and carefully suctioned.  
19. The mucosal flaps are released, and the site is closed with 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  
20. The modified Dingman mouth gag and the throat pack are removed.

# Inferior Alveolar Nerve Repair

# Access Phase

1. The operating surgeon is positioned on the opposite side of the operation site. The patient's head is turned to the side opposite of the operation site.  
2. An incision is initiated with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel just above the mandibular sulcus from the midline of the lower lip posteriorly to the ascending ramus.  
3. A subperiosteal flap is raised to expose the mandible from the alveolus to the inferior border, including the mental foramen. The mental nerve is carefully preserved.  
4. A window is created circumferentially around the mental foramen by using a small round bur to make grooves that radiate outward from the mental foramen and then are joined to form windows (see Figure 75.6 in Case Report 75.2). The windows are

carefully fractured with either a Coupland or Warwick James elevator, taking care to avoid the mental nerve. A window is created within the buccal bone over the course of the IAN until the nerve is exposed to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  beyond the injury site (see Figure 75.7 in Case Report 75.2).

5. A scalpel is used to sharply divide the incisive branch and carefully dissect the IAN free from its bed.

# Phase

6. The operating microscope is positioned over the operative field.  
7. The proximal and distal nerve segments are lifted from the mandibular bone with a nerve hook, and a modified neuropathy background is placed beneath the nerve segments.  
8. The nerve injury is examined under microscopic magnification. The nerve injury may be a complete transection or a partial transection with a neuroma in continuity.  
9. The neuroma is carefully excised with straight microscissors, and the nerve ends are trimmed to expose the fascicular surfaces. The nerve site is irrigated with heparin-saline periodically.  
10. The nerve segments are approximated using 6-0 or 7-0 monofilament sutures (see Figure 75.8 in Case Report 75.2) passed through the epineurium of each segment to the adjacent muscle, so as to facilitate nerve repair without undue tension. The distal nerve segment can usually be transposed toward the proximal segment, so a nerve graft is less likely to be necessary.

# Infraorbital Nerve Repair

# Access Phase

The operating surgeon is positioned on the opposite side of the operation site. Depending on the site of the ION injury, two approaches may be used:

1. Cutaneous approach: Utilized when the nerve injury site is proximal to the infraorbital foramen  
2. Intraoral approach: Utilized when the nerve injury site is distal to the infraorbital foramen.

# Cutaneous Approach

1. The globe is protected with a temporary tarsorrhaphy using a 4-0 silk suture or a scleral shell.

![](images/9cec762658d571f77c749c949d55134c1624cf9e9a88537a65a33c5c3b0d364f.jpg)  
Figure 75.7. Site of neuroma-in-continuity within the left inferior alveolar nerve.

2. The subsidiary incision line is marked with a skin marker approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the eyelashes along the length of the lower eyelid. The incision may be extended laterally  $2\mathrm{cm}$  beyond the lateral canthus, curving inferior-laterally along a skin crease.  
3. The subsidiary incision is initiated with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel to the subcutaneous layer, so that the underlying orbicularis oculi muscle is exposed.  
4. Dissect subcutaneously with sharp-curved scissors inferiorly toward the inferior orbital rim. The dissection proceeds through the orbicularis oculi muscle with scissors to the periosteum overlying the inferior orbital rim. A tissue plane between the muscle and septum orbitale is identified.  
5. A skin-muscle flap is elevated from the lower eyelid. The periosteum over the inferior orbital rim is incised with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel a few millimeters below the inferior orbital rim edge. The periosteum is elevated with a periosteal elevator until the infraorbital foramen is reached (7-9mm inferior to the inferior orbital rim).  
6. A groove is created around the infraorbital foramen with a small round bur. Bone is removed from the foramen carefully with Rongeur forceps. The ION is exposed by carefully unroofing the infraorbital canal to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  beyond the nerve injury site.

# Intraoral Approach

7. An intraoral vestibular incision is initiated within the unattached mucosa of the maxillary vestibule from the midline to the zygomatic process.  
8. A subperiosteal flap is raised from the maxilla to expose the infraorbital foramen.  
9. A groove is created around the infraorbital foramen with a small round bur. The bone from the periphery of the foramen is carefully removed with Rongeur forceps.

# Phase

10. The operating microscope is positioned over the operative field.  
11. The proximal and distal nerve segments are lifted from the bone with a nerve hook, and a modified neuropathy background is placed beneath the nerve segments.  
12. The nerve injury is examined under microscopic magnification. The nerve injury may be a complete transection or a partial transection with a neuroma in continuity.  
13. The neuroma is carefully excised with straight microscissors, and the nerve ends are trimmed to expose the fascicular surfaces. The nerve site is irrigated with heparin-saline periodically.  
14. The nerve segments are approximated using 6-0 or 7-0 monofilament sutures passed through the epineurium of each segment to the adjacent muscle, so as to facilitate nerve repair without undue tension.

Microsuture Phase: Follow steps 12-15 of the "Microsuture Phase" subsection of the "Lingual Nerve (LN) Repair" section.

# Wound Closure

15. The operating microscope is removed from the operative field.  
16. The operative site is irrigated with saline and suctioned carefully.  
17. The periosteum is closed with 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures. The skin is re-approximated with 4-0 silk interrupted sutures or with a running 6-0 monofilament suture.  
18. The intraoral mucosal flap is closed with 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  
19. The throat pack is removed.

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics are prescribed routinely, especially if bone removal was involved.  
2. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed, unless a concurrent infection, wound contamination, or systemic risk of immunosuppression is present.  
3. Chlorhexidine mouth rinse is prescribed.  
4. Patients are advised to maintain a soft diet for the first week postoperatively.  
5. Patients are typically discharged the same or next day after surgery, and they return to normal activities after 1 week.

# Complications

1. Intraoperative bleeding: More common if the mandibular cancellous bone is entered. Bleeding can usually be arrested with local measures such as diathermy or packing hemostatic agents within the site of concern.

2. Infection: Managed with antibiotics and chlorhexidine rinse. Incision and drainage are indicated if an abscess is identified.  
3. Wound dehiscence: Often due to excessive flap tension on closure. Managed with regular irrigation or rinsing with chlorhexidine.  
4. Pathologic fracture of the mandible: The presence of sudden onset of pain, malocclusion, and/or swelling should alert one to the possibility of a fracture. A fracture should be excluded or confirmed via a thorough examination and radiographs. Depending on the clinical requirements, observation with antibiotics and a nonchew diet, closed or open reduction, and fixation may be necessary.  
5. Trismus: A common sequela of surgery and typically self-limiting, with a return to normal mouth opening after 2-3 weeks. Analgesics, a soft diet, and passive jaw-opening exercises may be helpful.  
6. Inability to locate one nerve segment: If the proximal nerve segment cannot be found, the distal nerve segment may be connected via nerve share to another nerve (i.e., a cross-mental nerve graft using the sural nerve from the distal IAN segment to the contralateral incisive branch). If the distal nerve segment cannot be found, the proximal nerve segment should be repositioned (i.e., nerve end buried in muscle to avoid neuroma formation).  
7. Failure to gain sensory improvement: Occurs in  $20 - 40\%$  of nerve repair patients with non-painful injuries. Persistence of neuropathic pain may be seen in  $30 - 40\%$  of nerve repair patients with painful injuries.  
8. Neuropathic pain: The development of neuropathic pain after nerve repair is exceedingly r

# Key Points

1. Appropriate patient positioning at the beginning of the procedure is key to maintaining microsurgeon comfort throughout the surgery.  
2. The use of an operating microscope with two operator eyepieces, a video feed (preferable), and the appropriate focal distance of  $250\mathrm{mm}$  is ideal for most microsurgery procedures.  
3. Appropriate microsurgical instruments with a bayonet design and  $18\mathrm{cm}$  in length should be utilized. Microsurgical instruments should be demagnetized before surgery. Bipolar diathermy and two suction tubings should be available.  
4. Caution should be taken to locate the nerve and release the injury site with careful microdissection under microscopic magnification.  
5. The nerve ends should be approximated so as to facilitate coaptation without tension.  
6. A nerve graft is necessary if the nerve gap is long, usually  $1\mathrm{cm}$  or more.

# Technique: Autogenous Nerve Graft and Harvest

A method of bridging nerve injuries with long gaps (usually  $1\mathrm{cm}$  or more) that cannot be approximated without excessive tension with autogenous grafts.

# Indications

1. As for nerve repair, but where the nerve gap is too large for coaptation of nerve stumps without tension.

A. Intermediate-span nerve injuries (1-3 cm gap) may occur from direct rotary instrument injury (i.e., bur penetration of the lingual mandibular bone to catch the lingual nerve), lacerative or crush injury (i.e., implant surgery or rigid fixation for fracture or orthognathic surgery), chemical injury (i.e., inadvertent injection of endodontic chemicals through a root canal into the mandibular canal), or thermal injury (i.e., diathermy for hemostasis in proximity to a nerve)  
B. Long-span nerve injuries (more than  $3\mathrm{cm}$  gap) may occur from avulsive maxillofacial trauma (i.e., gunshot wound), ablative surgery for intraosseous tumors, or multiple-point injury (i.e., bone plate or screw fixation)

# Contraindications

1. Recipient site is infected or contaminated, is significantly scarred, or has poor vascularity (e.g., previously irradiated). Delayed nerve grafting may be considered after recipient site infection or contamination has been resolved  
2. Donor site was previously operated on, injured, or diseased  
3. Neuropathic pain of central trigeminal origin or sympathetically mediated pain source  
4. Patient refusal to undergo nerve grafting

Autogenous nerve grafting remains the gold standard for bridging a significant nerve gap. The most common autogenous donor nerves for trigeminal nerve repair are the sural nerve (SN) and the great auricular nerve (GAN). Other potential donor nerves are the saphenous dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve, the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, and the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve.

Where a nerve graft is necessary, but autogenous nerve grafting is not possible, other alternatives include:

A. Autogenous vein grafts  
B. Autogenous frozen-thawed muscle grafts  
C. Nerve allografts

Avance (human decellularized nerve allograft; AxoGen Inc., Alachua, FL, US)  
D. Resorbable nerve conduits or guides  
Neurotube (polyglycolic acid; Synovis Life Technologies, St. Paul, MN, US)  
Neurolac (polylactide-caprolactone; Polyganics Inc., Groningen, the Netherlands)  
NeuraGen (semipermeable collagen; Integral LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ, US)  
Autogenous vein or muscle grafts may be considered for intermediate-length nerve gaps that are between 1 and  $3\mathrm{cm}$ . For nerve gaps longer than  $3\mathrm{cm}$ , a nerve allograft is the preferred method of treatment.

# Anatomy

Sural nerve (SN): The SN is located in the posterior aspect of the lower leg, commencing at the popliteal fossa, between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. The SN classically forms from the confluence of the medial sural cutaneous nerve and the peroneal communicating branch (60% of the time), which arises from the lateral sural cutaneous nerve (or, less commonly, the common peroneal nerve). The SN may continue directly from the medial sural cutaneous nerve alone (37% of the time) or, rarely, from the lateral sural cutaneous nerve (3% of the time). The SN continues inferiorly from the medial to lateral aspect of the posterior lower leg to lie consistently in the space between the lateral malleolus and the calcanean (Achilles') tendon. The SN distal to the level of the lateral malleolus gives off branches in the foot. The median length of the SN measured from the distal point of the lateral malleolus proximally to the confluence of the medial sural cutaneous nerve and peroneal communicating branch measures 20cm (Riedl et al., 2008). The SN average diameter is 2.1 mm, about 88% of the IAN and 66% of the LN. It is oligofascicular with small-diameter fascicles. The axon number and axon size are significantly lower (approximately 50% or less) than those of the IAN and LN; its axon density is lower,

but comparable to that of the IAN and LN. The SN supplies the cutaneous sensation of the posterior and lateral aspect of the distal lower leg, the lateral aspect of the heel and foot, and the little toe.

Great auricular nerve (GAN): The GAN forms from the second and third cervical nerves and emerges at the mid-height of the neck from behind the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. The GAN then travels superiorly, just posterior and parallel to the external jugular vein on the lateral surface of the SCM, and enters the lower pole of the parotid gland. The GAN lies deep to the platysma muscle and superficial to the superficial layer of the cervical fascia. The GAN branches in its distal third  $37\%$  of the time and measures  $6.5\mathrm{cm}$  on average (range  $5.5 - 9.0\mathrm{cm}$ ). Its average diameter is  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$ , about  $63\%$  of the IAN and  $47\%$  of the LN. The GAN is oligofascicular with fewer fascicles than the IAN and LN. Its axon number is significantly lower than that of the IAN and LN, but its axon size and axon density are comparable to those of the IAN and LN. The GAN supplies part of the facial skin over the parotid gland, the parotid fascia, and the auricular skin (cranial surface and lower lateral surface [earlobe] below the external acoustic meatus).

# Surgical Technique for Trigeminal Nerve Graft Repair

1. The choice of the donor nerve graft site, the anticipated sensory loss, and the side are discussed with the patient prior to surgery. For a sural nerve graft, the nonmaster (usually left) leg is selected as the donor site.  
2. Patient positioning, general anesthesia via nasal endotracheal intubation, preparation, and local anesthesia are dependent on the operative site (i.e., LN, IAN, or ION).  
3. For a sural nerve graft and if resources allow, a second surgical team may be used to harvest the sural nerve graft once its need is confirmed.  
4. The recipient injured nerve should be exposed and prepared, with excision of any neuroma or damaged nerve tissue, so that the recipient nerve stumps are ready for coaptation with the nerve graft. The nerve gap is measured to determine the length of nerve graft required prior to graft harvest.

# Sural Nerve Graft

# Access

1. The donor leg is flexed and turned, exposing the lateral aspect of the lower leg to the surgeon. The location of the sural nerve is surface marked with a skin marker.  
2. A  $2\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal incision is created with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel one fingerbreadth distal and superior to the lateral malleolus of the ankle.

3. The skin edges are retracted, and a pair of curved artery forceps is utilized to dissect the subcutaneous tissues to expose the sural nerve and the small saphenous vein and artery superficial to the fascia of the posterior tibialis muscle.  
4. The sural nerve is isolated from the vein and artery using vessel loops and dissected with a nerve hook distally and proximally to the desired length (see Figure 75.11 in Case Report 75.3) (nerve gap distance  $+25\%$ ). Normally, a  $20 - 30\mathrm{mm}$  length of sural nerve can be harvested through a single incision (see Figure 75.12 in Case Report 75.3).  
5. If a greater length is required, a second incision is made proximal and parallel to the first incision, at about the distance equal to the desired length of nerve.

# Harvesting

6. The distal end of the sural nerve is transected sharply, and the nerve is exteriorized to the length required for grafting the measured nerve gap. The distal donor nerve end can be allowed to retract in place.  
7. The proximal end of the sural nerve is transected sharply, leaving at least  $1\mathrm{cm}$  of proximal nerve.  
8. The harvested sural nerve graft is measured and transferred to the recipient site in saline-soaked gauze. The ends of the nerve graft are inspected under microscopic magnification, and any excess tissue is trimmed so that the ends are prepared for coaptation. The nerve graft is microsutured to the recipient nerve ends using 8-0 or 9-0 monofilament sutures on a cutting needle, in a similar technique as for direct nerve repair, taking into account any difference in size between the graft and recipient nerve ends.

Donor stump burial: The proximal stump of the donor sural nerve is repositioned into muscle to avoid painful neuroma formation.

9. A U-shaped incision is made with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel within the posterior tibialis muscle fascia, thus creating a "trapdoor" with its "hinge" on its distal edge.  
10. The fascial "trapdoor" is elevated to expose the tibialis muscle.  
11. The proximal nerve stump end is sutured to the muscle using 5-0 or 6-0 resorbable sutures.  
12. The fascial "trapdoor" is closed over the sutured stump.

# Wound Closure

13. The subcutaneous layer is closed with 4-0 resorbable sutures, and the skin is closed with subcuticular continuous 6-0 resorbable sutures.  
14. The wound edges are reinforced with steri-strips.  
15. The wound is covered with a dressing, gauze, and a light bandage.

# Case Report

Case Report 75.3. Sural Nerve Harvest and Interpositional Graft Repair of Lingual Nerve Defect After Neuroma Resection. A 33-year-old patient with witnessed complete transection of the left lingual nerve (Sunderland V) during third molar surgery. A primary LN repair was attempted by the operating surgeon, and the patient was followed with weekly neurosensory testing. The patient developed a complete loss of

sensation and was referred for microsurgical evaluation and repair. The left LN was explored, and a neuroma-incontinuity (see Figure 75.9) was identified and resected, resulting in a  $9\mathrm{mm}$  nerve gap (see Figure 75.10). An interpositional graft was performed with harvest of the SN (see Figures 75.11 and 75.12) and a tension-free repair (see Figure 75.13) was performed (see Figures 75.9 through 75.14).

# Great Auricular Nerve Graft

# Access

1. The surgeon sits on the same side as the donor neck, and the patient's head is turned to the opposite side. The location of the GAN is surface marked with a skin marker.  
2. A  $2\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal incision is created with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel in a skin crease two-thirds of the way up the neck, over the posterior margin of the SCM muscle (see Figure 75.15). Alternatively, if there is already submandibular access to the mandible, the skin incision can be extended posteriorly to the neck.  
3. The skin edges are retracted, and curved artery forceps are utilized to dissect the subcutaneous tissues to expose the GAN, taking care to avoid damaging the external jugular vein (see Figure 75.16).  
4. The GAN is isolated using vessel loops and dissected superiorly to the desired length (nerve gap distance  $+25\%$ ). Normally, a  $20 - 40\mathrm{mm}$  length of GAN can be harvested. Because the GAN diameter tends to be smaller than that of the recipient nerve, it may be necessary to harvest twice the length of the nerve gap for a cable graft.

# Harvesting

5. The distal (superior) end of the GAN is transected sharply, then followed by the proximal end, leaving a short stump.  
6. The harvested nerve graft is measured and transferred to the recipient site. The ends of the nerve graft are inspected under microscopic magnification, and any excess tissue is trimmed so that the ends are prepared for coaptation. The nerve graft is microsutured to the recipient nerve ends using 8-0 or 9-0 monofilament suture on a cutting needle, in the same method as a direct nerve repair.  
7. If a cable graft is necessary, the harvested nerve graft is measured and sharply divided into two equal segments. The nerve graft segment ends are inspected and prepared for coaptation, laid side by side in the recipient site, and microsutured to the recipient nerve ends.

Donor stump burial: The proximal stump of donor nerve is repositioned into muscle to avoid painful neuroma formation. (see Figure 75.17).

8. A U-shaped incision is made with a No. 15 Bard-Parker scalpel in the superficial cervical fascia over the SCM muscle, thus creating a trapdoor.  
9. The fascial trapdoor is elevated to expose the SCM muscle.  
10. The proximal nerve stump end is sutured to the muscle using 5-0 or 6-0 resorbable sutures.  
11. The fascial trapdoor is closed over the sutured stump.

![](images/57a6e9301be72c92b1828d2f85d3800a74b32914f3ff5279ae21b127825290dd.jpg)

Figure 75.17. The distal (superior) end of the great auricular nerve is transected sharply, followed by the proximal end, leaving a short stump. The proximal stump of the donor nerve is repositioned into muscle to avoid painful neuroma formation. A U-shaped incision is made in the superficial cervical fascia over the sternocleidomastoid muscle, thus creating a "trapdoor." The proximal nerve stump end is sutured to the muscle, and the fascia is closed.

# Wound Closure

12. The subcutaneous layer is closed with 4-0 resorbable sutures, and the skin closed with interrupted 6-0 monofilament sutures.  
13. The wound is covered with antibiotic ointment and a dressing.

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics, antibiotics, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse are prescribed.  
2. Patients are advised to maintain a soft diet for the first week.  
3. Patients are typically discharged the next day and can return to normal activities after 1-2 weeks.  
4. Patients who have undergone sural nerve grafting are given walking aids and instructed to avoid weight bearing on the donor leg for 2 weeks.

# Complications

1. Intraoperative bleeding: Controlled by diathermy or by tying off any bleeding vessels.  
2. Infection: Managed with antibiotics and chlorhexidine rinse. Incision and drainage are indicated if an abscess is identified.

3. Wound dehiscence: Managed with daily wound care and dressing  
4. Hypertrophic scar formation: Treated with steroid injections and/or scar revision after 6 months.  
5. Neuroma formation: May require revision surgery to remove the neuroma and to bury the nerve stump in muscle to prevent recurrent neuroma formation.  
6. Failure to gain sensory improvement: Sensory improvement with a nerve graft is generally not as successful as with direct nerve repair as there is the greater impediment of a double repair site and additional distance for axonal regeneration.  
7. Loss of sensation in donor nerve distribution: Expected outcome. For sural nerve grafts, the area of sensory loss involves the lateral surface of the heel and foot and sometimes the little toe. SN sensory loss does not involve the sole of the foot; therefore, there should be no impediment to normal function of the foot after recovery. For GAN grafts, the area of sensory loss usually involves the earlobe and the skin around it.

# Key Points

1. The possibility of donor nerve graft and the choice of donor site and side, including the risks of nerve grafting (i.e., loss of sensation in the donor nerve distribution), should be discussed with the patient prior to surgery.  
2. Prep and drape the donor site when prepping the main operation site.  
3. Use a separate set of instruments for nerve graft harvesting from those used in the oral cavity.  
4. If resources permit, have a second surgical team available to harvest the sural nerve graft.  
5. It is advised to harvest a nerve graft with an additional  $25\%$  of length than the nerve gap distance because the harvested graft will contract. However, excessively long nerve grafts yield a lower predictability due to the longer distance for axonal regeneration.  
6. The GAN tends to be smaller than the recipient IAN or LN, and a longer length (double that of the recipient nerve gap) may be required for a cable graft.  
7. The recipient bed must be well vascularized for the nerve graft to be successful.  
8. The nerve graft should be oriented in the same functional direction from which it was harvested (i.e., the donor proximal end should be connected to the recipient proximal stump).  
9. A lower quality of sensory improvement should be expected when a nerve graft is used, compared to direct nerve repair, because there are two repair sites instead of one. The age and health of the patient, the nature of the nerve injury, and the quality of microsurgery will also influence the quality of sensory improvement.

# Nerve Allograft Reconstruction

Reconstruction of peripheral nerve deficit to restore nerve integrity and function utilizing a nerve allograft.

# Indications

1. Transection of inferior alveolar or lingual nerve  
2. Persistent sensory deficit  
3. Foreign body within the mandibular canal  
4. Neuroma  
5. Patient not able to tolerate sensory deficit  
6. Progressively worsening sensory deficit  
7. Nerve reconstruction where autogenous grafting is contraindicated or not accepted by the patient

# Contraindications

1. Improvement in sensory function  
2. Central neuropathic pain  
3. Active infection  
4. Residual pathology  
5. Sensitivity to porcine materials  
6. Compromised vascularity  
7. Medically compromised and immunocompromised patient

# Technique: Avance® Nerve Graft (Axogen, Alachua, Florida, USA)

1. The surgical procedure is initiated (tumor resection, trauma repair, nerve repair, etc.) and the proximal and distal aspects of the nerve are identified (see Figure 75.28 in Case Report 75.4).  
2. The proximal and distal nerve segments are lifted from the mandibular bone with a nerve hook, and a modified neuropatty background is placed beneath the nerve segments.

3. The isolated nerve stumps are inspected under magnification and any herniated intrafascicular tissues are resected back to healthy tissue.  
4. The injured nerve diameter and length of defect are measured. Avance Nerve Graft of a similar diameter and necessary length is selected, which will allow for a tension-free anastomosis (see Figure 75.29 in Case Report 75.4).  
5. Axoguard® Connector is secured to the epineurium of distal and proximal stumps using a 8-0 Prolene suture (see Figures 75.30, 75.31 and 75.32 in Case Report 75.4).  
6. Coaptation of the Avance Nerve Allograft to the distal and proximal stumps with  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  gap using 8-0 Prolene suture through the epineurium (see Figures 75.33 and 75.34 in Case Report 75.4). Three sutures are placed in the 12, 4, and 8 o'clock positions.  
7. Axoguard Nerve Protector is wrapped around the nerve to minimize scar formation for optimal results. Microclips used to secure the Axoguard Nerve Protector, which aid in radiographic identification (see Figure 75.35 in Case Report 75.4).  
8. Ideal hemostasis is required to minimize scar tissue formation. Hematoma development can lead to compression-induced ischemia potentiating demyelination.

# Complications

Complications associated with nerve allograft reconstruction are similar to complications associated with autogenous nerve grafting.

# Key Points

1. Nerve allografts eliminate donor-site morbidity and donor-site neurosensory deficits.  
2. The IAN contains up to 18 fascicles at the third molar area, which decreases 12 fascicles at the mental foramen.  
3. The average IAN diameter is  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  and LN diameter is  $3.2\mathrm{mm}$  
4. Allograft Nerve (Avance) is processed, chondroitinase-treated, decellularized human cadaveric peripheral nerves processed to be nonimmunogenic and inert, but able to retain fascicular architecture. Avance Nerve Graft have a variety of diameters and lengths that lend themselves ideally for IAN and LN grafting.  
5. Allow Avance Nerve Graft to completely thaw prior to inset (5-10 minutes). Never insert a partially thawed or frozen allograft.  
6. Affected nerve stumps are resected to healthy tissue and all herniated intrafascicular tissues are removed.  
7. Care is taken to accurately measure the involved peripheral nerve diameter and defect length to allow

for ideal coaptation with an allograft of a similar diameter, fascicular size, and with tension-free neurorrhaphy to optimize postoperative outcome and sensory return.
