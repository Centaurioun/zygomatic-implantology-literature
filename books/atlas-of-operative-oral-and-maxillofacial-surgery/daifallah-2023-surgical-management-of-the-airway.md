# Surgical Cricothyrotomy

An emergent airway when other non-surgical methods of securing the airway have failed or not possible.

# Indications

When an acute emergent airway is indicated and oral and nasal intubation devices are not available or are not possible due to mechanical airway obstruction such as an expanding hematoma, hypopharyngeal obstruction, oral burns, profuse hemorrhage, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, or laryngeal edema. Cricothyrotomy is not indicated in non-emergent situations.

# Contraindications

1. Pediatric patients under the age of 10. In pediatric patients, surgical cricothyrotomy can damage the cricoid cartilage and lead to subglottic stenosis  
2. Relative contraindications include complete or partial transection of the airway, subglottic stenosis, laryngeal fracture, injury to the cricoid cartilage, and active surgical site infection

# Anatomy

Cricothyroid space: The cricothyroid space is located between the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage and the superior border of the cricoid cartilage. The cricothyroid space spans  $20 - 30\mathrm{mm}$  in its horizontal dimension and  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  in its vertical dimension. Within this space lies the cricothyroid membrane (see Figure 16.1). There are no large vessels, glandular structures, or complex fascial or muscular layers overlying the cricothyroid membrane.

# Cricothyrotomy Landmarks

1. The greater prominence of the thyroid cartilage  
2. The lesser prominence of the cricoid cartilage  
3. The depression between these two landmarks is the cricothyroid space

# Cricothyrotomy Layers

1. Skin  
2. Subcutaneous tissue

3. Cervical fascia  
4. Cricothyroid membrane

# Surgical Cricothyrotomy Technique

1. The patient is positioned with hyperextension of the neck (if no cervical spine injuries) for better visualization of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.  
2. The skin is prepped and local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected to aid in pain control and hemostasis. Avoid excessive local anesthetic as this will obscure landmarks.  
3. If time permits, trans-tracheal injections are performed to decrease cough reflex (for an awake patient).  
4. With the non-dominant hand, stabilize the thyroid cartilage between the thumb and middle finger and palpate the cricothyroid space with the index finger. With the dominant hand, make a  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  vertical midline incision over the inferior portion of the thyroid cartilage extending inferiorly to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage (see Figure 16.2 in Case Report 16.1). A vertical incision is utilized in an emergent situation to decrease the risk of vascular injury, increase visibility, and decrease the operating time from the skin to the cricothyroid membrane. The incision extends through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and cervical fascia to the thyroid and cricoid cartilage, exposing the cricothyroid membrane (see Figure 16.3 in Case Report 16.1). The thumb and middle finger are used to apply a slight downward pressure to separate the skin edges after the incision. The incision should be made in a single, continuous swipe. If arterial bleeding is encountered, suspect the cricothyroid branches of the superior thyroid artery, which enter the cricothyroid membrane superiorly. Any bleeding should be ignored until the airway is secured.  
5. Incise through the cricothyroid membrane in a horizontal manner (see Figure 16.4 in Case Report 16.1) and place a scalpel handle or scissors/hemostat to enlarge the cricothyrotomy opening.  
6. Place a lubricated airway device into the trachea through the cricothyroid space (see Figure 16.5 in Case Report 16.1 and Figure 16.8 in Case Report 16.2).

7. Attach the ventilator circuit, check for end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , and perform bilateral chest auscultation.  
8. Secure the tube to the skin with sutures and a cloth tie around the neck or convert the cricothyrotomy to an open tracheotomy. Do not close the skin incision as this can lead to subcutaneous emphysema.

# Complications

Cricothyrotomy complications coincide with tracheotomy complications.

# Key Points

1. With any emergent surgical airway procedure, a midline vertical incision allows for faster access to the trachea and minimizes the risk of arterial and venous bleeding.  
2. There is no definitive evidence to support the conversion of a cricothyrotomy to a tracheotomy. As most cricothyrotomies are performed in acute obstructive situations (anaphylactic edema, expanding hematoma, and abscess formation), the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation is often unnecessary.  
3. A true surgical cricothyrotomy is contraindicated in children under the age of 10 or in patients who

weigh less than  $40\mathrm{kg}$ . In pediatric emergent airway situations, a needle cricothyrotomy should be utilized. There are numerous commercial needle cricothyrotomy kits available. Some utilize 12-14-gauge needles that can be inserted directly into the cricothyroid space and attached to a jet ventilation apparatus. Other kits allow for the placement of a needle into the cricothyroid space and allow for the changing of a specific catheter over a guide wire (Seldinger technique). Needle cricothyrotomies require conversion to a definitive airway immediately as they are highly unstable due to dislodgement of the needle with subsequent loss of the airway. In addition, needle cricothyrotomy patients experience poor ventilation quality due to the small size of the needle lumen.

# Case Reports

Case Report 16.1. Trauma cricothyrotomy. A 72-year-old patient presents with impending airway obstruction due to expanding floor-of-mouth hematoma resulting from a gunshot wound (Gsw) to the anterior mandible (see Figures 16.2 through 16.5).

Case Report 16.2. Trauma cricothyrotomy. A 34-year-old patient presents to the Emergency Department (ED) immediately status post  $9\mathrm{mm}$  caliber gunshot wound (Gsw) to the mandible. The low-energy transfer projectile (low velocity bullet) entered the right angle of the mandible and exited the left angle of the mandible causing severe soft tissue edema and obstruction of the posterior oropharynx. After three failed intubation attempts in the ED and with falling oxygen levels, the patient's airway was secured via cricothyrotomy. The patient was then transported with a stable airway to the operating room (OR) for repair of his mandibular fractures (see Figures 16.6 through 16.9).

![](images/32a28bcb2067642d95329a5d64c4b650b9c07cc450a5ce65775959e5fc6dc8c4.jpg)  
Figure 16.10. Surgeon identifies the thyroid cartilage with bimanual palpation prior to surgery. Pertinent surgical landmarks (laryngeal prominence, cricoid cartilage, horizontal tracheotomy incision, and sternal notch) are marked with a marking pen prior to prepping and draping.

# Tracheotomy Layers

1. Skin  
2. Subcutaneous tissue  
3. Platysma muscle  
4. The superficial (investing) layer of the deep cervical fascia, which splits to invest the SCM and trapezius muscles  
5. The midline infrahyoid linea alba which is formed from the fusion of the superficial (investing) and the middle (pretracheal) cervical fasciae between the bilateral strap muscles  
6. The thyroid isthmus may be identified at the level of the second tracheal ring  
7. The pretracheal (middle) layer of the deep cervical fascia which invests the infrahyoid (trap) muscles, thyroid gland, trachea, and esophagus  
8. Tracheal rings

# Tracheotomy Procedure

1. The patient's head is placed in the midline of the table with cervical hyperextension (unless c-spine injury is suspected) with a shoulder roll and head donut support (see Figure 16.14 in Case Report 16.3).  
2. The patient is prepped and draped from the inferior mandible to a point several centimeters below the sternal notch.  
3. A sterile marking pen is used to mark the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage, the cricoid cartilage, and the sternal notch (see Figure 16.15 in Case Report 16.3).  
4. A  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal line is drawn with a sterile marking pen  $2\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the cricoid cartilage or midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch. This line will represent the skin incision and corresponds to the level of the second and third tracheal rings.  
5. Local anesthetic is injected under the horizontal line of the marker superficial to the platysma muscle. In an emergent situation in wake patients, a transtracheal injection is used to decrease the cough reflex. Caution to not create an air leak with the needle if you plan on using electrocautery.  
6. A  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal skin incision is placed over the horizontal line (see Figure 16.16 in Case Report 16.3). The incision initially transverses skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the platysma muscle (if present). If excessive adipose tissue is present within the subcutaneous tissues, lipectomy (see Figure 16.18 in Case Report 16.3) may be performed using electrocautery. Electrocautery is used for hemostasis of subcutaneous bleeding. In elective tracheotomy, a horizontal skin incision has the advantage of improved cosmesis

following secondary revision. Excessive lateral extension of the incision can lead to severance of the anterior jugular veins. In an emergent tracheotomy, a midline vertical incision (see Figures 16.36 through 16.39 in Case Report 16.4) allows for faster access to the desired level of tracheal rings and minimizes the chance of arterial and venous bleeding.

7. After transecting the platysma muscle (see Figure 16.20 in Case Report 16.3), a vertical incision is performed through the superficial (investing) layer of the deep cervical fascia (see Figure 16.21 in Case Report 16.3).  
8. Loose connective tissue is retracted laterally and the linea alba and strap muscles are identified.  
9. Blunt dissection is carried through the midline avascular linea alba separating the strap muscles of the anterior neck until the thyroid isthmus and the pretracheal fascia are identified (see Figure 16.22 in Case Report 16.3). If the thyroid isthmus is noted to cross over the second and third tracheal rings, it is divided with electrocautery and ligated using 2-0 silk sutures (see Figures 16.23 through 16.25 in Case Report 16.3). Failure to cauterize and ligate the transected thyroid isthmus can lead to postoperative bleeding. Failure to stay within the midline (within the avascular linea alba) during the initial dissection can result in muscle bleeding and lateral dissection of the trachea. The lateral sulcus between the trachea and esophagus contains the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Damage to this nerve results in impaired vocal cord function.  
10. Kittner pledgets are used to remove the pretracheal fascia and to expose the cricoid cartilage and tracheal rings (see Figure 16.26 in Case Report 16.3 and Figure 16.38 in Case Report 16.4).  
11. The tracheotomy cuff is lubricated and tested (inflated in water) prior to tracheal ring incision to ensure that the cuff works appropriately. Occasionally, the tracheotomy tube may be torn upon insertion into the trachea or may be too large for passive insertion into the surgical stoma. A second, smaller tracheotomy tube is always available as a backup.  
12. A cricoid hook is used to engage and elevate the cricoid cartilage upward and superiorly to gain better visibility of the tracheal rings.  
13. Prior to entering the trachea, it is paramount that the incision site is hemostatic in order to improve visualization and to minimize postoperative bleeding. Preoxygenation with high flow  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  (fraction of inspired oxygen) helps to build a reservoir for additional working time.  
14. The anesthetic gases are stopped, and the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  is decreased to less than  $30\%$  to minimize the oppo

nity for airway fire. The use of electrocautery is not recommended beyond this point.

15. The ideal placement of the tracheal incision is through tracheal rings 2 and 3. Numerous types of tracheal incisions can be utilized. A simple "T" or cross incision can be made through tracheal rings 2 and 3 with an #11 blade, and a tracheal dilator can be used to enlarge the size of the surgical stoma. Alternatively, a Bjork flap (inverted U-flap) can be placed through tracheal rings 2 and 3 (see Figure 16.27 in Case Report 16.3). The width of the base of the Bjork flap should be one-third of the tracheal diameter. 2-0 stay sutures are placed within the non-hinged border of the cartilage window. Appropriately positioned stay sutures will aid in the retraction of the Bjork flap during tube insertion. The stay sutures may be tied to the skin incision to reflect the flap open, or they can be taped to the patient's anterior chest wall with sterile-strips at the completion of the procedure. The Bjork flap has the advantage of creating a stable tract for tube reinsertion should accidental decannulation occurs in an uncontrolled setting. For patients requiring prolonged or permanent mechanical ventilation, a permanent surgical stoma can be created by removing a wedge of cartilage the size of the Bjork flap from the anterior tracheal wall at the level of tracheal rings 2-3.  
16. After creation of a surgical stoma through tracheal rings 2 and 3, the anesthesia team is asked to slowly pull back the endotracheal tube. Once the endotracheal tube has moved superior to the surgical stoma, an unfenestrated lubricated tracheotomy tube with its obturator is placed into the tracheal stoma with gentle inferior pressure and following the natural curvature of the trachea. The obturator is removed, and the inner cannula is inserted. The tracheotomy tube cuff is inflated and the anesthesia circuit is attached (see Figure 16.28 in Case Report 16.3). The tracheotomy tube outer diameter should be  $\frac{3}{4}$  the inner tracheal diameter. In an average size person, an 8.0 Shiley cuffed tube is appropriate for most men and a 6.0 Shiley is appropriate for most women.  
17. The anesthesia team is asked to check for end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and bilateral breath sounds.  
18. The tracheotomy flange is secured with a cloth tie around the neck (see Figure 16.33 in Case Report 16.3) and to the skin with sutures (see Figure 16.30 in Case Report 16.3). SURGIFLO® is placed into the surgical site (see Figure 16.31 in Case Report 16.3) and a split gauze dressing is placed between the tube collar and the skin to protect the wound and to absorb secretions

(see Figures 16.32 and 16.33 in Case Report 16.3). The previously placed stay sutures are secured to the skin of the anterior chest wall with sterile-strips if they were not secured to the skin (see Figure 16.34 in Case Report 16.3).

19. Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle layers are not closed in order to minimize the risk of subcutaneous emphysema, which can result from positive pressure ventilation and a tightly closed tracheotomy incision.  
20. An immediate chest film is obtained in order to confirm tracheal tube placement and to assess the lung fields to rule out pneumothorax. The ideal position of a tracheotomy tube should be a minimum of  $2\mathrm{cm}$  above the carina so that inadvertent main stem cannulation does not occur.

# Postoperative Management

1. Tracheotomy dressings (split sheet) are changed as they become saturated, or at least once per day.  
2. The inner cannula must be cleaned or changed twice daily. The trachea should be suctioned twice per shift to prevent mucus plug from developing to minimize obstruction of the airway.  
3. Maintain tracheotomy tube cuff pressure between 20 and  $25\mathrm{cmH}_2\mathrm{O}$ . High pressures can lead to necrosis and/or stenosis. Low pressures will result in leakage and inadequate ventilation.  
4. The surgical site or stoma is cleaned daily to remove secretions and coagulated blood and to clean the surrounding skin edges.  
5. Passive neutral support of the proximal end of tracheotomy tube and ventilator circuit will minimize unfavorable (erosion) pressures on tracheal walls.  
6. The tracheotomy tube should be changed every 2 weeks to minimize infection and obstruction of the airway.  
7. Humidification will decrease viscous secretions, the risk of inflammation and necrosis of epithelium (which leads to ulcerations and bleedings), impairment of cilia function, bacterial infiltration, and reduction in lung function.  
8. Daily oral hygiene will decrease the chance of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).  
9. The authors prefer to downsize the tracheotomy tube on days 5-7. Tube downsizing assists with air passage around the tube, phonation, smooth future decannulation, and reduction in complications.  
10. Once the patient is awake, alert, medically stable, off the ventilator, with low risk of aspiration, and attempting to communicate, a speaking valve can be used to assist with phonation. Speaking valves should only be used on deflated or cuffless tracheotomy tubes.

11. Prior to tracheotomy tube removal, an air leak test is performed to evaluate breathing around the deflated tracheotomy tube. If indicated, a computed tomography scan can also be obtained to evaluate airway space. Prior to extubation, make sure to have all appropriate equipment and personnel ready to place a new tracheotomy tube if the patient begins to desaturate bedside. After extubation, the patient is closely observed in a monitored setting for several hours. One hour after extubation, an arterial blood gas (ABG) is obtained to assess for adequate ventilation.

# Complications

# Immediate and Early Tracheotomy Complications

1. Bleeding: Sources of early bleeding (see Figure 16.11) include the anterior jugular veins, thyroid ima artery, inferior thyroid arteries and veins, highly vascular thyroid parenchyma, innominate artery, external jugular veins, and thyroid isthmus. Arterial bleeding should be explored in a controlled setting (OR). Venous bleeding is common and can be controlled by local measures bedside.  
2. Pneumothorax or hemothorax: Inadvertent perforation or laceration of the posterior wall of the trachea may also penetrate into the pleural spaces, leading to pneumothorax or hemothorax. Note that the pleural cavity is not limited to the lateral aspects of the trachea, but extends around the lateral walls of the trachea to the posterior wall of the trachea and that there is a short distance between the dorsal tracheal wall and the pleural cavity.  
3. Airway fire: This extremely rare, but catastrophic complication can be minimized by avoiding the use of electrocautery to enter the trachea, by minimizing the use of volatile anesthetic gases and decreasing the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  to less than  $30\%$  prior to incising the trachea.  
4. Air embolism: Rare, potentially an immediate fatal complication. More likely to occur during awake tracheotomy due to the increase in venous pressure in the neck. Air that enters the venous system is transported to the pulmonary circulation, resulting in interference in gas exchange, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and arrest.  
5. Subcutaneous emphysema: Occurs from tight closure of the skin incision, from a small skin incision, the use of an uncuffed tube, or from false passage of the tracheotomy tube into the pretracheal tissue. Subcutaneous emphysema can also occur when the posterior wall of the trachea is inadvertently perforated (more common with percutaneous tracheotomy). Symptoms occur after positive pressure ventilation is

Figure 16.11. The most common immediate and early tracheotomy complication is bleeding. Arteries and veins within the surgical field should be tied and cauterized for ideal hemostasis. Care should be taken to enter a "dry" trachea and to ensure that all bleeding is well controlled prior to leaving the operating room.

attached to the tracheotomy tube and air dissects within the pretracheal subcutaneous tissue. Air emphysema can further dissect within the subcutaneous tissues of the head, neck, face, and thorax (mediastinal emphysema and pneumomediastinum). Subcutaneous emphysema will resolve once its source is identified and corrected.

6. Inappropriate tracheotomy tube placement: The tracheotomy tube can be inadvertently placed (false passage) into the subcutaneous tissue plane between the trachea and the sternum. Bjork flap technique helps in minimizing this complication. False passage of the tracheotomy tube will result in loss of airway and subcutaneous emphysema. The tracheotomy tube can also be incorrectly positioned within the trachea itself. If inappropriately positioned within the trachea, the tracheotomy tube can place unwanted pressure on the tracheal walls resulting in dysphagia, ulceration, and fistulae formation.  
7. Loss of airway: Results from a false passage of the tracheotomy tube or from inadequately securing of the tracheotomy tube in the OR.

8. Damage to adjacent structures: Structures damaged may include the cricoid cartilage, thyroid cartilage, posterior tracheal wall, esophagus, vocal cords, and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Inadvertent lateral tracheal dissection can occur when the midline is lost or obscured during the surgical dissection. Dissection along the lateral sulcus of the trachea can damage the recurrent laryngeal nerve and result in vocal cord paralysis and dysphonia.  
9. Perforation of the posterior trachea: Occurs more commonly with percutaneous tracheostomy than with open tracheostomy. Frequently caused during percutaneous dilation tracheotomy when the guide wire is poorly stabilized and perforates the posterior tracheal wall. Symptoms include subcutaneous emphysema, decreased arterial saturation, and decreased breath sounds, often proceeding toward tension pneumothorax.  
10. Tracheal tube obstruction: Initial tracheotomy tube obstruction is commonly with mucous or blood. These obstructions are frequently due to the placement of a small-diameter tracheotomy tube and/or poor daily tracheotomy tube care.  
11. Accidental decannulation: Accidental decannulation can occur from increased pulmonary secretions, the patient changing position in bed, lack of clinically indicated limb restraints, and an improperly secured tracheotomy tube. Accidental decannulation is more common in the pediatric population.  
12. Aspiration pneumonia: Symptoms include tachycardia, tachypnea, cough, chest pain, sputum production, rales, cyanosis, wheezing, fever, and leukocytosis, or may be completely asymptomatic. Chest films demonstrate pulmonary infiltrates specific to the segments of the lobes involved.  
13. Internal and external stomal erosion: Internal erosion is the result of outward pulling or torquing from the traction of the ventilator tubing on the tracheal wall. Internal erosion is prevented by adequate support of the tubing in a more neutral position. External erosion results from inward pressure from the tube flange. External erosion is minimized by keeping the neck in a neutral position and free of pressure.

# Late Tracheotomy Complications

1. Erosion of the tube into adjacent structures: Erosion into the tracheal or laryngeal cartilages will cause chondromalacia and ultimately stenosis. Erosion through the posterior wall will cause a tracheoesophageal fistula. Erosion into vessels will cause bleeding and tracheo-arterial fistula development.  
2. Tracheo-esophageal fistula: Rare complications that can occur at the time of tracheostomy or from improper

positioning of the tracheostomy tube or increase in cuff pressure. Treatment involves tracheal resection and anastomosis plus esophageal closure, with or without a muscle interposition.

3. Tracheo-arterial fistula: The most fatal late complication of tracheotomy (occur in  $0.7\%$  of patients). Tracheoarterial fistulae can occur between 30 hours and several years after tracheotomy. However,  $70\%$  occur within the first 3 weeks postoperatively. Symptoms include sentinel bleeding and a pulsating tracheotomy tube followed by massive bleeding. The innominate artery is the most common site, but left innominate vein, aortic arch, and right common artery fistulae can also occur. Decrease in capillary pressure (hypotension), sepsis, corticosteroid usage, low placement of tracheotomy (below the 4th ring), and malnutrition; all can increase the risk for the fistula formation. Tracheo-arterial fistulae occur owing to erosion of the anterior tracheal wall from the tracheostomy cuff or tip. Treatment involves early identification, over inflation of cuff, occlusive pressure, and emergent thoracotomy for ligation of artery.  
4. Stomal infection: Stomal infections result from contamination of the surgical site at surgery or contamination of the wound in the postoperative period.  
5. Formation of granulation tissue: Granulation tissue typically grows in the areas of tube irritation and can be exacerbated by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). These growths can cause airway obstruction, bleeding, interfere with vocal cord function, interfere with decannulation, and ultimately lead to tracheal or laryngeal stenosis. Treatment involves topical silver nitrate, control of GERD, steroid injections, and surgical excision.  
6. Tracheal and/or subglottic stenosis: A result of mucosal ischemia at the stomal suprastomal or infrastomal levels. More common in patients who have been intubated for more than 3 weeks. Symptoms (stridor, cough, dyspnea, shortness of breath, and malaise) typically do not occur until the luminal diameter is reduced by  $50\%$ . Subglottic or suprastomal stenosis is the result of cricoid cartilage destruction during cricothyrotomy or high tracheotomy. Tracheal stenosis can be prevented by limiting the size of the stomal opening, avoiding cartilage injury, preventing mechanical irritation of the tube on the trachea, preventing infections and maintaining cuff pressures of  $20 - 25\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ . Treatment of stenosis involves surgery, most commonly with tracheal resection with end-to-end anastomosis, tracheal dilation, and tracheobronchial airway stenting.  
7. Tracheomalacia: Tracheomalacia is rare and results from the weakening of the tracheal wall from ischemic injury that leads to chondritis and destruction of the supporting cartilage. Tracheomalacia is typically the result of direct tracheal tube pressure or overinflated cuff (above  $25\mathrm{cmH}_2\mathrm{O}$ ). Tracheomalacia leads to airway collapse during respiration, which results in air trapping, limited

airflow, and retained respiratory secretions. Treatment is dependent on the severity of upper airway obstruction. Mild to moderate cases treated with longer tracheotomy tube to bypass the area of necrosis and better cuff management. More severe cases require bronchoscopic stenting, surgical resection, and tracheoplasty.

8. Tracheocutaneous fistula: Failure for the stoma to close following decannulation (see Figure 16.12). Persistent tracheal stomas occur from prolonged cannulation or stoma infections, which allows the tracheostomy tract to epithelialize. Treatment includes tract excision and a layered closure, with or without a muscle flap.

# Key Points

1. Tracheotomy tube selection: The size of the tracheotomy tube coincides with the internal diameter of the tube. Men require an internal diameter of 7.0-8.5. Women require an internal diameter of 6.0-7.5. In children, the size of the tube should be the size of the child's little finger. In toddlers and infants, an uncuffed tube is recommended because the trachea is so small that the tracheotomy tube will create an adequate seal without a cuff.  
2. In the acute trauma situation, unfenestrated tubes should be utilized. After initial placement of an unfenestrated tube, secondary placement of a fenestrated tube for phonation and weaning is appropriate.  
3. Bleeding is the most common complication in tracheotomy. Bleeding can be minimized with a  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  incision. Longer, more lateral incisions risk inadvertent damage to the great vessels (anterior, external, and internal jugular veins and carotid arteries). Bleeding can also be

minimized by maintaining a midline dissection, ligating all small vessels, and by dividing the strap muscles rather than transecting them. Using electrocautery to divide the thyroid isthmus instead of transecting with a blade can minimize postoperative bleeding. Alternatively, the thyroid isthmus can be left intact and retracted superiorly to provide access to the tracheal rings.  
4. After division of the strap muscles, army-navy retractors are placed on either side of the trachea in order to keep the trachea within the midline. Dissection lateral to the trachea can lead to damage of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and paralysis of the vocal cords, resulting in hoarseness.  
5. The ideal placement of the surgical stoma is between tracheal rings 2 and 3. The cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring should never be cut or injured. The surgical stoma should never extend below the fourth tracheal ring. The surgical stoma should not extend more than one-half of the circumferences of the tracheal lumen (one-third is preferred).  
6. The advantage of the Bjork flap is that if unintentional decannulation occurs, the inverted U-flap provides an ideal pathway for recannulation, especially if stay sutures are utilized, and minimizes the chance of false passage.  
7. In elective tracheotomy, a horizontal skin incision has the advantage of improved cosmesis following secondary revision. In trauma tracheotomy, a midline vertical incision allows for faster access to the trachea and minimizes the chance of arterial and venous bleeding in emergent situations. A midline vertical scar is more difficult to revise and has poor cosmesis compared to a horizontal neck scar.  
8. In elderly patients, the tracheal rings may be calcified. Entry into the trachea may require the use of heavy scissors. Care should be taken to minimize fracturing of the calcified tracheal rings during stoma creation.  
9. Patients with thick necks or obese patients may require an extended tracheotomy tube. Assessing lateral neck films before tracheotomy helps in determining the appropriate trachea tubing. Alternatively, adjustable tracheotomy tubes are utilized in this patient population.  
10. With obese patients, it is easy to become anatomically disoriented and dissect too far inferiorly (around the sternal notch or beneath the sternum). Be cognizant of low dissections (toward the sternum) as this increases the risk of encountering the innominate artery and thus increases the risk of development of a tracheo-innominate artery fistula.  
11. If prolonged intubation is required, tracheotomy should be performed no later than 15 days after intubation to minimize the occurrence of endotracheal tube erosion of the trachea.  
12. Tracheotomy in the pediatric population differs from the adult population in that the procedure is technically

more demanding and is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. Most pediatric tracheotomy tubes are cuffless and non-fenestrated (see Figure 16.13).

# Submental Intubation

An alternative to tracheotomy when short-term ventilation is required or a neck injury is suspected that is complicated by tracheotomy (unable to provide cervical hyperextension).

# Indications for Submental Intubation

1. Maxillofacial trauma patients who require MMF and dental occlusal references when nasal intubation is contraindicated (i.e., mandibular fractures with associated midface fractures and/or skull-based fractures) and postoperative mechanical ventilation is not necessary or will be of short duration  
2. Patients requiring a short-term definitive airway for elective craniomaxillofacial reconstructive surgery where a reference to the dental occlusion is required with a desire to avoid the complications of tracheotomy (i.e., orthognathic surgery where nasal intubation is not possible, cleft lip-palate patients, and maxillomandibular advancement with concurrent nasal surgery for sleep apnea)  
3. In situations where nasal intubation cannot be achieved (lack of operator experience, lack of fiber optic equipment, and intranasal pathology)  
4. Patients with previous tracheotomy with complications

8. Oral mucosa

# Submental Intubation Procedure

1. The patient is orally intubated with a kink-resistant, but flexible, metal-reinforced oral tube, and a bite block is placed.  
2. The skin is prepped to include the anterior neck, chin, and floor of mouth.  
3. The patient is draped from midface to sternal notch.  
4. The submental crease is identified and injected with local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor (see Figure 16.42 in Case Report 16.5).  
5. A  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  incision is created  $2\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the submental crease. The incision transects skin, subcutaneous

tissue, and platysma only. Superficial bleeds are controlled with electrocautery.

6. A Kelley clamp is used to bluntly dissect from the skin incision through the deep cervical fascia and muscles of the floor of the mouth into the midline of the oral cavity under the ventral aspect of the tongue (see Figure 16.40).  
7. The pilot tube cuff is inserted into the beaks of the Kelley clamp. The Kelley clamp is used to pull the pilot cuff from the oral cavity through the submental incision (see Figure 16.43 in Case Report 16.5). Care is taken to not perforate the pilot cuff.  
8. The endotracheal tube connector is removed. The Kelley clamp is reinserted from the submental incision into the oral cavity and the metal-reinforced oral endotracheal tube is grasped and pulled through the submental incision (see Figure 16.44 in Case Report 16.5). The connector is reattached and the anesthesia circuit is reconnected (see Figure 16.46 in Case Report 16.5).  
9. The endotracheal tube is secured to the skin of the submental region with 2-0 silk sutures (see Figure 16.45 in Case Report 16.5). A 24-gauge wire can be used to secure the rigid endotracheal tube to the lingual aspect of the first molar below the occlusal plane so that it does not interfere with the ability

to check dental occlusal references during the procedure.

10. At the completion of the procedure, the patient can be left submentally intubated, or the submental intubation can be converted to a traditional oral intubation (see Figure 16.47 in Case Report 16.5).

# Submental Intubation Complications

# Immediate Submental Intubation Complications

1. Floor-of-mouth edema  
2. Floor-of-mouth hematoma  
3. Injuries to the sublingual duct, submandibular duct, or lingual nerve or vessels  
4. Detachment of or damage to the pilot cuff  
5. Inadvertent extubation  
6. Damage to the genioglossal muscle attachment

# Late Submental Intubation Complications

1. Infection of submental incision from oral contamination  
2. Accidental extubation  
3. Oral cutaneous fistula formation  
4. Abscess formation in the floor of the mouth  
5. Salivary fistula formation  
6. Mucocele or ranula formation  
7. Hypertrophic scarring

# Key Points

1. Submental intubation is not a replacement for open tracheostomy. Submental intubation is indicated in select cases of facial trauma and reconstructive surgery where postoperative mechanical ventilation is not required or will be of a short duration.  
2. The endotracheal tube connector should be loosened prior to intubation in order to avoid inadvertent extu

# Case Report 16.5. Pediatric submental intubation.

A 10-year-old male presents after a motor vehicle accident with extensive comminuted facial fractures to include basilar skull fractures, cribriform plate fractures, Le Fort II fractures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, bilateral orbits floor fractures, hard-palate fractures, and displaced mandibular fractures. The patient received a right decompressive craniectomy due to a large intracranial bleed. MMF was necessary to re-establish the anterior-posterior dimension of the facial skeleton, to establish

bation during tube manipulation. The use of kink-resistant, reinforced tube is highly recommended.

3. As with all airway procedures, the airway must be secured in a stable manner. With submental intubation, tube stabilization involves skin sutures and/or a 24-gauge wire secured circumferentially to a mandibular molar tooth.  
4. Although submental intubation is a secure airway, it is not indicated for prolonged periods of intubation. Submental intubations are typically converted to oral intubations immediately after surgery. Alternatively, when short periods of intubation are required and the need for long-term ventilatory support is not required, submental intubation is an appropriate alternative to open tracheostomy.  
5. Prior to initiating the surgical procedure (i.e., Naso-Orbito-Ethmoid [NOE] fracture reduction), end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  readings, bilateral chest auscultation, and chest movement are assessed to ensure that displacement of the endotracheal tube did not occur during the submental intubation procedure.  
6. Although paramedian skin incisions have been described in the literature, these incisions increase the risk of damage to the sublingual glands and facial nerve, result in a more difficult tube passage, and more bleeding. The midline approach for submental intubation is preferred as there are few anatomic structures to damage and the scar is well hidden within the submental crease.  
7. Submental intubation is a quick, simple, and safe procedure that is associated with fewer complications and postoperative management issues when compared to open tracheotomy.  
8. Metal-reinforced endotracheal tubes are used to reduce the risk of tube kinking during manipulation through the submental tract.

appropriate occlusion, and to reduce and fixate the comminuted facial fractures. The presence of the comminuted NOE fracture, basilar skull fracture, cribriform plate fracture, and CSF rhinorrhea prohibited nasal endotracheal intubation. Because the patient demonstrated no airway edema and no pulmonary trauma, and thus did not require long-term ventilation, the decision was made for a submental intubation in order to avoid the potential complications associated with an open tracheotomy (see Figures 16.41 through 16.47).
