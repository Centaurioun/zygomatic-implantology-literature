Augmentation or reduction of the anterior mandible (chin).

# Indications

1. Correction of skeletal deformities, including mild retrognathia, macrogenia, microgenia, and genial asymmetry  
2. Enlargement of the posterior airway space for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea

# Contraindications

1. Retrognathia with normal genial development  
2. Difficult or distorted anatomy  
3. Short mandibular symphysis  
4. Neurosensory concerns

# Anatomy

Mental nerve and foramen: The genu of the mental nerve may course anteriorly  $1 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  before exiting the mental foramen at the apices of the premolar teeth.

Mentalis muscle: A midline muscular band that originates from the incisive fossa of the mandible and inserts along the skin of the lower lip. Functions to protrude the lower lip.

Genioglossus muscle: A paired extrinsic tongue muscle that originates from the superior genial tubercle and inserts into the body of the tongue. Functions to protract and depress the tongue.

# Genioplasty Technique

1. The patient is prepped and draped to include the oral cavity and maxillofacial region. The patient is nasally intubated, and the tube is secured. A throat pack is positioned at the level of the hypopharynx.

2. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected within the anterior mandibular vestibule from mental foramen to mental foramen with direct injection within the mentalis muscles.  
3. An incision is created within the anterior mandibular vestibule,  $1\mathrm{cm}$  anterior to the depth of the vestibule (see Figure 30.1 in Case Report 30.1). An anteriorly placed incision will conserve both attached and unattached tissue for closure. An incision placed too close to the attached tissue will cause recession due to scar contracture and could compromise the incisor teeth. Once through the mucosa, the small branches of the mental nerve coursing superficially into the lower lip are identified and reflected laterally from the surgical field. The dissection is carried sharply through the mentalis muscle with a heavy scissor (Metzenbaum). Caution should be taken to minimize dissection toward the skin to avoid iatrogenic perforation of the lower lip.  
4. The symphysis is exposed anteriorly in a subperiosteal manner to the inferior border (see Figure 30.2 in Case Report 30.1). Minimal dissection is required superiorly to avoid unnecessary striping of the attached tissue over the mandibular incisor teeth and to preserve the superior portion of the mentalis muscle for closure.  
5. The dissection is carried posteriorly to locate the mental foramen (see Figure 30.3 in Case Report 30.1). Subperiosteal dissection is carried inferior and posterior to the mental foramen to expose the inferior border of the body of the mandible.  
6. A sagittal saw is used to score a vertical line marking the skeletal midline to serve as a reference during manipulation of the anterior segment (see Figure 30.4 in Case Report 30.1 and Figure 30.10 in Case Report 30.2). The planned osteotomy should be

placed at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  inferiorly to the visualized mental foramen and apices of the anterior teeth. The horizontal osteotomy should extend as far posteriorly as possible within the body of the mandible without encroaching on the mandibular canal.

7. A virtually planned, occlusal-based repositioning guide may be placed at this time to assist in planning the position of the osteotomy (see Figure 30.13 in Case Report 30.3).  
8. A reciprocating saw is used to score the facial cortex for the planned osteotomy bilaterally (see Figure 30.10 in Case Report 30.2).  
9. Once satisfied with the osteotomy design, the saw is held upright while cutting through both the facial and lingual cortices from the inferior border to the midline. The osteotomy is then duplicated on the contralateral side. Once the osteotomy is complete, the inferior border is downfractured and mobilized.  
10. The free segment can be stabilized with a towel clamp or wire. A wire-passing bur may be used to create an opening through the facial cortex for a 26-gauge wire. The wire or towel clamp can be used to control the free segment in preparation for fixation (see Figure 30.4 in Case Report 30.1).  
11. The genial segment is repositioned according to the treatment plan and inspected to ensure appropriate positioning and symmetry. Calipers can be used to determine the extent of skeletal change to aid in transferring the presurgical plan to the surgery. Alternatively, repositioning may be accomplished by custom-fabricated repositioning guides for improved accuracy. This is particularly useful for cases with known asymmetry (See Figure 30.14 in Case Report 30.3).  
12. Plate or positional screw fixation may be used to stabilize the anterior segment (see Figure 30.5 in Case Report 30.1 and Figure 30.11 in Case Report 30.2). Visualization of the fixated anterior segment and extraoral palpation of the osteotomy "wings" are performed to ensure symmetry and correct positioning of the anterior segment.  
13. Soft tissue closure is accomplished in a layered fashion beginning with reapproximation of the periosteum and mentalis muscle with interrupted resorbable sutures. Adequate resuspension of the mentalis muscle (see Figure 30.6 in Case Report 30.1) is imperative to prevent ptosis of the soft tissue drape. A single midline mucosal suture is placed to aid in orientation of the mucosal closure. Primary closure of the mucosa is completed with a continuous resorbable suture.  
14. A dressing may be placed over the chin to facilitate redraping the overlying soft tissue. The dressing is applied over the anterior mandible and submental area to support the soft tissue and to apply pressure to the surgical site in an effort to minimize edema.

# Genioglossus Advancement Technique

1. The approach to a genioglossus advancement mimics steps 1-5 listed in the genioplasty technique.  
2. While a genioglossus advancement can be performed without virtual planning, it is recommended to fabricate custom guides to aid in precision and avoiding errors (see Figure 30.16 in Case Report 30.4.).  
3. A sagittal saw is used to create vertical osteotomies that diverge from buccal to lingual (see Figure 30.17 in Case Report 30.4.). Horizontal osteotomies are made superiorly and inferior using the guide. These are paralleling osteotomies that do not diverge.  
4. Once the guided osteotomies are complete, the guide is removed. The inferior horizontal osteotomy is then completed as in a standard genioplasty to "drop" the genial segment.  
5. A reciprocating saw or osteotome is now used to connect the superior horizontal and vertical osteotomies to free the tubercle-bearing segment. Once freed, this trapezoid-shaped segment is slid inferiorly to achieve free manipulation of the segment. The tubercle-bearing segment is then repositioned with the lingual cortex (base of the trapezoid) facial to the native facial cortex (see Figure 30.18 in Case Report 30.4.). The wide base allows passive retention over the native facial cortex.  
6. The tubercle-bearing segment is then reduced with a reciprocating saw or recontouring bur until the lingual plate remains, relatively flush with the natural contour of the native cortex.  
7. The inferior genial segment is repositioned to its natural position and fixated with flat plates (see Figure 30.19 in Case Report 30.4.).

# Postoperative Management

1. Antibiotics coverage is recommended for 1 week postoperatively.  
2. Analgesics and anti-emetics are prescribed.  
3. Facial dressings are removed at 5-7 days postoperatively.  
4. Meticulous oral hygiene is reinforced.

# Complications

1. Sublingual hematoma formation: Bleeding may occur if vessels are severed or if the soft tissue is excessively traumatized. Failure to diligently address hemostasis may result in the development of a sublingual hematoma. An expanding hematoma may elevate the tongue, requiring exploration and evacuation of the extravasated blood to avoid potential airway compromise.  
2. "Witches chin": Occurs from failure to resuspend the mentalis muscle and/or wound dehiscence. Results in

ptosis of the soft tissue envelope. Corrected via resuspension of the mentalis musculature and appropriate wound closure.

3. Pointed chin: Occurs from a short osteotomy between the parasymphysis regions. The chin will appear narrow and pointed. Treatment includes anterior mandibular osteotomy to include the body of the mandible.  
4. Asymmetric chin: Due to poor treatment planning and/or inappropriate segment placement.

# Key Points

1. It is imperative that the facial and lingual cortices are transected at the same level in order to prevent a decrease in the vertical height of the chin as it is advanced.  
2. For patients with obstructive sleep apnea, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) can demarcate the anatomic boundaries of the posterior airway space and allows for the identification of areas that may be the etiology of soft tissue collapse. The base of the tongue is frequently the etiology of a narrow posterior airway. Advancing the genioglossus attachment at the genial tubercles via an anterior segmental osteotomy can increase the airway space and address the anatomic source of obstructive sleep apnea (see Figure 30.20 in Case Report 30.4.).  
3. Bone grafting materials may be used within the anterior segmental osteotomy to eliminate or soften the step expected at the osteotomy site after large advancements. Grafting may aid in creating a subtle bony transition and provide more aesthetic soft tissue contours within the lower face.  
4. In situations where the skeletal midline is deviated from the dental midline, traditional orthognathic surgery to correct a malocclusion may not achieve facial symmetry. Adjunctive osteotomies on the inferior border of the mandible or chin may be required to correct underlying skeletal deformities.  
5. The establishment of symmetry within an anterior mandible that possesses vertical distortion of the inferior border will often generate an unequal osteotomy gap necessitating shims and/or grafting when the segment is repositioned (see Figures 30.14 and 30.15 in Case Report 30.3).  
6. Virtual surgical planning (VSP) improves the accuracy when correcting an asymmetrical dentofacial deformity. VSP provides insight prior to the operation about the skeletal deformity and the movements necessary to reposition the chin symmetrically. Cutting templates can be fabricated in addition to jigs that are attached to a stable reference (occlusal arch) that transfers the virtual plan and accurately repositions the anterior segment.

7. Chin implants can be used for augmentation or to improve the contour of the anterior mandible. Stock or custom implants can be used to achieve the desired projection and contour. The advantages of chin implants compared to anterior segment osteotomies include a less invasive procedure with decreased potential neurosensory change. Disadvantages include potential bone remodeling or resorption if not adequately stabilized, infection, displacement, development of a fibrous capsule, foreign body reaction, and inability to affect the airway space.

# Technique - Le Fort I Rigid External Distractor (RED)

1. After oral endotracheal intubation, the endotracheal tube is secured and corneal shields with ophthalmic ointment are placed bilaterally (see Figure 31.1 [all figures cited in this section appear in Case Report 31.1]).

The face, scalp, and oral cavity are prepped in a sterile fashion. A half sheet with two towels is placed under the patient's head, and the inner towel is clamped to expose the frontal and temporal areas bilaterally down to the upper neck. A split sheet is then applied to cover the rest of the body. The area where the rigid external distractor (RED) device will be attached must be visualized within the surgical field.

2. Local anesthesia is injected within the maxillary vestibule and into the greater palatine canals. The fixation device is assembled on the back table of the sterile field. The vertical bars are joined to the RED frame.  
3. Eight fixation screws are lightly lubricated with ointment and inserted partially into the desired positions within the RED frame. It should be noted that the manufacturer recommends six screws in the halo, but eight screws enhance stability.  
4. One or two horizontal bars are attached to the vertical bar depending on if two-point or four-point fixation of the maxilla is desired. Four-point fixation allows for better control of the movement of the maxilla in all dimensions in a level I Le Fort osteotomy and will allow differential movement if level I and levels II-III Le Fort osteotomies are performed simultaneously.  
5. A maxillary vestibular incision is utilized to expose the anterior and lateral walls of the maxilla as in the Le Fort I osteotomy procedure. The mucosa is elevated from the anterior nasal spine and a subperiosteal dissection is performed along the nasal floor extending posteriorly to the choanal region. The nasal mucosa is elevated from the floor of the nose, the lateral nasal walls, and the nasal septum. Care is taken to minimize tears within the nasal mucosa.  
6. A reciprocating saw is used to create the osteotomy at the desired Le Fort level. The horizontal osteotomy must be placed  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  above the roots of the longest maxillary teeth and superior to the junction of the nasal floor and the pyriform rim. Sufficient space is required on the maxilla for placement of the fixation plates without compromising the teeth roots.

7. The bone attachments are released similarly to a standard Le Fort I osteotomy. The nasal crest of the maxilla is released from the septum-vomer with a guarded vomer osteotome. A single guarded osteotome is used to separate the lateral nasal walls. A curved osteotome is used to separate the posterior maxilla from the pterygoid plates at the pterygomaxillary junction bilaterally. The maxilla is gently downfractured. Any tethering of the nasal mucosa to the palatal mucosa in a cleft case is identified and carefully divided. Holding the maxilla down, the nasal mucosa is checked for full release from the maxilla.  
8. Ronguers are used to remove any remaining posterior attachments of the lateral nasal walls. The maxilla is mobilized without tearing the mucosal attachment. Full mobility of the maxilla is essential, yet care must be taken to retain all of the soft tissue attachments for blood supply.  
9. Two L-shaped plates are secured to the anterior superior edge on each side of the maxilla. Four or five screws are used to attach each plate, and one screw hole is left empty in the short arm of the L for a full-length 25-gauge stainless steel wire (see Figure 31.2). The long wire is passed through the most anterior hole on the plate and then bent away from the field and tagged with a hemostat. Alternatively, a distractor plate with incorporated arm may be used.  
10. To achieve four-point fixation in a level I Le Fort, a long 25-gauge wire is passed through the orthodontic tube on the upper first molar on each side. The wire is bent on itself when passed halfway. The two free ends are tagged to each other with a hemostat on each side. Four points of fixation are established on the maxilla to control maxillary movement in all directions.  
11. A #15 blade is used to create a small nick in the nasolabial fold at the very base of the nose a few millimeters lateral to the philtrum bilaterally. Each pair of the two pairs of wires attached to the maxillary plates are passed through the ipsilateral skin openings using a fine-tipped hemostat, externalizing the maxillary wires (see Figure 31.2). Alternatively, the wire may be passed with a Keith needle. The dental wires are passed through the oral cavity (see Figure 31.3).  
12. Before attaching the fixation device, ensure that the fixation device is properly assembled and that all of the assembly screws are fully tightened. To attach, the device requires two people. The surgeon holds the halo in the ideal position, as the assistant surgeon tightens the screws by hand. If the screws were to be tightened using the screwdriver, a temporal bone fracture could occur.  
13. The screws are tightened from front to back and on both sides at the same time. The goal is to engage the point of the screw in firm contact with the outer cortex of the skull. The vertical bars of the fixator remain midline (see Figure 31.4).

14. The halo device is positioned  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  above the supraorbital rim parallel to the Frankfurt horizontal plane. All of the fixation screws should be within the hairline. At least four fixation screws are used on each side, for a total of eight. All fixation screws are finger tightened as tight as possible without undue pressure on the temporal bones. Stability of the external fixation device is confirmed by gently moving the device and observing the head move.  
15. The maxilla is attached to the two short horizontal bars of the fixator (see Figure 31.5). If vertical movement is desired, the horizontal bar attached to the vertical screw must be configured to drive the maxilla in the desired direction as it is activated. The two wires attached to the maxillary plates are attached to the upper horizontal bars. The two wires attached to the first molars are covered with a sterile urinary catheter (see Figure 31.8) to protect the lips, and they are attached to the lower horizontal bar.  
16. An alar cinch suture is placed to minimize alar widening during advancement. The mucosal incision is closed with a resorbable suture. Final adjustments are made to the distractor, and the fixation screws are gently hand tightened one more time before the patient is awakened from anesthesia.  
17. The screwdrivers for the fixation device and wire cutters are given to the anesthesiologist and labeled with the patient's name. The anesthesiologist is taught how to remove the vertical bar in case of an airway emergency during emergence by cutting the four wires and removing the upper screw that secures the vertical bars (see Figure 31.6). Emergency removal of the vertical bar in the case of an airway crisis is also reviewed with the recovery room staff. The patient can only be extubated when fully awake (see Figure 31.7).

# Technique – Le Fort I Internal Osseous Distractor

1. Prior to surgery, the distractors may be mounted to a stereolithographic model of the patient's facial skeleton. This aids in the accuracy of the surgical plan and allows for adjustments to be made prior to implantation. The osteotomy may be outlined as well as the application of the internal osseous distractors (see Figure 31.9 [all figures cited in this section appear in Case Report 31.2]).  
2. After oral endotracheal intubation, the endotracheal tube is secured and corneal shields with ophthalmic ointment are placed bilaterally. The face, scalp, and oral cavity are prepped in a sterile fashion. Sterile towels are used to square off the surgical field. It is recommended to keep as many facial landmarks in the field as possible to aid the surgeon in orientation of the internal distractor vectors. A split sheet is applied to cover the rest of the body.

3. Local anesthesia is injected within the maxillary vestibule and into the greater palatine canals.  
4. The same Le Fort I approach and osteotomy described in the above section is performed. This includes downfracture and mobilization of the Le Fort maxilla.  
5. Distractors are placed into position after the maxillary downfracture. The proximal portion of the distractor is placed first. Drill and place only one screw on each side initially. This allows the surgeon to adjust the vector of the internal distractor. Remember, once the vector on internal distractors are set, they cannot be manipulated during the distraction phase as they can in a RED or external distraction.  
6. Apply the paralleling rods and evaluate for parallelism from a bird's eye view (see Figure 31.13) and lateral profile view (see Figure 31.14).  
7. Once the surgeon is pleased with the distraction vector on both sides, the distractor is fixated with three to five screws both proximally and distally within each plate. Remove the paralleling pins and place the distractor arms. Ensure that the distraction device is in the fully closed position before fixation (Figure 31.15 illustrates the closed and open distractor).  
8. Check both distractors by activating them to make sure the distractors are fixated correctly. The surgeon should also ensure the maxilla is moving symmetrically and in the correct vector. Once confirmed, bring both distractors back to the closed position. Closure is initiated in a standard fashion with or without a V-Y fashion after a nasal cinch has been performed. Care is taken to close the vestibular incision around the distractor arms.  
9. Activation of both devices is typically started 3-5 days postoperatively. One millimeter of distraction per day is common, but may vary based on the age of the patient. Once desired advancement have been achieved, the distractor arms that penetrate the oral mucosa may be removed in a clinical setting. This allows a comfortable consolidation phase that obviates wearing the RED device or having the mucosal-penetrating distraction arms in place. Once full consolidation has occurred, the internal distraction hardware may be removed. However, if a formal Le Fort and/or bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is planned at skeletal maturity, the hardware may remain in place until formal osteotomies are performed.

# Technique - Le Fort III Rigid External Distractor (RED)

1. After nasoendotracheal intubation with a reinforced tube, the tube is secured to the membranous septum and columella and corneal shields with ophthalmic ointment are placed bilaterally. The face, scalp, and oral cavity are prepped in a sterile fashion. A half sheet with two towels is placed under the patient's head, and the inner towel is clamped to expose the

temporal areas bilaterally down to the upper neck. A split sheet is applied to cover the rest of the body. The cranium must be in the field since a bi-coronal incision will be made. The operator may choose to utilize a craniotomy drape as well.

2. Le Fort III Distraction Osteogenesis is performed under general anesthesia. A standard bi-coronal incision is designed by the surgeon's preference. Full exposure of the orbits and zygomatic arches must be achieved; therefore, extension of the incision should be carried down to just superior of the tragus. Although a pericranial flap is not needed in this procedure, many surgeons will preserve the pericranium until dissection approaches approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the superior orbital rim, at which point an incision through the pericranium should be performed. Dissection from this point on should be subperiosteal.  
3. Subperiosteal dissection is continued until the entire superior, lateral, and medial aspects of the orbits are fully exposed. In addition, the entire lateral surface of the zygomas should be exposed, including the anterior portion of the zygomatic arches.  
4. Continue dissection until exposure of lateral frontotemporal skull/anterior most aspect of the temporal fossa, nasion, and bilateral nasal bones are visualized.  
5. Free the supraorbital nerves by releasing them from the supraorbital foramen with either a guarded osteotomy or #9 periosteal. Continue dissection to exposure the medial and lateral canthal attachments, careful to not sever them in the process. Full visualization of the lacrimal apparatus is necessary to protect this anatomy. The osteotomy of the medial orbit must be performed deep to the posterior lacrimal crest. The surgeon may consider introducing jones tubes bilaterally in order to protect the integrity of the lacrimal apparatus.  
6. Either a reciprocating or ultrasonic saw under copious amounts of normal saline irrigation may be used to perform osteotomies through the zygomatic arches, zygomaticofrontal (ZF) sutures, and nasion. Caution is taken to avoid transcranial migration of the saw during the nasion osteotomy. Toward the midline, the vomer and ethmoid are separated from the cranial base using a guarded swallow-tail osteotome. Again, care is taken to control the vector of the osteotome inferior to the cranial base. At this point, the surgeon may use a small straight osteotome or ultrasonic blade to perform the orbital osteotomies. The orbital walls are thin and do not require much force for the osteotomy; therefore, the authors prefers to use a small curved osteotome. All osteotomies must be connected for a complete Le Fort III osteotomy. Begin the orbital osteotomy with the medial orbital wall. Use the osteotome to create a controlled osteotomy behind the posterior lacrimal crest to the anterior orbital floor. Next, connect the ZF osteotomies already performed with the inferior orbital

fissure. This is completed either intraorbitally or from the anterior temporal fossa approach. If approaching from temporal fossa, place a malleable retractor in the bony orbit to protect orbital contents. The final step in the orbital osteotomies is the anterior orbital floor. A small curved osteotome may be used to complete this from the bi-coronal approach. Begin at the anterior most aspect of the inferior orbital fissure, move medially until the prior medial wall osteotomy is encountered. Alternatively, a standard transconjunctival inferior orbital floor approach may be used for better visualization of this floor osteotomy.

7. The last osteotomy to be performed is the pterygoid osteotomies. This may be approached via a Le Fort I incision in the standard fashion that most oral and maxillofacial surgeons are familiar with, as well as through the bi-coronal incision. If a Le Fort II is being performed without a Le Fort I, it is advantageous to perform this osteotomy via the coronal approach. A large straight osteotome is passed inferiorly from the anterior temporal fossa. The tip of the osteotome should ride against the bony wall of the posterior-lateral orbital wall and pass inferiorly until the pterygoid-maxillary junction is encountered. The surgeon can place their index finger in the ipsilateral buccal vestibule to help guide the osteotome in the correct position.  
8. Rowe disimpaction forceps are placed in the nose and mouth just as one would for a Le Fort I osteotomy, and gentle and controlled force is initiated while the head is stabilized until the midface is sufficiently mobilized. Small orderly movements are advised to not displace the nasoendotracheal tube. Additionally, Smith spreaders may be introduced in the nasion osteotomy to help downfracture the midface from the cranial base.  
9. Head frame (RED II System) is applied in the same fashion as previously mentioned with cranial pins (minimum three on each side).  
10. The fixation level of a Le Fort III is at the level of the zygomas. This may be accomplished with a bone plate, or a single fixation screw in the protuberance of the zygomas that allows a wire to pass through the head. A transcutaneous wire is then secured to the distractor  
11. If a simultaneous Le Fort I osteotomy is performed as well, the fixation level can be in the standard location for Le Fort I fixation or the dental arch as previously discussed. A transcutaneous wire is then secured to the distractor.  
12. Closure will begin with resuspending the lateral canthus if detached, and the temporalis muscle with resorbable sutures (Vicryl). The anterior portion of the temporalis muscle that was dissected free from the anterior temporal crest should be resuspended to the lateral orbital rim. This will lessen the chance of

temporal wasting in the future. The scalp is closed in a standard fashion.

# Postoperative Management

1. The patient is placed on a full liquid diet following the procedure.  
2. Meticulous oral and appliance hygiene is enforced.  
3. A latency period of 3-7 days is observed prior to activation of the device.  
4. A distraction rate of  $1\mathrm{mm/day}$  is typically observed. The device is activated by turning the four screws on the horizontal bars at a rate of  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  twice each day.  
5. Patients are monitored closely during distraction. At each visit, the fixator screws are manually tightened to prevent migration of the halo.  
6. After the ideal position of the maxilla is achieved, the last turn of the distractor is completed and the consolidation phase begins. The consolidation phase continues for a minimum of 8 weeks. Early release of the fixation has been linked with significant relapse. Bone healing can be monitored with cephalometric head films. Alternatively, once the distraction phase is complete, the surgeon may choose to take the patient to the operating room from distraction removal and immediate replacement with rigid internal fixation. This allows bony contouring at the zygomatic-frontal junction that often presents with an extreme bony step post distraction. This also allows the patient to avoid wearing the halo for 8 or more weeks for full consolidation.  
7. At the time of appliance removal, the wires are cut and the device is carefully removed by unscrewing the eight fixation screws. The wires connected to the maxillary plates can be removed with local anesthesia or with intravenous sedation.  
8. After removal of the appliance, there is a short period of time when the regenerated bone can be molded with elastic therapy to achieve an ideal occlusal result. Each case will require a differing level of force to close the bite, but it can usually be accomplished with elastic bands to the orthodontic hooks.

# Complications

1. Migration of the halo inferiorly toward the brow from incomplete mobilization of the maxilla  
2. Intracranial fixation pin migration with dural violation in the setting of halotype distractor  
3. Pins loosening  
4. Relapse  
5. Hardware failure  
6. Temporoparietal skull fracture as a result of overtightening halo screws  
7. Unequal distraction in one or more planes  
8. Asymmetrical advancement  
9. Superficial surgical site infections, mostly around pins

10. Deep soft tissue infection and abscess formation  
11.  
hospitalization  
12. Infraorbital nerve injury  
13. Orbital/global injury  
14. Partial anosmia  
15. Excessive bleeding

# Key Points

1. Surgical distraction should be delayed until skeletal maturity is completed, preventing the need for repeat procedures. An exception is if the child is suffering from extreme negative social stimuli. In this instance, internal maxillary distraction may be indicated. It should be noted that early maxillary distraction does not obviate the need for formal osteotomies at skeletal maturity.  
2. Most cleft cases have already undergone multiple surgical procedures within the maxilla, and greater care must be taken to ensure adequate blood supply to the maxilla. The soft tissue attachments of the soft palate must be retained. If the greater palatine arteries can be preserved, then the blood supply to the regenerate is enhanced. Keeping the vestibular incision from second bicuspid to second bicuspid is another maneuver to enhance blood supply to the maxilla.  
3. The maxilla must be released from all of its bone attachments for full mobilization. Failure to fully mobilize the maxilla or midface and remove potential bony

# Case Reports

Case Report 31.1. Le Fort I - Rigid external distractor (RED). An 18-year-old patient born with orbital hypertelorism and bilateral cleft lip and palate after cleft lip repair (age 2 months), cleft palate repair (age 18 months),

interferences will result in incomplete and/or asymmetrical distraction. The bone attachments to be cut are identical to those in a Le Fort I osteotomy and/or Le Fort III osteotomy.

4. The posterior osteotomies may be initiated between the maxilla and the pterygoid plates or in the posterior part of the tuberosity. By having the posterior osteotomy within the posterior part of the tuberosity and crossing across the hard palate, velopharyngeal insufficiency can be minimized.  
5. The maxillary artery and vein are located just posterior to the posterior wall of the maxilla. Both structures can lead to significant bleeding if inadvertently cut. Particular attention to this vasculature should be paid in the case of a pterygoid plate osteotomy from a coronal approach.  
6. The nasal mucosa is adherent to the floor of the nose and is elevated carefully. Where the nasal crest of the maxilla connects to the cartilage of the septum, the mucosal attachment is adherent and is more challenging to disarticulate without tearing the mucosa. Mucosal tears result in increased postoperative bleeding and discomfort. In cleft cases without an intact hard palate, the nasal mucosa will be bound to the palatal mucosa within a band of scar tissue. This presentation is more difficult. Tearing can be avoided by creating the bone cuts and carefully starting the下一fracture. As the maxilla is slowly lowered, electrocautery can be used to divide the nasal mucosa away from the palatal mucosa, working from anterior to posterior.

sphincteroplasty (age 3 years), facial bipartition and orbital repositioning (age 6 years), and dentoalveolar cleft grafting (age 8 years) with severe maxillary hypoplasia and dysgnathia (see Figures 31.1 through 31.8).
