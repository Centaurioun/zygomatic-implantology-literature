Digital data is exported into software programs that enable virtual surgical planning (VSP) in a three-dimensional (3D) environment to evaluate anatomical structures and to treatment plan the surgical correction of dentofacial deformities. VSP permits digital segmentation of the maxilla and mandible, repositioning of condylar position and bony segments and allows osseus segment movements in vertical, horizontal, and transverse dimensions. Based on the final VSP treatment plan; custom surgical guides, cut guides, and fixation devices can be fabricated.

# Data Collection for Orthognathic Virtual Surgical Planning

Data collection, often referred to as final records, should ideally be performed 1-3 weeks prior to the planned surgical date. At this final data collection visit, it is imperative that the orthodontic movements of the teeth have been suspended (the patient should be passive versus active orthodontics). If orthodontic movement of the teeth occurs between final record collection and the time of surgery, the surgical splint may not fit accurately during the surgery. The following is a comprehensive set of data that should be collected in preparation of digital VSP.

# Clinical Examination

Even with advances in digital technology, there is still no substitute for a thorough clinical exam. At a minimum, the clinical examination should record maxillary teeth show at rest and animation, maxillary dental midline, maxillary occlusal cant, and the presence of any orbital dystopia. These measurements should be recorded and available at the time of the digital planning session. While many surgeons find other clinical evaluations useful in their analysis, these are the minimum measurements that the authors feel are required to accurately plan orthognathic cases within a digital workflow.

# Clinical Photos

1. At minimum, the following clinical photos should be obtained prior to planning: frontal repose, frontal animation, and right profile repose.  
a. Care should be taken to capture the patient in natural head position. This is often performed by having the patient look into their own eyes in a mirror when looking straight ahead.  
b. In the repose photos, if the patient's lips do not naturally separate at rest, the patient should be instructed to relax their lower face until their lips separate such that the lay of the upper lip can be judged relative to the central incisor.  
c. It is paramount that these photos, especially the frontal photo, is taken orthogonal. The frontal clinical photo can then be used to confirm the clinical measurements mentioned above at the time of planning to verify digital head position, discussed further below.  
2. In addition, intraoral frontal occlusion, side occlusion, and maxillary/mandibular occlusal images are helpful, but are not required for this planning method.

# Computed Tomography (CT) Scan (Exported as DICOM Files)

1. Any CT scan that captures the entire maxillofacial structure is acceptable. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan is the most often used as it is readily available with the surgeon's office and can be used to reconstruct lateral cephalogram and orthopantomogram views. In addition, it has a lower dose of radiation than standard medical grade helical CT scans.  
2. The importance and implication of condylar position when the face bow is obtained have been appreciated by surgeons since the inception of bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. Modern fixation techniques have made

ible first surgery possible. Perhaps the largest advantage of mandible first surgery is the reduced dependence on condylar position during final records. However, if the surgeon is planning maxillary first surgery or the use of custom mandibular hardware, condylar position is still vitally important. In the case of mandible first surgery with custom hardware, if the condyle is not appropriately seated when the CT scan is obtained, this will result in an increased osteotomy gap at time of surgery compared to the virtual plan (see Figure 26.1). When using non-custom (stock) fixation, this adjustment is easily made intraoperatively. However, if the surgeon has elected to use custom fixation (custom plate fabrication) based off of the virtual surgical plan, fixation holes may now overlay the now larger osteotomy gap at time of surgery. If the surgeon plans to use custom mandibular hardware and there is a concern that the condyles are not seated within the CT scan, the authors recommend having the engineers digitally reposition the condyle into what appears to be

Figure 26.1. Demonstration of a custom mandibular fixation plate spanning the osteotomy gap during the virtual planning session. If the condyles are not fully seated within the fossa on the preoperative CT, then intraoperatively when the condyles are fully seated the proximal segment will move posteriorly as indicated by the blue arrows. However, the distal, dentate segment will remain fixed to the skull base through maxillomandibular fixation (MMF). This will result in an overall increase in the osteotomy gap, which can result in one or more of the preplanned fixation holes of the custom plate overlying the osteotomy gap (highlighted in red).

a more seated position within the fossa and being careful to not place fixation holes too close to the osteotomy gap on the distal segment to allow for an acceptable margin of error.

# Occlusal Record (Exported as STL Files)

An occlusal record is necessary to obtain accurate dental occlusal references for tooth alignment and surgical splint fabrication. As CT scans have inherent occlusal inaccuracies due to orthodontic brackets, metallic restorations, and other metal artifacts, they cannot capture the occlusal surfaces of teeth with sufficient accuracy to digitally fabricate an occlusal splint capable of intimate adaptation to the occlusal surfaces of the patient's dentition (see Figure 26.2).

There are two methods to capture an occlusal record, scanning traditional stone dental models or an optical scan (intraoral scan/digital impression) of a patient's dentition (see Figure 26.3).

An intraoral scan (optical scan) of the patient's dentition is the authors' preference. Digital scanning utilizing an intraoral scanner provides an STL file of the patient's occlusal data, eliminates the need for conventional impression material and plaster models, and provides accurate occlusal data. This method will necessitate the surgeon digitally setting the occlusion.

# Setting Postsurgical Occlusion

All data is uploaded into planning software to be viewed by both the surgeon and the digital planning engineers. Once the engineers have a complete data set within their system, a planning session can be scheduled which provides enough turnaround time for splint fabrication prior to surgery. If desired, it is possible to set, scan, and upload the ideal postsurgical occlusion from physical dental study models for review within the VSP session. However, the authors prefer utilizing an intraoral scanner and setting the occlusion digitally within the VSP session. By setting the occlusion digitally, it eliminates the need for physical dental models entirely and saves significant time. When working with a private engineer, the engineer should set at least one, if not several, preliminary occlusal set ups prior to the planning session with the surgeon. The surgeon can use the same guiding principles to set the occlusion that have been used with traditional model surgery. Guidelines noted in Figure 26.4 or a version edited to the surgeon's preference can be provided to the engineers to aid in improved occlusal set ups prior to the planning session and to minimize the overall length of the planning session.

During the VSP session, the surgeon works with the engineers to evaluate the proposed occlusal set up. The authors feel there are several significant advantages to

setting the occlusion digitally. First, single versus multipiece versus different osteotomy locations of a multipiece maxillary osteotomy can be evaluated much more efficiently. Second, occlusal interferences are easier to evaluate, calculate, and display. For example, if a deeper bite is desired, the surgeon can sink the occlusion further and quickly evaluate the risk to benefit ratio of the exact amount of enameloplasty required to obtain a certain occlusal setup. Additionally, a detailed and accurate enameloplasty map can be generated and is becoming standard of care (see Figure 26.5). Lastly, the digital environment allows net effects of maxillary segmentation to be easily visualized and calculated. This information allows the surgeon to evaluate numerous different surgical treatment scenarios and fixation options that may be employed intra- or postoperatively to attempt to maintain these movements. This data is paramount in cases with large transverse expansion movements to minimize postsurgical relapse (see Figure 26.11).

# Set Digital Head Position

After the occlusion has been set, the surgeon and engineers work together to set a digital head position. In order to accurately plan in a 3D digital environment, the digital representation of the patient must faithfully mimic the real-world patient. The surgeon should be careful to assure both the frontal and profile orientation are considered. In the past, fiducial markers and gyroscopes have been used, but the authors have found that using clinical pictures to carefully confirm that the clinical position matches the digital representation is the most efficient and acceptably accurate method. For many cases, this can be done quickly. However, in cases of significant asymmetry, especially in patients with existing orbital dystopia,

this step is of paramount importance. If this is not done properly, it can result in worsening of an existing asymmetry (see Figures 26.6 through 26.8).

1. Frontal orientation can be established by confirming that orbital dystopia, maxillary midline, and maxillary occlusal cant are correctly transferred from the real world to the digital world. By default, most engineers will assume that the orbits are level and thus set the infraorbital rims to true digital horizontal. From there, the engineer will tell the surgeon that based on this default orientation, the digital patient shows a certain maxillary midline position relative to the skeletal facial midline and the maxillary cant is measured from the orbits to the canines. The surgeon then confirms that

![](images/d566e76c3f3e36a3e58bb6410555c522b581895f8a8a508b92cfb3c6fb58456d.jpg)

Orbits level

This head position puts the maxillary dental midline  $1.74\mathrm{mm}$  to the left of facial with a maxillary occlusal cant. Not accounting for the orbital dystopia would have created a non-ideal outcome for this patient.

Cant:  $\sim 1.5\mathrm{mm}$  lower on right canine

The true maxillary dental midline is  $1.4\mathrm{mm}$  to the right of facial, without a maxillary cant. VSP in a 3D environment allows for the evaluation of anatomical deformities and treatment planning of both simple and complex dentofacial deformities.

Cant: Canines level

no orbital dystopia is present based on the clinical images. Next, the surgeon will verify that the orientation is correct by confirming that the maxillary dental midline deviation and occlusal cant reported by the engineer are congruent with the clinical exam/photos. If there is no orbital dystopia and the engineer and surgeon agree that the maxillary midline and maxillary cant shown in the 3D digital environment faithfully represents the patient in the clinical world, the surgeon can proceed to the next step. However, if there is a

discrepancy between what is seen by the engineer in the digital world and what the surgeon sees in the clinical world, the head position must be adjusted. The most common cause of this discrepancy is orbital dystopia. If the patient's orbits are not level in the clinical world, then when the engineer assumes the orbits are level in the digital world, there will be a relative shift of the maxillary dental midline and a maxillary cant (see Figure 26.7). The surgeon and engineer should work together to adjust the digital representation of the

patient until the digital position of the skeleton accurately reflects the patient in the clinical world in the frontal plane (see Figure 26.8).

2. Profile orientation is much simpler. A profile shot in repose can be used to position the patient digitally, but the authors find it much simpler to orient horizontal to a line passed from porion to orbitale (Frankfurt horizontal). Inaccuracy at this step may result in alterations and inaccuracies regarding the pitch and occlusal plane measurements. However, these small inaccuracies carry little clinical significance in the planning process. In addition, the authors feel that many patients alter their head position in the sagittal plane in order to modify their profile either from a functional breathing or esthetic standpoint. These patients are likely to adjust these positions based on their new postoperative profile.

# Planning Surgical Movements

With the data gathered, occlusion set, and the digital patient correctly oriented to accurately reflect the clinical patient, the surgeon and engineers are ready to define the planned surgical movements. Planning surgical movements are based on a number of factors including the patient's existing skeletal deformity and malocclusion, the patient's chief complaint, the patient's preference to operate multiple jaws, and the stability of proposed surgical movements. There is no absolute VSP evaluation sequence, and there are multiple appropriate treatment plans for each individual patient. The authors preferred to sequence the orthognathic VSP session as follows:

1. Occlusion  
2. Head position  
3. Maxillary dental midline  
4. Maxillary cant  
5. Anterior posterior movement of the maxillary central incisor  
6. Vertical movement of the maxillary central incisor  
7. Maxillary occlusal plane  
8. Yaw correction of maxillomandibular complex

# IntraOperative Insights

During the planning of the surgical movements above, there are several advantages to planning in the digital world compared to conventional model surgery that warrant highlighting.

1. Yaw and interferences of the mandibular proximal and distal segments are easier to evaluate with digital planning compared to conventional model surgery. After completion of the planned surgical movements, the surgeon can request a worm's eye view to evaluate yaw and interferences of the mandibular proximal and distal segments (see Figure 26.9). The worm's eye view allows the surgeon to accurately evaluate if a yaw deformity is

present and if correcting the yaw is worth potentially worsening interferences of the proximal and distal segments. The authors routinely allow up to  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of yaw deformity at the canines if correcting this deformity would create substantial interferences of the proximal and distal segments of the mandible. This amount of yaw is clinically imperceptible and leaving it can, at times, result in significantly less interference of the proximal and distal segment. This allows the surgeon to anticipate and minimize interferences when possible.

2. Net movement of the proximal segment allows for insight into the stability of a net mandibular movement. Ideally, after completion of the planned virtual movement, the proximal segment of the mandible should rotate counterclockwise or not move, which results in shortening or no change of the preoperative length of the pterygomandibular sling. If the proximal segment must rotate clockwise to meet the inferior border of the repositioned distal segment, this demonstrates increased stretch of the pterygomandibular sling which can potentially lead to instability of the movement. If an unfavorable proximal segment move is appreciated during the planning session, the surgeon can use this insight to either adjust the net surgical movements such that the proximal segment is now neutral or rotates counterclockwise to meet the distal segment or utilize extra fixation during the operation ranging from extra bicortical screws, bicortical screws in conjunction with plates, two plates, or custom mandibular fixation plates.

Figure 26.9. Worm's eye view after final planned movements. Above image demonstrates  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  of mandibular yaw at the canines. Rotating about the central incisors can correct for this yaw, but will create further interference at the right mandibular proximal and distal segments. The worm's eye view allows the surgeon to accurately evaluate if a yaw deformity is present and if correcting the yaw is worth potentially worsening interferences of proximal and distal segments.

Figure 26.10. The above images illustrate the location of the IAN canal and the thickness of the cortical plate at the inferior border of the mandible. Identifying and measuring the above points within the VSP sessions allow the surgeon to anticipate where to initiate the inferior border osteotomy cut and the location of the IAN canal during surgery.

3. In a mandibular setback, the exact amount of buccal mandibular cortex that should be trimmed can be measured and visualized in a surgical report. This can save time intraoperatively by predictively trimming the predetermined amount of the mandible prior to placing the patient in MMF.  
4. The position of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) canal relative to the inferior border of the mandible and the thickness of the inferior border cortical plate can be visualized and measured within the VSP session to allow the surgeon to plan the design of the final osteotomy (see Figure 26.10).

# Surgical Adjuncts

Digital planning has unlocked the ability to design and fabricate custom 3D surgical adjuncts such as palatal inserts, cutting guides, and custom plates. As the price of this technology continues to fall and their use increases, the only item limiting the creation of a new surgical adjunct is the creativity of the individual surgeon.

1. Palatal inserts have provided an alternative solution to an immediate postoperative rigid device to maintain the transverse dimension in a multipiece maxillary osteotomy requiring significant expansion in the transverse dimension. In order to bolster this historically unstable movement, transverse expansion, many surgeons in the past have opted to wire in the final splint postoperatively in order to maintain this expansion for several weeks until an alternative device can be placed by the orthodontist, such as a heavy arch wire or transpalatal appliance. The advantage to the palatal splint is that it can support the transverse dimension, while not covering the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. This allows the surgeon to take advantage of the postoperative

regional accelerator phenomenon (RAP) in order to settle the occlusion faster (see Figures 26.11 and 26.12).

2. Custom cutting guides can be used to avoid anatomic structures which are hard to visualize intraoperatively

such as teeth roots, nerves, or muscle attachments (see Figures 26.13 and 26.14). Custom cutting guides may be used in conjunction with custom plates to place predictive holes prior to completing an osteotomy.

3. Custom fixation plates can, in theory, alleviate the need for occlusal splints. However, their persistent high cost relative to a standard occlusal splint has reduced their usage for routine cases and single jaw surgeries. However, in more complex, unstable, or difficult to fixate movements, custom plates provide a unique avenue to efficiently fixate atypical osteotomies, such as the intraoral inverted L and total subapical osteotomies (see Figures 26.15 and 26.16).
