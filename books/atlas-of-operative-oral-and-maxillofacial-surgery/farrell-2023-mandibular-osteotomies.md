# Sagittal Ramus Osteotomy (Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy or BSSO)

A means of surgically repositioning the lower jaw through mandibular osteotomies.

# Indications

1. The correction of congenital dentofacial deformities, including mandibular deficiency, hyperplasia, asymmetry, and dysgnathia  
2. The correction of acquired dentofacial deformities resulting from facial trauma, tumor ablative surgery, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) asymmetries and deformities

# Contraindications

1. Distorted ramus anatomy (thin or abnormal shape)  
2. Excessive counter-clockwise rotation (greater than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  apertognathia requires two-jaw surgery)  
3. Mandibular advancements greater than  $12\mathrm{mm}$  
4. Neurosensory concerns  
5. Previous head and neck radiation

# Anatomy

Retrolinguial depression: A depression located on the lingual aspect of the mandible between the lingula and the posterior border of the mandible.

Lingula: Entrance of the neurovascular bundle into the mandibular canal. The sagittal ramus osteotomy is initiated superior to the lingula.

Antelingula: Prominence along the lateral ramus predicting the position of the lingula on the medial aspect of the ramus.

Inferior alveolar nerve: Neurovascular bundle which enters the mandibular canal adjacent to the lingual and exits the mandible anteriorly at the mental foramen.

# Sagittal Ramus Osteotomy (SRO)

# Technique

1. The patient is nasally intubated, and the tube is secured. A throat pack is positioned at the level of the hypopharynx.

2. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected along the external oblique ridge, retromolar trigone, and posterior buccal vestibule.  
3. The patient is prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion to include the oral cavity and maxillofacial skeleton.  
4. Preplanned enameloplasty is performed, and a posterior bite block is placed.  
5. A #15 blade is used to initiate an incision through mucosa only, positioned  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the external oblique ridge (see Figure 28.28 in Case Report 28.1). The soft tissue is reflected medial over the external oblique ridge exposing the underlying muscle (Figure 28.29 in Case Report 28.1). A sharp dissection proceeds to the lateral ramus transecting muscle and periosteum.  
6. A periosteal elevator is used to dissect within a subperiosteal plane to expose the lateral mandible anteriorly to the Dalpont prominence adjacent to the molars. The dissection continues posteriorly to expose the external oblique ridge and the superior portion of the ascending ramus. A sigmoid notch retractor is positioned to elevate and retract the temporalis attachment from the ascending ramus. Subperiosteal dissection continues on the medial surface of the mandible, creating a subperiosteal pocket superior to the lingula. The inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle is identified. Identification can be accomplished by direct visualization or by palpation of the lingula with a nerve probe.  
7. A Seldin retractor is placed within the lingual subperiosteal pocket and rotated  $45^{\circ}$  to protect the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle and to create a space for the insertion of the reciprocating saw (see Figure 28.30 in Case Report 28.1).  
8. A reciprocating saw initiates the horizontal osteotomy of the medial cortex at a  $45^{\circ}$  angle (the cut may be more vertical if the ramus is thin) (see Figure 28.31 in Case Report 28.1). The tip of the saw should extend into the retrolingular depression with the blade at full depth to score the osteotomy superior to the neurovascular bundle (see Figures 28.1 and 28.2).

Figure 28.2. Illustration depicting a favorable sagittal ramus osteotomy split (Hunsuck modification), mandibular advancement, and fixation with positional screws.

9. The osteotomy is extended anteriorly through the cortical bone medial to the external oblique ridge and lateral to the dentition. The osteotomy is extended to the bony prominence located along the buccal aspect of the molar region (Dalpont prominence) (see Figure 28.32 in Case Report 28.1).  
10. The bite block is removed. A channel retractor is placed along the inferior border of the mandible along the anterior aspect of the Dalpont prominence. The channel retractor is rotated  $45^{\circ}$  to expose the inferior border of the mandible, allowing for the insertion of the reciprocating saw.  
11. The vertical osteotomy is initiated at the anterior aspect of the Dalpont prominence at the inferior border and transects both the buccal and lingual cortical plates inferior to the mandibular canal. The osteotomy continues vertically as a tangential cut through the lateral cortex only to connect the osteotomy along the external oblique ridge (see Figure 28.33 in Case Report 28.1).  
12. The bite block is returned to stabilize the mandible during the separation of the mandible into proximal and distal segments. During separation (splitting) of the sagittal ramus osteotomy, the osteotomy should be visualized along its entire length to ensure equal separation throughout.  
13. Osteotomes are used to facilitate the initial separation of the osteotomy (see Figure 28.34 in Case Report 28.1). Care is taken to avoid using the osteotomes as a fulcrum posterior to the dentition to prevent the development of a lingual plate fracture within the distal segment.  
14. After initial separation, larger osteotomes or spreaders are used within the osteotomy to provide equal separation and to complete the split. Care is taken to ensure that the inferior border is associated with the proximal segment (see Figure 28.35 in Case Report 28.1). The inferior border of the mandible provides structural integrity to the proximal segment, aiding in avoiding unfavorable fractures.  
15. The neurovascular bundle is identified early to ensure proper positioning and to avoid further iatrogenic injury with instrumentation between the osteotomy.  
16. The nerve typically will course within the distal segment and requires minimal manipulation (see Figure 28.36 in Case Report 28.1). Occasionally, the nerve will remain encased within the mandibular canal in the proximal segment and requires release by removal of the overlying bone (see Figure 28.8). Elevators and/or osteotomes may be used to free the nerve and allow positioning within the confines of the distal segment.  
17. The muscular and tendinous attachments of the medial pterygoid muscle are released with a J stripper

from the inferior and medial aspect of the distal segment to ensure passive repositioning of the mandible. Mandibular setback surgery will require release of soft tissue from the medial aspect of the proximal segment to create a pocket for the repositioned distal segment.

18. Maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) is established using the prefabricated occlusal splint with 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires.  
19. Passive positioning of the proximal and distal segments is confirmed. Bony interferences are removed with saws, burs, and rasps to improve bone contact (see Figure 28.37 in Case Report 28.1).  
20. The inferior borders of the mandible are aligned, and the condyles are seated with firm pressure in a posterior-superior vector.  
21. Fixation can be applied using percutaneous (see Figure 28.38 in Case Report 28.1) or transoral access. Trocar positioning is determined by passing a local anesthetic needle through the skin followed by a stab incision with a #15 blade. The trocar allows placement of rigid internal fixation perpendicular to the cortex.  
22. Fixation options include positional screws placed in a line at the superior border (see Figure 28.38 in Case Report 28.1 and Figure 28.47 in Case Report 28.2) or in an inverted L pattern (see Figure 28.2). Stability of the osteotomy is improved with spacing of the positional screws over the span of the osteotomy. Lag screw technique can also be used for fixation and can allow for excellent bony contact between the segments. With this method, it is critical to stay mindful of the effect on the condylar position. Plates with monocortical fixation may be placed on the lateral border of the mandible. A combination of bicortical positional screw(s) and plates may be used if there is inadequate bone available in the distal segment for isolated screw fixation (concomitant third molar removal) or in cases of long advancements with limited bony overlap (see Figure 28.39 in Case Report 28.1).  
23. At the completion of fixation, MMF is released and the occlusion is verified. Deviation of the occlusion to one side may indicate failure to seat the condyle and require removal of fixation on the affected side with repositioning of the proximal segment.  
24. The trocar incision is closed with a single interrupted suture. The intraoral incisions are closed with resorbable sutures (see Figure 28.40 in Case Report 28.1).  
25. The throat pack is removed, and the surgical splint is removed. Guiding elastics may be utilized to facilitate neuromuscular guidance and reprogramming. A pressure dressing is applied to aid in control of postoperative edema.

# Intraoral Vertical Ramus Osteotomy (IVRO)

# Technique

1. An incision is placed through mucosa positioned lateral to the external oblique ridge similar to that performed for a sagittal ramus osteotomy. The incision length is ample enough to allow appropriate access  $(4 - 5\mathrm{cm})$  to the ramus.  
2. A subperiosteal dissection is performed to expose the lateral aspect of the mandible. The elevator is carried over the lingual aspect of the mandible immediately posterior to the dentition to ensure adequate soft tissue reflection to prevent tears when the notch retractor is used to strip the temporalis tendon from the ascending ramus. The dissection should expose the entire ramus from the posterior border to the anterior border and from the sigmoid notch superiorly to the antagonial notch inferiorly (see Figure 28.50 in Case Report 28.3).  
3. A channel retractor is placed into the sigmoid notch on the medial aspect of the mandible. A reciprocating saw is used to separate the coronoid process to improve visibility and eliminate the pull of the temporalis muscle. The coronoid can be removed completely through reflection of the tendinous attachment.  
4. The lateral aspect of the mandible is exposed with the placement of Bauer retractors into the sigmoid and antagonial notches, respectively. Additional retraction is accomplished with a large right-angle toe-out retractor positioned at the posterior border (a LeVasseur retractor is also frequently used). The soft tissue dissection and osteotomy of the coronoid are performed with the use of a bite block. The mouth is closed during the creation of the vertical ramus osteotomy for accessibility to the posterior border.  
5. The orientation of the vertical ramus osteotomy is established by paralleling the posterior border of the mandible utilizing an oscillating saw  $(105^{\circ})$ . The orientation of the osteotomy is important to avoid carrying the osteotomy into the condylar neck or off of the posterior border. The osteotomy is positioned posterior to the lingula and entrance of the inferior alveolar nerve into the mandibular canal, and typically establishes a proximal segment measuring  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  from the posterior border.  
6. Rotation of the oscillating saw creates the initial osteotomy mid-ramus. With orientation of the osteotomy confirmed, the oscillating saw is "walked" superiorly into the sigmoid notch cutting on the outstroke as the shaft is positioned against the ramus (see Figure 28.51 in Case Report 28.3). The saw is then returned to the mid-ramus area and redirected inferior into the antagonial notch in a similar fashion.  
7. After the vertical ramus osteotomy is completed, the proximal segment is stabilized with a kochar clamp,

while the muscular and periosteal attachment from the inferior medial aspect of the segment is released. The soft tissue release establishes a pocket for telescoping of the posteriorly repositioned distal segment.

8. MMF is established utilizing the prefabricated occlusal splint and ensuring that the proximal segment remains lateral to the distal segment (see Figure 28.52 in Case Report 28.3). Failure to do so may result in loss of the proximal segment medially, requiring a release of MMF to locate and lateralize the proximal segment.  
9. The proximal segment is adapted to passively and evenly contact the distal segment. Bony interferences (usually superior toward the sigmoid notch) are reduced with a recontouring bur or rasp from either segment to ensure passive overlap. Seating of the condyle is subtle (contrary to firm seating with class II corrections).  
10. Application of rigid internal fixation requires percutaneous access via trocar placement. Stabilization of the vertical ramus osteotomy is generally performed via three positional screws oriented in a vertical fashion (see Figure 28.53 in Case Report 28.3 and Figure 28.3). Surgeons may elect to complete a period of MMF with or without wire osteosynthesis stabilizing the segments should rigid fixation not be utilized.

Figure 28.3. Illustration depicting a favorable vertical ramus osteotomy split, mandibular setback, and fixation with vertically oriented positional screws.

11. The inferior portion of the proximal segment may be reduced if excessive lateral or inferior projection is noted as creating a palpable bony elevation externally. The intraoral and percutaneous wounds are closed in a similar fashion to the sagittal ramus osteotomy noted in this chapter.

# Extraoral Ramus Osteotomy

# Technique

1. Access to the ramus may be achieved through either a transoral or a transcutaneous submandibular or Risdon approach. With extraoral approaches, the avoidance of paralytics should be reviewed with the anesthesia team preoperatively to allow for testing of the facial nerve (CN VII) during soft tissue dissection with a nerve stimulator.  
2. Sharp and blunt dissection of the tissue layers is completed to the angle of the mandible. The subperiosteal dissection of the ramus is completed superiorly from the angle of the mandible to expose the sigmoid notch between the base of the coronoid process and condylar neck.  
3. The planned osteotomy (vertical ramus osteotomy, inverted L osteotomy, or C osteotomy) is completed under direct visualization once the soft tissues have been adequately reflected from the surgical field. After separation of the mandible into proximal and distal segments, the prefabricated occlusal splint (or bone-borne guide) is used to place the patient into MMF and the mandible is repositioned based on the presurgical plan. The proximal and distal segments are rigidly fixated utilizing positional screws and/or stock or custom plates.  
4. Closure of the wound is completed in a layered fashion with special care to ensure that the marginal mandibular nerve is not impinged or damaged. The skin may be closed with a nonresorbable or resorbable suture.

Note: Correction of severe mandibular deficiency with a large counter-clockwise movement requires bone grafting within the osteotomy to ensure maintenance of continuity and bone union. Additional osteotomy techniques can be found in Chapter 29. Atypical Mandibular Osteotomies.

# Bone Grafting Considerations in Orthognathic Surgery

Grafting bony defects in orthognathic surgery can provide added structural support, aid in minimizing relapse, and facilitate healing. This is especially true for large defects in wide segmental expansions, lengthy advancements, or any inferior repositioning. While bone grafting is not common with traditional mandibular osteotomies, it is often recommended in large counter-clockwise movements for mandibular deficiency.

Most surgeons recommend grafting defects larger than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  to encourage bony union. There are various grafting modalities; however, autogenous grafts offer osteogenic properties in addition to osteoconduction and osteoinduction. The availability and ease of autogenous graft harvest in orthognathic surgery make autogenous bone grafting a reliable and efficient choice for augmenting defects created by large, unstable movements.

When a sagittal split osteotomy is used for mandibular setback, osteotomy of the most distal portion of the proximal segment (see Figures 28.4 through 28.7) is often necessary to allow for passive seating of segments during fixation. This bone can be harvested and used for the subsequent Le Fort osteotomy or genioplasty with no additional incisions and minimal time. Bone may also be harvested from the inferior border of the proximal segment or coronoid process during intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO), or from osteotomy in asymmetry corrections.

# Postoperative Management

1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), antibiotics, and analgesics are prescribed. Liquid medications are typically prescribed as they are more easily consumed in the early postoperative period (maximum discomfort and edema) and in patients whom MMF is required.  
2. Meticulous oral hygiene is reinforced.  
3. Oral or intravenous steroids may be used to lessen postoperative edema.  
4. Ice is applied for the first 24-48 hours. Warm moist heat with gentle massage may be applied after the initial 48 hours.  
5. Facial pressure dressings may be removed at 24-48 hours if applicable.  
6. Nausea and vomiting are minimized with the use of an in-and-out orogastric tube placement at the conclusion of the procedure prior to extubation. Prophylactic antiemetics are recommended during the immediate postoperative period.  
7. Adequate oral intake is necessary to maintain hydration. Initial intake is generally in the form of clear liquids with a conversion to a soft non-chew diet over the first week. The consistency of the non-chew diet increases gradually over the following weeks as discomfort and edema subside and as range of motion and activity return.  
8. Guiding elastics are applied early in the postoperative period to facilitate neuromuscular reprogramming. The pattern frequently follows the skeletal correction; class II vector (upper 2s to lower 3s) after mandibular advancement for hypoplasia or class III pull (upper 3s

to lower 2s) following maxillary advancement or mandibular setback for a class III skeletal discrepancy. The elastics are worn routinely over the first week with removal for isolated intervals for intake and hygiene.

9. The absence of an occlusal splint at the conclusion of orthognathic surgery allows continued settling of the occlusion in the weeks that follow prior to the patients return to the orthodontist. Once coupling of the incisors and canines has been achieved in the first week or two with anterior elastics, they can be moved posterior to engage the premolar and molar teeth. The elastics are often lighter than the initial rubber bands used in the first week and can be placed in box or rectangle (engaging three teeth in each arch) to aid in further settling. Light elastic traction used in the 4-6 weeks after surgery can greatly aid in settling the occlusion via the rapid acceleratory phenomenon (RAP) that originates with the bony osteotomies.

# Complications

# Intraoperative Complications

1. Transection of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN): Complete or partial transection of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) may occur throughout the course of a sagittal ramus osteotomy. Nerve injury may occur with saws, burs, and instrumentation. The completion of the osteotomy through the inferior border carries the greatest risk of injury to the IAN. Additional sites of injury arise when performing the vertical cut through the lateral cortex of the body of the mandible or with manipulation/repositioning the nerve from the distal segment (see Figure 28.8). Exposure of the transected distal nerve stump may require the creation of a buccal window within the mandible to allow reapproximation (see Figure 28.9). A tension-free reapproximation is performed utilizing 2-3 epineural sutures (see Figure 28.10) or use of a collagen tube if tension-free reapproximation is not feasible.  
2. Injury to the lingual nerve: May be injured with excessive tissue manipulation and retraction, over preparation or penetration of positional screws, and/or damage from saws or burs during osteotomy. Injury to the lingual nerve that results in numbness of the tongue is often more difficult subjectively for patients than numbness with the lip and chin that is tolerated better. Fortunately, many incidents of tongue numbness reported initially resolve spontaneously in a transient time of weeks. Similar to injury to the lingual nerve with other oral surgical procedures (third molar extraction), the surgeon must monitor recovery closely and address with exploration or refer early if the deficit is prolonged (10-12 weeks).  
3. Bleeding: Excessive intraoperative bleeding with mandibular surgery is not common with proper surgical technique. Vascular injuries may result from aggressive

retraction and/or disruption of the periosteum. Instrument misdirection within the osteotomy site may injure the neurovascular bundle. The internal maxillary or masseteric artery may be encountered with osteotomies extending into the sigmoid notch (IVRO). The facial artery may be injured with overextension of instrumentation at the inferior border.

Management of intraoperative bleeding includes hypotensive anesthesia, gauze packing, electrocautery, vasoconstrictor injection, and resorbable hemostatic agents.

4. Unfavorable fractures: While uncommon, may require significant modification of surgical steps to both finish the separation of the mandible into a portion containing the condyle and one that contains the teeth. After securing the occlusal-borne or bone-borne splint/ guide, the fractured segments are repositioning, stabilized, and fixated based on the original treatment plan.

Unfavorable fractures are speculated to occur from incomplete osteotomies, the presence of third molars, excessive force during separation of osteotomies, and patients with minimal marrow space. However, a systematic review of factors commonly associated with bad splits revealed a lack of strong evidence demonstrating the influence of patient age, the presence of third molars or surgical technique on unfavorable fractures during SSO. Anatomic factors such as thin faciolingual width or short ramus may contribute to increased risk of unfavorable fractures with SSO. Unfavorable fractures or bad splits may include fractures of the lingual or buccal cortex (see Figures 28.12 through 28.15).

Management of unfavorable fractures include completing the osteotomy so that segments can be adequately repositioned, re-establishing continuity of the fractured segments (consolidating the pieces), repositioning the mandible based on the presurgical plan, providing adequate fixation of the segments to prevent movement at the osteotomy, and ensuring bony continuity between segments to allow bone union.

Unfavorable fractures can be mitigated by ensuring the inferior border (Dalpont) and Hunsuck cuts are satisfactory. It is essential to maintain an inferior border integrity in the proximal segment to propagate a favorable fracture (see Figure 28.11).

5. Insult to the facial nerve: Traditionally seen with transcutaneous approaches, but may occur with damage or penetration of the periosteum during intraoral procedures or with trocar placement for the positioning of rigid fixation. While rare, studies suggest a higher incidence with BSSO mandibular setbacks using the Obwegeser technique compared to the Hunsuck modificati

# Postoperative Complications

1. Infection: The incidence of an infection after mandibular osteotomy is low  $(2 - 7\%)$  and typically occurs within the first month after surgery. Superficial infections are managed with incision and drainage through the vestibular incision with evacuation of the collection (hematoma/purulence) and antibiotic coverage. Late infections may be the result of loose hardware and require exploration of the surgical site with possible screw/plate removal.

2. Malocclusion: Subtle occlusal discrepancies are frequently noted early in the postoperative period secondary to muscle influence and posturing. The occlusal deviation is addressed with guidance elastics and continued neuromuscular reprogramming. Deviation of the mandibular midline creating asymmetry may be the result of improper proximal segment positioning via torqueing of the condyle or condylar sag. Minor discrepancies are addressed with early and aggressive orthodontic therapy. Pronounced deviation may require revision surgery to provide improved positioning of the segments. Malocclusions can also occur from late mandibular growth or skeletal relapse (see Figure 28.16).

![](images/cc8bfda05eed5d90c7462169ee40b3d7dc3e7d65b6d7551e631c4251c3cd82ce.jpg)  
Figure 28.16. Return of class III malocclusion due to late mandibular growth.

3. Fixation failure or nonunion: Signs of fixation failure include palpable mobility of the segments, persistent infection, an open bite tendency (see Figure 28.17), a class III occlusion on the affected side, a midline shift toward the opposite side, and premature contact on the affected side. Early surgical management may be required to reinforce the fixation and stabilize the osteotomy. A delayed return to the operating room to address a nonunion is more complicated, and management is similar to that for a nonunion after traumatic mandibular fracture.  
4. Idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR): A form of dysfunctional remodeling of the TMJ seen in adolescent females and occasionally orthodontic and postorthognathic surgery patients. The key feature is resorption of the condyle leading to loss of height and eventually mandibular retrusion and anterior open bite malocclusion. The mechanism is thought to be related to excessive mechanical stress as is sometimes seen in orthodontic therapy and orthognathic surgery (see Figure 28.18). There is evidence to suggest various predisposing factors such as history of TMJ dysfunction (especially disc displacement), high mandibular plane angle, rheumatoid arthritis, and connective tissue disorders. Surgical modifications for high-risk patients may include minimizing mandibular advancement in

![](images/eb5ecc3856bdcc81a093c4be3871d8080cf19b2d2382c7df0d772ca7e247e0f8.jpg)

bimaxillary cases and using miniplate fixation to minimize condylar torquing, which may occur with bicortical screws. If possible, avoidance of mandibular surgery in patients with a history of ICR is recommended. Management of malocclusion from ICR can be difficult as it requires combined orthodontic therapy and surgery (See Chapter 43. Concomitant Temporomandibular Joint Replacement and Orthognathic Surgery), which may cause progression of the disease. Disc repositioning surgery may play a role in cessation of the disease process in select cases. Prior to intervention, technetium-99 bone scans can identify areas of active resorption.

# Mandible First Sequence

Internal rigid fixation technology has given surgeons the ability to choose the maxilla or mandible first sequence in bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. Obtaining rigid fixation of the mandible is a prerequisite for choosing the mandible first approach. In the days of wire osteosynthesis, the maxilla was often operated first because with a bad (unfavorable) split, the mandible could not be rigidly repaired in order to provide a stable construct for the new maxillary position. With rigid internal fixation, the majority of unfavorable mandibular splits can be fixated sufficiently to provide a stable construct to relate the maxilla (see Figures 28.13 through 28.15).

There has always been controversy over which approach is best; however, the available evidence suggests minimal difference in postsurgical outcomes. There are situations where the mandible first approach may be advantageous. Errors in centric relation records can be eliminated by completing mandible surgery first. Unpredictable condyle positions seen with congenital or TMJ disorders, and inaccurate bite registrations can translate to errors in the maxillary position if the maxilla first approach is used. Condylar position inaccuracies are minimized with virtual surgical planning and the development of software allowing digital seating of the

condyles. With the maxilla first sequence, a counterclockwise movement creating a large intermediate open bite would require a thick splint which may interfere with the application MMF or positioning of the condyles. Importantly, with concomitant TMJ surgery, the mandible must be operated first.

A notable drawback to the mandible first approach is that, should a bad split develop that cannot be salvaged or rigidly fixated (i.e., involves the condyle), the maxillary procedure must be delayed, as the maxilla can no longer be accurately related (positioned) in the final position. The choice of maxilla or mandible first surgery in double jaw (bimaxillary) cases remains the preference of the surgeon.

# Digital Planning Pearls

There are numerous advantages to digital planning for orthognathic surgery when compared to traditional model surgery. Digital planning offers increased efficiency and accuracy in planning the occlusal and skeletal correction of dentofacial deformities. The appreciation of the multidimensional deformity, preoperative insight, and intraoperative efficiency can be particularly beneficial in bimaxillary treatment plans and complex cases such as hemi-mandibular hypertrophy.

Errors from inaccurate centric relation records can be eliminated by seating the condyles digitally (see Figures 28.19 and 28.20). Virtual planning also allows the surgeon to extrapolate changes in condylar position with interference between the proximal and distal segment. Ensuring sound orientation and passive positioning of the segment interface can aid in improving intraoperative

efficiency by eliminating extensive carpentry and minimizing condylar displacement.

Manipulation of the skeleton in three-dimensional space allows visualization of expected interferences

spacing (see Figure 28.22). Yaw correction may be difficult with traditional model surgery, especially in asymmetry cases, but is readily controlled within a virtual environment (see Figure 28.25). Reliable, accurate results can be achieved with virtual planning for orthognathic surgery procedures (see Figure 28.26).

# Key Points

1. The sagittal ramus osteotomy (sagittal split osteotomy) is the preferred surgical technique to address mandibular hyperplasia when the pattern of ramus divergence is U shaped. The anatomic consideration for mandibular setback can be best determined on plain films through a submental vertex or 3D imaging (cone beam computed tomography). Completion of a sagittal ramus osteotomy on a divergent V-shaped mandible will create a bony gap within the osteotomy between the proximal and distal segments upon repositioning. An appreciation of this anatomic relationship will prevent the overtightening of fixation that may torque the condyle and create medial displacement of the condyle.  
2. A divergent ramus pattern (V shaped) is frequently best managed with an intraoral (IVRO) or transoral (TOVRO) vertical ramus osteotomy. The completion of the

osteotomy will create telescoping of the divergent mandible upon setback. Performing a vertical ramus osteotomy on a parallel U-shaped mandible will create bony interferences that will require aggressive reintouring to prevent lateral displacement of the proximal segment to accommodate the distal segment movement posterior.

3. The completion of the sagittal ramus osteotomy into the retrolingual depression is vital for mandibular setback procedures. The Hunsuck modification (see Figure 28.1) allows the distal segment to move posteriorly without impingement on the pterygomasseteric sling, maximizing the skeletal stability of the movement.  
4. Lingual segment fractures may be associated with the simultaneous removal of third molars during mandibular osteotomy or excessive instrumentation of the osteotomy posterior to the dentition. The early removal of wisdom teeth (9-12 months prior to osteotomy) to allow sufficient healing of the site and careful separation of the superior portion of the osteotomy may decrease the chance of a lingual segment fracture.  
5. The osteotomy through the inferior border is the most technique-sensitive aspect of the sagittal ramus osteotomy. Maintaining the inferior border of the mandibles association with the proximal segment provides structural integrity that aids in the avoidance of unfavorable fracture.  
6. Complications that arise intraoperatively are typically a result of deviation from the standard techniques of osteotomy completion, separation, or fixation.  
7. Mandibular setback surgery positions the superior border of the distal mandible posterior and inferior to that of the proximal segment when the inferior borders are aligned. The proximal segment on mandibular setback procedures using a sagittal ramus osteotomy requires recontouring of the anterior and superior aspect (see Figures 28.45 through 28.47 in Case Report 28.2) for visibility, to avoid periodontal issues, and to prevent over-rotation of the segment. If not sufficiently reduced, the prominence of the proximal segment will elevate the soft tissues in the molar area, creating irritation and challenges with hygiene that lead to periodontal issues. The improper alignment of the superior borders can lead to over-rotation of the proximal segment and violation of the pterygomasseteric sling, leading to concerns regarding stability.  
8. In osteotomies completed in young patients with "green stick" mandibles (low modulus of elasticity), the angle and posterior border frequently will remain intact, requiring additional efforts to complete the separation into proximal and distal segments. The identification of the inferior alveolar nerve within the osteotomy will allow for positioning of an osteotome or saw to redirect the osteotomy medial into the retrolingual depression and prevent the development of a proximal segment fracture, should it extend laterally.
