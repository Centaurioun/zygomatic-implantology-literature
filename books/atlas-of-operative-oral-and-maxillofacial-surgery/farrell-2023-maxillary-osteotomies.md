# Le Fort I Osteotomy (Single Piece)

A means of repositioning an intact maxilla to correct congenital and acquired dentofacial deformities.

# Indications

1. Correction of maxillary dentofacial deformities in all three planes of space  
2. Access to pathologic lesions located within the maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, and/or skull base  
3. Interpositional bone grafting for the atrophic, edentulous maxilla

# Contraindications

1. Surgery performed prior to the complete eruption of the maxillary permanent dentition  
2. Medical conditions prohibiting surgery

# Surgical Anatomy

The vasculature supply of the maxilla is abundant and is supplied via the terminal branches of the maxillary (posterior superior alveolar, infraorbital, descending palatine, and sphenopalatine arteries), the ascending pharyngeal (branch of external carotid artery), and the ascending palatine (branch of facial artery) arteries via the soft palate.

The maxilla is composed of three vertical buttresses: the zygomaticomaxillary, nasomaxillary, and pterygomaxillary buttresses. The zygomaticomaxillary buttress laterally and the nasomaxillary buttress (piriform rim) medially form the periphery of the maxillary sinus and serve as areas for fixation after Le Fort procedures. The pterygoid plates comprise the pterygomaxillary buttress located just posterior to the maxilla.

The infraorbital nerve is the terminal branch of the second division (V2) of the trigeminal nerve. The infraorbital nerve supplies sensation to the lower eyelid, lateral aspect of nose, and upper lip and is encountered during subperiosteal elevation of the lateral wall of the maxilla.

# Technique

1. The patient is placed supine on the operating room table and nasally intubated. The anesthesia tube is secured, all extremities are padded, and a urinary catheter is placed for procedures exceeding 150 minutes. Lacrilube is placed within the orbits, and opsites are placed to protect the periorbital regions during the procedure. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx, and the oral cavity is prepped with betadine solution and/or chlorhexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  oral rinse and a toothbrush to include all teeth, the gingiva, the tongue, and the palate. The maxillofacial skeleton is prepped with betadine scrub from the hairline to the clavicles, and the patient is draped in a sterile fashion to allow for exposure of and access to the oral cavity, nasal bridge, and orbits.  
2. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is placed circumferentially within the maxillary vestibule. Additionally, the nasal floor, nasal septum, and inferior turbinates are injected to assist in hemostasis.  
3. A Kirschner wire may be inserted within the nasofrontal suture (see Figure 27.2 [all figures cited in this section appear in Case Report 27.1, unless otherwise noted]) to establish a vertical reference for the maxilla. A Boley gauge is utilized to measure from the Kirschner wire to an anterior maxillary reference point (the anterior maxillary orthodontic arch wire, the orthodontic brackets of teeth #8 and #9, or the incisive edges of teeth #8 and #9), and the measurement is recorded.  
4. In select cases, enameloplasty is performed with a large diamond bur and copious irrigation on selected tooth surfaces that are determined preoperatively.  
5. A maxillary vestibular incision is initiated through mucosa from the maxillary premolar to the midline (see Figure 27.3). The incision is positioned  $10\mathrm{mm}$  cephalic to the mucogingival junction and parallels the mucogingival junction. A mucosal releasing

incision may be incorporated at the first molars to allow for increased flap elevation. The incision is extended through subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and periosteum.

6. A subperiosteal dissection exposes the lateral maxillary wall, the zygomaticomaxillary and nasomaxillary buttresses, and the piriform aperture (see Figure 27.4). The identical incision and dissection are performed on the contralateral side.  
7. Sharp, subperiosteal dissection is used to enter the nasal cavity and to elevate the nasal mucosa from the piriform aperture. A periosteal elevator is used to elevate the nasal mucosa from the lateral nasal walls and the nasal floor. Careful elevation and reflection of the nasal mucosa will minimize nasal mucosal tears during downfracture of the maxilla.  
8. A retractor is placed posterior to the maxilla to expose the pterygomaxillary junction (the junction of the maxillary tuberosity and the pterygoid plates) and to reflect the overlying tissue. An elevator is placed along the lateral nasal wall of the nasal cavity within the submucosal plane to protect the nasal mucosa during the osteotomy (see Figure 27.4).  
9. A reciprocating saw is utilized to create a horizontal osteotomy from a point just posterior to the maxillary tuberosity to a point just superior to the nasal floor (see Figure 27.5). The osteotomy is placed superior to the apices of the maxillary teeth. The osteotomy is mirrored on the opposite side.  
10. A double guarded vomer osteotome is used to separate the nasal septum and vomer bone from the nasal crest of the maxilla (see Figure 27.6).  
11. A curved pterygoid osteotome is used to divide the pterygomaxillary junction. The osteotome is placed between the maxillary tuberosity and the pterygoid plates and is directed medially and inferiorly, away from the pterygoid plexus and internal maxillary artery (see Figure 27.7). A finger can be placed on the palate at the hamular notch region to palpate the separation.  
12. A single guarded osteotome is used to separate the lateral nasal wall (see Figure 27.8). A change in sound is audible posteriorly as the thicker, perpendicular plate of the palatine bone is engaged. Partial sectioning of the palatine bone minimizes unfavorable fracture patterns during downfracture, which may cause disruption of the orbits and/or cranial base.  
13. After the completion of all maxillary osteotomies, the downfracture of the maxilla is performed with digital pressure. Tessier mobilizers are placed posterior to the maxillary tuberosities (see Figure 27.9) in order to distract the maxilla forward and laterally to complete the bony separation and to stretch the posterior soft

tissue pedicle. The maxilla should be capable of mobilization of  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  in all directions.

14. The greater (descending) palatine arteries should be identified and preserved or ligated (surgeon's preference) (see Figure 27.10).  
15. Interferences within the areas of the nasal crest of the maxilla, the lateral nasal wall, and the posterior and lateral aspects of the maxillary sinus are removed (see Figure 27.11).  
16. The anterior nasal spine may be reduced, especially in cases of maxillary advancement and superior repositioning.  
17. The field is irrigated, and all debris is suctioned.  
18. Inferior turbinectomies and inferior septoplasty are adjunctive procedures that may be indicated in cases of significant superior repositioning or when nasal obstruction is apparent. A vertical incision is made through the nasal mucosa overlying the inferior turbinates, and the inferior turbinates are identified. A Kelley or Allis clamp is used to grasp the inferior turbinate at its base, and electrocautery or heavy scissors are used to transect the turbinate. The nasal mucosa is closed using chromic gut sutures.  
19. In cases of superior maxillary repositioning, the inferior portion of the cartilaginous nasal septum is resected to prevent septal deviation against the superiorly repositioned and fixated maxilla.  
20. The patient is placed in maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) with the use of a surgical splint. The maxillomandibular complex is rotated into position, ensuring that the condyles are seated ideally within the glenoid fossa. Any interferences are removed to achieve even passive contacts and the appropriate preplanned vertical dimension of the maxilla. For surgery designed to alter the vertical dimension of the maxilla, the prerecorded measurements from the Kirschner wire are used to determine the amount of maxillary repositioning based on the presurgical workup.  
21. Fixation is applied to the zygomaticomaxillary buttress and the nasomaxillary buttress (piriform rim) bilaterally (see Figures 27.12 and 27.24 in Case Report 27.2). Bone grafts may be placed within the osteotomy gaps for large advancements or inferior repositioning (see Figure 27.13).  
22. After the application of rigid fixation, the patient is removed from MMF to assess occlusion, mandibular movements, and overall facial symmetries. Any occlusal or midline discrepancies, jaw movement asymmetries, nasal deviations, or areas of excessive bleeding should be corrected with the release of fixation and ensuring the removal of all bony

interferences, complete condylar seating, the correction of septal deviation, and achieving tissue hemostasis.

23. An alar cinch suture is placed to minimize unaesthetic widening of the alar base.  
24. Mucosal closure is initiated with a V-Y closure (see Figure 27.14) to avoid thinning of the upper lip. A single-prong skin hook is used to form the vertical leg of the closure, and is closed with several passes of chromic gut in a running fashion. The vertical leg is connected to the gingiva and closure is completed in a continuous, horizontal mattress fashion with chromic sutures (see Figure 27.15).  
25. Prior to extubation, an orogastric tube is passed to empty contents of the stomach.  
26. The patient is placed into guiding elastics to help guide the jaw into occlusion.

# Postoperative Management

1. A pressure dressing and ice packs are utilized to minimize edema and hematoma formation.  
2. Humidified oxygen and head-of-bed elevations are recommended for 24 hours.  
3. A Yankauer suction is placed bedside for persistent intraoral secretions.  
4. Scissors or wire cutters should be on the patient at all times if heavy MMF is applied.  
5. Antibiotics, analgesics, anti-emetics, and steroids are recommended.  
6. The septum should be evaluated postoperatively to identify septal hematoma formation.  
7. Nasal congestion may be treated with nasal suctioning, nasal rinses, and decongestants.  
8. Epistaxis may be minimized with head-of-bed elevations, pressure dressings, oxymetazoline sprays, and posterior packings for severe cases.

# Key Points

1. The ascending pharyngeal and ascending palatine arteries maintain perfusion to the downfractured maxilla.  
2. Impacted wisdom teeth may be removed at the time of Le Fort surgery. Care is taken to place the curved pterygoid osteotome posterior to the impacted teeth.  
3. Posterior bony interferences may result in condylar displacement or distraction, asymmetrical jaw movements (deviations), malocclusion, and aberrant maxillary position.  
4. Insufficient mobilization of the maxilla prior to fixation may hinder optimal advancements.  
5. The zygomaticomaxillary and nasomaxillary buttresses contain thicker areas of bone and are ideal for securing fixation.

Figure 27.1. Visualization of the osteotomy gap during virtual surgical planning (VSP).

6. During planning, anterior movement of at least  $4\mathrm{mm}$  is recommended to reduce the need to remove excessive posterior interferences intraoperatively. Osteotomy gaps may be visualized to anticipate the need for additional bone grafting (see Figure 27.1) during virtual surgical planning.

# Segmental Maxillary Osteotomy (Two or Three Pieces)

A means of correcting maxillary transverse discrepancies (deficiency or excess) and/or multiple planes of occlusion.

# Indications

1. The two-piece osteotomy corrects transverse discrepancies  
2. The three-piece osteotomy corrects vertical and transverse discrepancies

![](images/9a9a0864370f5740d869db3414d32727be640f6324769e99e02e764726b3b9b5.jpg)

# Contraindication

1. Inadequate space for interdental osteotomies

# Segmental Osteotomy Technique

1. Procedure follows Le Fort I single-piece osteotomy steps 1 through 12.  
2. The orthodontic arch wire is sectioned within the area of the proposed interdental osteotomies.

a. For a two-piece maxilla, the interdental osteotomy can be made within the midline between the central incisors. If the transverse discrepancy is unilateral, the interdental osteotomy can be made between the first premolar and canine or between the canine and lateral incisor on the involved side.

b. For a three-piece maxilla, the interdental osteotomies are made bilaterally between the first premolar and canine or between the canine and lateral incisor. Ideally, the canine should be kept within the anterior segment.

3. The interdental osteotomies are initiated prior to downfracture for better stability and control of the osteotomies (see Figure 27.16 [all figures cited in this section appear in Case Report 27.2]). The gingiva is retracted inferiorly within the area of the interdental osteotomy to the level of the alveolar ridge in a subperiosteal plane. The prominences of teeth roots are visualized. Care is taken to fashion the osteotomy parallel to the tooth roots, perpendicular to the alveolar bone, and between the roots. A sagittal saw is used to initiate the interdental osteotomy. The osteotomy is taken through the palatal plate without penetrating the palatal mucosa. A finger may be placed on the palate to palpate for blade penetration through the palatal cortex. The osteotomy should extend from the horizontal Le Fort osteotomy inferiorly and interdentally.

4. After downfracture and mobilization of the maxilla, the vertical osteotomies are extended posteriorly within the palate utilizing a reciprocating saw (see Figure 27.17). The palatal osteotomies are placed lateral to the midline due to the increased mucosal tissue thickness and minimal bone thickness of the parasagittal region. Care must be taken to ensure the palatal mucosa is not violated. The parasagittal osteotomies may be beveled in a tangential fashion so that if the palatal mucosa tears, there is bony overlap.

a. For a two-piece maxilla, the parasagittal cut is connected to the interdental osteotomy based on the presurgical workup. The interdental osteotomy associated with a two-piece osteotomy is typically located lateral to the canine or within the dental midline.  
b. For a three-piece maxilla, the parasagittal cuts are connected to the interdental osteotomies based on the presurgical workup. A variety of palatal osteotomy designs are available depending on the amount of maxillary expansion and movement of the anterior segment. Interdental osteotomies are typically placed lateral to the canines; however, they may be placed lateral to the lateral incisors with caution.  
5. After downfracture, the interdental osteotomies are completed with saws, burs, and/or thin chisels. Osteotomes may be used to separate the segments. All segments are manually mobilized in the horizontal and vertical dimensions to ensure appropriate separation. Interdental bony interferences are removed with small chisels and/or burs (see Figure 27.18). The palate is visually inspected for tears.  
6. The maxillary splint is wired to the maxillary dentition, and the individual segments are positioned within the splint. A wire can be passed through the molar bands

to serve as a handle to assist in widening the maxilla. Interferences should be removed to allow for passive positioning of the segments within the surgical splint. A palatal strap or lingual flange should be incorporated into the splint to add rigidity.

7. Interpositional bone grafts may be placed within the osteotomy sites to aid in stability and provide a construct for new bone growth.  
a. Autogenous bone grafts can be obtained without a second site by using existing surgical access. Autogenous graft sites include the anterior nasal spine, nasal septal footplate (see Figure 27.19), lateral nasal wall, posterior lateral wall of the maxilla (see Figures 27.20 through 27.23), zygomaticomaxillary buttress, and piriform rim. The sites mentioned are removed to prevent interferences, but can be used as grafts if carefully removed with a reciprocating saw or rongeur.  
b. If BSSO/IVRO/genioplasty is completed during same operation, autogenous bone grafts can also be harvested from proximal segment lateral body and external oblique ridge ("matchstick") during setback, symphysis of mandible during vertical chin reduction or genioglossus advancement, inferior border of proximal segment and coronoid process during IVRO, and inferior border during correction of asymmetry.  
8. Refer to Le Fort I single-piece osteotomy from step 15 onward for the remainder of the procedure.

# Postoperative Management

1. Guiding elastics are utilized to aid in the positioning of the mandibular dentition within the guide.  
2. Maxillary splints should remain in place for 4-6 weeks to allow for complete osseous healing.  
3. The removal of the splint needs to be coordinated with the treating orthodontist so that a transpalatal arch wire may be placed immediately after splint removal to minimize transverse relapse.

# Key Points

1. The transverse expansion of the maxilla should be limited to  $10\mathrm{mm}$  or less at the second molars to prevent nonunion, relapse, and palatal tension necrosis. Use of prefabricated palatal splint stabilized with circumdental wires is recommended with transverse expansion greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  to prevent relapse. This obviates the need for occlusal splint in the postoperative period. The palatal splint can be designed during the virtual surgical planning (VSP) (see Figures 27.25 through 27.28).  
2. Increased segmental osteotomy stability can be achieved by utilizing bone grafts harvested from maxilla/mandible within parasagittal osteotomies (see Figure 27.23).

3. Each individual maxillary segment must be completely free and mobile from adjacent segments to allow for passive seating within the surgical splint. Failure of passive segment positioning within the surgical guide may result in the deformation of the surgical splint and occlusal discrepancies.

# Patient-Specific Custom Implants for Le Fort Osteotomy

With the aid of VSP, patient-specific guides, templates, and custom titanium fixation can be fabricated that accurately transfer the digital plan to the surgery, resulting in shorter operative times and predictable outcomes.

# Indications

1. Large advancements of maxilla (minimal posterior interferences)  
2. Inferior repositioning of maxilla (minimal posterior interferences)  
3. Complex maxillary asymmetries  
4. Difficulty of osteotomies and/or fixation after planning a. Poor bone quality, tooth position  
b. Root convergence and space for interdental osteotomy can routinely be visualized during VSP  
5. Splintless repositioning of maxilla/mandible

# Virtual Surgical Planning (See Chapter 26-Virtual Surgical Planning in Orthognathic Surgery)

1. Requires clinical photos, optical scan (digital impression) of occlusion, and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) prior to digital planning  
2. Desired occlusion is set digitally  
3. Skeletal repositioning of maxilla/mandible is completed  
4. Titanium plate is designed based on adjacent anatomy including tooth roots, bone quality, and fixation requirements  
a. Predictive holes are placed to maximize bone quality/thickness along the piriform rim and buttress (see Figures 27.31 and 27.32)  
5. Cutting guides, templates, and jigs can be fabricated  
a. Predictive holes/level of osteotomy are transferred to patient by either an occlusal- or bone-borne guide (see Figures 27.33 through 27.35)

# Surgical Technique

1. After adequate surgical exposure as outlined earlier in the chapter, the intact maxilla is scored using the guide (see Figures 27.36 and 27.37).  
2. Guide is removed showing the planned osteotomies and predictive holes for fixation (see Figure 27.38).  
3. Osteotomies are completed and the maxilla is mobilized as outlined earlier in this chapter (see Figures 27.38 and 27.39).  
4. Custom titanium plates are applied to the downfractured maxilla and fixated to the mobile segment (see Figure 27.40).  
5. The plate is now reoriented into final position using the predictive holes of the stable maxilla superiorly and fixated without the use of an occlusal splint (see Figure 27.41).  
6. Occlusion is verified by auto-rotating the mandible.

7. Refer to Le Fort I single-piece osteotomy from step 23 onward for the remainder of the procedure.

# Key Points

1. Soft tissue dissection is limited based on the extent of predictive holes and osteotomies, thus contributing to less postoperative swelling.  
2. Surgery that includes extensive mitering of bone may prove difficult as the custom plate is reverse-engineered to the predictive holes. The surgeon must ensure an accurate representation of the digital plan.  
3. Although the application of custom fixation may provide a more efficient surgical intervention, it has a significantly greater cost than traditional surgery with stock plates.

# Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (SARPE)

A combined means of orthodontic-surgical expansion of the maxillary arch in cases of transverse maxillary deficiency in patients in whom the palatal suture is completely fused.

# Indications

1. Maxillary transverse deficiency

a. Stand-alone procedure for an isolated maxillary transverse deformity  
b. Preliminary procedure prior to definitive orthognathic surgery

2. Arch length and tooth mass discrepancy (crowding)  
3. To expand the arch in cases of maxillary hypoplasia associated with clefts of the palate  
4. To overcome the resistance of the midpalatal suture when orthodontic palatal expanders have failed  
5. Skeletally mature patient: The age at which surgical intervention is required to assist with palatal expansion is controversial and ranges from 14 to 25 years

# Contraindications

1. Noncompliant patient: The patient or guardian must activate the palatal device daily in the postoperative period  
2. Patients with significant periodontal disease  
3. Patients who have not reached skeletal maturity (prior to skeletal maturity, an orthodontic palatal expander is recommended)  
4. Medical condition prohibiting surgical intervention

# Anatomy

The hard palate consists of two palatal processes of the maxilla and two horizontal plates of the palatine bones that form the palatine sutures. The midpalatal suture extends from the incisive foramen to the posterior aspect of the palate. The midpalatal suture is perpendicular to the palatomaxillary suture, which joins the horizontal process of the palatine bones and the palatal process of the maxilla.

The midpalatal suture remains patent until late adolescence. The process of palatal fusion is characterized by progressive sutural interdigitation and ossification that is typically completed within the third decade of life.

# Technique

1. Prior to the start of the case, verify that the palatal expander is in place and secure, and that the device key to activate the appliance is present (see Figure 27.44

[all figures cited in this section appear in Case Report 27.4]).

2. This procedure follows Le Fort I single-piece osteotomy steps 1 through 12. The maxilla is not downfractured (see Figure 27.45).  
3. The osteotomies at the zygomaticomaxillary buttresses are relieved to allow for clearance during separation (see Figure 27.46).  
4. The gingiva is elevated in the area between the central incisors to expose the alveolus. A sagittal saw is used to make the midline osteotomy from the piriform rim to the alveolus (see Figure 27.47). Chisels are used to complete the osteotomy along the midpalatal suture.  
5. The palatal appliance is activated within the operating room to ensure equal separation of the two halves, and clearance at the zygomaticomaxillary buttresses is confirmed (see Figure 27.48).  
6. Refer to Le Fort I single-piece osteotomy from step 23 onward for the remainder of the procedure.

# Postoperative Management

The palatal appliance is activated on postoperative day 3 by utilizing the distraction frequency as determined by the orthodontist.

# Key Points

1. SARPE procedures are primarily for V-shaped arches where the anterior expansion required is greater than or equal to the posterior expansion.  
2. The patient's models can be hand articulated to visualize the transverse discrepancy. An arch width analysis can be conducted between teeth across the arch and compared to the opposite arch. The buccal-lingual inclination of the teeth should also be taken into account. Orthodontics alone cannot mask a skeletal transverse discrepancy of greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$ .  
3. A segmental Le Fort expansion greater than  $7\mathrm{mm}$  is considered the upper limit of expansion. In cases where significant maxillary expansion is required, an SARPE procedure is considered more stable. Future maxillary segmental surgery may need to be performed based on skeletal growth, relapse, and dysgnathia; however, the movements will be more stable after SARPE expansion.  
4. Radiographs of the central incisors should be taken to ensure sufficient room for interdental osteotomy.  
5. All osteotomies completed during a Le Fort I osteotomy are completed for the SARPE procedure; however, the maxilla is not downfractured. Separation of pterygoid plates is based on the surgeon's preference and the amount of posterior expansion required.  
6. The area of the greatest resistance to maxillary expansion is the zygomaticomaxillary buttresses. The palatal appliance should be activated within the operating

room to ensure symmetrical bilateral expansion of the maxilla with no interferences.

7. Transverse maxillary expansion is the most unstable maxillary movement. Overcorrection is recommended to allow for relapse.  
8. A tooth-borne (Haas and Hyrax appliance) or bone-borne palatal appliance can be used. The tooth-borne appliances are less invasive and hygienic, and thus allow for better patient compliance. Tooth-borne appliances also create an occlusal tipping effect at the level of the alveolar bone and teeth. This tipping effect can be minimized with tooth-borne appliances that engage at least three posterior teeth. A bone-borne appliance has more control over orthopedic (versus teeth) movements at the level of the palate, but it is more invasive and requires a steep palatal vault for anchorage.

# Complications

# Le Fort I Osteotomy (Single Piece)

1. Deviated nasal septum: Results from inadequate inferior septoplasty during superior maxillary positioning. Managed postoperatively with adjunctive septoplasty (see Figure 27.53).

2. Hardware failure: Exposed hardware, hardware fracture, palpable fixation, and loose screws. Treatment involves hardware removal with or without replacement depending on the amount of bone union.  
3. Damage to apices of teeth: The horizontal osteotomy should be placed at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the anticipated apices of the maxillary dentition.  
4. Malunion and non-union: Inadequate fixation or failed fixation.  
5. Unfavorable aesthetic result: From poor treatment planning or unrealistic patient expectations.  
6. Hemorrhage: Common sources include the greater palatine artery and pterygoid plexus. Also consider arteriovenous malformations and undiagnosed bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia). Hemorrhage intraoperatively is ideally managed with removal of fixation and stopping the source of the bleeding. Arterial hemorrhage in the immediate postoperative period is managed with a return to the operating room and stopping the source of the bleeding. Venous bleeding may be managed with either stopping the direct source or with pressure dressings. Interventional radiology may be utilized if the source of the bleeding is unknown or if a return to the operating room is not possible.  
7. Infection: Rare. Treated with antibiotics with or without drain placement and suspect hardware/fixation failure. Confirmed hardware failure must be removed and the patient treated with hardware replacement, MMF, or both.

Figure 27.53. Deviated nasal septum. Note nasal septum is displaced from its footplate due to the maxilla being superiorly impacted without adequate inferior septal trim.

# Segmental Maxillary Osteotomy (Two or Three Pieces)

1. Palatal tears: Result from excessive expansion or perforation during osteotomy (e.g., during the fracture of the pterygoid plates with a curved osteotome or from parasagittal cuts made with a reciprocating saw). Repaired via pedicled local flap advancement.  
2. Fistula formation: Oroantral fistulas typically develop from the extraction of erupted or partially erupted third molars in conjunction with Le Fort I osteotomies. Oroantral and oronasal fistulas may also occur due to non-healing palatal tears (see Figures 27.54 and 27.55).  
3. Vascular insult and ischemia to maxillary gingiva: May progress to avascular necrosis of the segment (see Figure 27.56).  
4. Gingival recession and/or periodontal defects: Occurs primarily at the interdental osteotomy site from either a lack of blood supply or loss of interdental bone.  
5. Tooth damage or loss at the interdental osteotomy site: May be minimized by having orthodontist provide adequate interdental spacing between known cut planes prior to surgery, with custom prefabricated cut guides (see Figure 27.35) and with utilizing sharp chisels and fine burs.  
6. Relapse in the transverse dimension: Results from large transverse expansions with insufficient stabilization. May be minimized with a combination of bone grafting large gaps within parasagittal osteotomies, custom or orthodontic palatal splints (see Figures 27.26 and 27.27), and rigid fixation.

# Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (SARPE)

1. Intraoperative or immediate postoperative bleeding: Arterial bleeding from the descending palatine arteries may be controlled by downfracturing the maxilla and ligating the vessel(s), or through interventional radiology.  
2. Failure to expand or unilateral expansion only postoperatively: Due to bony interferences that limit

palatal expander movement or incomplete osteotomy of the immobile segment of the maxilla. Reoperation is indicated.

3. Relapse: Minimized with the placement of a transpalatal bar following the removal of the palatal expansion device.  
4. Palatal tissue irritation from the appliance: Caused by inappropriate position of the palatal appliance and/or poor oral hygiene around the appliance.
