Technological and clinical innovations in facial cosmetic surgery have accelerated over the last 15 years. These advances often allow the surgeon to achieve an improved cosmetic results with decreased patient downtime and complications. This chapter will illustrate multiple current advances in facial cosmetic surgery.

# Non-invasive Management of Submental Lipomatosis

Submental lipomatosis is a common cosmetic concern that most oral and maxillofacial surgeons may treat. In patients with moderate to significant fatty deposits, conventional submental liposuction with or without a facelift, still provides the most desirable aesthetic outcomes. However, in milder cases, non-invasive techniques are now available and are desirable by the patient requiring minimal downtime. As the demand in cosmetic surgery increases, patients seeking these non-invasive and conservative means of treatment have also increased. These include cryolipolysis and injectable chemolipolytic agents (deoxycholic acid).

# Cryolipolysis

# Indications

1. Visible submental and/or submandibular lipomatosis

# Contraindications

1. Open or infected wounds  
2. Cryoglobulinemia  
3. Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria  
4. Cold agglutinin disease  
5. Excessive submental skin laxity  
6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

# Procedure: Submental and Submandibular Cryolipolysis

1. The patient is positioned supine on the patient table and an appropriately sized vacuum suction is selected.  
2. A protective conducting gel is applied to the treatment area. A small volume vacuum applicator is

positioned at the treatment area (CoolMini applicator, CoolSculpting System, ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and secured around the patient's head (See Figure 44.1).

3. After confirming accurate placement of the applicator, vacuum suction is initiated for a treatment session of 45-60 minutes with a temperature set at  $-10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  
4. Following completion of the session, manual massage for at least 2 minutes over the treatment area will assist in obtaining normal tissue contour as the pressure from the vacuum suction will cause some areas to raise.  
5. Additional cooling cycles can be performed 6 weeks apart, following the same protocol.

# Early Complications

1. Discomfort, edema, erythema, ecchymosis, itching, skin sensitivity, and hypoesthesia: May present up to a few weeks following treatment.  
2. Transient tongue deviation: Due to exposure of the hypoglossal nerve to cold temperatures.  
3. Transient weakness of lower lip muscles: Due to exposure of the marginal mandibular nerve to cold temperatures.  
4. Decreased salivary production: Due to exposure of the submandibular gland to cold temperatures.

# Late Complications:

1. Paradoxical adipocyte hyperplasia (PAH): Although rare, adipocyte hyperplasia may occur and present as a well-demarcated firm mass at the treatment area, 2-5 months after treatment. Conventional liposuction will resolve this concern.  
2. Hyperpigmentation: Usually resolves spontaneously; however, may be managed with depigmentation agents (i.e.,  $4\%$  Hydroquinone BID).

# Case Reports

Case Report 44.1. Cryolipolysis with CoolSculpting. A 49-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of "excessive fullness under the chin." Upon physical examination, the patient demonstrates a Glogau II, Fitzpatrick III skin type, submental and submandibular lipomatosis with a Dedo III neck classification. The patient was interested in a conservative non-invasive approach to reducing his neck

Figure 44.2. Pre-CoolSculpting lateral view, demonstrating a Dedo III neck classification showing the submental lipomatosis.

# Key Points

1. Cryolipolysis applies controlled cooling to cause injury to subcutaneous adipocytes without damaging surrounding tissues. Tissues rich in adipocytes have a greater susceptibility to injury from cold temperatures compared to surrounding cells with an abundant source of water.  
2. CoolSculpting is FDA approved for visible regions of lipomatosis in the submental and submandibular regions.  
3. Multiple cooling sessions may be required and noticeable results will appear a few weeks after treatment.  
4. Cryolipolysis does have limitations in moderate to severe forms of lipomatosis. Conventional liposuction, with or without use of radiofrequency-assisted lipolysis, is more effective at removing higher volumes of fat and contouring the jaw more effectively. However, in isolated and visible regions of fat deposition, cryolipolysis can be an effective non-invasive therapy.  
5. Cryolipolysis will have no significant benefit in patients with excessive skin laxity, jowling, or platysmal banding as these patients will benefit from a facelift with or without a platymaplasty to obtain an ideal aesthetic result.

volume. In this case, cryolipolysis was performed using the CoolSculpting CoolMini applicator. The patient received two 45 minute CoolSculpting sessions, 6 weeks apart, along the submental and submandibular regions (see Figures 44.2 through 44.4).

# Injectable Chemolipolysis: Deoxycholic Acid (Kybella, Allergan USA Inc., Madison, NJ)

# Indications

Mild to moderate isolated submental fullness due to excess subcutaneous fat

# Contraindications

1. Infection at the proposed injection site  
2. Caution in patients on anticoagulants, anti-platelets, or those with coagulation abnormalities  
3. Caution in patients with excess skin laxity or prominent platysmal banding. Submental fat reduction in such patients may lead to an unaesthetic outcome  
4. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

# Technique

1. Ice packs, topical anesthetic, or injectable lidocaine can be used at the treatment site to enhance patient comfort.  
2. Outline the planned treatment area. A marking pen can be used to make an injection grid, spacing injection points  $1\mathrm{cm}$  apart from each other.

3. Avoid injecting in subplatysmal fat. Injections should be targeted in the subcutaneous fat. Stay  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible to avoid marginal mandibular nerve injury. If resistance is met, the needle should be withdrawn and redirected to the appropriate depth before administering the injection.  
4. The patient is asked to tense the platysma. The submental fat is grasped and with a 30-gauge (or smaller) needle,  $0.2\mathrm{mL}$  is injected into each supraplatysmal region, with injections spaced  $1\mathrm{cm}$  apart from each other.

# Complications

1. Pain, numbness, erythema, edema, hematoma, and induration at treatment areas: May present up to a few weeks following treatment.  
2. Marginal mandibular nerve injury: Due to poor injection techniques. Observe for recovery and avoid injecting within  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  to the mandibular inferior border.

3. Dysphagia: Worse in patients with pre-existing dysphagia.  
4. Injection site alopecia: Onset and duration may vary among patients. Additional treatments should be withheld until alopecia is resolved.  
5. Ulceration and necrosis at injection sites: Caused by superficial dermal injections. Injections should only be placed in the subcutaneous fat. Only withdraw the needle from the subcutaneous fat layer after injection is complete. Simultaneously injecting and withdrawing the needle can cause inadvertent dermal exposure and subsequent injury. Do not proceed with additional treatments until complete resolution is appreciated.

# Case Report

Case Report 44.2. Injectable chemolipolysis with deoxycholic acid. A 35-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of "undesired submental fat". Upon physical exam, the patient demonstrates a Glogau II, Fitzpatrick II skin type, and mild submental lipomatosis. The patient

# Management of the Submentum: Non-invasive Skin Tightening Modalities

In addition to fat reduction, skin tightening is an added benefit that will enhance the aesthetic outcome, particularly as patients advance in age and exhibit skin laxity in conjunction with, or independent of, lipomatosis. In advanced cases with moderate to severe forms of

# Key Points

1. Patient selection is critical. A thorough discussion of expected benefits and limitations prior to treatment should be addressed. Patients may require surgical interventions to achieve desired results.  
2. Kybella is supplied in  $2\mathrm{mL}$  vials  $(10\mathrm{mg / mL})$  and does not require reconstitution.  $0.2\mathrm{mL}$  is injected into each injection site.  
3. Can inject up to 50 sites or  $10~\mathrm{mL}$  total (five vials) in a single treatment session with injections spaced  $1\mathrm{cm}$  apart.  
4. The average initial treatment is one to three vials  $(2 - 6\mathrm{mL})$  
5. Up to six treatments can be administered at intervals of 4-6 weeks, depending on the amount of submental fat reduction desired.

was interested in a conservative non-invasive approach to reducing his submental fat volume. In this case, chemolipolysis with deoxycholic acid was performed. Two treatment sessions were performed at 6-week intervals, using  $2\mathrm{mL}$  of Kybella per session (see Figures 44.5 and 44.6).

excessive skin laxity, surgical rhytidectomy is warranted. Nonetheless, there are some non-invasive modalities available to assist in skin tightening for milder cases. Some examples include the use of radiofrequency (i.e., Morpheus8, Exilis, Pelleve, Viore, Thermage), ultrasound (Ulthera), and a 1068 nm diode laser (Sculpture) (see Figures 44.7 through 44.14).

# S

1. Mild to moderate fine lines and wrinkles  
2. Mild to moderate skin laxity  
3. Mild fat deposition

# Contraindications

1. Severe skin laxity and jowling  
2. Moderate to severe submental or submandibular lipomatosis  
3. Deep platysmal banding  
4. Severe Dedo neck classifications [i.e., IV, V, or VI]  
5. Caution in Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI patients  
6. Unrealistic expectations  
7. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

# Complications

1. Pain, numbness, erythema, edema, and induration at treatment areas: May present up to a few weeks following treatment.  
2. Facial nerve palsy: Transient, due to excessive delivery of thermal energy. Additional therapies should be avoided until resolution of facial nerve paresis.  
3. Alopecia: Transient, heat energy can affect follicular hair growth. Patients should be advised prior to treatment.  
4. Subcutaneous nodules: Local massage or warm compresses may assist in expedited recovery.

5. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: More common in Fitzpatrick IV, V, or VI skin types, can be managed with depigmenting agents (i.e.,  $4 \%$  Hydroquinone BID).

# Key Points

1. Radiofrequency, ultrasound, and lasers work on a similar goal by delivering energy in the form of heat, disrupting collagen fibers making them contract and tighten. In this process, fibroblasts are promoted to produce new collagen that will assist in providing a healthy and improved collagenous framework for the skin.  
2. The main advantages of these non-invasive techniques are the limited downtime and quick treatment sessions. Non-invasive modalities are especially appealing for patients seeking alternative options to surgical management. Multiple treatment sessions are recommended.  
3. Lesser invasive therapies are associated with more inferior outcomes. Case selection and patient education are important.  
4. The application of heat energy to the face may provoke pain and discomfort. Treatment can be rendered under oral sedation, intravenous sedation, or general anesthesia for anxious patients.  
5. Caution in Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI. Test spots may be performed and assessed for any concerns prior to full treatment. Lower energy settings are recommended to prevent thermal melanocyte injury.

Figure 44.7. Example of a Morpheus8 configuration setup for the submentum region in a patient with moderate submental lipomatosis. Deeper depths (3.0 or  $4.0\mathrm{mm}$ ) target subcutaneous fat and are aimed for fat reduction. Shallower depths (1.0 or  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$ ) target collagen and are aimed for skin tightening. Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI typically require lower energy settings than lighter skinned individuals. Test spots are encouraged in these individuals.

# Invasive Adjuncts to Facial Liposuction and Skin Tightening Modalities

As described with non-invasive radiofrequency, ultrasonic, and laser therapy modalities used for non-invasive fat reduction and skin tightening, invasive modalities using similar principles have been developed for more moderate and severe cases of facial lipomatosis. Unlike in non-invasive therapies whereby external energy is only applied, in these modalities, internal energy is also delivered, resulting in a more profound result. Examples of these adjunctive therapies include the use of internal radiofrequency (i.e., FaceTite, Renuvion), internal ultrasound (i.e., Vaser), and internal Nd-YAG or diode lasers (i.e., SlimLipo, LaserLipo). The goals with facial liposuction are not only to reduce the fullness of the neck due to excess fat deposition; but to also sculpt the jaw effectively, obtaining aesthetic jaw contours. In these moderate to advanced cases, management of excessive skin redundancy must also be taken into consideration. These therapies are the best available options prior to performing a facelift procedure.

# Indicati

1. Mild, moderate, or severe submental and/or submandibular lipomatosis  
2. Mild to moderate jowling  
3. Mild to moderate skin laxity

# Contraindications

1. Severe skin laxity  
2. Severe jowling  
3. Deep platysmal banding  
4. Unrealistic expectations  
5. Caution in Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI  
6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

# Technique: Internal and External Radiofrequency with FaceTite (InMode Corp., Toronto, Canada)

1. Patients are best managed under intravenous sedation or general anesthesia for improved comfort during the procedure.  
2. Tumescent local anesthesia is administered to the treatment area.  
3. For the submandibular and submental regions, access incisions are made using an 11-blade at the subauricular and submental creases.  
4. Lipodissection is performed using a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  single hole blunt tipped cannula along the lower face and neck, carefully dissecting in a subcutaneous fashion along a supraSMAS and supraplatysmal level.  
5. Conducting gel is applied to the skin surface, making sure not to place the gel near the access locations to prevent any foreign body reaction.  
6. The FaceTite internal probe is inserted through the access incisions in the subcutaneous layer, having direct contact with the adipose tissue. The external probe is in contact with the skin (see Figure 44.10).  
7. The probe is moved in a succinct fashion along five treatment zones: the right and left jowl, the right and left submandibular, and midline submental regions. As the probe moves along each region, internal radiofrequency coagulates fat and external radiofrequency causes skin contraction overtime. Unless there is facial asymmetry, the right and left zones should have similar total energy delivered. To prevent excessive delivery of heat from the internal and external probes, temperature cutoffs are set (i.e., internal cutoff  $65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , external cutoff  $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ).  
8. Afterward, the probe is removed and liposuction with negative pressure is performed to contour the jaw, using a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  and  $3\mathrm{mm}$  single hole blunt tipped cannula. A 4-mm cannula may be used cautiously in the submental region for select cases.  
9. Access incisions are closed using 5-0 plain-gut and a facial dressing is applied for 1 week.

# Case Report 44.3. Facial liposuction with radiofrequency-assisted lipolysis and skin tightening.

A 56-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of "excessive skin laxity and neck fat." Upon physical examination, the patient demonstrates a Glogau III, Fitzpatrick II skin type, Dedo IV neck classification, moderate jowling, and mild submental and submandibular lipomatosis.

# Complications

1. Pain, numbness, erythema, edema, and induration at treatment areas: May present up to a few weeks following treatment.  
2. Facial nerve palsy: Transient, due to excessive delivery of thermal energy. Additional therapies should be avoided until resolution of facial nerve paresis.  
3. Alopecia: Transient, heat energy can affect follicular hair growth. Patients should be advised prior to treatment.  
4. Subcutaneous nodules: Usually due to conducting gel migration into the access locations, particular the submental access site. Local massage or warm compresses may assist in expedited recovery.  
5. Thermal injury: Although rare, avoid prolonged skin contact with the probe and confirm adequate temperature cutoffs prior to treatment.  
6. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: More common in Fitzpatrick IV, V, or VI skin types. Can be managed with depigmenting agents (i.e.,  $4 \%$  Hydroquinone BID).

# Key Points

1. Radiofrequency, ultrasound, and lasers all work on a similar goal by delivering energy in the form of heat, disrupting collagen fibers making them contract and tighten. In this process, fibroblasts are promoted to produce new collagen that will assist in providing a healthy and improved collagenous framework for the skin.  
2. These invasive modalities have the potential for more profound results than their non-invasive counterparts. Case selection will be important as these will inevitably have higher complication risks.  
3. Patient treatment should be rendered under intravenous sedation or general anesthesia to allow for a comfortable experience.  
4. Caution in Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI. Test spots can be performed and assessed for any concerns prior to full treatment. Lower energy settings are recommended to prevent thermal injury to the melanocytes.  
5. Final results will take up to 6 months to allow for complete skin tightening.

The patient was aware that a facelift would be her best option in achieving the most aesthetic result; however, she elected for a less invasive approach. Treatment included submental and submandibular liposuction with FaceTite radiofrequency lipolysis and skin tightening under general anesthesia (see Figures 44.11 through 44.14).
