# Indications

1. Benign neoplasms of the palate  
2. Malignant neoplasms of the palate that are resectable and free of distant metastatic disease

# Contraindications

1. Locally unresectable or distant metastatic disease  
2. Pathology not amenable to primary surgery (i.e., non-Hodgkin lymphoma)  
3. Poorly controlled systemic disease

# Technique: Wide Local Excision  $\pm$  Palatectomy

1. A nasal endotracheal tube in the contralateral naris and a reinforced oral endotracheal tube are the preferred airways for excision of palatal tumors. For optimal access to the palate, a Dingman or Crowe-Davis mouth gag may be utilized. Alternatively, a combination of a bite block, Weider tongue retractor, and van Langenback retractors may be used.  
2. The lesion is identified on the palate and an appropriate margin is marked with a surgical marking pen.  
3. Using monopolar electrocautery, the mucosa of the hard and soft palate (if required) is incised (see Figure 55.9 in Case Report 55.2). In the region of the hard palate, dissection is carried to the level of the palatal bone. In the region of the soft palate, initial dissection should stop at the level of the palatal musculature.  
4. For wide local excision with periosteal stripping, a Molt periosteal elevator is used to gently peel the periosteum on the deep surface of the specimen off of the hard palate from anterior to posterior. If the periosteum appears to be breached or if there is evidence of cortical invasion, the underlying bone should be removed en bloc.  
5. As the dissection proceeds from anterior to posterior, the greater palatine neurovascular bundle is identified, clipped, and divided. The specimen will now be pedicled on the soft tissues of the soft palate, which can be divided with monopolar electrocautery, releasing the specimen. Hemostasis is carried out in the wound bed.

6. The specimen is analyzed and oriented with marking stitches (see Figure 55.10 in Case Report 55.2). Alternatively, the surgeon can ink the specimen margins and specimen-driven frozen section margins can be scrutinized.  
7. If a palatectomy is planned, only minor modifications to the above-described steps are required. Following the initial mucosal incision and exposure of the palatal bone, a reciprocating saw can be placed along the posterior free edge of the hard palate and the medial and lateral osteotomies are completed first. An anterior osteotomy is made connecting the medial and lateral osteotomies. Osteotomes can be used to complete the osteotomies as necessary and to deliver the specimen as described above from anterior to posterior. Following delivery of the specimen, the descending palatine neurovascular vessel is clipped (if not done previously) and hemostasis is carried out.  
8. A xeroform bolster can be fabricated and a surgical obturator placed (see Figure 55.11 in Case Report 55.2) for 7-10 days prior to conversion to an interim obturator. If reconstruction is chosen, local flaps such as a palatal island flap or tongue flap can be used. In patients with partial edentulism, a buccal fat pad advancement flap, facial artery myomucosal flap, or a nasolabial flap may be considered, particularly if the defect is paramedian. Alternatively, a thin pliable free flap such as a fasciocutaneous forearm flap can be used (see Figure 55.13 in Case Report 55.2).

# Technique: Infrastructure Maxillectomy

1. A nasal endotracheal tube in the contralateral naris or a reinforced oral endotracheal tube are the preferred airways for maxillectomy. Tracheostomy is reserved for bulky flap reconstructions, significant oropharyngeal extension of the defect, or patients with significant comorbid cardiopulmonary disease. To minimize blood loss and preserve the surgical field, the patient is placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position and hypotensive anesthesia is maintained.

2. For an infrastructure or subtotal maxillectomy with preservation of the orbital rim, the maxillary vestibular or sublabial approach provides adequate exposure. An upper lip splitting approach is often necessary for a total maxillectomy (Brown III/IV defects). Alternatively, a midfacial degloving approach can be used for lesions crossing the midline and involving the inferior maxilla bilaterally. Access to the posterolateral maxilla can be improved through a coronoidectomy completed via a transoral or lower cheek flap approach. When wide exposure to the posterolateral maxilla and infratemporal fossa are required, a lower lip splitting incision and mandibulotomy are preferred. For high-grade malignancies, a  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  surgical margin is marked around the tumor in the maxillary vestibule and palate connecting in the retromolar region. For adenoid cystic carcinoma, a  $1.5 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  margin is typically recommended. Incisions are made with monopolar electrocautery through the mucosa to the level of the anterior maxilla and hard palate taking care to maintain good hemostasis.  
3. Subperiosteal dissection is carried out to expose the maxilla superiorly, identifying and preserving the infraorbital nerve if oncologically sound. Alternatively, the nerve can be resected and traced back to the skull base as needed. Pre-operative MRI and frozen section analysis can help guide the extent of resection required. The mucoperiosteum of the hard plate should be elevated for approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  away from the tumor to aid in inset and closure if a free flap is being utilized for reconstruction.  
4. Following adequate exposure, osteotomies are completed with or without the aid of patient-specific cutting guides (see Figure 55.3 in Case Report 55.1). Low-profile, titanium alloy guides that capture the unique anatomy of the piriform rim and posterior inferior aspect of the zygoma are ideal (see Figure 55.5 in Case Report 55.1). Alternatively, an occlusal-based guide can be used to guide the alveolar osteotomy. The alveolar osteotomy should be designed to ensure preservation of at least  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of bone on the tooth adjacent to the defect for long-term periodontal health. The lateral maxillary, alveolar, and palatal osteotomies are completed first. The nasal septum and lateral nasal wall can be divided with guarded osteotomies as needed.  
5. Pterygomaxillary disjunction is completed last with a curved osteotome given the anatomical proximity to the internal maxillary artery (25mm superior to pterygomaxillary junction) and the possibility of significant hemorrhage and need for expedient control. Alternatively, if the tumor extends to the posterior maxilla or pterygoid plates, the curved osteotome can be directed through the plates removing them en bloc with the specimen. The palatomaxillary complex is downfractured in a controlled fashion with digital pressure or with the aid of a Smith bone spreader. If excessive force is required, attention should be redirected to revising the osteotomies.

6. The posterior soft tissue pedicle including the soft palate and pterygoid musculature is divided with monopolar electrocautery or maxillectomy shears releasing the specimen.  
7. Attention is directed to hemostasis of the wound bed. Often the descending palatine and/or internal maxillary arteries need to be controlled with surgical clips at this time. Diffuse oozing from the pterygoid musculature, pterygoid plexus of veins, and nasal mucosa can be managed with local hemostatic agents such as oxidized regenerated cellulose, fibrin sealant, and/or flowable gelatin with thrombin.  
8. If a surgical obturator is being used, an inferior turbinectomy should be completed to allow for superior extension of the obturator prosthesis to improve retention and prevent inferior turbinate edema and descent into the oral cavity. Exposed respiratory mucosa should be covered with a skin graft. The keratinized tissue provides a better prosthetic bearing surface than respiratory epithelium. Furthermore, a skin graft promotes the development of a cicatricial band at the skin graft-mucosa junction that aids in obturator retention.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative care of maxillectomy patients is largely dictated by the means of reconstruction. Patients undergoing free tissue transfer are best managed in a high-dependency/specialty care unit or an intensive care unit depending on the institutions capabilities. Alternatively, maxillectomy patients with a surgical obturator can typically be managed in a standard head and neck/maxillofacial surgery care unit.  
2. The majority of patients can be safely managed with either a reinforced oral endotracheal tube or nasal endotracheal tube in the contralateral naris. Patients with bulky flap reconstructions, significant extension to the oropharynx, and/or severe pulmonary disease may benefit from an elective tracheostomy.  
3. Maxillectomy patients with defects limited to the oral cavity typically have minimal disruption in swallowing function. Reconstruction with a surgical obturator permits early resumption of a liquid diet progressing to a blenderized diet as tolerated. Patients with free flap reconstruction are at lower risk of cervical leaks compared with other subsites of the upper aerodigestive tract. As such, commencement of oral intake can typically begin 3-5 days postoperatively. One concern with early resumption of oral intake and excessive speech is the development of a posteriorly based oronasal fistula at the soft palate-flap junction. This can be minimized with the injection of botulinum toxin A in the soft palate intraoperatively.  
4. If orbital contents are preserved, routine ocular examinations are required to evaluate for signs of optic nerve compromise and extraocular muscle entrapment.

5. Patients with a surgical obturator placed at the time of primary surgery will have the prosthesis and the bolster dressing removed 7-10 days postoperatively. At this time, an interim obturator prosthesis is delivered. Adjustments and relines are carried out every 1-3 weeks for 3-4 months until a steady state of healing is appreciated. At this time, fabrication of a definitive obturator prosthesis can begin.

# Complications

Bleeding: The maxilla and midface are well-vascularized structures with abundant collateral circulation. Reverse trendelenburg positioning and hypotensive anesthesia should be utilized to minimize blood loss and improve the surgical field. The internal maxillary artery runs approximately  $25\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the pterygomaxillary junction, while the descending palatine artery runs approximately  $30 - 35\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the piriform rim along the nasal wall. Pterygomaxillary disjunction should be the last osteotomy completed as significant bleeding from the internal maxillary artery can occur at this juncture. In the event of transection, expedient delivery of the specimen is performed, and local vascular control is completed. Liberal use of hemostatic agents such as oxidized regenerated cellulose, fibrin sealant, and flowable gelatin with thrombin can be utilized for diffuse oozing from the pterygoid plexus of veins, pterygoid muscles, and nasal mucosa. Following maxillectomy, pseudoaneurysm formation and delayed hemorrhage from rupture are possible. When suspected, a CT angiogram for diagnosis is appropriate. Management typically consists of angiography and embolization.

Ophthalmologic: Corneal abrasion, optic nerve injury, and nasolacrimal system dysfunction are all possible, particularly with total maxillectomy. A corneal shield or temporary tarsorrhaphy suture should be placed to protect the globe intraoperatively. When the nasolacrimal duct is transected to improve access to the medial orbit, the system should be cannulated to avoid postoperative epiphora. Lower eyelid malposition, including most commonly lower lid retraction and/or ectropion, is common following a subciliary extension of a Weber-Ferguson approach. An extended lateral rhinotomy approach with extension inferior to the brow has been proposed by some authors to minimize the risk of lower lid malposition and hardware exposure without compromising lateral exposure.

Hypernasality: Hypernasal speech following maxillectomy is a common complication. When there is significant extension of the resection onto the soft palate, disruption of the velopharyngeal unit can result in velopharyngeal insufficiency. Additionally, posteriorly based fistulae along the soft palate-flap margin are common and are thought to arise from movement of the soft palate during the early postoperative period during speech and swallowing.

# Key Points

1. All patients presenting with a palatal mass require a detailed history and physical examination and an incisional biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis.  
2. Patients with minor salivary gland neoplasm (MSGNs) require a contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) to evaluate the extent of the lesion, the presence of cortical erosion, and for the presence of regional metastasis (if malignant). MRI of the skull base is required in patients with neurosensory changes, and high-grade malignancies, in particular adenoid cystic carcinoma, which has a propensity for perineural invasion and extension along the second division of the trigeminal nerve.  
3. The particular surgical intervention required is dictated by the specific pathology and the extent of disease (i.e., bone invasion, perineural spread). In general, benign MSGNs and T1 low-intermediate-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma with no clinical or radiologic evidence of bone invasion can be treated with wide local excision and periosteal stripping. If there is evidence of cortical disruption or a breach in the periosteum, the underlying bone should be removed. Alternatively, all high-grade malignancies necessitate bone removal. Polymorphous adenocarcinoma (formerly polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma) management is more controversial. Although once felt to be a low-grade malignancy, a recent review demonstrated a  $19.1\%$  recurrence rate, prompting some authors to recommend excision with bone removal to decrease the rate of local failure.  
4. The Brown-modified maxillectomy classification is perhaps the system best known for bridging the "language barrier" between surgeons and prosthodontists. The Brown-modified maxillectomy classification is a six-subgroup schema comprising the vertical (numbered 1-6) and horizontal (a-d) extent of the resection, with the goal of predicting the functional and esthetic sequelae of ablative surgery.  
5. Adjuvant radiotherapy with MSGNS is indicated in patients with increased risk of local or regional recurrence, which includes high-grade pathology, T3/T4 disease, high-risk pathologic features (perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node involvement), and adenoid cystic carcinomas. The role of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is being prospectively investigated in the RTOG 1008 randomized phase II/III clinical trial comparing RT with chemoradiotherapy using weekly cisplatin in high-risk patients following surgical resection.  
6. Goals of maxillectomy defect reconstruction include (i) separation of the nasal cavity from the oral cavity; (ii) support the globe, nose, cheek, upper lip, and facial soft tissues; (iii) re-establish bony and soft-tissue foundation for ideal mastication; (iv) maintain adequate mouth opening for chewing, speaking, and insertion/removal of a dental prosthesis; (v) provide

a stable bony platform for dental implants if possible; (vi) maintain a patent nasal airway; (vii) obliterate the surgical dead space; (viii) seal the dura if violated during resection; and (ix) prepare the patient and wound bed for adjuvant radiotherapy when indicated.

7. Reconstruction of palatomaxillary defects is challenging and no broad consensus exists. In general, a surgical obturator can be considered in Brown I-IIa, b defects particularly when the ipsilateral canine has been preserved. With the increasing use of zygomatic implants, the capabilities of a surgical obturator have been enhanced allowing for reconstruction of larger

# Case Reports

Case Report 55.1. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) of the palate treated via right infrastructure maxillectomy with reconstruction utilizing a 2-segment osteoseptocutaneous fibula flap. A 47-year-old female referred for evaluation of a right palatal mass. Following history and physical examination, a panorex and incisional biopsy was completed. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the palate. To complete the oncologic workup, a CECT of the neck and chest was completed. In addition, an MRI of the skull base was performed to evaluate for perineural spread along the second division of the trigeminal nerve, which was not present. The patient was staged as a cT4aN0M0 adenoid cystic carcinoma of the palate. The patient underwent a right infrastructure maxillectomy via a maxillary vestibular approach, an ipsilateral selective neck dissection, and

defects; however, studies comparing outcomes of this to that of free tissue transfer are limited at this time.

8. When reconstruction of the palatomaxillary defect is chosen, soft tissue flaps such as a fasciocutaneous forearm or anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap, achieve good results with Brown I-IIa, b defects. As the defect expands anteriorly past the canine, and superiorly, there is increasing loss of peri-nasal and malar support. Moreover, there is decreased support and retention offered by the remaining dentition and palate for a tooth and tissue-supported removable prosthesis. As such, Brown IIc, d, III, IV defects are typically better managed with vascularized bone flaps and implant supported prostheses.

reconstruction with a 2-segment osteoseptocutaneous fibula flap and second-stage dental implant placement. Patient-specific titanium alloy cutting guides were used for the maxillectomy to facilitate reconstruction with a fibula flap. Mini-plates were pre-bent to a stereolithographic model of the reconstructed maxilla to guide flap inset. Alternatively, a custom reconstruction plate could have been used.

The final pathology demonstrated an adenoid cystic carcinoma in a tubular and cribiform pattern consistent with Grade 1 (absence of solid component) disease. Perineural invasion and bone invasion were also identified. Final pathologic stage was IVA (pT4aN0M0). The patient was treated with adjuvant proton therapy (see Figures 55.1 through 55.6).
