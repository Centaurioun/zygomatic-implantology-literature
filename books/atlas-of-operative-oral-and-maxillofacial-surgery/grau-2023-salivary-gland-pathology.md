# Mucocele (Mucous Extravasation Phenomenon) Excision

Local excision of a damaged minor salivary gland and associated soft tissue

# Indications

1. Soft tissue swelling associated with damage or rupture of a minor salivary gland duct

# Contraindications

1. Significant medical comorbidities (i.e., anticoagulated patients)

# Anatomy

Mucocele: A damaged or ruptured minor salivary gland duct leading to extravasation of mucus within the surrounding soft tissue.

# Technique

1. Local anesthesia is administered specific to the location of the mucocele. For lower lip mucoceles, bilateral mental nerve or inferior alveolar nerve blocks are performed.  
2. An elliptical excision of the mucocele, with its associated overlying mucosa and glandular tissue/damaged minor salivary gland, is performed down to the muscle layer (see Figure 60.3 in Case Report 60.1). Care is taken to preserve the integrity of the vermilion border of the lip, to remove the entire involved minor salivary gland, and to minimize iatrogenic damage to adjacent minor salivary glands.  
3. Deep 4-0 Vicryl sutures are placed depending on the size and depth of the surgical defect.

4. Interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures are used to re-approximate the mucosa (see Figure 60.4 in Case Report 60.1). Care is taken to not deform the lower lip with inappropriate suture placement.

# Postoperative Management

1. Pain medication is prescribed based on the invasiveness of the procedure.  
2. If the lower lip is the site of excision, ice is applied to the affected area off and on for the first 24 hours.  
3. A 2-week follow-up is advised to assess the healing of the site and to review the pathology results with the patient.

# Complications

1. Lower lip asymmetry: Results from inappropriate suture placement. If identified at the time of the procedure, the asymmetry may be corrected with suture removal and resuturing of the lower lip. If identified late, the asymmetry may require revision surgery.  
2. Recurrence: Due to incomplete removal of the involved minor salivary gland or from damage to adjacent minor salivary glands. Prior to the procedure, the possibility of recurrence should be discussed with the patient.

# Key Points

1. Although mucoceles may occur at any location containing minor salivary glands (i.e., the soft palate, retromolar pad, ventral tongue, floor of mouth, and buccal mucosa), over  $80\%$  of mucoceles are found within the lower lip.  
2. The majority of mucoceles occur within the first three decades of life.  
3. Mucoceles typically present as a blue, purple, gray, or normal-colored painless, soft, fluid-filled vesicle on the

lower lip. Mucoceles may undergo a fibrotic transformation from chronic inflammation and lip biting.

4. Mucoceles infrequently exceed  $1.0\mathrm{cm}$  in their greatest dimension.  
5. Drainage of mucoceles or incomplete excision of the damaged gland will result in a recurrence of the mucocele.

# Case Report

# Sublingual Gland Excision

A surgical method for excising an infected or pathologic sublingual gland with or without an associated ranula.

# Indications

1. Ranula formation  
2. Sialadenitis  
3. Sublingual pathology

# Contraindications

1. Significant medical comorbidities  
2. Relative contraindication: active infection

# Anatomy

Ranulas: Extravasation mucoceles that arise from the sublingual gland due to damage or rupture of a main duct or the acini after obstruction.  
Plunging ranulas: A ranula that extends through the mylohyoid muscle and extends into the neck, with or without intraoral swelling.

Sublingual gland: The sublingual gland is the smallest of the major salivary glands and produces  $3 - 5\%$  of the total salivary flow to the oral cavity. The sublingual saliva exits the gland via small ducts of Rivinus. These ducts may empty directly into the floor of the mouth, join Wharton's duct directly, or coalesce into a larger, common sublingual (Bartholin's) duct before joining the submandibular duct.  
Lingual nerve: A large, flat nerve that is located within the lateral floor of mouth, superior to the submandibular gland. The lingual nerve descends from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve near the lingula, and it courses from lateral to medial as it nears the tongue. During its descension, the lingual nerve loops underneath the submandibular duct, first crossing from the lateral side, and then again passing the duct as the nerve ascends on the medial side to innervate the dorsal tongue.

# Technique: Intraoral Ranula and Sublingual Gland Excision

1. The procedure may be performed with local anesthesia alone, intravenous sedation, or general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  
2. Local anesthesia is administered in the form of bilateral nerve blocks and local infiltration. A lacrimal probe is inserted into Wharton's duct (see Figure 60.7 in Case Report 60.2) to allow for the identification and retraction of the duct. Traction sutures may be placed within the periphery of the tongue to aid in retraction.  
3. An elliptical incision is made around the periphery of the ranula through the oral mucosa only. Care is taken to not perforate the ranula itself.

4. Blunt dissection with a fine hemostat is used to identify the associated sublingual gland (see Figure 60.7 in Case Report 60.2). During dissection, the surgeon should be cognizant of the location of Wharton's duct (easily identifiable if a lacrimal probe was placed) and the lingual nerve medial to the sublingual gland.  
5. An Allis clamp is used to grasp and elevate the sublingual gland as it is freed from its surrounding tissue with blunt dissection (see Figure 60.8 in Case Report 60.2).  
6. The site is copiously irrigated, and the lacrimal probe is removed. The defect is evaluated for hemostasis.  
7. The mucosal defect may be re-approximated with interrupted resorbable sutures or may be left open to granulate secondarily (see Figure 60.10 in Case Report 60.2).

# Technique: Intraoral Sublingual Gland Excision Without Associated Ranula

1. Follow steps 1-2 of the "Technique: Intraoral Ranula and Sublingual Gland Excision" section.  
2. A lingual gingival sulcular incision is initiated along the posterior teeth. The incision may be carried to the midline if additional exposure of the floor of the mouth is necessary.  
3. A subperiosteal tissue plane is developed, and a full-thickness tissue flap is developed along the lingual aspect of the body or ramus of the mandible.  
4. The sublingual gland is palpated medial to the periosteal reflection, superior to the mylohyoid muscle. The perio- teum overlying the sublingual gland is penetrated with blunt dissection, and the sublingual gland is identified.  
5. The ensuing sublingual gland removal is described in steps 4-6 of the "Technique: Intraoral Ranula and Sublingual Gland Excision" section.  
6. The incision is closed primarily with interrupted interproximal resorbable sutures.

# Technique: Transcutaneous Plunging Ranula and Sublingual Gland Excision

1. The approach to the submandibular triangle is described in steps 1-6 of the "Submandibular Gland Excision" section.  
2. Once the ranula is identified, blunt dissection is used to mobilize the ranula from its surrounding tissue. Blunt dissection and mobilization continue superiorly until the plunging ranula is freed from the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscles, the hyoglossus muscle, and the herniation through the mylohyoid muscle is identified (see Figure 60.16 in Case Report 60.3).  
3. The dehiscence through the mylohyoid muscle is enlarged, and the attachment of the plunging ranula to the ipsilateral sublingual gland is identified. Blunt dissection is used to free the sublingual gland from its associated tissue. Care is taken to avoid iatrogenic damage to the lingual nerve and Wharton duct medial to the gland.

4. The plunging ranula and the associated sublingual gland are delivered through the transcutaneous incision (see Figure 60.17 in Case Report 60.3). The dehiscence in the mylohyoid muscle is repaired with interrupted resorbable sutures.  
5. The incision is irrigated, hemostasis is confirmed, and the wound is closed in a layered fashion. Drains are placed dependent on the size of the plunging ranula excised (see Figure 60.18 in Case Report 60.3).

# Postoperative Management

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed for 5 days postoperatively.  
2. Saline rinses are begun the day after surgery and continued until the complete mucosalization of the defect or incision site.  
3. Analgesics are prescribed based on the invasiveness of the procedure.  
4. Follow-up appointments are typically at 1, 3, and 6 weeks to assess surgical site healing and to assess lingual nerve and Wharton's duct function.

# Complications

Hematoma formation: Minimized with meticulous dissection and careful inspection of the surgical site prior to procedure completion. Managed with hematoma evacuation with or without drain placement.

Damage to the lingual nerve (CN V3): Iatrogenic damage to this structure as it courses medial to the sublingual gland will result in a sensory disturbance to the tongue. Most injuries are stretch injuries and improve with time. Witnessed nerve transections should be repaired primarily at the initial surgery.

Damage to Wharton's duct: Minimized by cannulation of Wharton's duct with a lacrimal probe prior to surgical exploration of the floor of the mouth. Damage to Wharton's duct may lead to stenosis, obstructive sialadenitis, and sialocele formation. Observed transections or lacerations are treated with intraoperative sialodochoplasty or intraoral cannulation with plastic tubing. The tubing should be left in place for several weeks to promote epithelialization around the stent to reestablish duct continuity (see Figure 60.35).

Ranula recurrence: Recurrence rates are directly related to the procedure performed. Complete sublingual gland excision has the lowest recurrence rate, whereas marsupialization alone is associated with the highest recurrence rate.

# Key Points

1. Multiple treatment modalities exist for ranula management. Surgical treatments and associated recurrence rates are listed in descending order: complete excision of the ranula and the associated sublingual gland, partial sublingual gland resection, and marsupialization.

Recurrence rates are highly variable within the literature.

2. The approach selection for plunging ranulas is based on the size of the ranula. Smaller plunging ranulas may be surgically excised via an intraoral approach alone. Larger plunging ranulas may be resected with an extraoral approach, with or without a combined intraoral approach. The type of extraoral approach is determined by the extension (submandibular, cervical, and/or parapharyngeal) and the size of the ranula.

# Case Reports

Case Report 60.2. Transoral sublingual gland and ranula excision. A 24-year-old patient presents with a chief complaint of a soft, painless mass within the right floor of his mouth that has been present for over 12 months. On examination, the patient has a  $2.5 \times 1.3$  cm fluctuant, nontender soft tissue mass located along the right lingual gutter. The location and appearance of the

3. Combined transcutaneous and intraoral approaches are required for plunging ranulas with intraoral extension or when the sublingual gland cannot be identified through an extraoral approach.  
4. Early identification of the lingual nerve and Wharton's duct along the medial aspect of the sublingual gland is key to minimizing postoperative complications associated with these structures. Cannulation of Wharton's duct prior to floor-of-mouth dissection will minimize iatrogenic damage to this structure and allow for its retraction from the surgical field.

The patient was treated with general anesthesia via nasotracheal intubation and an in-continuity excision of the right sublingual gland and overlying ranula. The final histopathology revealed a ranula with extravasation of mucus from the included sublingual gland (see Figures 60.6 through 60.10).

# Submandibular Gland Resection

A surgical method for transcutaneously excising a nonfunctional, hyperfunctional, or pathologic submandibular gland.

# Indications

1. Recurrent or chronic sialadenitis  
2. Obstructive sialocholithiasis  
3. Benign or malignant neoplasms  
4. As part of a neck dissection to remove lymph nodes in level Ib

# Contraindications

1. Suspicion of tumor: Removal of the gland should not be done as a biopsy to rule out tumor, whether benign or malignant. A formal level I neck dissection, rather than a "shelling out" of the gland, should be performed unless the evaluation clearly points to a non-neoplastic indication for gland removal.  
2. Significant medical comorbidities precluding the use of general anesthesia: For patients unable to tolerate general anesthesia, the gland may be removed under local anesthesia if indicated  
3. Hematologic disorders  
4. Sialolithiasis within the distal portion of Wharton's duct

# Anatomy

Submandibular gland: The submandibular gland is located within the submandibular triangle (level 1b) of the neck. The superficial part of the gland is immediately deep to the platysma and is encapsulated by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. The gland is bilobed, forming a C shape around the posterior margin of the mylohyoid muscle. The superficial lobe can be found above the mylohyoid muscle within the lateral sublingual space, while the larger deep lobe is located inferior to the mylohyoid muscle. Medially, the submandibular gland is intimately associated with the stylohyoid, digastric, and styloglossus muscles.

's duct: Arises from multiple branches on the medial side of the deep lobe of the submandibular gland (see Figure 60.20). Wharton's duct courses forward, superior, and medial to the mylohyoid muscle and in proximity to the lingual nerve. As the duct moves forward, it travels medial to the sublingual gland. The submandibular duct advances anteriorly and medially until its orifice opens at the summit of small papilla on the side of the frenulum linguae, called the lingual caruncle. Not only is the course of the submandibular duct tortuous, but it is also the longest salivary duct at approximately  $5\mathrm{cm}$  (see Figure 60.20). Therefore, salivary secretions have more time in transit before being discharged into the mouth. The duct possesses two bends, the first at the posterior border of the mylohy-oid muscle and the second near the duct orifice. In addition, the duct partially courses from inferior to superior, forcing the flow of saliva against gravity and increasing the risk of retrograde movement. The calcium concentration of the saliva produced by the submandibular gland is twice that of the parotid gland, and the saliva is more viscous and alkaline. These factors promote salivary stasis and sialolith formation within the sub-mandibular duct;  $90\%$  of submandibular duct stones are radiopaque, whereas  $90\%$  of parotid gland stones are radiolucent. Stones anterior to the first molar can often be seen on an occlusal film and are more amena-ble to treatment via an intraoral incision and sialodochoplasty.

![](images/871b96ba125e6e01cf97e2ef98a849c244d5498a7f5acde18a070a47305f71f2.jpg)  
Figure 60.20. Wharton's duct is visualized as the submandibular gland is being delivered with an Allis clamp.

Marginal mandibular nerve: At risk of injury as it runs within the investing (superficial) layer of deep cervical fascia overlying the submandibular gland. The marginal mandibular nerve may be located up to  $3\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible. It consists of up to four parallel branches that cross the facial artery and vein before ascending to innervate the depressor anguli oris.

Hypoglossal nerve: Enters the submandibular triangle posteroinferiorly and medial to the stylohyoid muscle and the posterior belly of the digastric. After entering the submandibular triangle, it travels in an anterosuperior direction against the lateral surface of the hyoglossus muscle. The nerve ultimately passes above the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle prior to entering the musculature of the tongue.

# Technique: Extraoral Submandibular Gland Excision

1. Preoperative intravenous antibiotics are initiated preincision.  
2. The patient is induced with short-acting paralytics to allow for monitoring of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve during dissection. General anesthesia is typically obtained via oral endotracheal intubation.  
3. The patient is placed in a supine position, the neck is hyperextended, and the head is rotated to the contralateral side. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The ipsilateral commissure of the mouth should be prepped and readily visible.  
4. A natural skin crease at least  $3\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible or at the level of the hyoid bone, extending anteriorly from the anterior border of the SCM muscle, is located and marked (see Figure 60.21 in Case Report 60.4);  $2\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine may be infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues in the region of the proposed incision to aid with hemostasis.  
5. The incision is carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue to the level of the platysma muscle (see Figure 60.22 in Case Report 60.4). A subplatysmal flap is developed superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible to expose the investing (superficial) layer of the deep cervical fascia and the superficial aspect of the submandibular gland. A nerve stimulator is used to assist in the identification of marginal mandibular nerve during dissection to the submandibular gland.  
6. The submandibular capsule is incised inferiorly. A subcapsular dissection is performed to expose the gland (see Figure 60.23 in Case Report 60.4). Care must be taken during this step to keep the dissection subcapsular to avoid damage to the marginal mandibular nerve. Alternatively, the marginal mandibular nerve may be exposed as the nerve crosses the facial vessels. The nerve may then be retracted superiorly within the subplatysmal flap.

7. The facial artery and vein are divided and ligated. The anterior margin of the gland is freed from the anterior belly of the digastric muscle with blunt dissection or electrocautery. The dissection continues in a posterior direction, elevating the gland from the lateral surface of the mylohyoid muscle. The mylohyoid vessels are divided and ligated to allow access to the mylohyoid muscle.  
8. The posterior free margin of the mylohyoid is identified. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the hypoglossal nerve, the venous comitans of the hypoglossal, and the lingual nerve, which are exposed and vulnerable to injury immediately posterior to the mylohyoid muscle. Retracting the posterior free margin of the mylohyoid anteriorly and with careful finger dissection, the lingual nerve, submandibular ganglion, and submandibular duct come into view. An index finger is passed in the well-defined interfascial plane between the gland and submandibular ganglion laterally and the fascia covering the hypoglossal nerve and venous comitans medially.  
9. After the hypoglossal nerve has been identified, one may safely clamp, divide, and ligate the submandibular duct and divide the lingual nerve from the submandibular ganglion. Bipolar electrocautery should be utilized at the junction of the lingual nerve and the ganglion prior to division. Care must be taken not to damage the lingual nerve. The gland is reflected inferiorly, and the facial artery is identified, ligated, and divided where it exits from behind the posterior belly of the digastric. The gland is freed from the tendon and posterior belly of the digastric and removed (see Figure 60.24 in Case Report 60.4). The gland is sent for final pathology.  
10. The view of the surgical field following resection demonstrates the hypoglossal nerve, the venous comitans, the lingual nerve, and the transected Wharton's duct all on the lateral aspect of the hyoglossus muscle (see Figure 60.25 in Case Report 60.4). Deep to the

74-year-old female presents with a 1-year history of intermittent pain and swelling to her left mandibular triangle. The patient with a medical history significant for Sjogren's syndrome. Physical examination revealed a tender and enlarged submandibular gland. Milking of Wharton's duct

hyoglossus muscle lies the lingual artery within Little's triangle.

11. The wound is irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline. The surgical site is closed in layers. A suction drain or passive drain may be utilized (see Figure 60.26 in Case Report 60.4).

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients are typically admitted for 24-hour observation.  
2. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (e.g., Cefazolin) are administered during the hospital course, followed by 1 week of oral antibiotic therapy.  
3. The head of bed is elevated  $30^{\circ}$ , and a gentle pressure dressing is placed on the anterior neck.  
4. The suction drain is removed at 36 hours postoperatively or when three consecutive 8-hour shifts produce less than  $30\mathrm{mL}$  cumulative output.

# Complications

1. Injury to the hypoglossal nerve: Damage to this nerve results in deviation of the tongue toward the injured side upon tongue protrusion.  
2. Injury to the lingual nerve  
3. Injury to the marginal mandibular nerve  
4. Surgical site infections  
5. Bleeding or hematoma formation

# Key Points

1. Ensure the use of short-acting paralytics during induction to allow for facial nerve monitoring.  
2. The incision should be placed within a natural skin fold to prevent an unaesthetic postoperative scar.  
3. The marginal mandibular nerve must be identified in all cases.  
4. If removal of the gland is indicated because of tumor, ensure the entire gland is removed and an enucleation is not performed.

suggested no salivary flow. A CT scan was obtained that demonstrated a large stone located within the hilum of the left submandibular gland. Due to chronic sialadenitis and large stone formation, the patient underwent left submandibular gland resection with ligation of Wharton's duct (see Figures 60.21 through 60.27).

# Sialodochoplasty

A ductotomy to reposition and widen the salivary duct orifice.

# Indications

1. Chronic or recurrent sialolithiasis or sialadenitis  
2. Evidence of distal ductal dilatation, obstruction, or stenosis on ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance sialogrophy  
3. Traumatic or iatrogenic violation of Stenson's, Wharton's, or Bartholin's ducts  
4. Adjunct to salivary calculi removal via sialolithectomy or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)  
5. Distal ductal pathology  
6. Excessive sialorrhea (drooling)

# Contraindications

1. Proximal obstruction of salivary duct or gland  
2. Salivary gland pathology or dysfunction

# Anatomy

Sialolithiasis: The formation of salivary calculi (sialoliths) within the major salivary glands or ducts. Sialoliths (salivary stones) are typically single, calcium-rich crystallized minerals; however, multiple stones may be present. Approximately  $85\%$  of sialoliths occur within the submandibular duct (Wharton's duct). Only  $5 - 10\%$  occur within the parotid gland due to the short and straight course of Stenson's duct and lower viscosity serous saliva. The ducts of Rivinus and Bartholin's ducts are usually unaffected, with less than  $5\%$  of cases within the sublingual or minor salivary glands.

# Technique

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia and prepped and draped to allow exposure of the oral cavity. Local anesthesia is administered with blocks and/or infiltration with care to avoid anatomical distortion of the floor of the mouth by excessive local anesthetic infiltration.  
2. A vasodilator such as lidocaine without epinephrine may be injected within the region of the duct opening to aid in the dilation and identification of the duct orifice. Once identified, serial lacrimal probes are used to dilate the duct for later stent placement. The expected site of the stone or of the obstruction is identified via gentle retrograde probing.  
3. A 2-0 silk suture is placed distal to the stone and around the duct to prevent retrograde migration of the stone toward the hilum of the gland (see Figure 60.28). This suture may then be used for elevation and retraction.  
4. If necessary, additional sutures may be passed through the tongue to aid with retraction.  
5. The superficial floor-of-mouth mucosa directly overlying the stone or site of stricture is excised via sharp dissection, incising parallel to the duct (see Figure 60.32 in Case Report 60.5). Meticulous hemostasis is imperative for proper identification of floor-of-mouth contents. Once the duct and lingual nerve are clearly identified, a ductotomy is performed to remove the sialolith or site of stenosis.  
6. The injured duct should be cleanly transected, and the cut end sutured to the adjacent floor-of-mouth mucosa with 5-0 Vicryl or chromic sutures. If dissection needs to be continued proximally, it is recommended to "suture as you go" with one stitch per  $0.5\mathrm{cm}$  of transected duct.

![](images/e3c91d642241f3f24dbefee5b0b1db249270dd014e09af7938f4cb3f3f6f1058.jpg)  
Figure 60.28. The location of the palpable stone is marked in purple. A 2-0 silk suture is placed distal to the stone and around the duct to prevent retrograde migration of the stone toward the hilum of the gland.

7. Copious sterile saline irrigation should be used to flush out any additional stones and dilute any purulence or inflammatory mediators.  
8. Stent or gauze strip placement is optional in the neoosteum. Alternatively, the duct may be closed entirely with a distally placed catheter or stent to maintain the original patency (see Figure 60.35 in Case Report 60.5). If placed, the stent should remain in place for a minimum of 14 days in order to allow epithelialization around the stent to reestablish duct continuity.

# Postoperative Management

1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for both their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.  
2. Conservative therapies such as hydration, warm compresses, and gentle glandular massage aid in minimizing stasis and subsequent infection.  
3. Sialogues, such as pilocarpine, may or may not be prescribed in addition to the slow consumption of sour candies to stimulate salivary secretion.  
4. Postoperative antibiotics are optional for elective cases, but they are recommended and routinely prescribed for cases with symptomatic sialadenitis.

5. Diet should begin with clear liquids post anesthesia and may be advanced to a full mechanical diet as tolerated.  
6. Patients may resume their normal activities the next day as tolerated.

# Complications

# Early Complications

1. Bleeding: Postoperative bleeding is rare. The translucent mucosa allows easy visualization of sublingual vasculature, and any compromise would likely be identified immediately. In patients with an underlying coagulopathy, a slow bleed or hematoma can present as a medical emergency with potential airway compromise. It is important to warn patients in advance with regards to floor-of-mouth edema/hematoma formation and subsequent airway compromise to hasten their return to the hospital after outpatient treatment.  
2. Lingual nerve damage: The lingual nerve lies in proximity to the submandibular duct, as described in this chapter, and careful scrutiny is imperative to avoid damaging the nerve.  
3. Stent dislodgement: If a surgical stent or gauze strip is left in place, it must be secured adequately to prevent dislodgment by mastication or parafunctional habits. Early failure may lead to restenosis of the neo-osteum.  
4. Infection: Rare. If an infection is present, appropriate cultures followed by empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended or clindamycin for penicillin-allergic individuals, in addition to oral rinses such as  $0.12\%$  chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex). Incision and drainage are indicated, and the patency of the duct and neo-osteum should be verified.

# Late Complications

1. Impaired glandular function: Salivary gland function typically returns following sialodochoplasty; however, clinically impaired function may warrant further workup for xerostomia or glandular studies via sialogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound assessment.

# Case Report

Case Report 60.5. Transoral sialolithectomy and sialodochoplasty. A 37-year-old patient presents with a chief complaint of a mass to the floor of her mouth and recent-onset pain while eating. The patient reports that the mass has been there for years, but that pain on eating has developed over the past several weeks. On examination, the patient has an indurated, mobile, and tender mass to the left floor of the mouth. No cervical

2. Recurrent sialolithiasis: Individuals prone to sialolith formation may have stone recurrence with or without obstruction. The shortened path and enlarged opening after sialodochoplasty may allow natural stone passage without additional treatment.  
3. Restenosis and recurrent sialadenitis: If obstruction and inflammation recur, retreatment may be justified. Alternatively, gland removal may be considered. The risk of neo-ostium stenosis is  $2\%$ .

# Key Points

1. The most common cause of salivary gland enlargement is benign inflammatory disease secondary to ductal outflow obstruction. This may be due to sialolithiasis, strictures, polyps, mucous plugs, mass effect, or other pathology causing stasis and retrograde salivary flow. All of the above may lead to an inflammatory response within the salivary acini and glandular enlargement with or without a bacterial infection. The submandibular (Wharton's) duct is the most common site for sialolithiasis.  
2. Sialodochoplasty refers to salivary duct repair. This may be performed in conjunction with sialolithectomy in order to prevent restenosis of the ductal system. The duct may be simply stitched open or packed with a gauze strip, or it may require a stent to be left in place for 7-10 days in order to heal properly.  
3. The goal of sialodochoplasty is to posteriorly reposition the duct orifice. This reduces the duct length and eliminates the most common site of obstruction in the distal duct. Stones located within the distal submandibular duct are usually superficial and may be removed easily via a transoral approach under local anesthesia. Conversely, proximal or glandular stones may require more invasive treatment with removal of the affected salivary gland and its duct.  
4. In addition to medical management, recent technical innovations and literature encourage the utilization of noninvasive techniques such as sialendoscopy and ESWL to remove or break up sialoliths. Sialodochoplasty may be completed in conjunction with the above procedures or as a second line of treatment after failure or recurrence.  
5. Sialodochoplasty after sialolithectomy via a transoral technique is frequently unnecessary.

lymphadenopathy was noted. On review of the cone beam CT scan, a  $23\mathrm{mm}$  (length) by  $12\mathrm{mm}$  (width) sialolith was identified. The patient's submandibular gland appeared normal on examination and on review of additional radiographs. The patient underwent sialolithectomy and sialodochoplasty of the left submandibular (Wharton's) duct (see Figures 60.29 through 60.35).

# Superficial Parotidectomy

The removal of the superficial (or lateral) lobe of the parotid gland with preservation of the facial nerve due to pathology within the gland.

# Indications

1. Biopsy of parotid mass  
2. Definitive treatment of an intraparenchymal parotid mass  
3. Excision of benign to low-grade malignancy within the superficial lobe of the parotid gland  
4. Treatment of chronic sialodenitis (parotitis) refractory to conservative therapy and medical management  
5. Symptomatic chronic sialolithiasis  
6. In conjunction with lymphadenectomy and/or local tissue excision for malignancy  
7. To ensure sufficient margins for cheek resections involving malignancies (e.g., melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma)  
8. Cosmesis for neoplasm-like conditions of the parotid (i.e., Sjögren's syndrome and benign lymphoepithelial cysts)

# Contraindications

1. Treatment of high-grade parotid neoplasms: Requires total parotidectomy with adjunctive procedures  
2. Neoplasm involving extension into or near the deep lobe of the parotid

# Anatomy

Parotid gland: The largest of the major salivary glands and primarily a serous salivary gland. The parotid is invested by the anterior or superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia (SDCF), also known as the investing fascia. This layer surrounds the entire neck, with attachments starting posteriorly at the spinous process of the vertebrae and splitting to invest the trapezius and SCM muscles. The SDCF is continuous across the midline without interruption. The structures of the parotid fascia are deep to the superficial fascia of the neck and superficial to the middle (pretracheal) layer of the deep cervical fascia.

Facial nerve: Exits the stylomastoid foramen approximately  $2\mathrm{cm}$  deep from the surface of the overlying skin. The bifurcation of the main trunk is  $1.5 - 2.8\mathrm{cm}$  inferior from the inferior-most portion of the bony external auditory canal. The main trunk bifurcates into the temporo-facial and cervicofacial divisions within the parotid parenchyma, with the cervicofacial division running more superficial within the gland than the temporo-facial division. The five main branches of the facial nerve include the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches. The main branches of the facial nerve have a wide variability as

they course through the parotid parenchyma with variable anastamosis between the branches.

# Surgical Landmarks to Identify the Main Nerve Trunk (MNT) of the Facial Nerve

1. Tympanomastoid suture line (fissure): The tympanomastoid suture line is located between the mastoid and the tympanic bones. The MNT lies  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  distal to the endpoint of this fissure.  
2. Tragal pointer: The MNT lies  $1.0 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  deep and slightly anterior and inferior to the tip of the external ear canal cartilage.  
3. Posterior belly of the digastric muscle: The MNT lies  $1.0\mathrm{cm}$  deep to the medial attachment of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle to the digastric groove (mastoid notch) of the mastoid bone.  
4. Mastoid process: The MNT can be identified in the mastoid bone by mastoidectomy and followed peripherally. This approach is typically reserved for intratympanic or large tumors.

# Procedure: Superficial Parotidectomy

1. Preoperative intravenous antibiotics (e.g., Cefazolin) are initiated pre-incision.  
2. The patient is induced with short-acting paralytics to allow for monitoring of the branches of the facial nerve during dissection. General anesthesia is obtained via endotracheal intubation.  
3. The patient is placed in a supine position, the neck is hyperextended with the placement of a shoulder roll and the head is turned to the opposite side of the involved parotid. The ispilateral eye is lubricated with ophthalmic ointment and is protected with either a corneal shield or a tarsorrhaphy stitch.  
4. A modified-Blair incision is marked with a sterile marking pen, and  $2\%$  lidocaine with epinephrine is injected within the subcutaneous tissues of the proposed surgical incision. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion to allow for direct observation of the ipsilateral muscles of facial expression.  
5. The skin incision begins in the pre-auricular region, extending posteriorly under the lobe of the ear, and retaining an adequate cuff of skin to prevent tethering of the lobule and a pixie-ear deformity. The incision continues for a variable distance posteriorly over the mastoid process. The incision may be extended into the hairline for cosmesis or curved inferiorly and anteriorly within a natural neck crease, allowing for transition into cervical lymphadenectomy if needed (see Figure 60.36 in Case Report 60.6).  
6. An anterior subplatysmal/subsuperficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap is developed using the natural plane on the surface of the parotid gland.

Dissection continues anteriorly within a tissue plane just superficial to the parotid fascia. Numerous filaments of connective tissue pass from the skin to the parotid fascia, which may resemble nervous tissue. The branches of the facial nerve, however, will only be found at the anterior and peripheral extent of the gland. The flap is carried beyond the extent of the tumor to completely expose the parotid fascia anterior to the tissue to be removed (see Figure 60.37 in Case Report 60.6).

7. A posterior skin flap may be developed to free the parotid tissue located posterior to the incision line or when combined with a neck dissection. If needed, the posterior flap is raised at the level of the SCM fascia. The greater auricular nerve branch and the external jugular vein are identified as they traverse the SCM, and the plane of dissection is developed superficial to these structures.  
8. Low-pressure clamps are used to grasp the exposed posterior glandular tissue, and a skin rake is used to retract the tragus in a superior and posterior direction. Scissors or hemostats paralleling the cartilaginous portion of the external auditory canal are used to dissect free the parotid fascia. Multiple small veins may be encountered within this region. Minimizing venous ligation, however, will help to reduce venous congestion to the tissues, which will improve surgical visualization of the gland. Dissection continues to the level of the mastoid process.  
9. The parotid tissue is carefully dissected from the mastoid region, paying special attention as dissection continues inferior to the mastoid tip, because the main nerve trunk (MNT) of the facial nerve is located slightly deep and anterior to this region. A broad front of dissection is now used in the areas of the cartilaginous external auditory ear canal, mastoid tip, and posterior belly of the digastric muscle to progressively separate and free the parotid tissue. The cartilaginous pointer (tragal pointer) may be used to aid in identification of the bifurcation of the facial nerve trunk. Surgical assistants should pay close attention for any facial muscle twitching. Ligation of any bleeding vessels should be delayed until definitive identification of the MNT is achieved.  
10. The MNT will be identified as a  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  diameter shiny white cord-like structure (see Figure 60.38 in Case Report 60.6). Once the temporo-facial and cervicofacial branches are identified, systematic dissection of the overlying parotid tissue is completed from a posterior-to-anterior direction, ensuring instrumentation is parallel to the motor nerve fibers (see Figures 60.39 and 60.40 in Case Report 60.6). Attempts should be made to preserve anastomoses if possible. No long-term facial nerve deficit should result from transaction of these anastomotic fibers as

long as the main nerve branches remain intact and undisturbed.

11. Once the anterior aspect of the gland is reached, Stenson's duct may be identified and ligated. Final release of the anterior aspect of the superficial lobe completes the removal.  
12. Bipolar electrocautery can be used to control hemorrhage. A flat Jackson Pratt (JP) drain to bulb suction is placed through a stab incision within the tissue of the neck. The anterior and posterior flaps are repositioned and closed in layers. For large parotid tumors, a wedge of tissue may be removed to facilitate an aesthetic closure (see Figure 60.41 in Case Report 60.6).

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed for 5 days.  
2. Local wound care is performed with a mixture of half hydrogen peroxide and half sterile saline, triple-antibiotic ointment, and a loose dressing.  
3. Drains are removed between 48 and 72 hours, or when they become nonproductive.  
4. Patients are followed indefinitely for tumor recurrence.

# Complications

1. Facial nerve injury: Facial nerve injury can be minimized by early identification of the main nerve trunk of the facial nerve, appropriate flap plane development, dissection parallel to the anticipated direction of the motor nerve fibers, the use of a nerve stimulator during dissection, and judicious use of cautery. Witnessed transections are repaired primarily.  
2. Gustatory sweating (Frey syndrome): Anomalous (misdirected) innervation of postganglionic parasympathetic salivary nerves with cutaneous sweat glands results in a localized flushing and sweating during mastication and salivation. Treatment involves topical application of antiperspirant, botulinum toxin injection, and the surgical interposition of tissue (e.g., superficial temporal fascia or free fat) or implantable materials between the skin flap and the underlying parotid bed.  
3. Salivary leakage: May lead to the development of a sialocele and/or a salivary fistula. Treatment of sialoceles involves drainage and pressure dressings. Salivary fistulae are treated with local wound revision if lowflow leakage is present. Adjunctive botulinum toxin injections may be used to block the release of acetylcholine from postganglionic parasympathetic fibers and decrease salivary flow. Recalcitrant salivary leakage typically necessitates surgical reexploration.  
4. Ear numbness: Hypoesthesia in the distribution of the greater auricular nerve is common and typically lessens over time.

5. Flap necrosis: Appropriate flap design and adequate flap thickness will minimize distal flap necrosis. Small defects are conservatively managed with standard wound care techniques. Larger defects may require additional surgical intervention to correct.  
6. Tumor recurrence: Often related to the type of tumor excised.

# Key Points

1. Parotid neoplasms include pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Parotid masses typically undergo FNA and MRI to obtain a working diagnosis prior to definitive surgical therapy.  
2. For smaller benign tumors, extracapsular dissection (subtotal parotidectomy) may be preferable to complete removal of the superficial lobe of the parotid.  
3. Total parotidectomy (superficial and deep lobe) indications include a malignant condition within the deep lobe of the parotid, metastasis to parotid lymph nodes, and tumors with underlying bone invasion.

The cartilaginous pointer follows the course of the inferior one-third of the helix of the ear, which points in an anteroinferior direction to the region of the facial nerve bifurcation.  
5. Identification and preservation of the facial nerve are essential for preventing inadvertent facial nerve injury. Careful observation for facial muscle twitching, from light mechanical stimulation or using a handheld nerve stimulator, will elicit muscle contracture.  
6. Dissection directed from a posterior to anterior direction with blunt instrumentation will help minimize nerve damage.  
7. The parotid capsule should be closed after removal of the involved portion of the gland. If closure is not feasible, an interposing tissue or implantable biologic material should be considered between the exposed gland and the skin to prevent postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from cross-innervating facial sweat glands, resulting in gustatory sweating (Frey syndrome).

right main nerve trunk with a large mass confined to the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. FNA was suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. The patient underwent a superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation, and a definitive diagnosis of a pleomorphic adenoma was established (see Figures 60.36 through 60.41).
