# Reduction of Isolated Zygomatic Arch Fractures

Reduction of the zygomatic arch to correct functional and cosmetic deformities.

# Indications

1. Loss of arch projection  
2. Comminuted arch  
3. Entrapment of the coronoid process (limited opening)

# Contraindications

1. Fractures over 20 days old; may require osteotomy  
2. Minimally displaced fractures with no symptoms  
3. Elderly and medically compromised patients

# Quinn Approach to the Arch

1. The procedure may be performed with local anesthetic alone, intravenous (IV) sedation, or general anesthesia.  
2. Local anesthetic is infiltrated within the tissue overlying the lateral ascending ramus and coronoid process.  
3. A #15 blade or electrocautery is used to initiate a  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  intraoral vestibular incision overlying the ascending ramus. Layers transected include mucosa, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and periosteum.  
4. A periosteal elevator is used to elevate in a subperiosteal plane along the lateral aspect of the vertical ascending ramus and coronoid process.  
5. Through the intraoral incision, an instrument (Seldin retractor, urethral sound, and Henahan retractor) is placed between the coronoid process and the zygomatic arch.  
6. Lateral pressure is applied to the arch until the medially displaced arch is reduced (see Figure 19.1).  
7. The oral mucosa is closed with resorbable sutures.

8. An external splint (tongue blade, finger splint, or metal eye patches) may be fixated to the arch if desired.

# Gillies Approach to the Arch

1. Preoperative antibiotics are used to cover contamination from skin or scalp flora. Preoperative steroids are administered to decrease postoperative soft tissue edema. General anesthesia is recommended.  
2. The patient is placed supine and rotated within a Mayfield headrest.  
3. After prepping and draping, the hair is parted, and a sterile marking pen is used to draw a  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal temporal line  $3\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the anterior temporal crest.  
4. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected into the overlying tissue to aid in hemostasis.  
5. A skin incision is initiated with a #10 blade to the level of the temporoparietal fascia (superficial temporal fascia). A periosteal elevator or a Henahan retractor is used to dissect through the temporoparietal fascia to the glistening white temporalis fascia (deep temporal fascia) overlying the temporalis muscle.  
6. A horizontal incision is made through the temporalis fascia, and the temporalis muscle is exposed.  
7. Either a Rowe zygomatic elevator or a urethral sound is inserted between the temporalis muscle medially and the temporalis fascia laterally (see Figure 19.2) until it reaches the medial aspect of the zygomatic arch.  
8. Lateral pressure is applied to the arch until the medially displaced arch is reduced (see Figure 19.3).  
9. The incision is closed in a layer fashion.  
10. An external splint (tongue blade, finger splint, and metal eye patch) may be fixated to the arch if desired.

# Contraindications

1. Fractures over 20 days old: may require osteotomy  
2. Minimally displaced fractures with no symptoms  
3. Blindness or open globe injury to the contralateral eye  
4. Traumatic hyphema; surgery typically delayed until hyphema resolves  
5. Elderly and medically compromised patients

# Anatomy

The frontal branch of the facial nerve provides motor innervation to the frontalis, corrugators, and procerus and often to a portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Damage to the frontal branch results in the inability to raise the affected eyebrow or wrinkle the affected forehead. The path of the frontal branch can be identified by drawing a line from the tragus to a point  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$  cephalic to the bony superolateral orbital rim. The frontal branch lies within or just deep to the temporoparietal fascia (superficial temporal fascia) and is in close proximity to the periosteum overlying the zygomatic arch (see

# Reduction of Zygomaticomaxillary Complex Fractures

Reduction of the bones of the zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) to re-establish facial projection, orbital volume, and aesthetics.

# Indications

1. Limited opening (trismus)  
2. Flattening of the malar eminence  
3. Flattening of the zygomatic arch

Figure 19.4). The frontal branch is often depicted as being contained within a box  $0.8 - 3.5\mathrm{cm}$  (average  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$ ) anterior to the anterior extent of the external auditory canal.

# Combined Maxillary Vestibular, Lateral Brow, and Transconjunctival Approach

1. Preoperative antibiotics are used to cover contamination from sinus flora.  
2. The patient is placed supine within a Mayfield headrest. Ophthalmic ointment and corneal shields are placed bilaterally.  
3. After prepping and draping, local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is infiltrated within the tissue overlying the zygomaticofrontal suture, the zygomaticomaxillary suture, and the inferior orbital rim from a transconjunctival approach.  
4. Maxillary vestibular incision: A #15 blade or electrocautery is used to initiate the intraoral maxillary vestibular incision (see Figure 19.5 in Case Report 19.1). Layers transected include mucosa, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and periosteum. A

periosteal elevator is used to expose the maxilla from the pterygoid plates laterally and to the pyriform aperture medially. Dissection proceeds cephalically and may include the inferior orbital rim if necessary.

5. Lateral brow incision: Palpation over the lateral bony rim will reveal the zygomaticofrontal suture and fracture. An incision with either a blade or a needle-tip Bovie is concealed within the hair bearing portion of the lateral eyebrow and is carried down to periosteum (see Figure 19.6 in Case Report 19.1). Periosteal dissection continues along the lateral orbital rim and may be connected to the transconjunctival incision if desired, thus allowing access to the entire inferior and lateral orbital rim (see Figure 19.8 in Case Report 19.1). Alternatively, in females with a high arching lateral brow, a superior blepharoplasty incision may be used.  
6. Transconjunctival incision: A Bame or Desmarres retractor is placed to evert the lower lid, and a Jaeger or malleable retractor is used to place gentle posterior pressure on the globe itself. A blade is used to create a mucosal incision  $2\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the orbital septum and lateral to the medial puncta. A malleable retractor is used to retract the orbital fat as the orbital rim is approached. Care is taken to avoid damage to the inferior oblique muscle, which is located between the middle and nasal fat pads. Damage to this structure will result in diplopia and restricted ocular motility.  
7. Additional medial orbital wall exposure can be obtained by using a transcaruncular incision. A #15 blade is used to extend the original incision along the entire medial aspect of the orbital rim posterior to the inferior and superior puncta and canilicular system.  
8. Exposure of the entire lateral orbital wall can be obtained with a lateral canthotomy. Stevens scissors are inserted within the palpebral fissure deep to the conjunctiva of the lateral-inferior orbital rim. Layers transected include the skin, subcutaneous tissue, orbicularis oculi muscle, orbital septum, inferior limb of the lateral canthal tendon, and conjunctiva.  
9. With exposure of the fracture sites, fracture reduction is performed. For grossly displaced fractures or for fractures that are difficult to align, a Carroll-Girard screw can be inserted transorally or transcutaneously to engage the malar eminence. The Carroll-Girard screw provides excellent three-dimensional control over the fractured ZMC and aids in the manipulation and reduction of the ZMC fractures.  
10. Prior to any plating, the reduced fractures are all visualized to ensure ideal reduction. The zygomaticosphe-noid suture should be evaluated along the internal

surface of the lateral orbital wall to ensure appropriate fracture reduction prior to employing rigid internal fixation.

11. Displaced ZMC fractures are typically plated in the following sequence: the zygomaticofrontal suture (see Figure 19.8 in Case Report 19.1), the comminuted zygoma and/or zygomaticotemporal suture, the zygomaticomaxillary suture (see Figure 19.7 in Case Report 19.1), the orbital rim, and lastly the orbital floor-medial orbital wall (see Figure 19.9 in Case Report 19.1). Plating sequence variations exist dependent on individual surgeon preferences and the nature/displacement of the fractures.  
12. Following fracture plating, extraocular muscle function is evaluated for entrapment while the patient is under general anesthesia with a forced duction test. If any restrictions in extraocular mobility are detected, the fixation points should be re-evaluated and adjustments made accordingly.  
13. All incisions are irrigated and closed in layers, and appropriate topical antibiotics and dressings are placed.  
14. If a lateral canthotomy was performed, the inferior limb of the lateral canthus is reapproximated, and a meticulous closure of the orbicularis oculi and skin follows. No sutures are required in closing the transconjunctival incision.

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients are admitted for 24 hours following ZMC fracture repair in order to evaluate for retrobulbar hematoma formation following surgery.  
2. Pain is controlled with either IV or oral analgesics depending on the discourse of the patient.  
3. IV or oral antibiotics are utilized postoperatively.  
4. Nasal decongestants and sinus precautions are recommended.

# Hemicoronal Approach to the Arch

1. Preoperative antibiotics are used to cover contamination from skin and scalp flora. Preoperative steroids are administered to decrease postoperative soft tissue edema.  
2. The patient is placed supine within a Mayfield headrest, and a linear band of hair is either shaved or parted in the area of the proposed scalp incision. Ophthalmic ointment and corneal shields are placed.  
3. After prepping and draping, either a coronal or a hemicoronal approach is utilized to approach the arch. The scalp and preauricular incision are marked with a sterile marking pen or a 10-gauge needle. Crosshatches can be made with a sterile marking pen

or needle to aid in exact reapproximation on closing.

4. A mixture of local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected within the subgaleal plane to aid in hemostasis and for hydro-dissection of the tissue (see Figure 19.11 in Case Report 19.2).  
5. The skin incision is initiated with a #10 blade and is placed  $3 - 5\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the patient's hairline (see Figure 19.12 in Case Report 19.2). The incision either terminates in the midline with a curved anterior release (hemicoronal) or continues to the contralateral side (coronal). A scalloped or stair-stepped incision may be performed in order to break up a potential scar.  
6. The scalp incision initially transverses the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and galea. For hemostasis, either Raney clips or a needle-tipped Bovie is utilized. If a full coronal incision is required, it is best to perform the dissection one side at a time in order to minimize blood loss.  
7. Blunt dissection begins cephalically within the subgaleal loose areolar connective tissue layer while preserving the attachment of the pericranium to the skull. The dissection proceeds laterally until the superior temporal line (the attachment of the temporalis fascia) is reached.  
8. A tunnel is created with either a periosteal elevator or a Henahan retractor from the superior temporal line to the zygomatic arch. The tunnel is deep to the temporoparietal fascia (superficial temporal fascia) and superficial to the temporalis fascia (deep temporal fascia).  
9. A Kelley hemostat is inserted within the tissue tunnel directly superficial to the glistening white temporalis fascia (see Figure 19.13 in Case Report 19.2). A #10 blade or needle-tip Bowie is used to cut through the remaining scalp directly over the top of the Kelley clamp. Dissection proceeds inferiorly, superficial to the temporalis fascia (see Figures 19.14 through 19.17 in Case Report 19.2).  
10. As the arch is approached, the temporalis fascia will divide into superficial and deep layers. The temporal fat pad will be visualized between the two layers (see Figure 19.18 in Case Report 19.2). The frontal branch of the facial nerve is located within or along the deep surface of the temporoparietal fascia. In order to avoid damage to the frontal branch, the arch is approached deep to the temporoparietal fascia.  
11. The arch may be approached in one of two ways (see Figure 19.4). The first approach is referred to as a subfascial approach. This approach involves transecting the superficial layer of the temporalis fascia and dissecting superficial to the temporal fat pad until the superior aspect of the arch is reached. The second

approach is referred to as a deep subfascial approach. It involves a dissection deep to the deep layer of the temporalis fascia directly overlying the temporalis muscle until the medial aspect of the arch is reached (see Figure 19.19 in Case Report 19.2).

12. In order to adequately expose the arch, inferior extension of the preauricular incision is often necessary. By keeping the caudal extent of the preauricular incision within  $0.8\mathrm{cm}$  from the external auditory canal, the frontal branch is avoided. At the level of the arch, a subperiosteal dissection proceeds anteriorly in order to expose the length of the entire zygomatic arch and lateral orbital rim (see Figures 19.20 through 19.22 in Case Report 19.2).  
13. A Seldin retractor is used to reduce the arch fracture. Plate fixation is utilized to maintain the arch position (see Figure 19.23 in Case Report 19.2).  
14. If additional displaced fractures are present, additional surgical access can be created with extending the dissection to include the upper midface or orbit and by utilizing additional approaches (see Figures 19.24 through 19.26 in Case Report 19.2).  
15. After adequate fracture reduction, all sites are irrigated and closed in a layer fashion with a drain placed superficial to the temporalis fascia.

# Postoperative Management

1. A pressure dressing is applied if a hemicoronal or coronal approach is utilized.  
2. Pain is controlled with either IV or oral analgesics depending on the discourse of the patient.  
3. IV or oral antibiotics are utilized postoperatively.  
4. If placed, the drain is removed at postoperative day 3 or when output is minimal.

# Complications

1. Subcutaneous hematoma or seroma formation: Minimized with meticulous closure, elimination of dead space, and pressure dressing. If large, will require drainage and drain placement.  
2. Infection: Minimized with attention to sterile technique, adequate fracture reduction, postoperative antibiotics, and smoking cessation.  
3. Enophthalmus: Restoring the original orbital volume is necessary to prevent postoperative enophthalmus. Postreduction enophthalmus is caused by an increase in orbital volume from inadequate fracture reduction or from an undiagnosed medial orbital wall or orbital floor fracture.  
4. Diplopia: Commonly with upward and downward gaze. Usually a result of post-traumatic edema, hematoma formation, muscle contusion, and/or neurogenic causes that typically improves 5-10 days post injury. Diplopia caused by muscular entrapment or

that does not resolve in 14 days requires exploration and reduction of herniated orbital tissues.

5. Dystopia: Inferior globe displacement caused by inadequate reduction of the orbital floor.  
6. Traumatic hyphema: Bleeding into the anterior chamber of the globe from a ruptured iris or ciliary body vessel. Treatment options include eye protection (rigid shield and eye patch), activity restriction, topical cycloplegics (atropine or scopolamine), systemic or topical corticosteroids, antifibrinolytic agents, analgesics, antiglaucoma medications, beta blockers, and the avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Surgical intervention is rarely indicated.  
7. Retinal detachment: Symptoms include flashing lights and a field loss described as a curtain or window shade coming over the eye. Urgent surgery is required.  
8. Traumatic optic neuropathy or vascular compromise: Ranges from mild decrease in visual acuity to loss of vision, diminished color vision, and a relative afferent papillary defect. Due to damage of the optic nerve or central retinal artery.  
9. Superior orbital fissure (SOF) syndrome: The contents of the SOF include cranial nerves (CN) III, IV, V1 (the lacrimal, frontal, and nasociliary branches), and VI, and the superior and inferior divisions of the ophthalmic veins. SOF syndrome occurs when hematoma, edema, or displaced fractures compress the contents of the SOF. Symptoms include ptosis (CN III), ophthalmoplegia (weakness of the extraocular muscles from CN III, IV, and VI, often resulting in diplopia), retro-orbital pain, forehead anesthesia (V1), and a fixed dilated pupil (CN III). SOF syndrome is both an indication for open reduction of a ZMC fracture and a potential complication of ZMC reduction. Complete resolution of symptoms often occur after reduction of ZMC fractures; if not, then exploration of the posterior orbital cone is warranted.  
10. Orbital apex syndrome: Orbital apex syndrome results from fractures that extend through the SOF and the optic canal. Involved structures include CN II, III, IV, V1, and VI. Symptoms include SOF syndrome and loss of visual acuity. Treatment is controversial and involves observation alone, high-dose steroids, optic nerve decompression, or a combination of these treatment modalities.  
11. Retrobulbar hematoma: Caused by hematoma formation with resultant disruption of the retinal circulation which can lead to irreversible ischemia and permanent blindness. Essentially a compartment syndrome with compression of the central retinal artery, which causes ischemia of the optic nerve. Symptoms include severe posterior orbital pain,

globe induration, excessive tension on the eyelids, decreased ocular movement, and decreased visual acuity. Treatment includes orbital decompression with an emergent lateral canthotomy, disinsertion of the orbital septum along the lower lid, evacuation of hematoma, and placement of a drain for 48 hours.

12. Trismus: Early trismus results from ZMC fractures that impinge the coronoid process. Late trismus occurs secondarily to fibrous or bony ankylosis of the coronoid process to the arch. Postoperative fibrous or bony ankylosis may be minimized by performing a coronoidectomy at the time of surgical intervention for combined comminuted ZMC fractures and coronoid process fractures (Figures 19.30, 19.31, and 19.32, Case Report 19.3).  
13. Cosmetic deformity: Cosmetic deformities present as a flattening or concavity of the malar region and/or lateral and inferior orbital rims when ZMC fractures are inappropriately reduced, particularly when viewed from a worm's-eye view. Cosmetic deformities also result from over- or undercorrection of the zygomatic arch.  
14. Facial paralysis: Damage to the frontal branch of the facial nerve can occur due to significant fracture displacement or during exposure of fractures. Partial paralysis of the frontal branch is treated with observation, and total paralysis is treated with contralateral botox to mask the deinnervation of the frontalis, procerus, and corrugators.

# Key Points

1. Patients with ZMC and orbital fractures should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist prior to surgical intervention for a complete ocular workup and appropriate documentation.  
2. All ZMC fractures have an orbital rim component and many have concomitant displaced orbital floor and/or medial wall fractures.  
3. Appropriate treatment includes selecting surgical approaches that maximize direct visualization of the fractured ZMC components, minimize morbidity, allow for complete mobilization of the ZMC, and permit rigid internal fixation with fracture immobility.  
4. When treating comminuted or significantly displaced ZMC fractures and concomitant panfacial fractures, a coronal approach is suggested. A coronal approach allows the operator exposure to bilateral ZMCS, supraorbital rims, medial orbital rims, lateral orbital rims, nasal bones, and the frontal sinus and will allow for transnasal wiring if indicated. For unilateral comminuted ZMC

fractures, a hemicoronal approach is often utilized in combination with transconjunctival and intraoral incisions.

5. Approaching the zygomatic arch in a tissue plane deep to the temporoparietal fascia (superficial temporal fascia) is key to preventing damage to the frontal branch of the facial nerve.  
6. A Carroll-Girard screw allows for excellent stabilization and manipulation of the fractured ZMC during plating.  
7. The key suture in evaluating the reduction of ZMC fractures is the zygomaticosphenoid suture. The zygomaticosphenoid suture should be evaluated along the internal surface of the lateral orbital wall to ensure appropriate fracture reduction prior to employing rigid internal fixation.  
8. ZMC fractures may present with lateral subconjunctival hemorrhage in the shape of a triangle. This is due to the direct oxidation of the red blood cells within the ultrathin subconjuctiva.  
9. Signs of ZMC fractures may include intraoral canine fossa pain, intraoral ecchymosis, and trismus.  
10. Subciliary and subtarsal incisions have a higher rate of entropion and increased scleral show compared to transconjunctival incisions.  
11. Evaluation of the extraocular muscles can be performed with finger tracking. If a restricted range of motion is detected, topical anesthesia is placed within the eye and a forced duction test is performed by grasping the insertion of the rectus muscles at two simultaneous points with two pairs of Adson forceps. The rectus muscles are grasped  $7\mathrm{mm}$  from the limbus, and the globe is manipulated in all directions. A positive forced duction test demonstrates muscular entrapment. A negative forced duction test with restricted extraocular movement indicates muscular hematoma, muscular contusion, or neurogenic causes of muscle paralysis.

Case Report 19.3. Complication. Ankylosis. A 24-year-old presents 8 weeks status post a gunshot wound to the right cheek. The patient sustained a grossly displaced ZMC fracture, a comminuted right posterior maxilla, and a medially displaced coronoid process fracture. The patient was treated at another facility without surgical intervention. The patient subsequently developed ankylosis of the right infratemporal fossa and exhibited a maximum vertical opening of  $1\mathrm{cm}$ . This case illustrates the importance of early surgical intervention, appropriate fracture reduction, and early and aggressive physical therapy. The author routinely performs coronoidectomies in situations where both the coronoid process and the ZMC are fractured and displaced (see Figures 19.30 through 19.32).
