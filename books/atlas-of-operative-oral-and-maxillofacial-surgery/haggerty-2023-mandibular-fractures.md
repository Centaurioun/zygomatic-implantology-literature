# Surgical Management of Anterior Mandibular Fractures (Symphysis and Parasymphysis)

# Indications for Open Reduction of Anterior Mandibular Fractures

1. When closed reduction will not adequately reduce fractures  
2. When the fixation of anterior mandibular fractures will allow for alignment of other fractures (condyle or angle fracture)  
3. In order to allow for early mobilization of condylar fractures  
4. Patients who cannot tolerate maxillomandibular fixation (MMF)

See Figure 17.1 for a comparison of regions of dentate mandible fractures.

# Contraindications for Open Reduction of Anterior Mandibular Fractures

1. Fractures that can be reduced with MMF alone

# Intraoral Surgical Approach and Open Reduction of the Anterior Mandible

1. The patient is nasally intubated to allow for the placement of MMF. The endotracheal tube is secured, a throat packing is placed, and the patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
2. Maxillary and mandibular Erich arch bars are adapted and secured in place with either 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel circumdental wires placed below the cingulums of the dentition from first molar to first molar or Hybrid MMF may be utilized. If Erich arch bars are placed, the incisors may be linked together or abstained if sufficient occlusion results without their incorporation into the arch bars.  
3. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected within the anterior mandibular vestibule to include the mentalis muscle.  
4. A mucosal incision is created with sharp scissors, cautery, or a blade (see Figure 17.4 in Case Report 17.1). The mucosal incision is created parallel to the attached

gingiva and approximately  $15\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the attached gingiva.

5. The mentalis muscle and periosteum are transversed between the canines with sharp scissors, cautery, or a blade.  
6. The mental foramen and nerves are identified with blunt dissection with a fine hemostat within the premolar region. Care is taken to spread the hemostat tines parallel to the anticipated course of the mental nerve. Alternatively, a periosteal elevator can be used to dissect in a subperiosteal plane posterior to the original dissection to locate the mental foramen. Once the mental nerves have been identified, they are dissected free from their surrounding tissue and retracted from the operating site with gentle superior traction.  
7. The fracture is aligned with a periosteal elevator, and the patient is placed into MMF with 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires and/or heavy elastics. If necessary, the fracture can be temporarily reduced with bone reducing forceps (see Figure 17.6, Case Report 17.1), a 24-gauge intraosseous wire, or a small bone plate.  
8. The well-reduced fracture is internally fixated with lag screws, tension plates, or a combination of the two. Care is taken to ensure that the fixation plates and screws are placed at a safe distance from the apices of the teeth, the inferior alveolar nerve, and the mental foramen.  
9. Once internal fixation is applied, the bone-reducing forceps (if utilized) are removed, MMF wires and elastics are removed, and the occlusion is verified.  
10. Any changes in the patient's occlusion should be addressed by removing the fixation, identifying areas of interference, and refixation of the mandible.  
11. Once the ideal pretrauma occlusion has been verified, the incision site is irrigated and closed in a layered fashion.

# Postoperative Management

1. A supportive dressing may be applied to the chin and submental area to provide superior support of the mentalis muscle and to act as a pressure dressing.  
2. Arch bar removal and functioning are based on the surgeon's preferences, the degree of fixation, patient compliance, and the management or fixation of more proximal fractures of the mandible.

# Complications

1. Ptotic chin (witch's chin): From inadequate closure of the mentalis muscle  
2. Lip perforation: From inadvertent perforation of the anterior lip during dissection to the inferior border of the anterior mandible. Minimized by placing the nondominant hand on the outer surface of the lip to detect the level of dissection.

# Key Points

1. Hybrid MMF placement may decrease the overall time to place MMF, especially with inexperienced surgeons. Hybrid MMF disadvantages include possible damage to teeth roots from fixation screws, gingival inflammation from arch bar placement (also a concern with Erich arch bars), and difficulties with reduction with multiple and grossly comminuted fractures.  
2. By placing the mucosal incision  $15\mathrm{mm}$  of more lateral (buccal) from the attached gingiva, it will permit a sufficient mucosal edge for easy closure, especially in the area of the arch bar.  
3. Initial dissection should not extend beyond the canines until the location of the mental foramen and mental nerves have been verified.  
4. Appropriate closure of the mentalis muscle can prevent the formation of a ptotic chin (witch's chin), asymmetrical muscle contraction, or dimple formation from placing the deep sutures too superficially.  
5. If other mandibular fractures are present (body, angle, and/or condyle), the anterior mandible fractures are typically fixated first.  
6. The final step prior to closing any mandible fracture is the verification of the patient's occlusion.

# Procedure: Lag Screw Fixation

A form of compression osteosynthesis commonly utilized in the symphysis and parasymphysis region

# S

1. Linear mandibular fractures  
2. Fractures within the symphysis and parasymphysis region (although lag screws can be placed in other locations)

# Contraindications

1. Oblique fractures  
2. Comminuted fractures  
3. Atrophic, edentulous mandibular fractures  
4. Patients with diminished or poor bone quality

# Technique

1. Maxillary and mandibular arch bars are placed, and the anterior mandible is exposed from an intraoral approach (see Figure 17.5 in Case Report 17.1).  
2. The anterior mandibular fracture is aligned and reduced with a periosteal elevator and MMF is applied with 24- or 26-gauge wires and/or heavy elastics.  
3. Bone reduction forceps may be placed within an area that will not interfere with the placement of the lag screws (see Figure 17.6 in Case Report 17.1).  
4. A gliding osteotomy is created. A  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  drill bit is oriented so that a  $30 - 45\mathrm{mm}$  screw may be placed perpendicular to the linear fracture. The  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  drill bit is then drilled to the fracture site (see Figure 17.7 in Case Report 17.1).  
5. A traction osteotomy is created. A drill sleeve is inserted that enters the previous drill site (gliding osteotomy). A  $1.8\mathrm{mm}$  drill bit is utilized to drill distal to the fracture until it exits the cortical bone perpendicular to the linear fracture (see Figure 17.8 in Case Report 17.1).  
6. The gliding osteotomy is countersunk, and the depth of the osteotomy is measured.  
7. An appropriate-length screw is placed through the gliding osteotomy, and the traction osteotomy is engaged.  
8. As the traction osteotomy is engaged with the lag screw, the fracture site will further compress and reduce (see Figure 17.9 in Case Report 17.1). If the lag screw does not engage the traction osteotomy ideally, the fracture will become displaced as the lag screw is tightened.  
9. An adjacent lag screw is placed in a similar fashion. The second lag screw may course either in the same direction or in the opposite direction (see Figure 17.10 in Case Report 17.1) of the first lag screw.  
10. MMF is removed, and the occlusion is verified prior to closing of the incision in a layered fashion.

# Key Points

1. Lag screw fixation has a lower incidence of infection and wound dehiscence when compared to plate fixation.

2. When drilling the traction osteotomy, make sure to keep the  $1.8\mathrm{mm}$  drill bit as perpendicular as possible to avoid flexing and fracture of the drill bit and to allow for compression perpendicular to the fracture.  
3. After the placement of lag screw fixation, it is important to exam the lingual aspect of the anterior mandible to ensure that the lingual plate is not splayed. This can be performed by a combination of a conservative dissection of the lingual plate from the inferior border of the mandible and/or by running a finger along the lingual plate after MMF has been removed.  
4. Fracture selection is paramount in lag screw placement. Ideal fractures include noncomminuted, linear fractures in dentate patients.

# Surgical Management of Posterior Mandibular Fractures (Body and Angle)

# Indication for Open Reduction of Posterior Mandibular Fractures

1. Unfavorable fractures  
2. Displaced fractures that cannot be adequately reduced with closed reduction alone  
3. Flail jaw  
4. Contralateral condyle fractures that require early mobilization  
5. Patients who cannot tolerate closed reduction  
6. Infected fractures  
7. Open fractures  
8. Patients with other facial fractures that will require using the mandible as a base or starting point for establishing the vertical and anterior-posterior dimensions of the midface

# Contraindications for Open Reduction of Posterior Mandibular Fractures

1. Favorable fractures well reduced with MMF alone  
2. When damage to the neurovascular bundle is imminent  
3. Grossly comminuted fractures with bone segments too small to fixate  
4. Patients with significant comorbidities (e.g., elderly, previous head and neck radiation)

# Submandibular Approach Layers

1. Skin  
2. Subcutaneous tissue  
3. Platysma muscle  
4. Superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia (SDCF)  
5. Pterygomasseteric sling  
6. Periosteum  
7. Mandible

# Anatomy

Platysma muscle: Paired muscle that originates from the superficial fascia of the pectoral and deltoid muscles and runs obliquely to insert at the corner of the mouth and inferior portion of the cheek.

Superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia (SDCF): Located just deep to the platysma muscle. This fascial layer encircles the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and the trapezius muscle. The SDCF forms the capsule overlying the submandibular gland. The SDCF contains the facial artery, the facial vein, the node of Stahr, and the marginal mandibular and cervical branches of the facial nerve.

Submandibular gland: Located between the anterior and the posterior bellies of the digastric muscle.

Node of Stahr (submandibular lymph node): Typically encountered in the area of the premasseteric notch. Serves as a warning for the location of the facial artery and vein, which lie just anterior to the node of Stahr.

Marginal mandibular nerve: Located above the inferior border of the mandible (80%) or within 2 cm below the inferior border (20%). Lies deep of the platysma muscle along its entire course, but becomes more superficial 2 cm lateral to the corner of the mouth. Damage to the marginal mandibular nerve results in paralysis of the depressors of the corner of the mouth (depressor labii inferioris, depressor anguli oris, inferior fibers of the orbicularis oris, and the mentalis).

Cervical nerve: Located inferior to the marginal mandibular nerve and deep to the platysma muscle. Damage to the cervical nerve results in paralysis of the depressor anguli oris and of the platysma muscle.

# Intraoral Surgical Approach and Open Reduction of the Posterior Mandible

1. The patient is nasally intubated, the endotracheal tube is secured, a throat pack is placed, and the patient is prepped and draped.  
2. Maxillary and mandibular arch bars are placed.  
3. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected within the area of the proposed intraoral incision.  
4. A bite block is placed on the contralateral side of the posterior mandibular fracture.  
5. A #15 blade or needle-tip cautery is used to create an incision through mucosa parallel to the mucogingival line. The incision is placed at least  $15\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the mucogingival line in order to allow for uncomplicated closure of the intraoral incision.  
6. After mucosal incision, the #15 blade or cautery tip is directed toward the underlying mandible. The submucosa, muscle, and periosteum are sharply transected.

7. A periosteal elevator is used to dissect within a subperiosteal plane posterior to the sigmoid notch and anteriorly as far as needed. Attention to the location of the mental foramen and mental nerve is key as the dissection proceeds anteriorly.  
8. The proximal and distal segments of the fracture are aligned with a periosteal elevator, and the patient is placed into MMF with either 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires and/or heavy elastics. If a posterior tooth is located within the line of fracture and if it will not serve as an occlusal reference, it is removed at this time (see Figure 17.13 in Case Report 17.2).  
9. If a trocar is indicated, a local anesthesia needle is inserted through the cheek at the desired location of the intraoral trocar site (see Figure 17.14 in Case Report 17.2). A #15 blade is used to make a skin incision approximately  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  in length and parallel to the anticipated direction of the facial nerve. The trocar is bluntly inserted from the extraoral incision into the oral cavity (see Figure 17.15 in Case Report 17.2).  
10. After fixation of the fracture (see Figure 17.16 in Case Report 17.2 and Figure 17.19 in Case Report 17.3), a curved periosteal elevator is run along the inferior border of the mandible to assess for proper alignment. For angle fractures, a periosteal elevator is also used to evaluate the superior aspect of the lingual plate of the mandible to ensure ideal fracture reduction.  
11. The patient is removed from MMF, and the occlusion is verified.  
12. After occlusal verification, the intraoral incision is closed with interrupted or continuous 4-0 chromic or Vicryl sutures. If a trocar incision was created, it is closed with 5-0 interrupted plain gut sutures.

# Submandibular Approach and Open Reduction of the Posterior Mandible

1. The patient is nasally intubated, the endotracheal tube is secured, and maxillary and mandibular arch bars are placed. Short-acting paralytics are used in order to allow for testing of the facial nerve.  
2. The patient is prepped and draped. A sterile marking pen is used to mark the site of the proposed skin incision (see Figure 17.25 in Case Report 17.5).  
3. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected within the subcutaneous tissue superficial to the platysma muscle. If local anesthetic is deposited below the platysma muscle, it may paralyze the cervical and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve. Alternatively, injection deep to the platysma may be performed with a vasoconstrictor without local anesthetic. Seven to ten minutes are allowed prior to incision for the ideal hemostatic properties of the vasoconstrictor.

4. The skin incision is placed at least  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible within a neck crease or parallel to a neck crease. The incision should allow for direct visualization of the fracture and may extend posteriorly to the mastoid region and anteriorly as far as is needed. The initial incision is carried through skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle only.  
5. The subcutaneous layer is undermined in all directions with a hemostat in order to facilitate a tension-free closure at the end of the procedure.  
6. Deep to the platysma muscle is the SDCF (see Figure 17.26 in Case Report 17.5). The SDCF can be exposed by utilizing a  $4 \times 4$  gauze and digital pressure once the platysma muscle is transected. The marginal mandibular and cervical branches of the facial nerve are located within or just deep to the SDCF.  
7. A nerve stimulator is set on 2 milliamperes (mA) and tested. Blunt dissection through the SDCF is performed with a pair of fine hemostats and a nerve stimulator.  
8. The submandibular gland is identified. The SDCF forms the investing fascia of the submandibular gland (see Figure 17.27 in Case Report 17.5). The submandibular gland is retracted inferiorly. The node of Stahr may be encountered within the area of the premasseteric notch and retracted superiorly. The node of Stahr acts as a warning for the proximity of the facial artery.  
9. Dissection continues cephalically after developing a plane of dissection deep to the SDCF. The pterygomasseteric sling is encountered and is divided at its avascular plane at the inferior border of the angle of the mandible where the masseter and medial pterygoid muscle intersect.  
10. The periosteum is incised, and the lateral aspect of the mandible is exposed in a subperiosteal plane (see Figure 17.28 in Case Report 17.5).  
11. After fixation of the posterior mandibular fracture (See Figure 17.30 in Case Report 17.5) and verifying occlusion, closure is performed in the following fashion: the pterygomasseteric sling is tightly approximated with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures, the platysma muscle is closed with 3-0 interrupted or continuous Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue is closed with interrupted or continuous 4-0 monofilamentous sutures, and the skin is approximated with either steri-strips or 5-0 plain gut sutures (see Figure 17.31 in Case Report 17.5).

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients are placed into MMF using either stainless steel wires or heavy elastics. The duration of MMF is dependent on the degree of fixation, patient

compliance, medical issues (e.g., malnourishment, seizures, or mental handicap), patient age, and other associated fractures (e.g., condyle fractures require earlier mobilization).

2. Elastics may be used to place the patient into heavy MMF or to act as guiding elastics to allow for early limited functioning and muscle reprogramming. Light or guiding elastics are typically reserved for patients with rigid fixation, younger patients, patients with medical issues contraindicating prolonged MMF, and patients with associated condyle fractures.  
3. Pressure dressings are applied based on the surgeon's preference.  
4. Appropriate analgesic and antibiotic coverage are warranted for the first 7 days after surgery. Scopolamine transdermal anti-nausea patches are prescribed for patients in MMF. Nutrition consultation is recommended for all patients discharged with MMF for periods more than 2 weeks.  
5. Ice is applied to the fracture site for the first 24 hours.  
6. Patients with any form of MMF are discharged with either wire cutters or scissors.  
7. Patients are followed at 1 week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after surgery.  
8. Arch bars are typically removed after 4-6 weeks based on patient exam (occlusion and maximum vertical opening), fixation technique, and compliance.

# Complications

1. Malocclusion: Caused by failure to appropriately reduce fractures, displaced condyle fractures, inappropriate fixation, or fixation failure. Minor occlusal discrepancies can be corrected with guiding elastic (early) or orthodontics (late). Severe occlusal discrepancies are best treated with reoperation (early) or mandibular osteotomy (late).  
2. Damage to tooth roots: Caused by placing fixation screws near adjacent teeth roots. Can be minimized by positioning bone reduction plates along the inferior border of the mandible, using monocortical screws, using drills with  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  stops, and placing screws at a minimum of  $12\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of posterior teeth.  
3. Hypoesthesia: May be caused from damage to the mental nerve during fracture exposure or from damage to the inferior alveolar nerve during screw placement. Bicortical screws should only be placed caudal to the mandibular canal. Monocortical screws should be placed along the lateral border of the mandible cephalic to the mandibular canal (see Figure 17.102 in Case Report 17.13).  
4. Facial paralysis: Typically occurs from stretching or transection of the marginal mandibular or cervical

nerves during external approaches to the posterior mandible.

5. Infection: Infections typically present in the form of wound dehiscence or abscess formation. Infections occur from a variety of reasons. Infections involving hardware should be treated with hardware removal, gross debridement of all nonvital bone and granulation tissue, a period of MMF, and antibiotics. Continuity defects are best treated with grafting procedures after the infection has resolved. Infections can also occur in the areas of teeth left within the line of fracture or from the exposure of the lateral ramus and tooth #17 in the line of fracture. (typically third molars). Infections originating from teeth within the line of fracture are treated with tooth extraction, surgical debridement of nonvital bone and granulation tissue, and the use of antibiotics. Infections originating from extraction sites are also treated with the removal of nonvital bone and granulation tissue and the use of antibiotics. A short period of MMF is suggested with moderate to severe infections or with fracture mobility.  
6. Wound dehiscence: Frequently caused by infection, hardware exposure, or smoking abuse (see Figure 17.11). Dehiscences caused by smoking, unfavorable muscle pull, or poor incision designs are initially managed conservatively with wound care, oral rinses, and smoking cessation (if applicable). Hardware exposure is initially treated with oral antibiotics and debridement of the site. Areas of hardware exposure that fail to heal after conservative management or areas with fractured or loose hardware require hardware removal.  
7. Pseudoarthrosis (nonunion) or fibrous union: Typically occur from infection or mobility of the fractured segments. Sources include hardware failure, nonrigid fixation, noncompliance with soft diet or MMF, and underlying medical conditions (diabetes, substance abuse, cigarette abuse, reduced immune system, etc.).  
8. Malunion: Occurs from inadequate fracture reduction, patient noncompliance, and torsional forces when treating multiple fractures.  
9. Hardware failure: Hardware fracture can be caused by repeated bending of the plate by the novice surgeon prior to rigid fixation. Loosening of screws is typically caused by improper drilling techniques (see Figure 17.24). Such techniques involve insufficient irrigation, not placing fixation screws perpendicular to the bone reduction plate, and insufficient bone contact when using shorter  $4\mathrm{mm}$  screws. Hardware fracture can also occur from patient noncompliance and additional trauma (see Case Report 14.3). All failed hardware should be removed, the site debrided, and additional hardware is placed unless sufficient bone union has occurred.

# Key Points

1. Wisdom teeth in the line of fracture should be removed to minimize postoperative infection.  
2. Patients with multiple mandibular fractures are plated from anterior to posterior and from rigid to nonrigid fixation. For example, if a patient has sustained a symphysis and an angle fracture, the symphysis is typically plated first with rigid internal fixation, and then the angle is plated with rigid or nonrigid (Champy plate) fixation. If a patient presents with an angle fracture and a condylar fracture, the angle fracture is typically plated first with rigid fixation, and the condylar fracture can be treated closed or with nonrigid or rigid fixation. In the situations discussed here, the more assessable fracture (simpler fracture) is rigidly fixated in order to provide less torsional forces to the more distal (more difficult) fracture. After the application of rigid fixation to the simpler fracture, the more difficult fracture can be treated as if it was an isolated fracture.  
3. If fracture reduction is non-ideal, it may be necessary to remove MMF, adjust the proximal and distal segments of the fracture site, and then reapply MMF. Sometimes, MMF can lock out the fracture if MMF is applied early on in the procedure.

The patient was initially treated with the extraction of bilateral lower wisdom teeth and the placement of a strut plate with monocortical screws on the right side and a  $2.8\mathrm{mm}$  reconstruction plate with bicortical screws on the left side. After 2 weeks of MMF, the patient pre

sented with right-sided failed hardware and a subperiosteal facial abscess. The left side showed no signs of hardware failure or infection. The patient was treated with the removal of the failed right mandibular angle strut plate through a submandibular incision, the debridement of the surgical site, and the placement of a  $2.8\mathrm{mm}$  reconstruction plate with bicortical screws (see Figures 17.22 through 17.32).

# Surgical Management of Mandibular Condyle Fractures (Extracapsular and Intracapsular Fractures)

# Indications for Open Reduction of Mandibular Condyle Fractures

1. Inability to achieve pretraumatic occlusion with manipulation and closed reduction  
2. Open fracture with potential for fibrosis  
3. Severe hypomobility of the affected joint after 1 week  
4. Lateral extracapsular deviation  
5. Foreign body within the joint space  
6. Fracture into the middle cranial fossa  
7. When stability of the occlusion is limited (e.g., less than three teeth per quadrant, gross periodontal disease, or skeletal abnormality)  
8. Conditions that preclude closed reduction (severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD] or emphysema, seizure disorder, alcoholism, substance abuse, status asthmaticus, mental retardation, and psychosis)  
9. To re-establish the vertical height of the lower third of the face with bilateral displaced condylar fractures  
10. To re-establish anterior-posterior and vertical dimensions of the mandible in order to reconstruct midface crush-type injuries

# Contraindications for Open Reduction of Mandibular Condyle Fractures

1. Condylar fractures with little or no dislocation  
2. Condylar fractures with little or no fracture displacement  
3. Fractures with minor malocclusion  
4. Fractures occurring in childhood (below the age of 12; author preference)  
5. Comminuted fractures or fractured segments too small to fixate  
6. Medical conditions that preclude general anesthesia

# Retromandibular Approach for Open Reduction of Extracapsular Condylar Fractures

1. The patient is nasally intubated. Short-acting paralytics are used in order to allow for testing of the facial nerve.  
2. The patient is prepped from the hairline to the clavicles, and MMF is applied.  
3. The head is turned to the side to allow for direct exposure of the ascending ramus. A sterile pen is used to draw a  $1.5 - 3.0\mathrm{cm}$  vertical line just posterior to the posterior border of the ascending ramus and originating  $5\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the ear lobe (see Figure 17.35 in Case Report 17.6). The incision area is infiltrated with local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor within the subcutaneous tissue only.  
4. A #15 blade is used to transect the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Needle-tipped electrocautery is used to

control skin bleeders. The subcutaneous tissue is undermined in all directions to facilitate a tension-free closure at the end of the procedure.

5. A fine hemostat is used to dissect through the scant platysma muscle (see Figure 17.51 in Case Report 17.7), SDCF, and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) to the parotid capsule. Blunt dissection proceeds anteromedially through the parotid gland to the posterior border of the ascending ramus. Care is taken to spread the tines of the hemostat in a direction parallel to the anticipated course of the facial nerve and to use a nerve stimulator once the parotid gland is reached. When branches of the facial nerve are identified, they are gently freed from surrounding tissue and reflected from the surgical site.  
6. Army-navy retractors are used to provide direct visualization of the posterior ascending ramus. A #15 blade is used to transect the periosteum overlying the posterior aspect of the ascending ramus.  
7. A periosteal elevator is used to dissect in a subperiosteal plane to expose and reduce the proximal and distal aspect of the subcondylar fracture (see Figure 17.37 in Case Report 17.6). A towel clip may be used to grasp the inferior aspect of the ramus in order to provide an inferior vector to aid in the reduction of the subcondylar fracture (see Figure 17.38 in Case Report 17.6).  
8. The fracture is plated (see Figure 17.40 in Case Report 17.6 and Figure 17.52 in Case Report 17.7), the occlusion is verified, and the incision is closed in a tension-free, layered fashion. The parotid capsule is closed with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous layer is closed with 4-0 Monocryl, and the skin edges are reapproximated with a running 5-0 plain gut suture (see Figure 17.41 in Case Report 17.6 and Figure 17.53 in Case Report 17.7).

# Key Points for Extracapsular Open Reduction

1. Closed reduction of extracapsular or intracapsular condylar fractures is frequently treated with a short period of MMF (7-10 days) followed by aggressive physical therapy. Occlusion should be maintained with guiding elastics, and other mandibular fractures should be rigidly fixated to allow for this early mobilization.  
2. Open reduction of indicated condyle fractures results in anatomical repositioning with rigid fixation of displaced segments, increased long-term occlusal stability, restoration of the vertical dimension of the ramus, and rapid return to function.  
3. The condyle can be approached through a variety of approaches to include preauricular, submandibular, retromandibular, intraoral, and endoscopic approaches. The retromandibular approach allows for a more direct approach to the condylar neck, more visible exposure, and faster operating times.

4. When plating condylar fractures, the use of two plates provides superior strength and anti-rotational properties compared to the use of a single plate. The overall stability of two parallel plates versus two angulated plates is a highly polarized topic in the literature.  
5. For fractures involving bilateral condyles and an anterior mandibular fracture (see Case Report 17.7), care must be taken to adequately reduce all fractures. Failure to reduce the fractures appropriately will lead to a gross widening or increase in the horizontal dimensions of the lower third of face. The same can be true with a non-reduced maxillary palatal fracture (increases the width of the maxilla and results in malocclusion and midface widening and asymmetry). For severely displaced fractures or for fractures greater than 2 weeks old, consideration should be given to the fabrication of an occlusal splint to aid in ideal fracture reduction, the re-establishment of occlusion and to reconstruct the width of the lower third of the face.

# Preauricular Approach for Open Reduction of Intracapsular Condylar Fractures

1. The patient is nasally intubated. Short-acting paralytics are used in order to allow for testing of the facial nerve.  
2. An ear wick is placed within the external auditory canal. The patient is prepped from the hairline to the clavicles, and MMF is applied. The head is turned to the side to allow for direct exposure of the ear, zygomatic arch, and temporomandibular joint.  
3. A sterile pen is used to outline the incision. The incision should be hidden within a natural skinfold anterior to the ear. The incision originates within the hairline and courses caudally to the inferior aspect of the external auditory canal. Further superior and inferior extension is possible if additional exposure is required.  
4. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is used to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue. The incision is created with a #15 blade and is carried through skin only. At the superior extent of the incision (above the zygomatic arch), needle-tipped electrocautery is used to cauterize skin bleeders and to transect the subcutaneous tissues and the temporoparietal fascia down to the temporalis fascia. The blunt end of a periosteal elevator is used to dissect anteriorly and inferiorly along the superficial layer of the temporalis fascia.  
5. At the root of the zygoma, electrocautery is used to transect the superficial layer of the temporalis fascia, the temporal fat pad, and the periosteum overlying the zygomatic arch.  
6. A periosteal elevator is used to dissect anteriorly along the zygomatic arch within a subperiosteal plane until the articular eminence is reached (see Figure 17.58 in Case Report 17.8). A periosteal elevator is used in a gentle sweeping motion to expose the lateral capsule of the temporomandibular joint.

7. Inferior mandibular traction is placed in order to separate the head of the condyle from the glenoid fossa. An incision is initiated with a #15 blade at the posterior slope of the eminence and proceeds posteriorly to the posterior aspect of the joint space. The #15 blade is angled at  $45^{\circ}$  while inferior traction is applied to the mandible in order to avoid damaging the articular disc. A 2-3mm cuff of tissue is left attached to the root of the zygoma eminence in order to allow for closure of the lateral capsule.  
8. The blunt end of a periosteal elevator is used to enter the superior joint space. The periosteal elevator is used in a sweeping motion to dissect into the anterior and posterior recesses of the superior joint space and medially to the medial pole of the condylar head.  
9. The inferior joint space is entered by making an incision with a #15 blade at the inferior aspect of the lateral recess, where the lateral aspect of the articular disc attaches to the capsule.  
10. Two periosteal elevators are used to locate and reduce the fractured segments. A towel clip can be used to grasp the inferior border of the angle of the mandible, and inferior traction can be applied to enlarge the joint space.  
11. The fractured intracapsular segments are fixated with either a four-hole plate (see Figure 17.59 in Case Report 17.8) or two to three position screws, depending on the line of the fracture.  
12. Once the fracture is fixated, the articular disc is repositioned into its most anatomical position with 5-0 Vicryl sutures.  
13. MMF is removed, and the occlusion is assessed. The capsule is closed with 5-0 Vicryl sutures. The subcutaneous tissues are closed with 4-0 Monocryl sutures, and the skin edges are reapproximated with either steri-strips or 5-0 plain gut sutures (see Figure 17.60 in Case Report 17.8).

# Key Points for Intracapsular Open Reduction

1. The temporomandibular joint space can be expanded for additional exposure or fracture reduction by one of three methods. A towel clip can be placed transcutaneously at the inferior angle of the mandible, and inferior traction is applied. Once the joint space is reached through the preauricular approach, a gauze packer (wire director) can be placed within the sigmoid notch and a downward vector of traction is applied. Finally, when the retromandibular approach is utilized, a skin hook can be placed within the sigmoid notch and a downward vector of traction is applied.  
2. Care is taken to not strip the lateral pterygoid muscle from the condylar head. Care is also taken to not damage the articular cartilage and to not place plates or screws in close proximity to the articular surface.

3. Positional screws should only be used in intracapsular fractures if the screws can be inserted  $90^{\circ}$  to the fracture. For this reason, most intracapsular fractures are treated with bone reduction plates.  
4. With the recent advancements in surgical techniques, instrumentation, and rigid fixation, there has been a recent movement away from traditional closed treatment of extracapsular and intracapsular fractures. Current therapy is based on the anatomical repositioning of fractured segments with semirigid or rigid fixation, early and aggressive physical therapy, and a rapid return to function. Advantages of open reduction of extracapsular and intracapsular fractures include exact restoration of pretraumatic anatomy, maintenance of the vertical dimension of the ramus, articular disc repositioning and repair, increased occlusal stability, and early return to function without the need for prolonged MMF.

# Postoperative Management

1. Appropriate analgesic and antibiotic coverage are warranted for the first 7 days after surgery.  
2. Patients are allowed to function immediately after surgery. Patients are instructed to wear guiding elastics during the day for the first 2 weeks. Guiding elastics allow for a full range of motion and help to facilitate an appropriate occlusion. Heavier elastics are placed at night. After 2 weeks, no elastics are utilized unless malocclusion occurs. Mouth-opening exercises are begun on postoperative day 7. Physical therapy is initiated for patients who have hypomobility after 4 weeks.  
3. Patients are maintained on a soft, non-chew diet for the first 2 weeks. They are gradually advanced to a full diet in weeks 2 through 6.  
4. Arch bars are removed at 6-8 weeks depending on occlusal stability and reproducibility.

# Complications

1. Occlusal discrepancy: Anterior open bite and/or retrognathia can result from inadequately reduced fractures, condylar resorption, avascular necrosis, and/or hardware failure.  
2. Deviation of the chin on opening: Occurs with comminuted fractures, nonreduced intracapsular fractures, dislocated condylar fractures, condylar resorption, and avascular necrosis.  
3. Facial asymmetry: Shortening of the ramus due to the loss of vertical height from displaced condylar fractures.  
4. Reduced mandibular mobility: Often seen with intracapsular fractures and comminuted fractures of the condylar head, and can be an early sign of fibrous ankylosis.

5. Ankylosis: Often occurs with intracapsular fractures where the condylar stump is displaced laterally outside of the glenoid fossa, with significant comminution of the condylar head, hemarthrosis, and extended periods of MMF.  
6. Condylar resorption or avascular necrosis: Can occur from stripping the lateral pterygoid muscle from the condyle. The lateral pterygoid muscle provides significant blood supply to the condylar head.  
7. Chronic pain: Early pain can be from inadequate repositioning of the articular disc and the retrodiscal tissue into the pretraumatic position. Late pain is typically from the development of osteoarthritis within the joint complex.  
8. Infection: Caused by contamination of the surgical field, contamination of the wound, or failed hardware.  
9. Hardware failure: Occurs from overdrilling screw osteotomies, inadequate irrigation, placement of screws within the line of fracture, and excessive early functioning.  
10. Hematoma and hemarthrosis: Typically occurs from excessive hemorrhage from the retrodiscal tissue. Prevented by closing the joint space only after hemostasis is achieved. Treated with surgical evacuation of the hematoma.  
11. Frey's syndrome: Occurs from aberrant innervation of the skin's sympathetic sweat glands by damaged parasympathetic auriculotemporal nerve fibers during the preauricular approach. Frey's syndrome is diagnosed by preauricular gustatory sweating, flushing, and a positive iodine-starch test, and is treated with botulinum toxin A injections.  
12. Salivary fistula and sialocele: Occurs from failure to close the parotid capsule appropriately. Treated with the placement of a drain for 3-5 days, antisialogogue agents, and pressure dressings for 7-10 days.  
13. Pseudoarthrosis and failure of osteosynthesis: Caused by inadequate fracture reduction, hardware failure, mobility at the fracture site, and infection.  
14. Preauricular hypoesthesia: From inadvertent damage to the auriculotemporal nerve during dissection.

# Surgical Management of Atrophic Edentulous Mandibular Fractures

# Indications for Open Reduction of Atrophic Edentulous Mandibular Fractures

1. Flail mandible  
2. Gross displacement of the fractured segments  
3. Infection  
4. Nonunion or malunion

See Figure 17.67 for a comparison of regions of edentulous mandible fractures.

# Contraindications for Open Reduction of Atrophic Edentulous Mandibular Fractures

1. Significant medical comorbidities  
2. Unable to tolerate general anesthesia

# Transcervical Approach for Open Reduction of Atrophic Edentulous Mandibular Fractures

1. The patient is medically optimized prior to surgery as most patients are elderly and have associated medical comorbidities.  
2. Oral intubation is employed if the fractures will be anatomically reduced without the use of the patient's dentures or gunning splints. Nasal intubation is employed if the patient's pre-existing dentures/gunning splints and skeletal fixation will be utilized to aid in fracture reduction. Short-acting paralytics are used in order to test for branches of the facial nerve during transcervical approach.  
3. The patient's head is placed within the midline of the table with cervical hyperextension (unless cervical spine injury or severe degenerative spine disease is present).

![](images/a39e8b66a484e3aedbf955a6326a8f4a28749359e8a5f55f4feeec46466d7b77.jpg)

4. The patient is prepped and draped from the orbital rims to the clavicles. The oral cavity is included within the prep.  
5. A cervical rhytid is identified that will hide the transcervical incision. A sterile marking pen is utilized to outline the site of the proposed skin incision. Ideally, the facial rhytid is located  $1\mathrm{cm}$  cephalic to the thyroid cartilage (see Figure 17.70 in Case Report 17.10).  
6. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is infiltrated within a supraplatysmal plane at the site of the proposed incision.  
7. A #15 blade is used to transect skin and subcutaneous tissue. The incision should be made in a single, continuous motion and can extend from mastoid process to contralateral mastoid process for bilateral posterior fractures. Needlepoint electrocautery is used to cauterize skin bleeders. The caudal aspect of the incision is undermined  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  within the subcutaneous tissue plane in order to allow for a tension-free closure at the end of the procedure.  
8. The platysma muscle is sharply transected, and the SDCF is identified. A nerve stimulator is used to test for branches of the marginal mandibular and cervical nerves once the SDCF is reached.  
9. The anterior border of the SCM muscle is identified. Care is taken to avoid damaging the greater auricular nerve and the external jugular vein along the superficial surface of the SCM.  
10. A subplatysmal flap is raised and carried toward the inferior border of the mandible. At a point approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above the hyoid bone, a finger is used to palpate the bilateral submandibular glands. The investing fascia of the submandibular gland is entered at the inferior aspect of the gland. The facial artery and vein are identified, ligated, transected, and reflected superiorly (Hayes-Martin maneuver) along with the investing fascia containing the marginal mandibular nerve. A nerve stimulator is used to identify the marginal mandibular nerve as it courses superficially over the submandibular gland prior to its reflection with the submandibular glands investing fascia.  
11. Medially, the anterior digastric tendons and muscles are identified and followed superiorly to the inferior border of the anterior mandible.  
12. Once the inferior border of the mandible is reached, a #15 blade or electrocautery is used to transect the pterygomasseteric sling and periosteum.  
13. A subperiosteal dissection is employed to expose the fractured segments and the thicker bone of the ramus and symphysis (see Figure 17.71 in Case Report 17.10). Care is taken to not strip periosteum from the lingual surface or from the alveolar crest so as not to further compromise the vascular supply to the atrophic mandible.

14. The fractured segments are reduced anatomically with digital manipulation. It may aid in the fracture reduction to place a finger on the inside of the mouth and to place pressure on the lingual surface of the mandible.  
15. The fractured segments are initially reduced with 2.0 miniplates placed at the inferior border of the mandible with  $4\mathrm{mm}$  screws (see Figure 17.72 in Case Report 17.10). This will allow the placement of a larger reconstruction plate once the fracture or fractures are anatomically reduced.  
16. A reconstruction plate is adapted to follow the anatomy of the reduced atrophic mandible (see Figure 17.73 in Case Report 17.10). The reconstruction plate should be bent passively so as not to distract the condyles from their fossae during rigid plating. Passive plate placement can be optimized by using locking plates and screws.  
17. The plate should be fixated with at least three bicortical screws per side. This will allow for greater load sharing and will minimize hardware failure from tension forces. Fixation should be extended to the ramus and symphysis portion of the mandible as this is typically the thickest portion of atrophic edentulous mandibles. Once the reconstruction plate(s) are fixated, the 2.0 miniplates are removed from the inferior border of the mandible.  
18. Immediate bone grafting may or may not be performed depending on the individual case.  
19. The site is irrigated, and the incision is closed in a layered fashion with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures used to reapproximate the fascia and platysma muscle, 5-0 Vicryl or Monocryl sutures for the subcutaneous tissue, and a running 5-0 plain gut sutures for the skin edges (see Figure 17.75 in Case Report 17.10). Steri-strips are applied over the closed skin incision. Typically, drains and pressure dressings are not necessary.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative antibiotic and analgesics are required.  
2. Steri-strips are removed after 5 days.  
3. The patient is returned to oral function as soon as possible.  
4. Future considerations may involve the removal of the reconstruction plate for denture fabrication and dental implants with or without additional grafting.

# Complications

1. Infection: Early infections are usually caused from failure to follow sterile technique, inadequate closure of incision resulting in hematoma or seroma formation, or infected fracture sites prior to surgery. Late infections are typically from hardware failure, non-ideal fracture reduction, and immunocompromised patients.

2. Wound dehiscence: Most commonly seen with transoral approaches. Seen infrequently with transcervical approaches unless the wound is closed under direct tension or if a layered closure is not employed.  
3. Hardware failure: Hardware failure in the edentulous mandible is often associated with the use of smaller fixation plates. The atrophic edentulous mandible is subjected to different forces than the dentate mandible. As such, the constant forces from the elevator and depressor muscles of the mandible produce constant, multivector tension and torque forces that can lead to fracture displacement and miniplate failure. A reconstruction plate has the ability to withstand the previously mentioned forces and to provide absolute immobilization of the fractured segments during healing.  
4. Nonunion or malunion: Occur with non-anatomical reduction of atrophic mandible fractures. Can be minimized by obtaining wide surgical access with direct visualization of the fractures, anatomical reduction of fractured segments, minimization of fracture gaps, and the use of rigid fixation in the form of reconstruction plates.  
5. Nerve damage: In the atrophic mandible, the position of the inferior alveolar nerve can be found along the crest of the alveolar ridge posterior to the mental foramen. Intraoral incisions should be placed within the buccal vestibule and not along the crest of the bone to minimize damage to the inferior alveolar nerve. Damage to the marginal mandibular or cervical nerve is possible from either transcervical or submandibular skin incisions. The incisions should be placed a minimum of  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible, and a nerve stimulator should be utilized once the platysma muscle is transversed.

# Key Points

1. Most patients with atrophic edentulous mandibular fractures have significant medical comorbidities that may influence operative management and postoperative healing. These factors need to be considered when placing the patient under general anesthesia for an extended period of time.  
2. There is a direct relationship between the incidence of complications and the degree of bone atrophy when treating atrophic edentulous mandibular fractures. The majority of complications are associated with the inability to adequately reduce the fractured segments and from the poor quality of the dense, sclerotic, poorly vascularized bone. It is paramount to be judicious in the stripping of the periosteum while exposing the fractured segments. Frequently, the periosteum is the only blood supply to the anterior aspect of the atrophic edentulous mandible.

3. Primary healing occurs with accurate anatomical reduction of the fractured segments with the elimination of fracture gaps and immobilization of the fractured segments. This is best achieved with extraoral approaches and rigid fixation with reconstruction plates.  
4. The reconstruction plate should fit passively, and locking plates and screws should be utilized. Care is taken to not create a torquing force that will distract the mandibular condyles from the glenoid fossae.  
5. Rigid plating of atrophic edentulous fractures leads to less complications and allows for earlier return to normal function. Rigid plating also eliminates the need for gunning splints and trans-skeletal MMF, which is often contraindicated in the elderly patient population.  
6. Reconstruction plates should be extended to areas of the mandible that are thicker (ramus and symphysis) in order to distribute the tension of the reconstruction plates to stronger segments of bone. Reconstruction plates should be plated with at least three screws on each side of the fracture in order to distribute the load sharing capabilities of the plate.  
7. Care should be taken when placing bicortical screws in atrophic sclerotic mandibles in order to minimize damage to the inferior alveolar nerve and overheating the screw osteotomy site, which resultant future hardware failure, and creating additional fractures within the atrophic mandible with non-ideal screw placement.  
8. Once plating is completed, a finger should be placed transorally along the lingual plate and the alveolar crest to ensure that the bicortical screws have not penetrated through the lingual plate of bone. Screw overpenetration will create pain, a source of infection, and may limit future prosthetic options for the patient.  
9. Immediate bone grafting is advocated when fractured segments cannot be realigned adequately and when a nonunion will occur, to add bulk bone to prevent future fractures and for future prosthetic considerations, and to promote revascularization through the transplantation of osteoprogenitor cells. Immediate bone grafting is not necessary in patients for whom prolonged general anesthesia is contraindicated or in patients with near-ideal alignment of fractured segments.  
10. Gunning splints can be fabricated in patients who are not surgical candidates (see Figure 17.68). Gunning splints are skeletally fixated to the upper and lower jaws with trans-skeletal fixation via circummandibular wiring, pyriform rim wiring, trans-nasal wiring, or circumzygomatic wiring. The patient is then placed into MMF by securing the gunning splints together. Gunning splints alone cannot adequately reduce grossly displaced fractures and are not ideal in elderly patients who cannot tolerate MMF due to nutritional deficiencies, COPD, dementia, etc. If gunning splints are fabricated, an opening should be created for nutritional support.

# Surgical Management of Pediatric Mandibular Fractures

# Indications for Open Reduction of Pediatric Mandibular Fractures

1. Displaced non-condylar fractures that cannot be adequately reduced with closed techniques

# Contraindications for Open Reduction of Pediatric Mandibular Fractures

1. Condyle fractures  
2. Fractures that can be reduced with closed reduction (external and/or internal skeletal fixation or pediatric splint)  
3. Nondisplaced fractures (can be treated with a soft diet) with no or minor changes in occlusion

# Pediatric Splint Fabrication and Closed Reduction

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia via nasal intubation.  
2. Weight-appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotics are administered.  
3. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx. The patient is prepped and draped from the orbits to the clavicles to include the oral cavity.  
4. Alginate impressions are taken of both the maxilla and the mandible.  
5. The impressions are poured in stone plaster. The mandibular cast is sectioned along the fracture line.  
6. The mandibular cast is oriented to the maxillary cast to re-establish the pretraumatic occlusion. The mandibular cast is looted together with wax and stone plaster. The maxilla and the looted mandibular cast are placed within a single hinged articulator, and an acrylic splint is fabricated with a lingual flange. Holes are placed within the buccal and lingual flange of the splint to facilitate placement of circum-mandibular wires.  
7. The splint is inserted and secured to the mandible with 26-gauge circum-mandibular wires placed with an awl. External fixation is applied to the middle one-third of the face via any combination of MMF screws, pyriform aperture screw/wiring, zygomatic arch screws/wiring, infraorbital screws/wiring, or transnasal wiring.

# Closed Reduction via Risdon Cables

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia via nasal intubation.  
2. Weight-appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotics are administered.

3. The patient is prepped and draped from the orbits to the clavicles to include the oral cavity.  
4. A 24-gauge stainless steel wire is ligated using a circumdental technique to the first deciduous molar (see Figure 17.84 in Case Report 17.11) and then braided for additional strength and support.  
5. The braided 24-gauge wire structure is positioned over the CEJ and secured to each tooth with a 24-gauge circumdental wire (see Figure 17.85 in Case Report 17.11). The Risdon cables terminate via circumdental ligation at the contralateral deciduous first molar. The single circumdental wires can be fashioned as hooks to hold elastics (see Figure 17.86 in Case Report 17.11).

# Closed Reduction via External Skeletal Fixation (Skeletal Wiring or Drop Wires)

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia via nasal intubation.  
2. Weight-appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotics are administered.  
3. The patient is prepped and draped from the orbits to the clavicles to include the oral cavity.  
4. An incision is placed within the maxillary anterior buccal vestibule in order to expose the pediatric pyriform apertures (rims).  
5. A fissured bur is used to create an osteotomy at the base of each pyriform aperture. A 25-gauge stainless steel wire is placed through each pyriform aperture and tightened into a loop (see Figure 17.78 and Figure 17.89 in Case Report 17.12). If additional posterior anchorage is required, circumzygomatic wires or titanium screws are placed within the zygomatic arch.  
6. An awl is used to place circum-mandibular wires (see Figures 17.90 and 17.91 in Case Report 17.12). The awl is placed from the oral cavity through the skin of the inferior border of the mandible posterior to the mental foramen. The awl is passed in close proximity to the buccal cortex. Once the awl passes through the skin at the inferior border of the mandible, the wire and the awl are redirected through the same percutaneous skin wound and passed along the lingual aspect of the mandible back into the oral cavity (see Figure 17.77). The circum-mandibular wire is then tightened (see Figure 17.78), leaving a loop at its distal end. Care is taken to not overtighten the circummandibular wire as overtightening can transect the thin pediatric mandible. Circum-mandibular wires are placed bilaterally.  
7. A final 25-gauge stainless steel wire or heavy elastics are used to place the patient into MMF (see Figure 17.92 in Case Report 17.12).

# Open Reduction with Resorbable Plates and Screws

1. When possible, screw osteotomies (drilling sites) should avoid areas of developing tooth buds. All screw osteotomies that must be placed within the areas of developing tooth buds are monocortical in order to minimize the potential for damage to the developing tooth buds (see Figures 17.94 and 17.95 in Case Report 17.13).  
2. All screw osteotomies are pretapped prior to the insertion of resorbable screws.  
3. Resorbable screws have a blunt-ended tip, which aids in preventing damage to developing tooth buds.

![](images/3e41176fd62f884d15ae4a8473be7f9607e073e6f5be5def079fb25a63946614.jpg)  
Figure 17.78. Illustration depicting maxillary and mandibular drop wires in place. Care is taken when tightening the mandibular wires to avoid transecting the soft pediatric mandibular bone. The terminal end of the drop wires are fashioned as hooks to hold elastics.

4. Fixation plates must be heated in a water bath to aid in plate pliability and adaptation.  
5. Resorbable screws are more likely to fracture and do not engage the bone as aggressively as titanium screws.

# Postoperative Management

1. The patient is placed on weight-appropriate oral analgesics and antibiotic for 1 week.  
2. Patients are placed into MMF for 1 week. After 1 week, the lingual splint or Risdon cables are left in place and the mouth-opening exercises are initiated. External skeletal fixation is removed after 7-10 days.

3. A soft diet is maintained for a period of 3 weeks.  
4. The splint or Risdon cables are removed after 3 weeks provided satisfactory occlusion.  
5. Future orthodontic treatment is recommended to correct any occlusal discrepancies that are not corrected by the eruption of the primary dentition.

# S

1. Malocclusion: Can result from numerous causes. Ideally corrected with postoperative orthodontic care.  
2. Dental trauma: Occurs from placing fixation screws into developing tooth buds. With open reduction techniques, plates and screws should be placed at the inferior border of the mandible to avoid developing tooth buds and the mandibular canal.  
3. Hardware failure: Due to inappropriate plate placement, resorbable screw fracture or loosening, and patient noncompliance.  
4. Growth abnormalities: Typically associated with condylar fractures that damage the growth plate.  
5. Ankylosis: Occurs from prolonged MMF, comminuted condylar fractures, and hemarthrosis.  
6. Paresthesia or anesthesia: Occurs from damage to the mental nerve or inferior alveolar nerve during tissue dissection or screw placement.  
7. Infection: Typically, from hardware failure or from a foreign body reaction associated with the degradation products of the resorbable hardware. Infections typically resolve after local incision and drainage of the area and the administration of oral antibiotics.

# Key Points

1. Mandibular condyle fractures are the most common type of mandibular fractures in the pediatric population.  
2. As condylar and greenstick mandibular fractures are common within the pediatric patient population, conventional orthopantomograms may be misleading as far as the severity and degree of displacement of the fractures. If the suspicion of a pediatric mandibular fracture is high (malocclusion, pain, anterior open bite, deviation on opening), then 3D studies are recommended.  
3. Open treatment of mandibular fractures is typically reserved for older pediatric patients (older than the age of 10).  
4. It is difficult to apply traditional Erich arch bars to primary teeth due to their bulbous shape. Risdon cables can be used to apply MMF in patients with primary or mixed dentition.  
5. When placing MMF screws or other means of skeletal fixation, care is taken to not damage nearby tooth roots or developing permanent teeth.

![](images/5b175693b6d21670a76ea836768c72de73e4dcba2923336e31539d64a81e070b.jpg)  
Figure 17.79. For grossly comminuted and displaced pediatric mandibular fractures that fail conventional management, the placement of a monocortical titanium plate at the inferior border of the mandible below the developing tooth buds and mandibular nerve may be utilized. The titanium plate is typically removed at the time of MMF removal or 3-6 months after fracture healing. Courtesy of Dr. Thaer Daifallah.

6. Care is taken when placing circum-mandibular wires to not overtighten the circum-mandibular wires and transect the inferior border of the soft pediatric mandible.  
7. It is essential to keep pediatric patients adequately hydrated while MMF is employed.  
8. When open reduction is required, the use of monocortical screws is recommended in order to minimize the risk of inadvertent damage to developing tooth buds.  
9. Resorbable plates should be placed at the inferior border of the mandible to avoid damaging tooth buds and the contents of the mandibular canal. The plates should be fixated with at least two screws on each side of the fracture.  
10. Titanium plates and screws are reserved for patients who have achieved skeletal maturity due to concern of limiting mandibular growth. However, in grossly displaced fractures that are resistant to conventional techniques, a well-adapted titanium plate may be placed at the inferior border of the mandible. This plate is typically removed either at the time that the MMF (Risdon cables, lingual splint, skeletal drop wires, etc.) is removed or 3-6 months after placement (see Figure 17.79).

# Surgical Management of Comminuted Mandibular Fractures

# Indication for Open Reduction of Comminuted Mandibular Fractures

1. To restore occlusion  
2. To restore arch form  
3. To restore facial contours  
4. To restore function  
5. Flail mandible or fractures involving the genial tubercles resulting in posterior displacement of the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles

# Contraindications for Open Reduction of Comminuted Mandibular Fractures

1. Comminuted segments too small to plate  
2. When excessive periosteal stripping may lead to severe bone resorption  
3. Comminuted fractures with severe tissue loss or tissue avulsion  
4. Medical comorbidities that limit or preclude the use of general anesthesia

The surgical approach for the management of comminuted fractures is based on the location, extent, and comminution of the mandibular fractures. Please refer to previous approaches within this chapter for dissection methods.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative antibiotics are imperative in open comminuted fractures.  
2. The patient is maintained in MMF for 4-6 weeks. If necessary, a feeding tube is placed.  
3. Secondary bone grafting may be necessary after hard and soft tissue healing.

# Complications

1. Infection: Causes include inadequate fracture reduction, teeth within the line of fracture, contaminated wound, failed hardware, and necrotic comminuted bone segments.  
2. Wound dehiscence: From inadequately vascularized tissue, hematoma or seroma formation, inadequate closure of tissues in a layered fashion, necrotic segments of underlying bone, and closure of tissue under tension.  
3. Nonunion or malunion: Typically, from inadequate fracture reduction, fracture mobility, or hardware failure.

4. Fistula or sialocele development: Occurs when damage occurs to the parotid or submandibular gland.

# Key Points

1. Posterior displacement of the tongue via either a flail mandible or fracture of the genial tubercules should be addressed promptly prior to airway embarrassment (see Figures 17.110 through 17.112 in Case Report 17.15).  
2. Facial lacerations or tissue avulsions allow for excellent exposure to the underlying bones (see Figure 17.116 in Case Report 17.16).  
3. Temporary fixation of comminuted mandibular segments with either wire fixation or miniplates will allow for the contouring and adaptation of reconstruction plates for permanent rigid fixation of the fractured segments (see Figure 17.104 in Case Report 17.14).  
4. Comminuted fractures should be plated with at least three screws per side of the fracture. Screws should be bicortical when possible and should not be placed in areas of severe comminution (see Figures 17.106 and 17.107 in Case Report 17.14).  
5. Care should be taken to keep periosteal stripping to a minimum in comminuted fractures. The perio- teum overlying the lingual aspect of the mandible should be preserved to maintain an adequate blood supply to the fractured and/or comminuted segments.  
6. Debridement of nonviable soft and hard tissues, dental fragments, and projectile fragments at the time of surgery will decrease postoperative complications.  
7. Always attempt to cover exposed bone when possible. If tissue undermining is inadequate, consider local and regional advancement flaps.  
8. Immediate bone grafting of mandibular defects is determined by the size of the defect, the contamination of the wound, and the amount of soft tissue coverage capable of closure without tension.

A 24-year-old male presents after a motor vehicle accident with numerous comminuted fractures to his bilateral mandibular angle and body.

A 65-year-old man immediately status post a self-inflicted gunshot wound (Gsw) to the anterior mandible with gross comminution. Upon arrival in the Emergency Department, the man was seated upright and in little distress with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15. After leaving the CT scanner, the patient underwent airway embarrassment from the posterior displacement of his tongue musculature and sustained an awake tracheotomy in route to the operating room. All mandibular teeth with the exception of #18, #30, and #31 were hopelessly fractured. The three remaining posterior mandibular teeth were utilized to place the patient into MMF via Ivy loops. A reconstruction plate was used to realign the anterior mandible, and wire fixation was used to secure the lingual plate and reposition the tongue musculature (see Figures 17.110 through 17.115).

# xternal Fixation of Mandibular Fractures

# Indications for External Fixation of Mandibular Fractures

1. Grossly comminuted mandibular fractures where the fractured segments are too small to appropriately plate (bag of bones)  
2. Comminuted fractures with severe tissue loss or tissue avulsion  
3. Grossly infected fractures  
4. Medical comorbidities that limit or preclude the use of general anesthesia

# Contraindication for External Fixation of Mandibular Fractures

1. Bone pathology in the area of necessary pin placement  
2. Fractured segments too small for external fixation pin/ screw placementt

# External Fixation Technique

1. Airway patency is secured via either intubation or tracheostomy.  
2. The patient is prepped from the orbital rims to the clavicles to include the intraoral cavity.  
3. If dentate, all damaged and unsalvageable teeth are removed, and the patient is placed into MMF via arch bars and 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires and/or heavy elastics. If edentulous, fractures are anatomically reduced with or without the use of pre-existing dentures or gunning splints.  
4. The fractured segments and the inferior border of the mandible are palpated and mapped with intraoral and extraoral digital manipulation (see Figure 17.120 in Case Report 17.17).  
5. Extraoral stab incisions are placed along the inferior border of the mandible in the anticipated sites of fixation screw placement.  
6. A hemostat is used to dissect to the inferior border of the mandible. Either a trocar or a nasal speculum is used to retract the tissues. The fixation screw is placed within the placement gun, positioned within the trocar or within the nasal speculum, and scrapped along the inferior border of the mandible in order to remove the periosteum and to feel the inferior border of the mandible. The fixation screw is driven through both the buccal and lingual cortical plates. Care is taken to not drive the fixation screw past the lingual plate.  
7. At least two fixation screws are placed in each segment of bone. The fixation screws ideally are placed  $10\mathrm{mm}$  from the fracture site and at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  from adjacent fixation screws (see Figure 17.121 in Case Report 17.17).  
8. After fixation screw placement, MMF is removed, and a finger is run along the lingual surface of the mandible to check for overpenetration of the fixation screws within the floor of the mouth. If overpenetration has occurred,

the fixation screw is reversed until it is flushed with the lingual plate.

9. MMF is reapplied and connectors/acrerylic bar/chest tube are placed  $10\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the skin surface. If acrylic is used, moist sterile gauze is placed over the skin in order to protect against thermal damage from the polymerization of the acrylic.  
10. The fixation screws are wrapped in ribbon gauze impregnated with iodoform or antibiotic ointment (see Figure 17.123 in Case Report 17.17 and Figure 17.125 in Case Report 17.18).

# Postoperative Management

1. Ribbon gauze impregnated with iodoform or antibiotic ointment wrapped around the fixation pins is changed daily.  
2. Postoperative antibiotics are imperative.  
3. Fracture adjustments can be made by either adjusting the adjustable connectors or by cutting and refixation the acrylic bar.  
4. Fracture healing can be tested by removing connectors or by cutting the acrylic bar to test for mobility.

# Complications

1. Infection: May be caused from necrosis of bone surrounding the fixator screws, necrotic segments of avulsed bone, tissue trauma, or retained unsalvageable teeth.  
2. Cellulitis around the fixation screws: Typically, from not leaving sufficient space between the connectors/fiber rods/acrylic bar and the skin. A clearance of  $1.0 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  should be present between the skin and the connectors/fiber rods/acrylic bar. Additional clearance is required in instances where additional facial edema is expected after external fixator placement.  
3. Nonunion or malunion: One of the most common complications associated with external fixators. External fixation procedures commonly require a secondary grafting procedure.  
4. Screws becoming detached from the underlying bone: Typically, from not fully engaging the lingual cortex or by placing the connectors/fiber rods/acrylic bar too close to the skin.  
5. Damage to adjacent structures: Typically to the inferior alveolar nerve, teeth roots, and contents of the floor of the mouth from inappropriate placement of fixation screws.  
6. Percutaneous fistulae formation: Typically, from bone necrosis around the fixator screws.  
7. Damage to the parotid gland or submandibular gland: Frequently results in sialocele or salivary fistula formation.  
8. Thermal trauma to the underlying skin: Due to the polymerization of acrylic. Moist gauze should be placed between the skin and the acrylic until the polymerization process is completed.

Figure 17.118. The use of a lightweight, adjustable carbon fiber rod external fixation system. The fixation screws are placed  $10\mathrm{mm}$  superficial to the skin in order to prevent tissue swelling into the fixation rods and to minimize the risk of skin cellulitis and pressure necrosis.

# Key Points

1. There are several types of external fixation systems that range from the use of percutaneous screws (or pins) fixated to an acrylic bar, a chest tube filled with acrylic, and lightweight, adjustable carbon fiber rod systems developed for orthopedic hand and forearm surgery.  
2. Percutaneous screws are placed at least  $1\mathrm{cm}$  from the fracture and are placed within thick segments of bone such as the body and symphysis region.  
3. Care is taken to avoid placing the percutaneous screws within the fracture, too close to the fracture, within the roots of teeth, within the mandibular canal, or deep to the lingual cortex of the mandible.  
4. Percutaneous screws should be placed or angulated far enough apart for the placement of connectors if fiber carbon rod systems are utilized.

5. Connectors and/or the bar should be placed a minimum of  $10\mathrm{mm}$  off of the skin so that, as the tissue swells, the skin will not necrosis (see Figure 17.118).  
6. External fixation commonly results in either the nonunion or malunion of fractures and typically requires a secondary grafting procedure.  
7. The overall complication rate of the treatment of comminuted mandibular fractures has been reported to be  $35\%$  with the use of external pin fixation,  $17\%$  with MMF alone, and  $10\%$  for patients treated with open reduction with rigid internal fixation. Studies support a higher rate of complications with higher degrees of fracture comminuti

Case Report 17.17. External Fixation. Nonunion with osteomyelitis in an unstable patient. A 65-year-old male presents 12 weeks after failed repair of bilateral edentulous mandibular fractures at an outside institution. Eight weeks after the placement of bilateral  $2.3\mathrm{mm}$  miniplates to the mandibular body fractures, the left miniplate fractured and was removed. The bone to the left posterior mandible was biopsied and a definitive diagnosis of osteomyelitis was proven. During the surgical procedure, the patient underwent a myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac stent placement. Due

to the recent cardiac event and risk stratification score, the decision was made to repair the mandibular nonunion with a surgical procedure with the shortest operating time under general anesthesia. The patient underwent successful external fixation of his bilateral mandibular fractures and was treated with 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics via a PICC line, 6 weeks of oral antibiotics and then definitive reconstruction with bone grafting 12 months after his cardiac status had stabilized and his osteomyelitis had resolved (see Figures 17.119 through 17.123).
