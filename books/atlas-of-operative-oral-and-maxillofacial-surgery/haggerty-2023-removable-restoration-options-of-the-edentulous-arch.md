# Removable Restoratidentulous Arch

Christopher J. Haggerty

Private Practice, Lakewood Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Specialists, Lees Summit, Missouri, USA

A method of adding additional retention and stability to a new or pre-existing removable appliance.

# Indications

1. Patient desiring additional stability and retention for a removable device (complete denture or partial denture)  
2. Adequate bone volume for the placement of dental implants  
3. Adequate inter-arch distance for a removable implant supported prosthesis  
4. Placement of implants to maintain current bone levels

# Contraindications

1. Insufficient bone volume and quality for dental implant placement  
2. Medical conditions that preclude implant placement (IV bisphosphonate usage, radiation to the jaws, uncontrolled diabetes, or other immunosuppressant conditions)

# Minimum Required Vertical Restorative (Interocclusal) Space of Various Types of Dental Restorations

Fixed hybrid prosthesis:  $15 - 18\mathrm{mm}$

Overdenture with bar:  $12 - 15\mathrm{mm}$

Locator abutments:  $9 - 12\mathrm{mm}$

# Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP) Dual Scan Technique

1. If virtual surgical planning (VSP) and implant guide fabrication is desired, a means of creating and exporting DICOM and/or STL files is necessary. Fiducial (radiographic) markers are used as key reference points to merge DICOM files in a 3D layered environment when there is insufficient dentition to serve as key references. Fiducial markers are placed along the buccal and palatal/lingual surfaces of the scannable removable appliance (current conventional denture, removable partial denture, base plate with wax rim, or radiographic guide). Types of fiducial markers

include fiducial stickers (preferred by the author) (see Figures 10.1, 10.8 and 10.9 in Case Report 10.1), a surgical stent or duplicated denture infused with barium sulfate or radio-opaque dye or the placement of gutta percha within a removable appliance.

2. The removable dental appliance (prosthesis) is refined with a radiolucent tissue conditioner (see Figure 10.10 in Case Report 10.1) to allow for an ideal fit between the intaglio surface of the removable dental appliance and the soft tissues. The fit of the removable dental appliance will correlate with the fit and accuracy of the printed surgical guide.  
3. A CBCT scan is obtained of the patient wearing the removable prosthesis and of the prosthesis alone.  
4. CBCT scan of patient wearing prosthesis (DICOM file #1): Cotton rolls are placed to apply equal pressure along the removable appliance during the CBCT scanning process to ensure complete seating of the intaglio surface of the removable appliance against the patient's soft tissues and to separate the removable appliance from the opposing dentition or appliance. Alternatively, stability of the removable dental appliance can be increased during CBCT scanning by utilizing a radiopaque bite index (radiolucent bite registration).  
5. CBCT scan of prosthesis alone (DICOM file #2): The removable appliance is then CBCT scanned individually (see Figure 10.12 in Case Report 10.1) utilizing a horizontal scaffold and foam block. When performing VSP on two arches, each removable dental appliance is scanned individually.  
6. The DICOM data from the CBCT scan of the prosthesis alone is converted to an STL file.  
7. The DICOM file of the patient wearing the prosthesis and the STL file of the prosthesis alone are exported to the surgeon's preferred dental implant software and are merged together in a 3D layered environment (see Figure 10.13 in Case Report 10.1) utilizing the fiducial markers.  
8. Bone morphology and density are evaluated for ideal implant placement. Key anatomical structures (maxillary

nasal floor, incisive canal, mandibular canal, and mental foramen) are identified and safe parameters for implant placement are designed based on the proximity of the planned implants to these key structures.

9. If necessary, guides may be planned that will allow for simultaneous alveoloplasty, tooth removal, sinus augmentation, and incisive canal obliteration.  
10. Surgical guides may be either tissue supported or bone supported. Skeletal fixation pins (see Figure 10.18 in Case Report 10.1) are designed to engage solid bone to anchor both soft tissue and bone supported guides to increase guide stability, accuracy, and retention.

# Surgical Technique for Tissue Supported Guides

1. Preoperative antibiotics and chlorohexidine rinses are administered immediately prior to surgery.  
2. The surgical guide is placed to ensure an ideal fit prior to tissue distortion from the administration of local anesthesia.  
3. Local anesthesia is administered in the form of nerve blocks and infiltration. Sufficient time must be given (8-12 minutes) for the local anesthesia to be evenly distributed throughout the tissues to minimize soft tissue distortion prior to guide placement.  
4. For tissue supported guides, the surgical guide is placed and seated fully along the edentulous ridge with no flap reflection (for bone supported guides, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is reflected and the guide articulates directly on the alveolar process of

bone). The surgical guide should fit the provided dental model exactly as it fits within the oral cavity. Ideal guide seating should result in even and symmetrical soft tissue blanching (see Figure 10.5).

5. Firm pressure is placed to hold the guide into its ideal tissue supported position, while skeletal fixation pins are drilled and placed to hold the guide in position (see Figure 10.18 in Case report 10.1).  
6. Based on the virtual surgical plan, either the implant osteotomies are drilled with copious sterile irrigation (see Figure 10.19 in Case Report 10.1) or alveoloplasty is performed (see Figures 10.35 through 10.38 in Case report 10.2).  
7. After the implant osteotomies are completed, implants are placed in a fully guided fashion through the surgical guide with complete control over implant angulation and depth.  
8. The surgical guide is removed and the implants are torque tested to ensure an insertional torque value of at least  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$ . Implants with a low torque value should be removed and replaced with either a longer implant or a wider diameter implant to establish sufficient torque value (see Figure 10.22 in Case Report 10.1). Low implant insertion torque values correlate with poor implant osteointegration and increased implant failure.  
9. Healing abutments are placed (see Figure 10.21 in Case Report 10.1). Planned and necessary hard and soft tissue grafting is performed and resorbable membranes are placed as indicated.

Figure 10.1. For patients without a pre-existing removable prosthesis, a denture base plate with a wax rim can easily and inexpensively be fabricated to function as an intaglio reference for virtual surgical planning. Fiducial markers can be placed on the denture base plate (a), scanned and exported (b) for virtual surgical planning.

10. If incisions were created, they are closed in a tension-free manner with interrupted resorbable sutures (see Figure 10.41 in Case Report 10.2). If the mentalis muscle was reflected, it is repositioned with 4-0 Vicryl sutures. The soft tissues should conform ideally with healing abutment anatomy.  
11. The pre-existing removable appliance is relieved and refined for patient comfort and to minimize direct pressure on the implant healing abutments (see Figures 10.23 and 10.24 in Case Report 10.1). Appropriate relining will distribute the mastication forces on the tissues and not on the implants.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative discomfort is managed with analgesics and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  
2. Gentle saltwater rinses are begun the same day as surgery and are continued until mucosalization of the surgery sites occurs.  
3. Healing abutments are cleaned daily with a soft tooth-brush beginning the day after surgery.  
4. Smoking cessation is encouraged during the recovery period.  
5. Patients are evaluated after 3 weeks to assess for implant hygiene. Modifications to oral hygiene are made based on tissue condition (edema, erythema, etc.) and plaque control to the healing abutments.  
6. After 4-6 weeks of implant healing, PA films are taken to confirm implant osseointegration and to evaluate for crestal bone loss, abscess formation, and lack of integration. Provided PA films are benign, the implants are torque tested, and the implants are cleared for definitive restoration.

# S

1. Poor implant angulation: Implant angulation errors may occur in the planning stage and results in non-parallel or severely angled implants. Implant angulation errors may occur at the time of surgery due to failure to appropriately seat the surgical guide. Tissue supported guides must rest completely and evenly on the soft tissues. Bone supported guide errors typically result from inadequate tissue reflection and incomplete guide seating. Skeletal fixation pins add to the stability of the surgical guide.  
2. Implant failure: Implant failure can be minimized with ideal implant placement, placing implants in dense bone, implants with high insertion torque values, and with an appropriately designed final prosthesis with conservative distal extension.  
3. Wound dehiscence: Wound dehiscence is common whenever the mentalis muscle is reflected in an atrophic mandible. Wound dehiscence can be lessened with Vicryl suture placement to resuspend the mental muscle, closing a dry surgical site to avoid hematoma formation, appropriate mucosal closure, the use of membranes when necessary, smoking cessation, and an appropriately fitting interim prosthesis that places minimal pressure on the healing alveolar ridge and incision line. Areas of wound dehiscence will heal via secondary intent (see Figures 10.42 and 10.43 in Case Report 10.2) if treated with meticulous oral hygiene, peridex irrigations, and not wearing the interim removable dental appliance.  
4. Infection: Infections are rare with implant placement. Minor infections are treated with removal of inflamed tissue, peridex irrigations, and a short-term 5-day course of oral antibiotics. Grafting may be performed if implant threads are exposed. Significant infections are treated with implant removal, surgical site debridement, long-term oral antibiotics and close observation.

# Implant Placement Is Key

1. Implants are designed to be parallel, axially loaded, at a similar platform level, to maximize anterior-posterior (A-P) spread, and to maintain cross-arch stabilization.  
2. Implants should be placed symmetrically within the arches. For the maxilla, implants should be placed within the premolar and canine region provided the maxillary sinus allows. Additional implants may be placed in the lateral incisor region. Implants should not be placed within the central incisor position due to the proximity to the incisive canal and as this may lead to an increased thickness of the anterior denture which may lead to phonetic issues. For atrophic mandibles where implants cannot be placed posterior to the mental foramen, implants should be placed  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior

to the mental foramen to avoid the anterior loop of the mental nerve. If a single anterior implant is placed, it is best to offset the mandibular midline slightly as the midline of the mandibular denture has the thinnest portion of acrylic within the mandibular denture and this will increase the tendency to fracture the prosthesis during function.

3. Implants are designed to emerge ideally through the thicker intaglio surfaces of the removable dental appliance in the sites of future locator housings.  
4. Implants are designed to engage solid bone as determined via Hounsfield unit measurements. Solid bone will allow for initial implant stability and high insertion torque values. If during implant placement, low insertion torque values are measured, the placement of a wider diameter implant or a longer length implant into the osteotomy site will lead to increased primary stability and implant success.  
5. Due to the softer bone of the maxilla, the maxilla cannot handle divergent forces as well as the mandible. For significantly divergent maxillary implants, a bar prosthesis is recommended to allow for implant splinting and maximum retention (see Figure 10.58 in Case Report 10.4).  
6. Although locator abutments are advertised to correct  $40^{\circ}$  of total implant divergence ( $20^{\circ}$  per implant), it is advised to have no more than  $10^{\circ}$  of divergence per implant (20 total degrees of divergence). Significant implant angulation will make it more difficult for the patient to seat the removable prosthesis, will lead to increased wear of the locator housings and locator retention rings, and will place additional torsional and bending forces on the implants and their associated abutments.  
7. Implants should be placed at a similar platform level. Having implants at different platform levels will necessitate the use of varying abutment heights. Taller abutment heights are subject to more torsional pressure than shorter abutments, which can lead to abutment and/or implant failure.  
8. Implant placement should minimize anterior-posterior rocking forces and to allow for cross-arch stabilization of the prosthesis.  
9. As locator abutments have a very low profile, they are ideal in clinical situations with average or less than average inter-arch space. A minimum of  $9 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical restorative space is required for locator abutments.

# Key Points

1. A comprehensive treatment plan must be established between the surgeon and the restoring dentist. The comprehensive treatment plan should include discussions regarding the VDO, is alveoloplasty required,

total number of implants, locations of implants, divergence and angulations of implants, and will a new prosthesis be fabricated or will an existing prosthesis be retrofit for locator-type abutments.

2. Common causes of edentulism include aggressive periodontal disease, parafunctional habits (clenching, grinding), and lack of patient motivation regarding dental care and hygiene. An open-ended discussion with the patient is necessary to understand the etiology of their terminal dentition and to discuss implant restoration options and necessary implant and prosthesis maintenance. Locators are commonly utilized in patients with a prior history of dental neglect and poor oral hygiene as they are easier to clean and maintain than a fixed hybrid prosthesis. Fixed hybrid designs that fracture (especially with inappropriately long distal extensions), undergo implant failure or are unhygienic may be predictably converted to a removable prosthesis with locator-type attachments.  
3. For patients with existing dentition, extraction with simultaneous grafting can allow for the augmentation of key areas (canine, premolar, and molar sites) to allow for ideal implant position. For edentulous patients, a custom alveoloplasty reduction guide may be necessary to establish sufficient VDO, to mask the prosthesis transition line, and to allow for ideal implant placement within solid bone and at similar platform levels.

4. The fabrication of new or interim conventional removable denture will aid in the establishment of the VDO, ideal patient aesthetics (lip projection, tooth show, tooth and gingival color and contours, and tooth shape and position) and will allow for the exportation of DICOM files utilizing fiducial (radiographic) markers for VSP and guide fabrication. For edentulous or partially edentulous patients with no current prosthesis, a base plate with a wax rim may be fabricated for scanning (see Figures 10.1 and 10.2). The importance of the wax rim is to establish the appropriate VDO prior to scanning. When scanning patients with current conventional dentures or removable partial appliances, ensure that the prosthesis has no metal substructures, claps, or crowns as these metal artifacts will affect the visibility and usability of the DICOM files.

5. It is recommended that patients are evaluated annually to examine implants for signs of failure and poor oral hygiene, to examine the fit and comfort of the intaglio surface of the prosthesis to the soft tissues and of the implant locator abutments to the housings, and to evaluate for housing fracture and locator retention rings wear. As locator retention rings wear over time, it is recommended that they are evaluated and replaced annually. An appropriately designed prosthesis should have areas of support along the intaglio surface that are supported on the implants and on the soft tissues.

Case Report 10.2: Mandibular alveoloplasty reduction guide. A 62-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of poor retention to his mandibular denture. The patient has been edentulous for over 30 years and has significant atrophy to the alveolar process of bone and a

knife edge ridge deformity. DICOM files were exported to allow for virtual surgical planning to create a custom alveoloplasty reduction guide and surgical guide (see Figures 10.28 through 10.43).

Case Report 10.3. Locator abutments for added retention with a removable partial denture (RPD). A 74-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of poor retention to her mandibular RPD and pain and irritation to her gums while masticating. A CBCT scan was obtained to create a DICOM file and an i-TERO digital impression was taken to obtain an STL file for exportation. Virtual surgical planning was performed to allow for the placement of four mandibular implants for locator

abutments. Due to the significant atrophy of the posterior mandible, 6-mm-tall implants were placed posteriorly to preserve  $2.5\mathrm{mm}$  of space above the mandibular canal. Eight-millimeter implants were placed anteriorly. The patient's pre-existing mandibular RPD was retrofitted with locator abutments to give her added retention and to redistribute the pressure from the soft tissues to her posterior implants (see Figures 10.44 through 10.55).

Case Report 10.4. Maxillary implant placement for custom milled bar with palateless prosthesis. A 68-year-old female patient presents with a chief complaint of failing maxillary teeth and desiring a palateless prosthesis. Due to concerns of fabricating a removable palateless prosthesis, a custom bar will be designed for maximum retention. Fifteen millimeters of vertical restorative space was created to allow for ideal fabrication
