A cyst is defined as a space-occupying lesion with a connective-tissue outer wall and an inner wall (typically, epithelial tissues) lining. They are typically unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies with sclerotic borders. Cystic lesions of the jaws are divided into odontogenic cysts and non-odontogenic cystic lesions. Cysts typically have the following characteristics:

1. Epithelium lining and fluid filled  
2. Occupy space, and displace or replace normal surrounding tissues  
3. May resorb or displace adjacent teeth  
4. May cause expansion of the bone  
5. May cause neurosensory changes  
6. Generally, do not affect tooth vitality

Odontogenic cysts arise from the enamel organ. The epithelial sources are the cell rests of Malassez, reduced enamel epithelium, and remnants of the dental lamina. Common non-odontogenic cystic lesions include the traumatic bone cavity, aneurysmal bone cysts, and nasopalatine cysts. All lesions should be treated individually based on their unique histopathology, aggressiveness, and clinical and radiographic presentation.

# Odontogenic Cysts

# Periapical Cysts

These cystic lesions arise from a necrotic dental pulp as a result of dental caries or trauma. Histologically, periapical cysts are inflammatory cysts with stratified squamous epithelial linings. Clinically, pulp testing should be completed to verify the presence of a necrotic pulp. Root canal therapy, apical surgery, or extraction of the offending tooth is required for necrotic pulps. Frequently, the authors have encountered cystic lesions associated with a root-canal-treated tooth that are not periapical cysts histologically. Determination of tooth vitality is paramount to avoid unnecessary and costly endodontic therapy. Enucleation and curettage as well as extraction or endodontic therapy of the offending tooth are required for treatment. Small

periapical cysts or granulomas  $(< 1\mathrm{cm})$  may resolve without surgical therapy. Recurrence after enucleation and curettage is not expected.

# Dentigerous Cysts

Dentigerous cysts are believed to arise from an accumulation of fluid between the crown of an unerupted tooth. The epithelial origin is believed to be the reduced enamel epithelium of the dental follicle. Dentigerous cysts typically occur within the second and third decades of life. Radiographically, these lesions are associated with the crown of an unerupted tooth and are radiolucent. Dentigerous cysts vary in size and produce no calcified structures. Dentigerous cysts are treated by enucleation. Large dentigerous cysts may be treated with marsupialization, especially if wide surgical access is difficult to obtain. Recurrence is rare. Histologic studies of the entire lining are required due to the potential presence of a mural ameloblastoma.

# Keratinizing Odontogenic Tumor (Odontogenic Keratocyst)

The odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) has been described by the World Health Organization as a keratinizing odontogenic tumor (KOT). This is primarily due to its aggressive behaviors, which more resemble those of an invasive tumor, and its high recurrence rates compared with a "benign" cyst. OKCs occur over a wide age range, peaking within the second and third decades of life. Histologically, the basement membrane is flattened and corrugated and has basal palisading of the epithelial cells with parakeratin noted. Within the lumen, large amounts of keratin may be noted. Radiographically, OKCs can present as unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies and can present as small, non-expansile lesions or very large, expansile lesions. OKCs have recurrence rates approaching  $25 - 30\%$ . Multiple OKCs may be seen in patients with nevoid basal cell syndrome (Gorlin syndrome). Treatment for these lesions includes long-term decompression or marsupialization (with or without future enucleation and curettage),

enucleation and curettage with adjunctive liquid nitrogen application, aggressive removal of adjacent cyst cavity bone (peripheral ostectomy), application of Carnoy's solution to the cystic cavity, and/or resection. Resection may be considered for large lesions that perforate the cortex, are difficult to access and visualize, and for recurrent lesions. Inadequate removal of cystic remnants may lead to a recurrence in an area of the maxillofacial region that is difficult or impossible to surgically treat (e.g., the posterior maxilla or ramus–condyle regions). Long-term follow-up is recommended due to the high percentage of recurrence, especially with enucleation and curettage.

# Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst (Gorlin's Cyst)

The calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) is unique in that it is the only odontogenic cyst that produces calcified structures. Radiographically, a COC can present as a mixed, radiolucent, or radiopaque lesion. These cysts have also been reported to arise in conjunction with other lesions, such as odontomas and ameloblastic fibro-odontomas. COCs are typically identified in adults through the third and fifth decades. Histologically, the cysts demonstrate an odontogenic epithelium, a palisaded basement membrane with reverse polarity, loose stellate-reticulum-appearing cells, and eosinophilic "ghost cells." Ghost cells may calcify, leading to the calcified structures within radiographs. Rarely, these cysts can take on clinical and histologic characteristics of odontogenic tumors. COCs are treated with enucleation and curettage. Recurrence is uncommon. Histologic review of these lesions is required to rule out other more aggressive lesions associated with these cysts.

# Non-odontogenic Cysts

# Nasopalatine Duct Cyst (Incisive Canal Cyst)

Nasopalatine duct cysts originate from the epithelial remnants of the nasopalatine duct, which typically disappears prior to birth. The cyst is located between the central incisors and may grow large enough to be palpable behind the central incisors on the palate. The teeth are typically vital. Radiographically, the cyst presents as a large radiolucency involving the incisive canal and central incisors. Small lesions are asymptomatic. Symptomatic nasopalatine duct cysts (i.e., those with pain and/or swelling) suggest an underlying infection. Pain, swelling, and/or continued enlargement warrant surgical excision via enucleation. Depending on the size of the cyst, the surgical approach may be either palatal or facial. Recurrence is rare.

# Aneurysmal Bone Cyst

Like the traumatic bone cyst, this lesion is not a true cystic lesion. The mandible is the most common maxillofacial site involved. These lesions are typically unilocular

radiolucencies and may be expansile and painful. Teeth are vital. Tooth mobility, root displacement, and/ or resorption may be seen. No bruit or thrill is appreciated. Aspiration may produce hemorrhagic fluid. On histopathologic exam, hemorrhagic tissue with endothelial cells, connective tissue, and possibly multinucleated giant cells may be seen. Treatment is curettage, typically done at the time of excisional biopsy. Large, destructive lesions may require resection. Bleeding is typically encountered upon opening of the region, but it is usually controlled with the removal of the lesion. Aneurysmal bone cysts can be considered a low-flow vascular lesion. Recurrence is rare with complete removal of the lesion. Serial radiographic follow-up is performed to ensure bone fill of the area.

# Traumatic Bone Cyst (Idiopathic Bone Cavity)

Histologically, the traumatic bone cyst is not a true cystic lesion. The name suggests a traumatic origin, but there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. Traumatic bone cysts are commonly identified in adolescents and young adults. Teeth are generally vital and are not displaced. Traumatic bone cysts are unilocular radiolucencies that may scallop superiorly into the alveolus and between teeth roots. They may be expansile and are generally asymptomatic. Upon biopsy, an empty cavity is encountered without a discernible cystic lining, thus the lesions nomenclature has been modified to idiopathic bone cavity. Curettage of the cavity stimulates bleeding into the cavity and generally causes bone formation. Typically, no further treatment is required. Serial films are obtained to ensure bone fill of the area. Recurrence is typically not seen.

# Procedure: Enucleation and Curettage

1. The patient is placed in a supine position. After endotracheal intubation, the patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
2. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is infiltrated within the area of the lesion, and regional blocks may also be utilized.  
3. The flap design should be such that it allows for the final incision closure to be placed over supporting bone to prevent tension from the invagination of the tissues within the enucleated cavity, resulting in dehiscence of the site.  
4. Wide surgical access can typically be obtained with a sulcular incision; care should be taken to avoid tearing the mucosal flap. If vertical releasing incisions are required, they should be designed such that the base of the flap is wider than the apex.  
5. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is elevated to expose the outer cortex of the lesion.  
6. An 18-gauge needle should be inserted into the center of the lesion and aspirated (see Figure 53.4 in

Case Report 53.1). This allows the surgeon to determine if the lesion is of vascular origin.

7. A handpiece or Kerrison rongeur may be used to remove the outer cortex overlying the lesion.  
8. Curettes are used to elevate the lesion off of the bony wall circumferentially. Care should be made not to tear or perforate the lesion.  
9. The lesion is sent for final pathology (see Figure 53.8 in Case Report 53.1).  
10. The bone cavity should be painted with methylene blue to mark all aspects where the lesion and bone were in contact.  
11. Using a diamond bur, a peripheral ostectomy (see Figure 53.9 in Case Report 53.1) is performed on all marked surfaces. The peripheral ostectomy may also be performed with curettes.  
12. The site is irrigated with copious amounts of sterile water to remove all debris from the surgical site.  
13. Biological membranes may be used to overlay the surgical site or cavity.  
14. The flap is repositioned and secured with individual horizontal mattress sutures interdentally with a resorbable suture. If vertical releasing flaps were used, they are closed in a standard fashion.  
15. A periodontal pack dressing may be used to protect the surgical site. The dressing remains in place for approximately one week and is removed at the follow-up appointment.

# Case Reports

Case Report 53.1. Le Fort I Downfracture for a large odontogenic keratocyst. A 17-year-old male presents with a referral from his dentist for the evaluation and treatment of his third molars. An orthopantomogram demonstrated a grossly displaced tooth #1 and a fluid level within the right maxillary sinus (see Figure 53.1). On questioning, the patient reported right-sided obstructed nasal breathing and congestion. A computed tomography scan was obtained that suggested a large cystic structure obliterating the right maxillary sinus with penetration into the right nasal cavity (see Figures 53.2 and 53.3). Aspiration of the area produced a clear, straw-colored fluid (see Figure 53.4). An incisional biopsy was performed through a lateral sinus approach (see Figure 53.5), and a cystic lining was encountered and biopsied. Histopathological slide analysis suggested an odontogenic keratocyst. Due to the size, location, and recurrence rate of the cyst, wide surgical access was planned via a Le Fort I osteotomy. Erich arch bars were placed, the osteotomy design was marked with a sterile pen, and miniplates were secured to the uncut maxilla (see Figure 53.6) prior to osteotomy. The mini-plates were removed, and the Le Fort I osteotomy was performed. The cyst was enucleated in its entirety (see Figures 53.7 and 53.8), and a peripheral ostectomy was performed with a large round

# Key Points

1. For large cysts, incisional biopsies are recommended so that the surgical approach and definitive treatment can be based on the aggressiveness and recurrence rates of the type of cyst involved.  
2. Wide surgical access is key to successful enucleation in order to allow for adequate visualization of the entire cystic cavity.  
3. Every attempt should be made to remove the cyst in its entirety to minimize recurrence. Aggressive cysts (OKCs) are treated with curettage and/or peripheral ostectomy following enucleation.  
4. Immediate reconstruction is warranted for lesions removed in their entirety and for lesions with low recurrence rates. Damaged adjacent structures (i.e., the nasal septum) should be repaired at the time of cyst enucleation.  
5. For large cysts that have significantly weakened the surrounding bone, the placement of prophylactic rigid fixation is often necessary to prevent iatrogenic fracture of the mandible at the time of cyst removal or within the early postoperative period.

bur (see Figure 53.9). The right inferior turbinate was in contact with the cyst and was removed with the specimen. A septoplasty and nasal antrostomy were also performed to improve nasal breathing. The patient was placed into maxillomandibular fixation, and the pre-bent mini-plates were secured to the maxilla using the predrilled screw holes. The Le Fort I osteotomy provided excellent access to the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity, allowed for repair of involved and damaged structures, and resulted in no external scars or changes in the patient's overall appearance (see Figures 53.1 through 53.10).

Case Report 53.2. Weber Ferguson approach for a large odontogenic keratocyst. A 33-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of pain and pressure to his left cheek. A computed tomography scan was obtained that suggested a large cystic structure obliterating the left maxillary sinus with penetration into the left nasal cavity and orbital floor (see Figures 53.11 and 53.12). An incisional biopsy was performed through a lateral sinus approach and a histopathological diagnosis of an odontogenic keratocyst was made. Due to the size of the cyst and its penetration into the lateral nasal

cavity and the orbital floor, surgical access was obtained via a Weber Ferguson approach (see Figure 53.13). The cyst was enucleated in its entirety (see Figures 53.15 through 53.17) and a peripheral ostectomy was performed with a large round bur. A calvarian block graft supported with titanium mesh was used to reconstruct the antral wall bony defect (see Figure 53.18). The Weber Ferguson approach allowed excellent access for the repair of all involved with minimal external scars or changes in the patient's overall appearance (see Figures 53.11 through 53.20).

Case Report 53.3. Nasopalatine Duct Cyst (Incisive Canal Cyst). A 78-year-old male presents with a referral from his dentist for the evaluation and treatment of a mass located within the maxillary midline. The patient was asymptomatic and his anterior teeth tested vital. A panorex film was obtained that demonstrated a heart-shaped mass between the central incisors. A CBCT scan was obtained

that identified a lesion suspicious for a nasopalatine duct cyst. As the patient had non-restorable maxillary teeth, the patient was treatment planned for maxillary extractions with associated alveoloplasty, cyst enucleation, and immediate maxillary denture placement. The specimen was sent to pathology and a diagnosis of a nasopalatine duct cyst was confirmed (see Figures 53.21 through 53.24).

Case Report 53.4. Idiopathic Bone Cavity (Traumatic Bone Cyst). A 17-year-old male presents for the evaluation of an area of suspicion identified by his dentist on routine plain films. The patient denies pain, tooth sensitivity, changes to his occlusion, swellings, or numbness to the site. Pulp testing revealed vitality of the surrounding teeth. A CBCT scan was obtained that demonstrated a  $25\mathrm{mm} \times 18\mathrm{mm}$  radiolucent area to the right posterior mandible. The patient underwent exploration of the site with the intent to biopsy the presumed cyst. Upon entering

the cavity, no discernable lining was encountered and the diagnosis of an idiopathic bone cavity (previous nomenclature; traumatic bone cyst) was rendered. The surgical site/bone defect was aggressively curetted to stimulate bleeding from the walls of the empty cavity to allow for blood clot formation. The site was closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures. A CBCT scan was obtained 12 months later that showed complete bone fill and consolidation to the bone defect (see Figures 53.25 through 53.28).
