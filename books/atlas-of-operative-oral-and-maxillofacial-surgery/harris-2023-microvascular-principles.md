# Indications for Microvascular Reconstruction of Maxillofacial Defects

1. Composite mandibular reconstruction  
2. Moderate to large soft tissue reconstruction in malignancy (i.e., hemiglossectomy and buccal carcinomas)  
3. Reconstruction of stage III osteoradionecrosis (bone and/or composite defects)  
4. Reconstruction of large soft tissue defects and soft tissue radionecrosis  
5. Large maxillectomy defects where obturation is unsuitable reconstruction  
6. Orbitomaxillary defects  
7. Benign, anterior mandibular defects with or without soft tissue deficiency

# Contraindications for Microvascular Reconstruction of Maxillofacial Defects

1. Medical status unsuitable for prolonged surgical procedure (advanced age alone is not a disqualifier)  
2. Medical history of hypercoaguable state (e.g., sickle cell anemia, Factor V Leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, or morbid obesity)  
3. Significant peripheral vascular disease

# Microvascular Principles and Technique

A thorough preoperative evaluation is undertaken prior to performing any vascularized tissue flap. A complete medical history and physical examination are undertaken, including laboratory and imaging studies as indicated. Many patients presenting with oral cancers have significant medical comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, polysubstance abuse, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) that require evaluation and optimization prior to surgery.

Accurate assessment of the planned ablative defect and its consequences on flap selection, as well as the final prosthetic rehabilitation planning, must be performed prior to surgical therapy. Choosing the donor site is based on the types of tissues to be replaced, the prosthodontic

requirements, and the quality of the donor site. The surgeon's familiarity and success with the flap choice are also considered. For example, in our practice, most oral cancer defects are reconstructed with radial forearm, anterolateral thigh, and fibula free flaps. The reliability with these flaps is likely to be much higher, and the complication rate much lower, than a flap that is rarely utilized. When treatment planning any microvascular reconstruction, a "backup" reconstructive plan is also devised in the event that the primary flap choice is unusable or inadequate.

Specialized equipment is required to perform microvascular procedures. Equipment typically includes microvascular surgical instruments, microsurgical anastomotic couplers, surgical loupes, an operating microscope, microsurgical sutures and vascular clamps, Doppler ultrasound (external and internal), and warmed, heparinized irrigation fluids. Microsurgical instruments should be lightweight and made of titanium, measure  $10 - 18\mathrm{cm}$  in length, and have low closing pressures. Magnetization of nontitanium instruments can increase the difficulty of positioning microsurgical needles. All instruments should be carefully inspected prior to the start of any case, and a reserve set should be available. It is a common occurrence to discover a bent instrument that needs to be replaced. A typical microsurgical instrument set consists of multiple jeweler's forceps (curved and straight), microsurgical adventitial scissors (curved and straight), microsurgical suture scissors, vein dilator forceps, vascular clamp applying forceps, and microsurgical needle holders. The vascular clamp set contains multiple arterial and venous, single and double approximating clamps with or without frames of varying size. Clamps can be disposable or reusable, depending on the surgeon's preference. Requirements for clamp pressures depend on vessel size and type; the pressure should be light enough to prevent leakage and damage to the vessel walls.

Venous anastomotic coupler devices are being used routinely in many institutions for venous anastomosis (see Figures 71.1, 71.10 and 71.11 in Case Report 71.1). Studies

have demonstrated an equivalent patency rate when compared to handsewn anastomoses, with significantly shorter anastomosis times and higher anastomosis strength. The Synovis™ anastomotic coupler (Birmingham, Alabama, USA) (see Figure 71.1) is routinely used at our institution. The device can be used with vessel sizes from 1.0 to  $4.0\mathrm{mm}$ . Arterial coupling is also possible with this device. The anastomotic coupler consists of two polyethylene rings in which several stainless-steel pins are embedded. The vessels are measured for the appropriate size, the vessels are passed through the rings, and the walls are everted over the steel pins. The coupler is closed, and the venous walls are sealed together by piercing the opposing ring.

The flap and pedicle should be routinely irrigated to prevent desiccation. Warmed lactated Ringer's solution is adequate. Heparinized normal saline  $(10\mathrm{u / mL})$  is used to irrigate the vessel lumens during anastomosis. A 24-gauge angiocatheter is used for delivery. Ophthalmic cellulose wick spears can be used to absorb excess fluid or blood if needed. Papaverine solution or plain  $4\%$  lidocaine can also be utilized to help minimize vasospasm if required. Epinephrine solutions should not be used.

Magnification is required during flap harvest. Typically, surgical loupes with  $2.5 \times$  or greater magnification are utilized by the surgeons. Magnification for vascular anastomosis is performed with a surgical microscope. The surgical microscope should be dual headed, have a variable focal length, provide controls for focus and zoom for

the two surgeons, and be ergonomic. The scope should be adjustable in order to allow for the procedure to be performed while sitting or standing.

Recipient vessel selection is a critical aspect of successful microvascular surgery. The reconstructive surgeon must impress this point on the ablative surgeon prior to the procedure. Unnecessary removal of usable recipient veins can make the reconstructive process difficult and prolong the surgical time. In most maxillofacial reconstructions, the facial vessels can be utilized for anastomosis (see Figure 71.3 in Case Report 71.1). The external and internal jugular veins are also used frequently, as are other easily accessible branches of the external carotid. Frequently, in maxillofacial reconstruction, the end-to-end anastomosis method is utilized; however, the end-to-side anastomosis method can also be used, particularly if the internal jugular is the recipient vein. The end-to-end is a technically simpler procedure.

Preparation for anastomosis begins with maximizing exposure to the recipient vessels. Determination of recipient and flap vessel geometry is then ascertained. Proper geometry should prevent twisting, kinking, or tension on the pedicle (see Figure 71.4 in Case Report 71.1). In most cases, a partial inset of the flap is performed prior to anastomosis. Bone contouring and placement on a reconstruction plate are typically undertaken prior to pedicle division and flap transfer to the maxillofacial region, where only minor adjustments are needed for final inset. Flaps should be positioned prior to anastomosis to ensure that proper pedicle geometry and length are available.

The vessels are positioned to allow for an end-to-end, tension-free anastomosis. Single vascular clamps are placed on the arteries and veins. Flow is verified from the recipient artery. The adventitia is removed for approximately  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the cut edge of each vessel with adventitial scissors (see Figure 71.5 in Case Report 71.1). The cut edge is inspected to ensure no irregularities are present, and the lumen is inspected for intimal damage, separation, plaques, and clots (see Figure 71.6 in Case Report 71.1). If needed, the vessel can be recut and the process repeated until adequate. Double approximating clamps are applied, and the vessel ends are brought into close approximation (see Figure 71.7 in Case Report 71.1). A background material is placed under the vessels to aid in visualization. Heparinized normal saline is used frequently to keep the vessel lumens open and free from debris. A 9-0 or 10-0 nylon suture on a tapered needle is used for the anastomosis. The anastomotic coupler may also be used.

The authors typically perform the arterial anastomosis first. Two sutures,  $180^{\circ}$  apart, are placed and suspended on a frame or tucked under adjacent tissue to provide slight tension (see Figure 71.8 in Case Report 71.1). Three more sutures are placed, halving the remaining distance. The clamp is turned over, and the anastomosis

is inspected to verify proper placement of the sutures and recognize any back wall injuries. The same process is completed on the back side of the anastomosis (see Figure 71.9 in Case Report 71.1). The double approximating clamp is removed. The veins can be hand sewn in the same manner, or a venous coupler can be utilized (see Figures 71.10 and 71.11 in Case Report 71.1).

The single vascular clamps are removed, venous side first, and the anastomoses are inspected for any significant leaks. Small areas of leakage will typically resolve, whereas larger ones may need an additional suture. The minimum number of sutures possible should be used to perform the anastomosis. Strip testing of the venous anastomosis is used to verify blood flow out of the flap. The flap is allowed to perfuse, irrigated with warmed fluid, and inspected for adequate revascularization. Once revascularization is confirmed, the remainder of the inset is performed. Prior to closure of the wound, the anastomosis is inspected, and an implantable Doppler ultrasound transducer is secured to monitor the venous (and arterial) side (see Figure 71.12 in Case Report 71.1). This is particularly useful to monitor bone flaps without a skin paddle, which are commonly used in benign, mandibular defects.

Postoperative management of the patient begins in the operating room. There must be clear communication between the anesthesiologist and surgeon regarding the extubation plans for the patient. It is not unusual for many patients, especially those with tracheostomies, to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilator support postoperatively. Extubation is then performed, usually within 24 hours. Many patients with benign defects do not require elective tracheostomies and are extubated in the operating room. Extubation is performed in a calm, gentle manner. Significant increases in blood pressure and excessive patient movement may cause wound bleeding, hematoma formation, and/or damage to the vascular anastomosis.

The nursing staff in the ICU must be educated about patient care and flap monitoring. The patient should be well hydrated; have adequate levels of analgesia; be well oxygenated; have a stable, nonlabile blood pressure; and remain calm. The use of constrictive tracheostomy ties is prohibited. The use of vasopressors should be avoided, and sedation may be needed to manage anxiety and restlessness. Prophylaxis for alcohol withdrawal should be utilized in patients whose history warrants it or if signs manifest regardless of history.

Anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents should be started on admission to the ICU. Multiple agents have been used for this, and they vary depending on the institution;  $325\mathrm{mg}$  aspirin daily and low-molecular-weight heparin injections (deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis dose) are commonly used. There is no consensus as to which

method is the best agent. These agents can increase the risk of postoperative hematoma formation and hemorrhage. Postoperative antibiotic coverage is surgeon dependent but typically continues for 72 hours. Routine laboratory measurements are surgeon dependent.

A member of the surgical team should assess the patient and inspect the flap at a minimum of every 4 hours for the first 72 hours. Most vascular issues with the flap will appear within this period, although late problems can rarely be seen. Donor sites should have vascular checks and drain outputs monitored at least every 2 hours. Nursing staff should inspect the flap and verify a Doppler signal (external or internal) every hour during this period. A prominent perforator can be marked on the skin paddle for easy location for the nursing staff when using an external Doppler (see Figure 71.2). Notification of any changes in flap appearance or Doppler signals should be relayed to the surgeon. Rates of successful salvage of flaps are high with early intervention. Signs of vascular issues may include pallor, congested-bluish or cold skin paddle, formation of neck swelling or hematoma, poor capillary refill, rapid capillary refill, and loss or decrease in Doppler signals. The use of implantable Doppler probes for buried flaps can cause false negatives and false positives that may result in unnecessary return visits to the operating room for flap inspection. Without complications, the typical ICU stay is 72 hours, and the total hospital course is approximately 7-10 days before the patient is ready for discharge.

# Complications

1. Venous insufficiency (congestion): Clinical examination may exhibit a flap with a purple or bluish color, decreased capillary refill time (<3 seconds), dark blood

at pinprick, venous oozing at flap edges, and increased edema (see Case Report 72.2. Complication-Venous flap congestion in Chapter 72).

2. Arterial insufficiency: Clinical examination may exhibit a flap with a pale color, a lack of capillary refill, may not bleed at pinprick, and a lack of turgor on palpation.

Treatment of venous and arterial insufficiency involves surgical exploration, evacuation of hematoma or seroma if present, surgical revision of anastomosis, pedicle evaluation for twisting/kinking, thrombectomy, and thrombolytic agent administration if thrombus is detected. Internal Doppler implantation is recommended.

# Key Points

1. Microvascular reconstructions often permit single-stage ablative and reconstructive surgeries and allow the ability to reconstruct 3D defects (skin, deep soft tissue, and bone) of significant size.  
2. Microvascular reconstructions typically demonstrate a success rate approaching  $95\%$  within the head and neck region.  
3. Microvascular reconstructions of continuity defects of the maxilla and mandible allow for the placement of endosteal dental implants with a high success rate, shortened prosthetic treatment times, and early return to function.

cortical expansion, and scalloped margin. An incision biopsy was performed, and a definitive diagnosis of an ameloblastoma was made. The patient was treated with mandibular resection with  $1\mathrm{cm}$  margins and immediate reconstruction with a free vascularized fibula (see Figures 71.3 through 71.13).
