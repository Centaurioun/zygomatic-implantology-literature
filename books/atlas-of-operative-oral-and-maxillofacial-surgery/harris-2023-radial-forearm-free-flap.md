A means of obtaining free tissue transfer for the replacement of moderate to large soft tissue defects associated with ablative wounds.

# Indications

1. Utilized for the reconstruction of moderate to large soft tissue defects related to traumatic, congenital, and benign or malignant defects  
2. Most commonly utilized for the replacement of oral and oropharyngeal soft tissues due to ablative treatment of malignancies

# Contraindications

1. Vascular anatomy disruption due to prior surgical procedures or trauma in the area of interest  
2. Anatomical variants precluding the use of a radial forearm flap: aberrant or no radial artery, absent branching from the superficial arch to the index finger and thumb, and lack of connections between the superficial and palmar arches  
3. Hereditary or acquired coagulopathy, which may lead to flap loss  
4. Inability of the patient to medically tolerate anesthesia and a prolonged surgical procedure

# Anatomy

Vascular supply: The radial artery supplies the arterial flow to the flap. The radial artery runs the length of the arm and terminates in the deep palmar arch. The ulnar artery supplies the superficial palmar arch. Anastomoses occur between the two that supply collateral circulation to the hand. The radial artery gives off multiple perforating branches to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and radius bone of the volar forearm. The lateral intermuscular septal perforators are found between the flexor carpi radialis and the brachioradialis muscles. Venous drainage of the flap is from the deep radial veins and the superficial system. The superficial system allows for better anastomosis due to a larger caliber, but it may be unreliable with small flaps. The arterial vessel caliber  $(2 - 3\mathrm{mm})$  and vein caliber  $(1 - 4\mathrm{mm})$  allow for easier anastomosis. A long vascular pedicle is available for most oral cancer defect reconstructions.

# Radial Forearm Flap Landmarks

1. Proximal wrist crease  
2. Antecubital fossa  
3. Superficial veins (cephalic)  
4. Flexor carpi radialis tendon  
5. Brachioradialis muscle  
6. Flexor carpi ulnaris  
7. Palmaris longus tendon (when present)

# Radial Forearm Flap Layers

1. Skin  
2. Subcutaneous tissue  
3. Antebrachial fascia  
4. Superficial veins  
5. Radial artery and vena comitantes; lateral intermuscular septum  
6. Paratenon  
7. Forearm tendons

# Radial Forearm Flap Technique

1. Preoperatively, a history of wrist surgery or trauma needs to be ascertained, as certain conditions may restrict safe flap harvest. An Allen's test is performed to verify collateral circulation from the ulnar artery. Questionable findings dictate that other vascular studies (e.g., color Doppler) be performed to verify adequate circulation prior to performing the procedure. Inadequate circulation between the superficial and deep palmar arches increases the risk of vascular insufficiency to the hand and thumb if the flap is harvested. Preoperatively, the patient is instructed to not allow intravenous attempts or venipuncture in the chosen arm. This is also recorded as an order within the patient's medical record.  
2. The flap design is drawn on the volar forearm with a surgical skin marker. Superficial veins and the radial artery are also marked for identification. The distal margin is  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  proximal to the wrist crease. The ulnar margin is typically the flexor carpi ulnaris. The radial margin is typically the brachioradialis muscle, but can extend over to the dorsal surface. The proximal extent is dependent on the size of flap needed for the reconstruction. The entire volar surface skin can be harvested if needed.

3. Surgical prep and draping are performed. A sterile tourniquet is applied to the upper arm.  
4. The limb is exsanguinated with an elastic wrap, and the tourniquet is inflated to  $250\mathrm{mmHg}$ . The tourniquet "uptime" is recorded. The dorsal wrist has a rolled lap sponge placed underneath, and an open lap sponge across the palm is secured with clamps to the arm board. This is used to extend the wrist slightly and secure the arm.  
5. The dissection is carried out on the distal end of the flap. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are incised. The dissection is carried down to the flexor tendons of the forearm. Subfascial dissection proceeds to identify the radial artery, venae comitantes, and any potentially usable superficial veins.  
6. The radial artery is identified between the flexor carpi radialis tendon and the brachioradialis (see Figure 74.2 in Case Report 74.1). A small section of the radial artery and its two venae comitantes is exposed. These are ligated and divided.  
7. The dissection at this point can be advanced from the ulnar or radial side. The paratenon of the underlying tendons must be maintained. The skin paddle and pedicle are attached to the deeper tissues. Dissection should identify the palmaris longus tendon. In some cases (e.g., lip reconstruction), this may be included with the flap to use as a suspensory mechanism. Care is taken to not damage the superficial sensory branch of the radial nerve during the dissection. Damage may leave neurosensory dysfunction of the dorsal thumb and index finger.  
8. The intermuscular septum separates the brachioradialis and the flexor carpi radialis. The intermuscular septum contains the vascular pedicle. The deep margin of the pedicle is released by ligating and dividing branches to the deeper musculature and radius bone.  
9. The proximal edge of the skin paddle is incised, and a wavy proximal skin incision is made to a point just distal to the antecubital fossa and connects with the proximal end of the skin paddle. The proximal tissue flaps are elevated in the subdermal plane to expose the underlying musculature.  
10. The pedicle is dissected along the intermuscular septum to the point where the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis intersect. The fascia between the two muscles are separated proximally, taking care not to damage the pedicle underneath. The brachioradialis muscle and flexor carpi radialis are retracted. The dissection of the pedicle continues in a proximal direction. Multiple perforators are ligated and divided to free up the vascular pedicle. The recurrent radial artery is typically the endpoints of proximal dissection. The venae comitantes frequently are larger or co-join in this region.  
11. The tourniquet is released, and "downtime" is recorded. The flap is allowed to reperfuse for 15-20 minutes (see Figure 74.3 in Case Report 74.1). Hemostasis of the

flap and the forearm wound bed is achieved with microclips or bipolar cautery during this reperfusion. Verification of adequate vascular supply to the flap and hand is verified during this time.

12. The proximal pedicle is divided and moved to the oral cavity for inset and anastomosis (see Figure 74.4 in Case Report 74.1).  
13. The wound bed is closed with dermal sutures and staples. Attempts to cover tendons of the forearm with muscle are made prior to closure. A suction drain is placed in the forearm prior to closure.  
14. The defect is reconstructed with a full-thickness or split-thickness skin graft. The authors typically utilize a full-thickness skin graft, which provides thicker coverage of the forearm tendons. A wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and a  $45^{\circ}$  dorsal wrist splint are applied. The authors typically utilize a dorsally placed arterial line wrist splint, cast padding, Kerlix gauze, tape, and an Ace wrap to secure the wrist and finger position. The fingers are checked for adequate capillary refill, and the wrist should be in a functional position. Poor capillary refill indicates a vascular compromise. If noted, the splint and dressing should be removed and replaced. The VAC and splint are left in place for 7 days prior to evaluating the amount of skin graft success. The suction drain is removed when drain output is less than  $25\mathrm{mL}$  over 24 hours.

# Complications

1. Damage to the vascular pedicle: May result in flap loss, but may be repaired if a small-side wall defect occurs.  
2. Ischemia to hand and digits: Signs include pallor, diminished capillary refill of the hand and thumb after flap harvest, and pain. Late signs may be frank ischemia and necrosis. Reconstruction of the radial artery with a vein graft may be required. Regular vascular checks of the hand and fingers intraoperatively and postoperatively (once each hour) are needed to verify adequate vascular supply. Forearm dressing should be loosened or removed and changed if poor vascular supply is noted due to possible compression in the postoperative period.  
3. Skin graft loss: Partial loss or total loss is possible with any shearing movements of the graft postoperatively. Dorsal wrist splints are used to minimize hand movement. VAC therapy is used to improve graft success as well. Partial graft loss is managed with local wound therapy, but may require further attempts at grafting or rotational flaps to close the defect over the flexor tendons.  
4. Hematoma of the forearm  
5. Wound infection  
6. Neuroma, or neurosensory dysfunction of the hand or digits  
7. Wrist stiffness and grip strength decrease, and loss of range of motion

# Key Points

1. Flap harvest requires meticulous dissection of the vascular pedicle. Magnification and an experienced, microvascular-trained assistant surgeon are ideal.  
2. Preoperative verification of collateral blood flow is required prior to flap harvest. Potential necrosis with loss of digit hand function may occur with no collateral circulation.

3. Wound complications with tendon exposure are the most commonly seen complication. Careful graft technique, full-thickness graft use, adequate wrist immobilization, and early recognition and management of graft failure are imperative to minimize postoperative issues.  
4. Perioperative antibiotic coverage is continued for 72 hours postoperatively. Sterile technique is used to change any dressings associated with the wound. Forearm infections can cause significant morbidity and disability of the arm

alveolus and chronic maxillary sinusitis was identified. The patient was treated with a "medallion" radial forearm flap to close the defect. The flap pedicle was tunneled through the soft tissue of the cheek, and anastomosis with the facial vessels was utilized (see Figures 74.1 through 74.6).
