Osteomyelitis: Inflammation of the osseous medulla.

# General Principles of Management of Osteomyelitis (Acute and Chronic)

1. A definitive diagnosis of osteomyelitis can only be made via bone biopsy with histopathological examination and staining, and routine microbiologic culture and sensitivities (aerobic, anaerobic, Tb, and fungal).  
2. All forms of osteomyelitis are managed with a combination of removal of the source of the infection, bone removal or resection to healthy, bleeding bone margins, reestablishment of blood flow to the involved area, and antibiotic therapy.  
3. All potential sources of infection are eradicated. Decayed and mobile teeth within the involved area should be extracted, all fixation plates and screws should be removed, and intraoral and cutaneous fistulae are resected.  
4. All necrotic and involved bone must be completely removed to expose healthy bleeding bone. Bone that does not freely bleed from its marrow cavity is avascular bone, will interfere with antibiotic penetration of the involved area, will serve as a nidus for future infections, and will prevent adequate blood flow to the involved area. The removal of involved bone will frequently lead to continuity defects.  
5. Initial antibiotic coverage includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with both aerobic and anaerobic coverage.  
6. Bone biopsy culture and sensitivities will ultimately guide antibiotic selection.  
7. Cases that do not respond to initial surgical debridement and oral antibiotic therapy require more aggressive surgical intervention, the extraction of adjacent teeth, infectious disease consultation, and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line placement for long-term intravenous antibiotic management.

8. Due to the inflammatory nature of osteomyelitis, anti-inflammatory medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids are beneficial in the management of symptoms both before and after surgical intervention.  
9. Causes of osteomyelitis include odontogenic infections, postsurgical infections, osteoradionecrosis, chemotherapeutic agents, and malignancy. It is imperative that both hard and soft tissue biopsies are obtained to confirm a diagnosis of osteomyelitis and to identify underlying causes of the infection.

Acute osteomyelitis: Clinical symptoms present for less than 4 weeks. Radiographic findings are typically absent.

Chronic osteomyelitis: Clinical symptoms present for 4 weeks or longer. Commonly has radiographic findings. Subclassifications include suppurative and nonsuppurative forms.

Clinical symptoms of osteomyelitis: Pain, edema, mobile teeth, suppuration, induration, paresthesia or anesthesia, tissue erythema, and exposed bone (see Figure 14.1). Acute osteomyelitis frequently presents as a facial abscess with symptoms specific to the space involved (i.e., trismus).

Radiographic findings of osteomyelitis: Altered areas of bone density, including areas of osteosclerosis, osteolysis, periosteal reaction (periostitis ossificans), sequestrum, and cortical and trabecular defects (see Figures 14.2 through 14.5).

# Surgical Treatment Options for Osteomyelitis

# Saucerization

Saucerization involves the removal of involved bone to expose the medullary cavity and the smoothing of surrounding bone.

# Saucerization Technique

1. This procedure may be performed under local or general anesthesia.  
2. Mobile teeth and loose segments of bone are removed.  
3. The exposed or involved bone is removed with a combination of a ronguer and a round bur. The depth of the saucerization terminates within bleeding bone marrow. All margins should involve healthy, bleeding bone. All removed segments of bone and tissue are sent for histopathologic examination.  
4. All bony edges are smoothed, and the surgical site is copiously irrigated.  
5. The surgical site is packed with ribbon gauze. The gauze is changed every 2-3 days in order to stimulate the formation of a healthy tissue bed with eventual epithelization of the surgical site.

# Key Points

1. Saucerization is the most conservative form of surgical treatment for osteomyelitis and, as such, has the highest recurrence rate.  
2. Saucerization is only indicated for relatively superficial forms of osteomyelitis.

# Decortication

Decortication involves the removal of the involved cortical bone to expose the underlying inflamed marrow (see Case Report 14.1).

# Decortication Technique

1. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia.  
2. An intraoral incision with a buccal release is placed over the area of involved bone. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal tissue flap is elevated to gain wide surgical access to the affected area. If the lingual plate is uninvolved, the lingual periosteal attachment is preserved to allow blood supply to the lingual cortex.  
3. Loose segments of bone and adjacent, involved, and mobile teeth are removed.

4. Curettes are used to remove nonviable, inflammatory, and necrotic soft tissue.  
5. A ronguer is used to remove the involved cortices of the mandible. Curettes are used to remove involved marrow.  
6. A round bur with copious irrigation is used to remove any sharp or irregular pieces of bone and to remove all necrotic bone. Bone removal is complete when all margins are within healthy bleeding bone. All removed bone and tissue are sent for histopathological evaluation and culture and sensitivities.  
7. The surgical site is copiously irrigated.  
8. The tissue is closed around the defect in a tension-free manner to allow for complete coverage of the surgical site.

# Key Points

1. Decortication may be achieved through either an intraoral or extraoral approach. Intraoral approaches are preferred for areas involving the alveolar crest or lateral cortex of the mandible and for patients with intraoral fistulae. Extraoral approaches are preferred for areas involving the inferior cortex of the mandible and for percutaneous fistulae. Fistulectomies are performed at the time of decortication.  
2. All margins should be within bleeding bone in order to ensure complete removal of necrotic bone and to stimulate blood flow to the surgical site.  
3. The tension-free closure of the surgical site will allow coverage of the surgical site with vascularized tissue (muscle and mucosa), which will transform into periosteum and aid in the blood supply to the area.  
4. Depending on the extent of bone removal, a period of maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) may be required to prevent pathologic fracture. It is not advised to place internal fixation to the surgical site.  
5. During decortication procedures involving the inferior third of the mandible, it is important to be cognizant of the inferior alveolar nerve.

# Resection (Marginal and Continuity)

Resection involves the removal of significant hard tissue (cortical bone and marrow), resulting in sizable hard tissue defects (see Case Reports 14.2 and 14.3).

# Resection Technique

1. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia.  
2. Wide surgical access of the involved bone is obtained via either an intraoral approach or a combined intraoral/extraoral approach. Fistulae are incorporated into the incision design and excised.

3. Involved bone is resected to areas of healthy, bleeding bone.  
4. Involved teeth are removed en bloc within the surgical specimen.  
5. Complete tissue coverage is obtained over the resected site.  
6. For marginal resections placing the mandible at risk for pathologic fracture, a period of MMF is employed. For continuity defects, the segments are stabilized prior to definitive reconstruction with either MMF or external skeletal fixation.

# Key Points

1. Hard tissue defects are reconstructed after a 4-6-month symptom-free period.  
2. Immediate reconstruction is not recommended due to the decreased vascular supply of the recipient tissue bed and the potential for recurrence of the infection.

# Case Reports

Case Report 14.1. Lateral decortication. A 35-year-old male presents for the extraction of impacted and symptomatic third molars. The patient underwent uneventful third molar removal with sedation. Three weeks S/P extraction (see Figure 14.7), the patient presented with pain and edema to site #32. The area was treated as if it was a subperiosteal abscess (exploration of the site, debridement of granulation tissue within the site, and short-term oral antibiotic therapy). The patient failed to heal after a second debridement procedure and developed an intraoral draining fistula. A CBCT scan was obtained at 10 weeks S/P extraction that correlated with the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis (see Figures 14.8 and 14.9). A lateral decortication procedure was performed to remove involved and sclerotic bone back to healthy and bleeding bone, an area of periosteal reaction (thickened periosteum) was removed to allow better blood flow to the involved mandible, and multiple specimens were obtained for routine aerobic and anaerobic culture and sensitivity and hard and soft tissue histopathologic examination and staining. Histopathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of osteomyelitis and culture and sensitivity demonstrated gram-negative aerobes and Pseudomonas. The patient obtained a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC Line) and was placed on  $2.0\mathrm{g}$  daily IV Ceftriaxone (Roephin) for 8 weeks. After clinical improvement and 8 weeks of IV Ceftriaxone, the patient was placed on 6 weeks of Augmentin until clinical and radiographic examinations were negative for osteomyelitis (see Figures 14.6 through 14.11).

Case Report 14.2. Continuity resection. A 13-year-old patient presents with a chief complaint of recurrent swelling to his left posterior mandible 5 weeks after the extraction of teeth #29-31 due to tooth mobility, pain, and a buccal space infection. The patient with a medical history significant for multiple autoimmune disorders. The patient's medication list consisted of infliximab, methotrexate, and prednisone for severe bouts of Crohn's disease requiring frequent hospitalizations. The patient was initially treated with the extraction of mobile and symptomatic teeth, an incision and drainage procedure, a bone and tissue biopsy, cultures and sensitivities, infectious disease consultation, and weight-appropriate intravenous Unasyn (ampicillin-sulbactam) (Phizer Inc, New York, USA). Based on cultures and sensitivity results, the patient was continued on inpatient intravenous Unasyn and outpatient oral Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) (GlaxoSmith Kline, Brentford, London, UK). The patient underwent an uneventful postoperative course and was followed closely for several asymptomatic postoperative appointments until he developed a recurrent swelling some 6 weeks postoperatively. An orthopantomogram (see Figure 14.12) was taken that demonstrated

an inconsistent appearance of the bone of the left posterior mandible. A computed tomography scan was obtained that depicted distinct areas of altered bone density to include areas of osteosclerosis and osteolysis (see Figures 14.13 and 14.14) of the left posterior mandible, including the parasymphysis, body, angle, ascending ramus, condyle, and coronoid process. The glenoid fossa and the skull base were free from radiographic abnormalities. The patient was taken to the operating room for a deep bone biopsy. At the time of deep bone biopsy, drains were placed for irrigation of the posterior mandible. Bone biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, and cultures and sensitivities suggested that Unasyn was an appropriate antibiotic for the causative bacteria. The patient was taken to the operating room for lateral nerve repositioning and for the removal of all necrotic and involved bone (see Figures 14.15 through 14.17). A PICC line was placed for the administration of long-term antibiotics, and a drain was left in place for 1 week postoperatively for continued irrigation of the site (see Figure 14.18). Definitive reconstruction of the mandibular defect was undertaken after complete resolution of the infection (see Figure 14.12 through 14.18).

Case Report 14.3. Debridement resulting in continuity defect and bilateral non-union. A 34-year-old female sustained bilateral mandibular fractures and was treated with the extraction of impacted tooth #17 in the line of fracture and bilateral open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). The patient with a medical history significant for personal neglect, psychiatric instability, tobacco usage, and intravenous drug abuse (IVDA). After ORIF of the bilateral fractures, the patient continued tobacco usage and IVDA. At 2 weeks post-reduction, the patient was involved in a second altercation that resulted in hardware damage. The patient was negligent in follow-up visits and therapy. The patient gradually developed mild left-sided facial edema, overlying mucosal erythema and intraoral purulence from the incision site. A 6-week postoperative orthopantomogram was obtained that depicted loosening of internal fixation, evidence of non-healing fractures and early radiographic signs of osteomyelitis (see Figure 14.19). The patient underwent bilateral plate removal, bilateral debridement resulting in a continuity defect to the left

ribular angle and bone and tissue biopsies. Histopathological evaluation of the bone samples confirmed osteomyelitis. Laboratory values depicted an elevated WBC and ESR. The patient was maintained in maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) and placed on PICC line antibiotics. Due to chronic periodontal disease and rampant decay, a full mouth extraction was performed excluding the posterior molar teeth (see Figure 14.20) that would remain to maintain MMF and to serve as dental occlusal references for virtual surgical planning (VSP). After resolution of osteomyelitis as confirmed with physical examination, laboratory values and radiographs; remaining molar teeth were extracted and reconstruction of the continuity defect and mandibular non-unions were treated with VSP, custom reconstruction plate fabrication, and defect grafting utilizing anterior hip cancellous marrow and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). After reconstructive surgery, the patient transitioned to 6 weeks of oral antibiotics and was restored with maxillary and mandibular complete dentures (see Figure 14.19 through 14.35).

Figure 14.20. Prior to reconstruction, all necrotic teeth were extracted, loose hardware was removed, and select posterior molar teeth were maintained in order to serve as dental occlusal references during reconstructive planning and surgery.
