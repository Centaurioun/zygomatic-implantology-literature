# Upper Lid Blepharoplasty Procedure

The excision of excess upper lid skin and/or fat for cosmetic or functional improvement.

# Indications

1. Dermatochalasis  
2. Pseudohermiation or prolapsing of central and medial orbital fat that is cosmetically troublesome to the patient  
3. Upper lid ptosis  
4. Asymmetries  
5. Vision blocked by excess upper lid skin (lateral hooding). In order to qualify for a functional procedure, loss of the visual field must be documented with visual field testing and photographs

# Contraindications

1. Blepharoptosis: Blepharoptosis will not be corrected with blepharoplasty alone and requires identification prior to surgery. Blepharoptosis and lid malposition should be addressed prior to, or concurrently, with blepharoplasty to minimize postoperative complications.  
2. Eyebrow ptosis: Eyebrow ptosis is frequently the patient's chief complaint, and should be recognized and treated with a brow lift instead of upper blepharoplasty.  
3. Active thyroid disease: Patient's with active thyroid eye disease should avoid cosmetic upper and lower lid blepharoplasty until their disease has been stable for 12 months.  
4. Refractive eye surgery: Upper and lower lid blepharoplasty should be avoided in patients who have undergone lamellar refractive surgery within the previous 6 months or surface ablative refractive surgery within the previous 3 months.  
5. Severe dry eye syndrome (relative contraindication): An upper lid blepharoplasty may exacerbate the condition, especially if postoperative lagophthalmos is

present. It is important to obtain a detailed ophthalmic history with attention to eye drop and ointment usage. Basal tear secretion testing (Schirmer testing) can be helpful, but the results of this test are sometimes unpredictable.

6. Lack of orbicularis oculi strength and/or absent Bell's phenomenon (relative contraindications): Both increase the incidence of postoperative corneal trauma.

# Anatomy and Definitions: Upper Lid

Dermatochalasis: Excessive or redundant skin of the upper and lower eyelid. Often associated with excessive skin laxity as well.

Blepharoptosis: Ptosis of the upper eyelid resulting in a low-lying upper eyelid margin.

Lagophthalmos: The inability to completely close the eyelids.

Bell's phenomenon: The ability of the eyeball to move superiorly with eyelid closure. A protective reflex that aids in preventing corneal trauma, especially if postoperative lagophthalmos is present.

Marginal reflex distance (MRD): A means of identifying the position of the upper and lower lids in reference to the eye by measuring the distance of the upper and lower lid margin from the pupillary light reflex.

Margin reflex distance-1 (MRD1): The distance from the center of the pupillary light reflex and the upper eyelid margin with the eye in primary gaze. The normal range for margin reflex distance-1 (MRD1) is  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$ . An MRD1 of less than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  may indicate blepharoptosis. An MRD1 of greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  may indicate proptosis from hyperthyroidism.

Margin reflex distance-2 (MRD2): The distance from the center of the pupillary light reflex and the lower eyelid margin with the eye in primary gaze. The normal range for margin reflex distance-2 (MRD2) is  $5\mathrm{mm}$ . An MRD2 of greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  may indicate lower lid retraction.

Figure 51.1. Anatomy of the upper eyelid. Image by Randy Sappo.

Layers of the upper eyelid superior to the tarsal plate (9-10mm high centrally), from external to internal (see Figure 51.1):

1. Skin  
2.Orbicularis oculi  
3. Orbital septum  
4. Preaponeurotic fat  
5. Levator palpebrae superioris  
6. Müller's muscle  
7. Conjunctiva

Orbicularis oculi muscles: Innervated by the frontal (temporal) and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve located on the underside of the muscle. Functions to close the eyelid.

Orbital septum: A tough fibrous layer that lies anterior to the preaponeurotic fat and posterior to the orbicularis muscle. The orbital septum extends from the orbital rim to the tarsal plate and separates the eyelid from the orbit.

Preaponeurotic fat: Consists of fat pads that lie anterior to the levator aponeurosis and posterior to the orbital septum. The upper lid contains only two fat pads: a central and a medial fat pad. The central fat pad is more yellow in appearance, whereas the medial fat pad is whiter in appearance. There is no lateral fat pad. The lacrimal gland lies in the preaponeurotic space laterally and appears whitish-gray, glandular, and irregular.

Levator palpebrae superioris muscle: Innervated by the oculomotor nerve and is the primary muscle responsible for opening the eyelid. Fibrous extensions from the levator palpebrae superioris muscle pass through the orbicularis muscle to insert on the skin and help create the upper lid crease.

Müller's muscle: Innervated by sympathetic nerves and functions to involuntarily open the eyelid. Müller's muscle is located between the conjunctiva posteriorly

and the levator muscle anteriorly. Originates on the inferior aspect of the levator palpebrae muscle and inserts onto the superior border of the tarsal plate.

Conjunctiva: A mucous membrane that lines the posterior surface of the eyelid (palpebral) and anterior eyeball (bulbar). The conjunctiva is composed of nonkeratinized squamous epithelium that contains goblet cells that protect and lubricate the eye.

# Upper Blepharoplasty Preoperative Assessment and Markings

1. Prior to any upper and lower blepharoplasty procedure, a thorough history and physical should be performed that assesses and documents visual acuity, facial nerve function, asymmetries, dryness of the eyes, lagophthalmos, orbicularis oculi strength, and Bell's phenomenon. Preoperative photographs should be taken and should include frontal, three-quarter, and lateral views (see Figures 51.2 through 51.7 in Case Report 51.1).  
2. Preoperative markings are performed with the patient in a seated and upright position. The patient's natural upper lid skin crease is marked. The upper lid skin crease is typically  $7 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the lid margin in males (see Figure 51.8 in Case Report 51.2) and  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the lid margin in females. A pinch test is performed to define the upper extent of the excision. A pinch test is conducted by gently pinching the excess skin superior to the marked eyelid crease with blunt pickups until there is slight eversion of the upper lid eyelashes without lagophthalmos. The upper mark for the blepharoplasty incision is designed to maintain  $10 - 15\mathrm{mm}$  of skin between the inferior brow hairs and the upper mark to prevent over-resection. Therefore, the total amount of skin remaining from the lid margin to the inferior brow hairs is at least  $20\mathrm{mm}$ . When

marking laterally, make sure to extend the skin incision upward into one of the crow's feet starting at the lateral canthus to prevent the incision from extending too low.

# Upper Lid Blepharoplasty Procedure

1. The procedure may be performed with local anesthesia alone, intravenous sedation, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or endotracheal anesthesia.  
2. After induction of anesthesia, the patient is placed supine, and  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{mL}$  of local anesthetic containing epinephrine is injected just below the skin within the areas of excision in both upper lids with a 30-gauge needle.  
3. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
4. The incision is initiated along the preoperative markings with a #15 blade,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser, or needlepoint cautery. If using a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser, make sure to place metallic eye shields prior to making an incision. The depth of the incision extends through the orbicularis muscle to the septum. You will observe a color change from pink to white when the septum is reached.  
5. Remove the excess skin and orbicularis muscle with needlepoint cautery or scissors within the tissue plane just anterior to the septum (see Figure 51.9 in Case Report 51.2).  
6. If prolapsing preaponeurotic fat removal is required, needlepoint cautery is utilized to open the septum and to expose the central and medial fat pads. The medial fat pad is easily differentiated from the central fat pad due to its whiter appearance than the central fat pad. In the preaponeurotic space laterally, the lacrimal gland may prolapse and create fullness or a contour irregularity. A 6-0 polyglycolic acid suture (Vicryl) can be used to suspend and reposition the prolapsing gland to the medial aspect of the superolateral orbital rim periosteum.  
7. If performing the procedure under local anesthesia alone, local anesthesia is injected into each fat pad prior to removal to minimize patient discomfort.  
8. The herniated fat is gently teased out with a hemostat or forceps and excised with needlepoint cautery using the coagulation mode (see Figure 51.10 in Case Report 51.2). Attempt to remove equal amounts of fat from each side for symmetry, unless an asymmetry was identified preoperatively.  
9. If lower lid laxity or malposition is present, a canthopexy procedure can be performed through the upper lid incision to resuspend the lateral canthal tendon. Scissors are used to dissect down to the lateral canthal tendon posterior to the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle. Using forceps, the tendon is identified, and a 6-0 polyglycolic acid suture (Vicryl) is passed

first through the tendon and then through the medial aspect of the superolateral orbital rim periosteum. The suture is tightened until the canthus has a pleasing appearance. The lateral canthus usually has a slight superior angle in females and is level with the medial canthus in males.

10. Skin closure is performed with a running 6-0 polypropylene (Prolene) or fast-absorbing gut suture. If the patient exhibits a poorly defined lid crease, fixation of the inferior skin edge to the levator aponeurosis at the superior aspect of the tarsal plate with a 6-0 polyglycolic acid suture (Vicryl) will help define the fold. One suture should be placed centrally with additional sutures placed at the medial and lateral limbus.

# Complications

1. **Asymmetry:** Minimized with a thorough preoperative examination with eyelid measurements to identify pre-existing conditions (i.e., blepharoptosis) and asymmetries, meticulous preoperative markings, and surgeon experience.  
2. Blepharoptosis: Typically occurs secondary to postoperative edema and resolves within 2-4 weeks after surgery. Occasionally, prolonged edema can lead to attenuation of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, resulting in a persistent blepharoptosis. Excessive tension during the surgical removal of upper eyelid skin can result in a dehiscence of the levator palpebrae superioris, causing ptosis. Blepharoptosis that persists for more than 6 months after surgery usually requires surgery for correction.  
3. Lagophthalmos: Frequently the result of the removal of excessive upper eyelid tissue. A good rule of thumb is to leave  $20\mathrm{mm}$  of skin between the eyelid margin and the inferior brow hairs. In addition, incorporating the septum into the closure can cause adhesions and prevent adequate closure. Untreated or unrecognized lagophthalmos will lead to corneal exposure and dry eye. Mild cases of lagophthalmos are managed with lubricants and massage until the condition resolves. Severe cases are managed with skin grafting to the upper lids.  
4. Hematoma: Typically result from bleeding of the orbicularis oculi muscle postoperatively. Small hematomas are observed and resolved without sequelae. Larger hematomas require evacuation to prevent fibrosis and scarring of the eyelid. Expanding hematomas require immediate surgical exploration with evacuation and control of the source of bleeding.  
5. Retrobulbar hematoma: Minimized with appropriate use of cautery and wound hemostasis prior to the termination of the procedure. Posterior bleeding may result in a compartment syndrome, which places pressure on the blood supply to the retina and, if unrecognized or untreated, can lead to permanent vision loss. Signs and

symptoms include severe ocular pain, proptosis, massive edema, limited or absent extraocular movement, elevated intraocular pressure, vision loss, and an unreactive pupil. Retrobulbar hematomas are a medical emergency and require immediate action to prevent permanent loss of vision. Initial treatment involves opening the surgical incision and attempting to visualize and evacuate the forming hematoma. If the evacuation of the hematoma through the incision site fails, a lateral canthotomy with cantholysis of the upper and lower limbs of the lateral canthal tendon is performed to increase the volume of the orbit. In rare cases, decompression of the bony orbit may be accomplished by pushing a hemostat through the medial wall and orbital floor. After decompression, an ophthalmology consult is warranted to monitor vision and for serial intraocular pressure checks.

6. Infection: Rare due to the rich blood supply to the eyelids. Signs and symptoms of an eyelid infection include increased erythema, edema, pain, and purulent discharge from the surgical site. Infections are treated with the administration of broad-spectrum oral antibiotics. If an abscess is present, drainage of the abscess with culture and sensitivities is indicated.  
7. Corneal abrasion: Present as pain and increased light sensitivity in the affected eye after surgery. Diagnosis may be made via symptoms alone or in conjunction with fluorescein drops and a cobalt blue light to visualize the abrasion and to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of ophthalmic antibiotic ointment to the affected eye 4-6 times per day until symptoms resolve. Corneal abrasions typically heal in 24-48 hours depending on the size of the abrasion.

# Key Points

1. Excessive fat pad removal is avoided to prevent creating an "A-frame" deformity or hollow appearance to the upper lid. Only fat that prolapses anterior to the septum with light pressure to the globe should be excised.  
2. Always remove herniating fat with coagulation in order to cauterize small vessels traveling through the fat and to minimize postoperative bleeding and hematoma formation.  
3. Avoid removing excess skin. The surgeon should leave approximately  $20\mathrm{mm}$  of skin between the eyelid margin and lower brow hairs to avoid postoperative lagophthalmos.  
4. Always evaluate the patient to see if he or she has brow ptosis and would benefit from a brow lift instead of, or in addition to, an upper lid blepharoplasty. Always perform the brow lift first to ensure the upper eyelid skin is not over-resected. Performing upper lid blepharoplasty in a patient with brow ptosis will further lower the position of the brow.

# Lower Lid Blepharoplasty Procedure

The excision of excess lower lid skin and/or prolapsing fat, often in combination with lid-tightening procedures, for cosmetic improvement. This procedure is often performed in conjunction with fat grafting, fat repositioning, or the placement of soft tissue filler or cheek implants to optimize results.

# Indications

1. Dermatochalasis  
2. Herniated or prolapsing fat that is cosmetically troublesome to the patient  
3. Lower lid laxity  
4. Asymmetries

# Contraindications

1. A negative vector between the cornea and the inferior orbital rim is a relative contraindication because its correction requires additional procedures to minimize postoperative lid malposition  
2. Malpositioned lower eyelids (ectropion, entropion, and lower lid retraction) are relative contraindications as they require additional procedures to correct the underlying pathology causing the malposition  
3. Contraindications 3-6 of upper lid blepharoplasties

# Anatomy and Definitions: Lower Lid

Ectropion: A condition where the lower lid is everted (turned outward) away from the globe, leaving the inner eyelid surface and cornea exposed and prone to irritation. Symptoms include excessive dryness, eyelid crusting, chronic epiphora, conjunctivitis, keratitis, pain, and ultimately a breakdown of the cornea.

Entropion: A condition where the lower lid is inverted (turned inward), allowing the inturned lashes to rub

and damage the cornea. Symptoms include a feeling that something (i.e., foreign body) is within the eye, pain, chronic epiphora, sensitivity to wind, photophobia, eyelid crusting, and ultimately scarring of the cornea.

Malar edema: Fluid that collects over the malar eminence, inferior to the inferior orbital rim.

Malar mounds: Chronic soft tissue swellings or bulges located within the region of the malar eminence between the inferior orbital rim and the cheek. Differs from malar edema in that the bulges contain an excess of soft tissue, rather than edema.

Festoons: Cascading hammocks of lax skin and orbicularis muscle that hang between the medial and lateral canthi. Festoons may or may not contain herniated lower lid fat.

Layers of the lower eyelid inferior to the tarsal plate (4-6mm high) from external to internal (Figure 51.11):

1. Skin  
2.Orbicularis oculi  
3. Orbital septum  
4. Postseptal fat  
5. Lower lid retractors  
6. Conjunctiva

Retroseptal lower lid fat pads: Consists of three fat pads (lateral, central, and medial) located posterior to the orbital septum and anterior to the lower lid retractors. Just as in the upper lid, the medial fat pad of the lower lid has a more whitish appearance than the more lateral fat pads. The inferior oblique muscle courses between the medial and central fat pads and should be protected during lower lid blepharoplasty.

Lower lid retractors: Includes the capsulopalpebral fascia and inferior tarsal muscle. The capsulopalpebral fascia is a band of fibrous tissue that originates from the inferior rectus muscle, and as it travels anteriorly, it

splits to surround the inferior oblique muscle and then ultimately inserts on the inferior border of the lower lid tarsal plate. The inferior tarsal muscle travels from Lockwood's ligament to the inferior border of the tarsal plate and is located posterior to the capsulopalpebral fascia and anterior to the conjunctiva.

Lateral canthal tendon: Attaches the eyelid to the lateral orbital rim. The pretarsal and preseptal orbicularis oculi muscles taper as they extend laterally to form the upper and lower limbs of the lateral canthal tendon. These limbs then join to form the lateral canthal tendon that inserts on Whitnall's tubercle. The lateral canthal tendon is normally  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  higher than the medial canthal tendon.

# Transconjunctival Lower Lid Blepharoplasty Procedure

1. The procedure may be performed with local anesthesia alone, intravenous sedation, LMA, or endotracheal anesthesia.  
2. After induction of anesthesia, the patient is positioned supine or with a slight reverse Trendelenburg position.  
3. Topical anesthetic (i.e., tetracaine) is placed into each eye.  $1.5 - 2\mathrm{mL}$  of local anesthetic containing epinephrine is injected into the palpebral conjunctiva and anteriorly within the eyelid.  
4. Corneal shields are placed bilaterally, and the patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
5. The lower lid is everted with a Desmarres retractor, and needlepoint cautery is utilized to initiate an incision through the conjunctiva and lower lid retractors approximately  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  below the inferior border of the tarsal plate (see Figure 51.16 in Case Report 51.4).  
6. A hemostat or forceps are used to gently tease fat from the medial, central, and lateral fat pads (see Figure 51.17 in Case Report 51.4). The herniated fat is removed with coagulation to cauterize small vessels within the fat pads. When removing fat, care is taken to ensure symmetry between sides and to avoid injury to the inferior oblique muscle located between the medial and central fat pads (see Figure 51.18 in Case Report 51.4).  
7. No closure of the conjunctiva is required.  
8. Fractionated  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser resurfacing to the lower lids may be performed to tighten minor to moderate skin laxity and to improve fine lines and wrinkles (see Figure 51.21 in Case Report 51.4). Two to three passes are conducted using the settings recommended by the manufacturer of the laser. If a fractionated  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser is unavailable, a  $20 - 35\%$  trichloroacetic acid (TCA) peel may be used.  
9. Fat grafting to the tear trough and cheek is performed to smooth and improve the contours of the lid-cheek junction (see Figures 51.19 and 51.20 in Case Report 51.4). Fat is typically harvested from the abdomen and placed within  $1\mathrm{mL}$  or  $10\mathrm{mL}$  Luer lock syringes with  $0.9\mathrm{mm} \times 5\mathrm{cm}$  blunt-tipped fat-grafting microcannulae. The fat is injected into the tear trough

areas and cheeks using a microdroplet technique just anterior to the periosteum to a pleasing cosmetic endpoint. Typically,  $5 - 10\mathrm{mL}$  of fat are placed within the tear trough areas and cheeks bilaterally.

# Transcutaneous Lower Lid Blepharoplasty Procedure

1. A subsidiary mark is placed  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the lower lid eyelashes (see Figure 51.22 in Case Report 51.5). The mark originates lateral to the puncta and extends toward the lateral canthus. The mark terminates  $6\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the lower lid within a natural rhytid.  
2. Steps 1-4 of the transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty procedure.  
3. A #15 blade, a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser, or a needlepoint cautery is used to initiate an incision along the subciliary mark.  
4. A skin flap is developed, and the dissection proceeds inferiorly for  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$ , preserving a rim of pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle. This cuff of muscle will provide tone to the lower lid, minimizing lower lid retraction and ectropion postoperatively.  
5. The dissection then extends through the muscle, and the orbital septum is identified (see Figure 51.23 in Case Report 51.5). Dissection proceeds to the inferior orbital rim in a dissection plane just anterior (superficial) to the orbital septum.  
6. If horizontal laxity is noted prior to surgery, a lateral canthopexy must be performed to support the lower lid (see Figure 51.24 in Case Report 51.5). This is accomplished by passing a 5-0 polyglycolic acid suture (Vicryl) through the periosteum of the medial aspect of the lateral orbital rim and then through the lateral edge of the tarsal plate, and tightening the suture to the appropriate tension. It is helpful to perform this procedure before removing fat because additional fat will prolapse after the lower lid is tightened.  
7. The orbital septum is opened with scissors or needlepoint cautery, and the medial, central, and lateral fat pads are identified.  
8. If performing the procedure under local anesthesia alone, local anesthesia is injected into each fat pad prior to removal to minimize patient discomfort.  
9. A hemostat or forceps are used to gently tease out fat from the medial, central, and lateral fat pads. The herniated fat is removed with coagulation to cauterize small vessels within the fat pads. When removing fat, care is taken to ensure symmetry between sides and to avoid injury to the inferior oblique muscle located between the medial and central fat pads.  
10. In select cases, the surgeon will choose to redrape the fat over the inferior orbital rim to correct a tear trough deformity. This is accomplished by dissecting inferior to the orbital rim in a preperiosteal plane with a Colorado needle to create a pocket within the area of the tear trough for  $1.5 - 2\mathrm{cm}$ . Care must be taken to

avoid injuring the infraorbital nerves. The fat from the medial and central fat pads can be teased out of their capsules, redraped over the inferior orbital rim, and sewn to the periosteum with 6-0 polyglycolic acid sutures (Vicryl) in a horizontal mattress fashion. The fat from the lateral fat pad is almost always excised and typically not redraped.

11. The lower lid skin is redraped in a tension-free manner, and the excess skin is excised at the lower lid margin.  
12. If additional lateral support is required or if excessive skin was excised, an orbicularis sling can be performed. A 5-0 polyglycolic acid suture (Vicryl) is passed through the anterior aspect of the lateral orbital rim and then through the orbicularis muscle in the lateral aspect of the skin flap. The suture is tied in a manner that supports the flap in a more superior location. Frequently, the skin is dissected off of the underlying orbicularis muscle laterally for a short distance to assist in redraping.  
13. The skin is closed with a running 6-0 plain gut suture.

# Key Points

1. It is important to identify lower lid horizontal laxity and tone prior to lower lid blepharoplasty surgery. Lower lid horizontal laxity and tone can be assessed with the eyelid distraction test and eyelid snap test. The distraction test is performed by pulling the lower lid away from the eyeball and should measure less than  $6\mathrm{mm}$ . The snap test is performed by pulling the lower lid inferiorly toward the inferior orbital rim and releasing it. The lower lid should snap back to its normal position without a blink. If the distraction test is greater than  $7\mathrm{mm}$  or the lower lid fails the snap test, a canthopexy with or without an orbicularis sling procedure is required. These procedures will correct the laxity and support the lower lid to minimize the risk of lower lid retraction and ectropion. If the patient has significant lower lid laxity, a horizontal lid-shortening procedure with lateral canthoplasty may be required.  
2. Avoid creating a hollowed look to the lower lid by resisting the urge to remove excessive fat. Only remove fat that herniates anterior to the orbital septum with light pressure on the globes. The lateral fat pad is more difficult to identify, and under-resection often occurs with inexperienced surgeons. Under-resection of the lateral fat pad will result in a contour deformity of the lateral lid and usually requires revision surgery.  
3. With any blepharoplasty procedure (upper and lower), always err on the side of conservative skin excision to avoid lid retraction and lagophthalmos.  
4. For patients with a deep nasojugal fold (i.e., tear trough), combine lower lid blepharoplasty procedures with fat grafting, soft tissue fillers, repositioning of the

orbital fat, or tear trough implants to enhance the aesthetics of the volume-deficient regions.

5. Many patients have a negative vector to the lower face and are at much higher risk of lower lid retraction after a traditional transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty. Typically, the cornea lies parallel or slightly posterior to the orbital rim. In patients with a negative vector, the cornea is anterior to the inferior orbital rim. These individuals are at a higher risk for lower lid retraction after traditional transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty and need additional support to minimize this complication. Extra support can be provided by a canthopexy or canthoplasty in mild cases, or with a cheek lift and/or a cheek implant in more severe cases. A transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty reduces the risks associated with patients with a negative vector because the middle lamellae are not violated and no skin is removed.  
6. The correction of lower lid malar mounds and festoons can be a challenging endeavor. Procedures typically involve combinations of skin-muscle flaps, direct excision, and midface lifts in combination with previously described techniques in this chapter.

# Complications

Lower lid retraction and/or ectropion: Often results in lagophthalmos and inadequate protection of the cornea with resultant dry-eye symptoms. Minimized with conservative skin excision and repair of horizontal lid laxity during lower lid blepharoplasty. The incidence of lid retraction is much higher with a transcutaneous approach versus a transconjunctival approach. If lid retraction develops postoperatively, the patient is managed with aggressive lid massage and injections of a 50-50 mixture of 5 fluorouracil and triamcinolone  $(0.2 - 0.4\mathrm{mL})$ . Injecting a hyaluronic acid filler into the lower lid may help splint the lid up and prevent severe scar retraction. If conservative therapies fail, spacer grafts (i.e., ear cartilage or hard palate grafts) or skin grafts are indicated to repair lid retraction.

Chemosis: Occurs more commonly with lower lid blepharoplasty than upper lid blepharoplasty, and can cause persistent aggravation and discomfort in the postoperative period. Treatment consists of combinations of artificial tears, ophthalmic lubricating ointments, topical steroid drops (i.e., fluorometholone or prednisolone acetate), and/or an eye patch. For severe cases and/or cases that do not resolve after 7 days, a temporary tarsorrhaphy or conjunctivotomy should be performed.

Diplopia: Typically results from injury to the inferior oblique muscle or inferior rectus muscle. Intramuscular hemorrhage or edema may also cause transient extraocular muscle dysfunction, leading to diplopia. Diplopia should be followed closely, and a referral to

an ophthalmologist is warranted for cases that do not resolve within 6-8 weeks. Patients with persistent diplopia (for more than 8 weeks) may require surgical exploration of the extraocular muscle and possible strabismus surgery.

# Postoperative Management: Upper and Lower Lid Blepharoplasties

1. Cold compresses are applied to the lids for the first 48-72 hours after surgery.  
2. Topical ophthalmic antibiotic ointment is applied to the incision four times a day for 5 days.

# Tear Trough Implants

The placement of a silicone implant to correct a deep nasojugal fold or tear trough deformity.

# Indications

1. A tear trough deformity (e.g., a deep nasojugal fold)  
2. A negative vector that is caused by maxillary or zygomatic bone deficiency

# Contraindications

1. Silicone sensitivity or allergy  
2. Deep-set eyes or a patient with maxillary or zygomatic bone excess. In these patients, the implant will worsen the appearance of the patient's already deep-set eyes

# Anatomy

The nasojugal fold is the medial fold that demarcates the lid-cheek junction and is also known as the tear trough. The malar fold is the lateral fold that demarcates the lid-cheek junction. These folds become more pronounced with aging as the malar fat pads descend, facial volume is lost, and septal laxity allows the orbital fat to prolapse anteriorly. These factors contribute to the contour changes of the lower lid with aging, resulting in a double convexity deformity.

Tissue layers in the lid-cheek junction from superficial to deep:

1. Skin  
2. Subcutaneous tissue (location of malar fat pad)  
3. Orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi (part of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system [SMAS])  
4. Suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF; invested by SMAS)  
5. Periosteum

Malar fat pad: Lies within the subcutaneous tissue plane. A triangular fat pad that gives fullness to the midface and is invested by the SMAS. The malar fat pad lies anterior to the orbicularis oculi muscle.

Suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF): A fatty layer that rests anterior to the inferior orbital rim in a preperiosteal plane. The SOOF is thickest lateral to the infraorbital foramen and envelops the zygomaticus major and minor muscles.

Arcus marginalis: The anatomical name for the location where the orbital septum, periorbita, and periosteum meet at the orbital rim.

Infraorbital nerve: A branch off of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. The nerve exits its foramen within the maxillary bone  $6 - 9\mathrm{mm}$  below the inferior orbital rim in a straight line extending inferiorly from the medial limbus in primary gaze. After exiting the foramen, the infraorbital nerve provides sensation for the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip.

Zygomaticofacial nerve: A branch off of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. The nerve exits its foramen within the zygomatic bone and provides sensation to the malar region of the cheek. The zygomaticofacial nerve is often encountered during subperiosteal dissection for larger malar, submalar, or combined implants.

# Transcutaneous Approach to the Placement of a Tear Trough Implant

1. Steps 1-5 of the transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty procedure.  
2. The dissection is continued  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the orbital rim within the SOOF, preserving a cuff of peri-osteum and the arcus marginalis.  
3. A #15 blade or needlepoint cautery is used to incise the periosteum and a Freer elevator is used to create a subperiosteal pocket within the tear trough area.  
4. The infraorbital nerve is identified, and a subperiosteal dissection is performed for  $360^{\circ}$  around the nerve.  
5. The subperiosteal pocket is enlarged until the pocket is large enough to accommodate the tear trough implant.  
6. The implant is soaked in Betadine solution prior to placement.  
7. Using a #11 blade, a keyhole is created within the implant to accommodate the infraorbital nerve to prevent compression of the nerve (see Figure 51.25).  
8. The implant is positioned in its proper position within its subperiosteal pocket with the keyhole surrounding the infraorbital nerve.  
9. Three 4-0 polyglycolic acid (Vicryl) sutures are used to secure the implant to the cuff of preserved perio- teum to prevent migration or rotation of the implant. Alternatively, the implant can be secured with two or three  $2\mathrm{mm}\times 5\mathrm{mm}$  titanium screws (see Figure 51.26 in Case Report 51.6). The secured implant should rest just below the inferior orbital rim to prevent a palpable or visual contour irregularity (see Figure 51.27 in Case Report 51.6).  
10. With the implant secured, additional procedures may be performed (i.e., a lateral canthopexy) if needed.

11. Perform the identical procedure on the opposite side, and then compare for symmetry.  
12. The skin is closed with a running 6-0 fast-absorbing plain gut suture.

# Transconjunctival Approach to Placement of a Tear Trough Implant

1. Steps 1-4 of the transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty procedure.  
2. The lower lid is everted with a Desmarres retractor, and needlepoint cautery is utilized to initiate an incision through the conjunctiva and lower lid retractors approximately  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  below the inferior border of the tarsal plate from the lateral canthus to the puncta.  
3. Inferior dissection proceeds within a plane between the orbicularis muscle and the orbital septum to the inferior orbital rim. This plane preserves the orbital septum and prevents orbital fat prolapse into the plane of dissection.  
4. The dissection continues for  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the orbital rim within the SOOF, preserving a cuff of periosteum and the arcus marginalis.  
5. The periosteum is incised, and a subperiosteal pocket is created within the tear trough region.  
6. Steps 4-11 of the transcutaneous approach to the placement of a tear trough implant are performed.  
7. The conjunctiva is closed with a running 6-0 fast-absorbing plain gut suture.

# Intraoral Approach to Placement of a Tear Trough Implant

1. The procedure may be performed with local anesthesia alone, intravenous sedation, LMA, or oral endotracheal anesthesia.  
2. Two to four milliliters of local anesthetic containing epinephrine is injected within the maxillary vestibule, the suborbital area just above the periosteum, and to block the infraorbital nerves bilaterally.  
3. The patient is prepped and draped, and the oral cavity is prepped with chlorohexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  oral rinse.  
4. A  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal full-thickness mucoperiosteal incision is created above the canine, leaving a cuff of mucosa. A periosteal elevator is used to dissect within a subperiosteal tissue plane to expose the maxilla, infraorbital nerve, and inferior orbital rim. A pocket is made within the tear trough area large enough to encompass the desired implant.  
5. Steps 4-11 of the transcutaneous approach to the placement of a tear trough implant are performed.  
6. The intraoral incisions are closed with deep interrupted 3-0 polyglycolic acid sutures (Vicryl), and the mucosa is reapproximated with a continuous 3-0 chromic suture.

# Complications

: Typically presents as a subperiosteal abscess. Treatment includes drainage of the abscess, culture and sensitivities of purulence, and removal of the implant. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated until culture and sensitivity results return.

Migration or rotation of the implant: Results in contour changes to the implant site. Minimized with securing the implant with 2-3 screws or deep sutures. Treatment involves revision surgery to reposition and resecure the implant.

Asymmetry: Frequently the result of a poorly positioned implant. Treatment involves revision surgery to reposition the implant, reshape the implant, or place a differently shaped implant.

Paresthesia: Due to stretching of the infraorbital nerve during implant placement or dissection. Most cases are transient and resolve over time.

# Key Points

1. The implant should be secured with screws or sutures to prevent postoperative migration.  
2. An alternative to implant placement in patients with mild to moderate tear trough deformities is autogenous fat grafting. Advantages of autogenous fat grafting include a technically simpler procedure and minimal morbidity. Disadvantages of autogenous fat grafting include the variability in fat survival from patient to patient and the occasional need for a second fat-grafting session or the addition of further filler.  
3. In patients with a significant negative vector, the authors' preferred method for treatment is with a malar or a combined malar-submalar implant in combination with fat grafting. A tear trough implant alone often does not provide sufficient volume within the entire cheek to adequately correct the deficiency.

# Case Reports
