Laser ablation of the mid-dermis and above to remove senescent changes.

# Indications

1. Facial rhytidosis  
2. Coarse skin texture  
3. Mild skin laxity  
4. Minor dyspigmentation  
5. Established acne scarring/facial scars  
6. Early treatment to minimize surgical scars within 4-6 weeks  
7. Dermatopathologic entities (rhinophyma, xanthelasma, actinic keratosis)

# Contraindications

1. Patients with poorly controlled comorbidities  
2. Anticoagulated patients  
3. Patients with collagen/vascular diseases  
4. Isotretinoin use in last 6 months  
5. History of facial radiation  
6. Dysmorphic patients with unrealistic expectations  
7. Patients with malignant facial skin pathology, vitiligo, lichen planus, and psoriasis  
8. Caution in patients with pre-existing eczema, rosacea, or atopic dermatitis  
9. Caution in patients with a history of hypertrophic scarring or keloids  
10. Caution in patients with darker Fitzpatrick skin types  
11. Caution in patients with previous facial lifting procedures (primarily lower blepharoplasty)

# Anatomy

The epidermis is the most superficial layer of skin and contains continuously regenerating squamous epithelial cells from its basal layer. It is limited at its deepest extent by the basement membrane. The epidermis also contains varying numbers of melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells depending on the location in the body. This layer produces the color and texture of the skin; however, it contains no collagen. Deep to the epidermis is the dermis, which is divided into the more superficial papillary layer and the

deeper reticular layer. The main function of the dermis is to provide support both structurally and metabolically for the epidermis. The papillary layer is a minor part of the dermis, which abuts the basement membrane and contains a concentrated vascular supply. The reticular layer forms the majority of the dermis and contains collagen and elastin fibers produced by fibroblasts, the main cell of the dermis.

# Technique

1. Pretreatment conditioning with retinoic acid and hydroquinone 4 weeks prior to procedure to speed healing and reduce post-laser complications.  
2. Preoperative antiviral medication beginning 24-48 hours preoperative and for 2 weeks postoperatively. Single-dose intravenous preoperative antibiotics prior to the procedure.  
3. Ensure fire precautions are in place.  
4. Intravenous conscious sedation or endotracheal general anesthesia may be employed depending on if adjunctive invasive procedures will be performed.  
5. Equal mixture of  $2\%$  lidocaine with epinephrine and  $0.5\%$  marcaine without epinephrine is utilized to block supratrochlear, infratrochlear, infraorbital, mental, and transverse facial/cervical plexus nerves.  
6. Laser-resistant corneal shields with lacrilube are placed.  
7. Select laser setting appropriate for laser system according to the patients goals and the amount of pathologic change.  
8. Prepare skin with acetone or dilute povidone-iodine  $5\%$  - avoid alcohol.  
9. Ensure the face is dry. Laser the face in subunits protecting the follicles of the hairline and the brow with a tongue blade (see Figure 48.6 in Case Report 48.1). Start with the forehead and laser caudally to the inferior border of the mandible in subunits. Care is taken to not overlap laser passes. Handpiece should be perpendicular to the target area.  
10. Withdrawal the laser off the skin, defocus and angle at  $45^{\circ}$  to blend the laser over the inferior border of the mandible (see Figure 48.7 in Case Report 48.1). Feathering of the thin cervical tissue may be performed with lighter laser settings.

11. Make a second pass without debridement (see Figure 48.8 in Case Report 48.1). Problem areas may require additional passes with the laser. Make consideration to reduce the energy around the eyes and increase the energy around the mouth and deeper acne scars and rhytids.  
12. Cover the face with thin layer of emollient (aquaphore) (see Figure 48.9 in Case Report 48.1).  
13. Remove corneal shields and irrigate eyes.  
14. Consider direct application of corticosteroids or 5 fluorouracil in scar treatment.

# Postoperative Management

1. Elevate head and use ice packs cautiously (facial numbness) for the first 2-3 days.  
2. Antibiotics 1 week postoperatively and antiviral medications 2 weeks postoperatively.  
3. Gentle face washing with hands and very mild soap 3-4 times daily followed by a thin layer of emollient starting on postoperative day 1.  
4. Patients are encouraged to not to pick at their face to avoid prematurely removing involved skin.  
5. Dilute vinegar mist and fan when desired – cools a hot and itchy face.  
6. Mineral-based make up can be used to cover erythema 1-2 weeks postablation after initial re-epithelialization.  
7. Retinoids and bleaching agents can be restarted after a month if tolerated.  
8. Avoid direct sun exposure for 2 months.

# Complications

1. Pruritis: Common and usually associated with reepithelialization. Treat with cool pack to face, antihistamines and consider steroid ointment. If pruritis continues after 3-4 days postoperatively, consider superficial skin infection.  
2. Acne: Reassurance within the first 2 weeks, consider different emollient, consider topical or systemic antibiotic (benzaclin) if severe after re-epithelialization. Try to move from thicker emollient to water-based moisturizer.  
3. Bacterial infection: Weeping crusting lesions with pain and pruritis. Attempt to culture and treat for Staphylococcus aureus.  
4. Viral infection: Distinct pattern of markedly painful erythematous ulcerative lesions. Increase the currently utilized antiviral to the maximum dose or switch to another antiviral.  
5. Fungal infection: Pruritis with white patches. Diagnosis with KOH prep. Begin systemic antifungal therapy.  
6. Contact dermatitis: Diffuse intense facial erythema and pruritis. Identify and discontinue the offending agent.

# Late Complications

1. Prolonged erythema: Consider other causes including incipient scar formation, infection, and dermatitis. Typically related to the depth of ablation. Treated with reassurance and topical steroids if severe. Also consider pulse dye laser.  
2. Scarring: Marked by inappropriately tender erythema especially in prone patients. Initially treat with topical steroids, silicone sheeting, and massage. Consider steroid and/or 5 fluorouracil injections for severe cases.  
3. Hyperpigmentation (3-4 weeks): Typically seen in darker skin types and those unable to avoid UV exposure post laser. Most cases resolve without treatment. Bleaching agents and avoiding UV exposure will hasten resolution. Consider nonablative laser treatments in refractive cases.  
4. Hypopigmentation (6-12 months): Typically presents as a delayed phenomenon that occurs 6-12 months after laser treatment. Frequently results from over aggressive resurfacing or resurfacing in subunits which heal adjacent to photodamaged skin (pseudohypopigmentation). Pigmentation frequently resolves with time. Refractory cases are managed with retreatment of the entire face to blend areas or with make up to camouflage.  
5. Milia (3-4 weeks): Microcyst formation with reepithelialization of follicles. Remove with large bore needle and manual expression.

# Key Points

1. Appropriate patient selection and utilization of the laser energy will avoid most complications. For example, use caution when treating patients with a "thinner" dermis to avoid scarring and prolonged erythema and with darker skin types to avoid dyspigmentation and scarring.  
2. Patients with lighter Fitzpatrick skin types have a lower incidence of postoperative hyperpigmentation and a higher incidence of prolonged postoperative erythema.  
3. Laser ablation will not treat marked skin laxity. Deep facial rhytids and moderate to severe skin laxity are best treated with surgical intervention.  
4. Try to laser the full facial unit when possible, to avoid lines of demarcation.  
5. Care is taken to minimize overlapping laser passes. Overlapping passes result in excessive thermal damage, deep wounds, and scarring.  
6. Areas that typically require additional laser passes include the thicker tissues of the forehead, glabellar, nasolabial, and perioral regions.  
7. When treating perioral rhytids, care is taken to not cross the vermillion border. Overtreatment of this area will lead to blunting, scarring, and thickening of the vermillion border.
