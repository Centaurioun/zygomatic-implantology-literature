A means of repairing congenital palatal defects utilizing nasal and oral mucoperiosteal flaps to achieve complete palate closure and velopharyngeal competence with minimal impact of maxillary growth.

# Indication

1. Hard and soft tissue defects of the palate

# Contraindications

1. No absolute contraindications  
2. Relative contraindications include medical comorbidities which preclude the use of general anesthesia

# Anatomy

Muscles of soft palate:

1. Levator palatini  
2. Tensor palatini  
3. Palatopharyngeus  
4. Palatoglossus  
5. Musculus uvulae

# Two-Flap Palatoplasty Technique

1. The patient is placed supine on the operating table and orally intubated with an oral RAE (right angle endotracheal) tube.  
2. The neck is carefully hyperextended for better visualization of the palate and alveolar process.  
3. The author prefers to place a Dingman or similar mouth gag prior to the sterile prep. A Dingman or similar retractor is inserted to allow complete exposure of the palate from the uvula to the anterior maxillary alveolus (see Figure 33.5 in Case Report 33.1).  
4. A throat bipartition is placed. The oral cavity is prepped with peridex and the face and mouth gag are prepped with povidone-iodine paint solution. The patient is draped, leaving the frame of the prepped mouth gag open to the field (see Figure 33.6 in Case Report 33.1).  
5. A marking pen may be used to mark the proposed incision sites adjacent to the cleft defect.

6. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is infiltrated into the hard palate, soft palate, and vomer mucoperiosteum, if exposed. The authors recommend  $0.25\%$  bupivicaine with  $1:200,000$  epinephrine based on the age and weight of the standard cleft palate patient.  
7. The nasal cavities may be packed with oxymetazoline-soaked cottonoids, although this is typically not necessary in a primary palate repair.  
8. Incisions are initiated with a #11 blade immediately adjacent to the cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosal lining within the soft and hard palate bilaterally.  
9. The incisions originate at the posterior aspect of the cleft just before the uvula. Lateral tension may be applied to the uvula using DeBakey forceps to aid in incision placement. The incisions are extended anteriorly to the junction of the palatal and alveolar mucosa. A second incision, originating just posterior to the maxillary tuberosity and extending anteriorly to the junction of the hard palate and the maxillary alveolus, connects with the first incision (see Figure 33.1).  
10. Along the entire length of the cleft, a cottle elevator, sinus curettes or dissection scissors may be utilized to elevate a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap separating the nasal mucosa from the oral mucosa (see Figure 33.7 in Case Report 33.1). Care is taken to preserve the greater palatine vascular pedicle (see Figure 33.2).

Once elevated, the oral mucosal flaps are retracted laterally with 2-0 silk sutures. Fibrous attachments around the vascular pedicle are freed, and the abnormal attachments of the levator palatini and tensor palatini muscle area are released bilaterally from the palatine shelves.

11. The palatal muscles of the soft palate must now be dissected from the oral mucosa and the nasal mucosal in order to perform a formal veloplasty. A 15c blade is used to sharply separate the nasal mucosa from the muscle on the nasal side (see Figure 33.8 in Case Report 33.1). The oral mucosa is dissected from the muscle on the oral side of the soft palate with a #69 beaver blade (see Figure 33.9 in Case Report 33.1).

Figure 33.1. An incision separating the oral and nasal mucosa is initiated. The incision originates at the uvula and extends anteriorly to the junction of the palatal and alveolar mucosa. A second incision is initiated at the junction of the hard palate and the maxillary alveolus. This incision originates at the termination of the first incision and extends posteriorly around the maxillary tuberosities bilaterally. Source: Image modified with permission from Dr. Jeffrey C. Posnick.

12. The nasal lining is freed from the palatine bone using sinus curettes. The dissection should be carried to the lateral maxillary sinus wall. Care is taken to ensure that the levator palatini muscle is freed from the palatal shelves on both the oral and nasal perspectives (see Figure 33.10 in Case Report 33.1). Judicious use of bipolar cautery may be utilized for hemostasis.  
13. If a wide cleft exists and the nasal mucosa will not span the gap tension free, a vomer flap may be utilized. A vertical incision is made in the vomer mucoperiosteum followed by a subperiosteal dissection on either side of the vomer. The mucoperiosteum is then sutured to the nasal mucosal previously freed from the palatal shelves (see Figure 33.11 in Case Report 33.1).  
14. The hard palate extent of the cleft is repaired with a two-layer closure (nasal mucosa and oral mucosa). The soft palate extent of the cleft is repaired with a three-layer closure (nasal mucosa, soft palate musculature, and oral mucosa). The nasal lining of the hard palate and soft palate is primarily closed using 4-0 Vicryl on a PS-4C needle in an interrupted fashion (see Figures 33.3 and 33.12 in Case Report 33.1)  
15. Intravelar veloplasty is performed. The previously dissected velum musculature is anastomosed and

repositioned within the midline. The cleft palate will have a uvula present on both the right and left side. One may be sacrificed so that only one uvula is positioned in the midline (see Figures 33.13 and 33.14 in Case Report 33.1).

16. The 2-0 silk retraction sutures are removed and the oral mucosa is primarily closed from the uvula to the anterior extent of the incision with 4-0 Vicryl interrupted horizontal mattress sutures (see Figure 33.4). Nasal and oral sides are sutured together with the 4-0 Vicryl to obliterate dead space. Additional sutures are placed between the hard palate mucoperiosteum and the attached gingiva anteriorly and laterally using 4-0 Vicryl sutures (see Figures 33.15 and 33.16 in Case Report 33.1).

# Postoperative Management

1. The airway is closely monitored within the first 24-48 hours for concerns related to postoperative edema.  
2. Flap checks are performed within the first 48 hours to evaluate blood flow within the palatal mucosal flaps.  
3. Postoperative nutrition is aimed at preventing suction-generated stress on the palate repair. A full liquid diet

is maintained for the first week. Utilization of Brecht feeder is recommended.

4. Adequate oral hygiene is mandatory for patients with teeth.  
5. No hard objects are permitted within the mouth. Maintain arm boards on elbows of infant patients while unattended for at least 7 days after surgery.  
6. Five days of postoperative antibiotics based on the patient's weight in kilograms is recommended.

# Complications

1. Flap necrosis: Due to severance of the greater palatine vascular pedicle.  
2. Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI): VPI results from improper muscle repositioning and/or insufficient soft palate length. Symptoms of VPI include hypernasality and nasal air emissions. VPI can be treated with secondary palatal lengthening, a superiorly based pharyngeal flap, or sphincter (lateral) pharyngoplasty.  
3. Oronasal fistula: Results from the inability to achieve complete, tension-free closure of all flaps or from flap necrosis due to loss of blood supply. Symptoms include nasal air escape and regurgitation of oral fluids. Its incidence is related to the surgeon's experience (the most significant variable) and the patient's age at the time of repair. Less often related is the type of repair or the severity of the cleft deformity. May be corrected with re-elevation of palatal flaps as in the original repair, local pedicled flaps (the tongue flap, musculomucosal flap, temporalis flap, and local palatal mucoperiosteal flap), dermis grafts, or a vascularized pedicle flap such as the facial artery musculomucosal flap (FAMM flap).  
4. Maxillary growth restriction: Restricted maxillary growth frequently occurs when repairs are attempted before 9 months of age. Twenty-five percent of patients repaired between 9 and 18 months of age show some maxillary growth restriction. Maxillary growth restrictions are initially managed with orthodontics, including maxillary expansion and face mask protraction appliances, and later with orthognathic surgery once skeletal maturity is reached.

# Key Points

1. Regardless of the technique utilized, the goals of cleft palate surgery include establishing an intact palate along the entire course of the palatal defect, avoiding oronasal fistulae, and minimizing the risk of VPI through the creation of a dynamic soft palate that allows for natural phonation.  
2. Although not always possible, especially with wide clefts, exposure of the palatal bone should be minimized in order to prevent the formation of palatal scar tissue resulting in restricted maxillary growth.

3. Advantages of the two-flap palatoplasty technique include the complete closure of the entire palate in a one-stage procedure, the creation of a more physiologic soft palate muscle sling, and a layered closure technique. The hard palate is closed in two layers (nasal mucosa and oral mucosa). The soft palate is closed in three layers (nasal mucosa, soft palate musculature, and oral mucosa).  
4. Speech outcomes are better when soft and hard palate repair is completed before speech development (9-12 months of age).  
5. The use of buccal fat has been well documented to repair various intraoral defects. Ladani et al. describes a technique for repair of cleft palate defects with decreased scar contracture and maxillary constriction, minimizes or eliminates the use of other tissues needed for repair, and decreases the surgical time requirement for harvest. Traditionally, the areas of undermined and translated tissues leave large, denuded palatal shelves, which lead to a large portion of scar contracture and

palatal restriction. The added layer of vascularized tissue (the buccal fat pad flap) functions to fill and line this open denuded space, increasing the vascularity to this area and minimizes significant wound contracture. The buccal fat pad can be predictably located through a horizontal incision lateral to the maxillary tuberosity in the area of the second maxillary molar. Curved Iris scissor may be used for blunt dissection through the superior constrictor and buccinators junction, allowing the buccal fat pad to herniate into the oral cavity. The body and buccal extension of the fat pad can be gently pedicled into the region lateral alveolar defect. The fat pad can be used to fill the defect and may be sutured to the palatal flap and gingiva without significant tension over the midline suture of the palatal flap (see Figure 33.17 in Case Report 33.1). Alternatively, the buccal fat may be advanced over the muscular anastomosis to bulk up the junction of hard and soft palate, as this is the area most prone to fistula development.

repaired at 3 months of age. Due to the patient's weight and milestones, he has been cleared for primary palatoplasty (see Figures 33.5 through 33.17).
