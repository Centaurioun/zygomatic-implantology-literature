Numerous surgical techniques may be employed to treat craniosynostoses, the early fusion of cranial sutures in infants. These conditions can be treated in both open and endoscopic fashions.

# Indications for Cranial Vault Surgery

The aim of cranial vault surgery for the correction of craniosynostoses is the release of the prematurely fused sutures with or without cranial vault remodeling for correction of abnormal cranial morphology. By releasing the affected sutures, other potential sequelae of craniosynostosis can be avoided, such as:

1. Abnormal skull shape  
2. Restriction of brain growth  
3. Elevated intracranial pressure  
4. Exorbitism/exophthalmos  
5. Dystopia  
6. Vision impairment  
7. Hydrocephalus

# Contraindications to Cranial Vault Surgery

1. Medically unstable patient  
2. Age  $>4$  years old without cosmetic or functional signs or symptoms. In these instances, although a craniosynostosis may have existed, the patient no longer has an indication for cranial vault surgery.

# Anatomy

Knowledge of cranial vault anatomy is essential not only to the execution of vault surgery, but also in understanding craniosynostosis itself, as well as the complications related to this condition. The early fusion of sutures of the neurocranium define craniosynostosis, and the sequela

are a direct result of which sutures are affected. The sutures of the cranial vault are as follows:

1. Sagittal suture: Located between the left and right parietal bones  
2. Coronal sutures (2): Located between the left and right frontal and parietal bones  
3. Lambdoid sutures (2): Located between the left and right parietal bones and the occipital bone  
4. Squamosal sutures (2): Located between the temporal and parietal bones  
5. Metopic suture: Located between the left and right frontal bones

The conditions created by the early fusion of one or more of these sutures are anatomically driven. According to Virchow's law, growth will be restricted perpendicular to the prematurely fused suture, but growth will be allowed parallel to the suture. With that in mind, the following is a list of anatomical descriptors related to craniosynostoses:

Scaphocephaly: Sagittal suture craniosynostosis. Restricted mediolateral growth with abnormal elongation of anteroposterior growth.

Plagiocephaly: Originating from the Greek work πλάγιος (plagios), meaning “oblique.” There are anterior and posterior variants.

Anterior plagiocephaly: Unilateral coronal suture craniosynostosis. Patient will have flattening of the forehead on the affected side.

Posterior plagiocephaly: Unilateral lambdoid suture craniosynostosis. Patient will have flattening of the occipitoparietal region on the affected side.

Note: These conditions should not be confused with positional plagiocephaly, which occurs due to pressure on the head from an infant repetitively laying in a certain

position (generally on their back), causing deformation of the cranium. Although similar in appearance to the aforementioned types of plagiocephaly, this condition is not caused by craniosynostosis.

Brachycephaly: Bilateral coronal suture craniosynostosis. Results in decreased anteroposterior dimension with compensatory mediolateral widening of the skull.

Trigonocephaly: Metopic suture craniosynostosis. This deformity is characterized by a triangle-shaped forehead (with the apex being along the metopic suture), retrusive lateral orbital rims, and hypotelorism.

Oxycephaly: A combination of fusion of a coronal suture with any other suture and may include fusion of all sutures.

Open cranial vault surgery is performed via a coronal incision and craniotomy. Thus, the soft tissue layers overlying the skull, the skull itself, and structures overlying the brain are all included in the surgical field.

1. Scalp (transected during coronal incision)  
2. Skin  
3. Subcutaneous connective tissue  
4. Galea aponeurotica  
5. Subgaleal connective tissue  
6. Pericranium  
7. Skull  
8. Dura mater

# Open Cranial Vault Surgery Technique

The surgical technique for the correction of a craniosynostosis defect varies according to which sutures are affected. In addition, each patient's case is unique, and the exact bony cuts, rotation and switching of segments, "barrel staving," etc. are tailored to that case and are not necessarily reproduced in similar cases. For instance, the steps for correction of a lambdoid synostosis are different from that for a unilateral coronal synostosis. Even two unilateral coronal synostoses can be treated in very different ways. Hence, the surgical correction of craniosynostosis is as much an art as a science. The following is a generalized sequence to consider when performing craniosynostosis correction cases.

1. The patient is intubated and positioned appropriately for the condition being treated. The patient can be positioned supine, prone, or in a sniffing position depending on the portion of the cranium to be exposed. A Mayfield headrest is often used.  
2. The patient is prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. The hair is braided or shaved in the area of the planned incision, which is then marked with a surgical

marker. The incision may be designed in a curvilinear, zigzag, or other pattern as appropriate for the case and per the surgeon's preference. Local anesthesia with epinephrine is injected.

3. An incision is made using a 15 blade. Debate exists as to whether this incision should be full-thickness (down to skull) or supraperiosteal, preserving a separate periosteal flap for rotational coverage if necessary. If the decision is made for a full-thickness flap, a periosteal flap can still be developed by making periosteal incisions at the inferior aspect of the coronal flap.  
4. A periosteal elevator is used to begin development of the flap, starting at the midline and proceeding laterally. A combination of blunt, sharp, and electrocautery dissection is utilized for reflection of the flap to its intended extent, depending on which sutures are being treated. The temporalis muscles are reflected with the flap for access to the temporal and parietal areas. Considerable attention is given to the control of bleeding to prevent air emboli, a potentially lethal complication. Bone wax and thrombin-soaked gelatin sponges are employed for hemostasis.  
5. The osteotomy lines are planned. If virtual surgical planning was utilized prior to the case, computer-fabricated guides can be used to mark the planned osteotomies. If virtual surgical planning was not utilized, the surgeon must consider the strategy for reconstruction. First, the area around the prematurely fused suture is marked for osteotomy. Next, the surgeon must decide what other geometric alterations can restore the cranium to a proper form. Helpful considerations are the cranial index (a ratio of the maximal cranial width divided by the maximal skull length) as well as observing any existing asymmetries (e.g., unilateral frontal bossing). Osteotomized segments can be removed, rotated, and switched with other segments to improve the cranial width and length ratios. "Barrel staves" can be created (linear incomplete osteotomies), which allow the surgeon to expand or contract localized areas. The end goal is not that the cranium lacks any gaps between bony segments, but rather to have a symmetric and esthetic shape with gaps in the bony segments allowing for brain expansion without recurrent early fusion between bones. In the case of fronto-orbital advancements, a frontal bandeau must be osteotomized, which includes cuts at the lateral orbital rims extending posteriorly into the squamous portion of the temporal bone (tenon extensions) and anteriorly through the orbital roofs and nasion, with an upper osteotomy approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above the inferior osteotomy line.  
6. The craniotomy is completed. Bur holes are made in the osteotomy lines, and hand instruments are used through the holes to strip the dura off the overlying

calvarium. Craniotomies are used with a protected drill bit to carry the osteotomies to completion. This includes incomplete osteotomies where barrel staves are planned.

7. At this point, the bone flaps are modified and rearranged per the plan developed prior to the osteotomies. Large bone flaps (e.g., orbito-frontal bandeau) can be brought to the back table for modification. Resorbable plates and screws are used to fixate the bones in their new positions. Barrel stave segments can be expanded or contracted using Tessier benders. In the case that this results in a fracture, the fractured segment can be replaced and plated. If there are large areas without bone coverage, small pieces of bone taken from larger bony segments can be used to fill in gaps. However, it is not necessary, and indeed undesirable, to fill all bony gaps.  
8. Once the desired cranial shape has been obtained with adequate fixation of bone segments, attention is turned to closure, which can be carried out in multiple fashions. It is the authors' preference to use interrupted deep sutures with surface running sutures. Only resorbable materials are used, as the pediatric population will generally not allow for easy removal of sutures or staples postoperatively.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is required.  
2. Patient should be monitored for postoperative infection and cerebrospinal fluid leaks.  
3. Postoperative antibiotics are advised. Institutions vary as to the recommended antibiotic regimen, but a first-generation cephalosporin for 24-72 hours postoperatively is the most common protocol.  
4. Patients are generally able to transfer to the floor 24 hours after ICU admission.  
5. Postoperative helmet therapy is not routinely recommended for open approaches, but generally is recommended for endoscopic approaches.

# Case Reports

Case Report 36.1. Scaphocephaly A 16-month-old female presents for the evaluation and treatment of craniosynostosis. The patient is healthy and meeting appropriate milestones. Physical examination shows scaphalocephalic head shape, bitemporal narrowing, and frontal and occipital bossing. Palpation along the

# Cranial Vault Surgery

Cranial vault remodeling is an invasive, but relatively safe procedure, with mortality rates of  $< 1\%$  in the United States. Despite low mortality rates, significant complications can arise, including:

1. Postoperative infection:  $8.10\%$  occurrence, including both cranial and extracranial infections.  
2. Subgaleal hematoma:  $6.08\%$  occurrence, nearly half of which become infected.  
3. Dural tears:  $5.06\%$  occurrence;  $93\%$  come from reoperations.  
4. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage:  $2.7\%$  occurrence;  $75\%$  come from reoperations.

# Key Points

1. Cranial asymmetries must be evaluated for their etiologies, and craniosynostoses must be differentiated from positional plagiocephalies.  
2. Cranial vault surgery can be reliably performed in the open or endoscopic fashions, and the technique chosen should be tailored to the patient's individual presentation and the surgeon's skills.  
3. Although there are certain common steps in performing these surgeries, the procedures are as much art as science, and preoperative planning requires the surgeon to envision the end result prior to starting.  
4. In addition to the open technique described in this chapter, endoscopic approaches are gaining popularity and have shown promising results. The fused sutures can be released endoscopically just as readily as in an open approach. However, the major disadvantage of endoscopic approaches is the inability to perform cranial remodeling. Instead, these techniques rely on postoperative helmet/band therapy and the rapid growth of the brain to obtain correct cranial morphologies. Thus, endoscopic approaches are most effective in younger patients (<6 months of age).
