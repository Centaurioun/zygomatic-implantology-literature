A means of obtaining autogenous, nonvascularized bone for the reconstruction of hard tissue defects and for the replacement of mandibular condyles. A means of obtaining a hyaline cartilage graft for the reconstruction of cartilaginous maxillofacial defects.

# Indications

1. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) replacements in pediatric patients with active growth centers to reconstruct condylar processes defects caused by trauma, neoplasms, infections, congenital dysplasias, growth abnormalities, ankyloses, and rheumatoid arthritis  
2. TMJ reconstruction in adult patients due to idiopathic condylar resorption, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis when other methods (alloplastic joint replacement) are contraindicated  
3. Reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial defects caused by loss of hard tissue  
4. Reconstruction of skull defects or cranioplasty  
5. Reconstruction of nasal dorsum defects or saddle nose deformities (costochondral cartilage)  
6. Reconstruction of the helical framework of the ear (costochondral cartilage)

# Contraindications

1. History of restrictive lung disease  
2. History of recent pulmonary infection  
3. History of cardiopulmonary instability

# Anatomy

Hyaline cartilage can withstand the stresses of the TMJ and also has an active growth center, allowing for spontaneous growth in the pediatric patient.

The first seven vertebrosternal ribs (true ribs) are attached to the sternum and the manubrium directly by means of costal cartilage.

Vertebrochondral ribs 8, 9, and 10 (false ribs) are attached to the vertebrosternal ribs above by means of costal cartilage.

Vertebral ribs 11 and 12 (floating ribs) have no attachment to the sternum.

# Costochondral Graft (CCG) Harvest Technique

1. The anterior chest wall is prepped and draped, allowing for visualization of the sternum, clavicle, nipple, and umbilicus.  
2. The ribs are counted and marked with a marking pen.  
3. A sterile marking pen is used to outline a  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  line within the inframammary crease of female patients (see Figure 66.1 in Case Report 66.1) or at the level of the sixth or seventh rib in male patients. In pediatric female patients, the incision is placed in the anticipated future location of the inframammary crease.  
4. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is used to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue overlying the rib to be harvested.  
5. Digital pressure is used to identify the fifth, sixth, or seventh rib and the costochondral spaces. A  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  skin incision is made with a #15 blade directly over the superior aspect of the rib to be harvested. The incision transverses skin, subcutaneous tissue, and pectoralis muscle (see Figure 66.2 in Case Report 66.1) down to the periosteum directly overlying the rib.  
6. A #9 periosteal elevator is used to dissect circumferentially around the rib. A tissue plane is developed between the rib's periosteum-perichondrium and the thin parietal pleura (see Figure 66.3 in Case Report 66.1). The subperiosteal dissection continues laterally as far as is needed and medially until the costochondral junction is reached. It is important to stay subperiosteal in order to avoid injury to the vascular bundle on the inferior portion of the rib.

7. At the costochondral junction, dissection proceeds in a supratherichondrial plane so as not to detach the hyaline cartilaginous cap from the medial aspect of the rib.  
8. A guillotine rib cutter is used to transect the lateral portion of the rib.  
9. Either a Doyen retractor or a silk suture (see Figure 66.4 in Case Report 66.1) is used to elevate the rib and to check the deep margin for tissue-muscle adherence.  
10. A malleable retractor is placed deep to the medial aspect of the rib. A #10 blade is used to cut the medial aspect of the rib preserving a  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  cartilaginous cap. The malleable retractor will prevent the #10 blade from cutting into the underlying parietal pleura.  
11. The harvested costochondral graft is placed within a sterile, saline-soaked gauze until the recipient site is prepared.  
12. Once the rib or ribs are removed, sterile water is placed over the anterior chest wall defect, and the anesthesiologist is asked to provide positive pressure in order to inspect the harvest site for pleural perforations. If no air bubbles are present, then the harvest site is closed in layers. If minor air bubbles are present, pleural tears can be closed primarily with interrupted sutures. If large air bubbles are present, then a thoracotomy tube is placed.  
13. After closure of the surgical site in a layered fashion, steri-strips are applied to provide additional skin tension. Generally, a drain is not required.

# Postoperative Management

1. A postoperative chest film is taken to evaluate for pneumothorax.  
2. Patients are placed on weight-appropriate analgesics and antibiotics for one week.

# Complications

# Immediate or Early Complications

1. Pleural tears, pneumothorax, and pleuritis: Prevented or lessened with meticulous dissection of the periosteum overlying the deep portion of the rib and cartilage cap. Large pleural tears are treated with thoracotomy tube placement.  
2. Infection: Infections are rare and typically result from contamination of the surgical site at surgery or contamination of the wound in the postoperative period.  
3. Hematoma or seroma formation: Minimized with closure of the harvest site in a layered fashion. Hemostasis should be attained prior to closure of the surgical site. Treatment involves exploration and drain placement.

4. Injury to the intercostal neurovascular: Avoided by maintaining a subperiosteal dissection plane and by placing the incision over the midbody or superior aspect of the rib.  
5. Fracture at the bone-cartilage interface of the CCG: The longer the length of the cartilaginous cap, the more mechanically unstable the bone-cartilage interface of the costochondral graft.

# Late Complications

1. Chest concavity: Occurs when multiple, adjacent ribs are harvested.  
2. Scar formation over the breast in female patients: Incisions in female patients should be placed in either the inframammary crease or the area of the anticipated future inframammary crease. At no point should the incision be placed over the developing breast mound or near the areolas.  
3. Areola retraction: Occurs when the incision is placed near the areolas.

# Key Points

1. The main advantage of CCGs over other forms of autogenous bone grafts is the ability of continued growth in the pediatric and adolescent patient population. The continued growth is a result of the growth center located within the hyaline cartilage cap and makes the main use of the CCG TMJ reconstruction in the prepubescent population.  
2. Most surgeons prefer to harvest CCGs from the contralateral side of the recipient site. The rationale is that the contralateral rib has a more ideal curvature and will adapt more desirably to the lateral surface of the recipient ramus. Others prefer to harvest CCGs from the right side due to a concern that left-sided chest pain from the harvest site may mimic or be confused with cardiogenic pain.  
3. In female patients, the location of the incision (inframammary crease, or anticipated inframammary crease in pediatric patents) often determines the rib to be harvested.  
4. Once the rib is isolated, care is taken to maintain the rib-cartilage junction. Because this junction (especially in pediatric patients) is inherently weak and is easily fractured, maintaining a small cuff of periosteum or perichondrium around the rib-cartilage interface will enhance the structural integrity of this area and will help prevent its fracture during both harvest and placement.  
5. Longer lengths of cartilage create a lever arm that is more prone to fracture at the bone-cartilage interface (junction). A  $10\mathrm{mm}$  or less cartilaginous cap is sufficient for temporomandibular reconstruction procedures.
