A method for reconstructing temporomandibular joints (TMJs) that have become significantly impaired and require alloplastic reconstruction to return form and function.

# Indications

1. Ankylosis  
2. Degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritides, or related arthropathies and autoimmune disorders of the condyle  
3. Condyle loss from trauma, pathology, or any progressive disease state  
4. Failed autogenous joint reconstruction  
5. Failed alloplastic joint reconstruction  
6. History of multiple joint surgeries  
7. Loss of lateral pterygoid function with any of the above  
8. Vertical dimension loss of the ramus with occlusal abnormalities  
9. Relative indications: Pain, loss of interincisal opening, and/or occlusion disharmony refractory to non-total joint procedures

# Contraindications

1. Active or suspected infections in or about the implantation site  
2. Proven allergic reactions to any of the prosthetic materials  
3. Systemic disease with increased susceptibility to infection  
4. Psychiatric disorders  
5. Medically compromised individuals: the very elderly, uncontrolled systemic diseases, and drug and/or alcohol addiction  
6. Skeletal immaturity (relative contraindication)

# Diagnosis and Surgical Planning

The surgeon must diagnose all preoperative conditions and plan desired outcomes relative to joint pathology, functional goals, desired occlusion, and aesthetics. A one-stage surgical reconstruction using a one-piece or two-piece stereolithic model, or a two-stage surgical procedure (which predominately uses a one-piece stereolithic model), is selected based on the surgeon's preference and desired treatment objectives. With a one-piece model, the occlusion is set prior to the procedure by performing the manufacturer-specific CT scan with the patient in intermaxillary fixation (IMF). With a two-piece model, the manufacturer-specific CT scan is obtained with the patient not in IMF. The advantage of a two-piece model is that it will allow the surgeon to set a new occlusion, either in a 3D digital environment or by fixating the two-piece model into the desired occlusion.

# Indications for a One-Piece Stereolithic Model

1. The patient is able to maintain a normal occlusion during the computed tomography (CT) scan. Aesthetics are satisfactory.  
2. The surgeon is able to manipulate and maintain a normal occlusion with the use of IMF for the CT scan. Aesthetics are satisfactory.  
3. The occlusion is ideal or nearly ideal, and it is maintained during the CT scan. Fossa anatomy is easily adjusted with minor corrections at planned surgery. Aesthetics are satisfactory.

To fabricate a one-piece stereolithic model, a manufacturer-specific CT scan is obtained with the jaws in occlusion, utilizing IMF if necessary. The stereolithic model is fabricated in one piece, with the patient's mandibular dentition fused to the maxillary dentition. The custom joints are fabricated based on the occlusion set during the manufacturer-specific CT scan.

# a Two-Piece Stereolithic Model

A two-piece stereolithic model is preferred when simultaneous mandibular and/or maxillary repositioning is required.

1. Condylectomy: A two-piece model is necessary when performing a condylectomy (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis) and placing total joints to improve occlusion and aesthetics. In the above instances, the fossa anatomy is normal or near-normal, requiring little alteration, and joint placement improves the occlusion.  
2. Simultaneous orthognathic surgery with total joint placement: Surgery may be performed in patients with poor occlusion, specific edentulous cases, apertognathia, maxillary or mandibular deformities, and mandibular asymmetries. The surgeon must be comfortable in simultaneously establishing the "new" occlusion through orthognathic surgery with concomitant total joint surgery (Refer to Chapter 43: Concomitant TMJ and Orthognathic Surgery).

To fabricate a two-piece stereolithic model, a manufacturer-specific CT scan is obtained with the jaws set slightly apart. The stereolithic model is fabricated in two pieces, with the mandible separated from the maxilla. The surgeon establishes the final occlusion during the surgical workup, and the custom joints are fabricated based on the desired final occlusion. The occlusion and desired aesthetics are then corrected at surgery with custom total joint placement and, if required, simultaneous orthognathic surgery.

# One-Stage Alloplastic Reconstruction (See Case Report 40.1)

One-stage alloplastic TMJ reconstructions are indicated in cases with abnormal joint pathology where gross excision of ankylosis, aggressive reshaping of the glenoid fossa, and correction of occlusion are not necessary or are minor. IMF is placed prior to surgery to provide the final postoperative occlusion. A manufacturer-specific CT scan is obtained with the patient in IMF and a stereolithic one-piece model is generated. The custom joint(s) are waxed up, approved by the surgeon, and fabricated. The gap arthroplasty (condyle resection) surgery and custom TMJ prosthesis placement are performed simultaneously (one-stage surgery).

# Specific Indications for One-Stage Alloplastic Reconstruction

1. Fossa and condyle anatomy that requires little modification (degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic condylar resorption, etc.) (see Case Report 40.1)  
2. Condyle loss from trauma, resorption, or any progressive disease state  
3. Tumor resection involving the body or angle of the mandible where insufficient proximal bone is present for plate fixation (see Figure 40.7)

# Two-Stage Alloplastic Reconstruction (See Case Report 40.2)

Cases with abnormal joint pathology, typically extensive bony ankylosis with or without occlusal or aesthetic anomalies, require excision of the ankylosis, shaping of fossa anatomy, and correction of occlusion and facial aesthetics by repositioning the mandible. IMF is required immediately after the first surgery to obtain the manufacturer-specific, CT scan-generated stereolithic model for a one-piece model. The custom total joint prosthesis is inserted at the second surgical procedure. If orthognathic surgery is planned, it may be performed at either the first or second surgery. If performed at the second surgical procedure, the teeth are separated when obtaining the manufacturer-specific CT scan, and a two-piece stereolithic model will be ordered as described above.

# Specific Indications for Two-Stage Alloplastic Reconstruction

1. Fossa or condyle anatomy that requires significant modification or resection  
2. Significant bony ankylosis  
3. When significant occlusal alterations are necessary with (1) or (2)  
4. Resection of large tumors of the temporomandibular region with associated hard tissue defects  
5. Removal of failed alloplastic hardware

# TMJ Concepts Virtual Surgical Planning

1. A manufacturer-specific, medical-grade CT scan is ordered to reflect  $0.5 - 1.0\mathrm{mm}$  cuts at zero gantry in an axial plane. The scan must include, at a minimum,  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$  above the glenoid fossa and the complete inferior border of the mandible. The patient is scanned in occlusion (one-piece model) with or without IMF or with the jaws set apart (two-piece model), as determined by the surgical plan.  
2. DICOM files are sent to the total joint manufacturer on a CD or uploaded directly for the fabrication of a stereolithic model in one or two pieces as prescribed by the surgeon. Stone models, intraoral digital scanner generated data (see Figure 40.1), or cone beam CT (CBCT) scanner generated data can be used to remove scan distortion from dental artifacts (i.e., dental restorations, arch bars, and orthodontic brackets), maximize occlusal anatomy, and establish ideal occlusion when a two-piece stereolithic model is used. Utilizing the above modalities will significantly improve the accuracy of the final occlusal result. The dental anatomy data from the laser-scanned stone models, intraoral scanner, or CBCT are registered within the manufacturer's software using surface-based align-

ment algorithms and are used to replace the maxillary and mandibular teeth (see Figures 40.2 and 40.3) within the manufacturer-specific CT scan. Once the dental anatomy is registered to the bony anatomy within the manufacturer's software, a hybrid model is generated and the preferred occlusion can be produced. Either the surgeon can use the improved hybrid pieces in a two-piece model to set the occlusion, or a planned occlusion can be generated using the dental models. If dental models are used to generate the final occlusion, the models are scanned in a prescribed or "ideal" occlusion using one of the methods listed earlier. The scanned occlusion is registered to the maxilla hybrid component in the CT scan. The hybrid mandible is located to the digitized occlusion. The stereolithic model is then fabricated for subsequent implant design (see Figure 40.4).

3. For a one-stage procedure, a one-piece stereolithic model is returned to the surgeon with the teeth in ideal occlusion as placed by the surgeon prior to the manufacturer-specific CT scan, or the ideal occlusion is set by the surgeon on models, which are sent to the manufacturer for scanning if the CT was taken with the teeth apart. During the virtual surgical planning session, the surgeon and the engineer will evaluate the patient's anatomy, occlusion and treatment objectives and perform virtual condylectomies, coronoidectomies, and minor alterations of the fossae. Alternatively, a stereolithic model with the patient in occlusion may be sent directly to the surgeon to create the condyle and coronoid osteotomy lines and fossa reshaping.  
4. With a two-piece stereolithic model, if the surgeon repositions the mandible on the returned stereolithic model, preservation of the coronoid processes may be helpful in maintaining the normal spatial relationships of the mandible to the skull base (see Figure 40.4). Once the mandible is secured to the maxilla with hot glue or plates, the coronoids can be removed from the model. Repositioning of the maxilla may also be performed by the surgeon as needed.  
5. For two-stage surgical procedures, the condylectomy with fossa shaping and coronoidectomy is completed on the patient. Orthognathic surgery, if necessary, is usually done at this time. A manufacturer-specific CT scan is obtained after resection of the condyle, coronoid, or temporal mass with the patient in occlusion for the fabrication of a one-piece model or not in occlusion for the fabrication of a two-piece model if additional surgery is planned (rarely).  
6. The operated model is returned to the manufacturer, who creates a wax-up of the custom prostheses (glenoid fossa and condyle) (see Figures 40.16 and 40.46) and sends the wax-up to the surgeon for approval prior to fabrication of the total joints. The surgeon approves or requests modification of the manufacturer's workup.

The final custom prosthesis is approved by the surgeon and fabricated (see Figures 40.4, 40.7, 40.8, and 40.47). Custom cut guides may be generated (see Figure 40.13) for use during condylectomies and coronoidectomies to minimize errors and to allow for a precision fit of the prostheses.

# Surgical Technique and Insertion of Custom TMJ Prostheses

# Presurgical Preparation

1. Intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and antisialagogues are given preoperatively. The patient is positioned supine and nasally intubated. Short-acting paralytics are used during intubation to allow for stimulation and

identification of branches of the facial nerve during the procedures. Separate intraoral and facial instrument tray setups are established. Protective draping and/or redraping and prepping are recommended throughout the procedure to avoid cross-contamination between the mouth and face when going back and forth between sterile and nonsterile (oral) environments.

2. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx. If orthodontic appliances are not in place, mandibular and maxillary Erich arch bars are placed, but IMF is not initiated. The oral cavity is prepped with Betadine paint (Betadine scrub is not recommended for mucous membranes application), and a sterile gauze is placed between the dentition and the internal surface of the lips (see Figure 40.17) to prevent the contamination of the extraoral field with saliva.  
3. Lacrilube is placed within the orbits. Corneal shields or small occlusive dressings are used to protect the eyes. The use of large, obstructive dressings is contraindicated in order to allow for visualization when testing the temporal branch of the facial nerve. A plastic adhesive drape (i.e., Tegaderm or Opsite) is used to seal the oral cavity to prevent the contamination of the extraoral surgical sites with oral microbes (see Figure 40.18). Large occlusive dressings are contraindicated to allow for visualization when testing the buccal and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve.  
4. The patient's hair is prepped to ensure there is no hair within the surgical field. If the hair is shaved, ensure the underlying skin is not damaged to minimize the risk of infection.  
5. The external auditory canals are prepped with Betadine paint, and an antibiotic-impregnated ear wick is placed within the external auditory canals bilaterally. The remainder of the facial skeleton is prepped with Betadine paint from the scalp to the clavicles. The patient is draped to allow for exposure of bilateral preauricular and modified retromandibular incisions (even if only anticipating ipsilateral surgery) and the oral cavity. The corner of the mouth and eyes must be exposed within the surgical field to allow for visualization of stimulation of all branches of the facial nerve during the procedure.  
6. The prostheses are removed from the manufacturer's sterile wrapping and placed within a broad-spectrum antibiotic concentrated solution (i.e., a mixture of normal saline with Cleocin and Vancomycin) at the beginning of the case. Copious irrigation of the wounds using the same solution is performed throughout the case.

# Preauricular Approach

1. The natural skin crease anterior to the helix is identified. The anticipated preauricular incision is marked with a marking pen from the top of the helix of the ear to the inferior level of the external auditory canal

within the natural skin crease (see Figure 40.5). A slight antero-superior curved releasing incision may be incorporated into the superior aspect of the incision.

2. A vasoconstrictor (i.e., 1:200,000 epinephrine solution) is injected along the proposed surgical incision within the subcutaneous tissues to assist in hemostasis. A skin incision is initiated along the previously marked line.

3. From the superior aspect of the incision to the zygomatic arch, the incision continues through the underlying subcutaneous tissue to expose the superficial layer of the temporalis fascia. A needle-tipped cautery is used to transect through the superficial or outer layer of the temporalis fascia from the root of the zygomatic arch level to the superior aspect of the incision. Once the superficial or outer layer of the temporalis fascia is transected, adipose tissue is recognized between the superficial and deep layers of the temporalis fascia. The deep or inner layer of the temporalis fascia proceeds beneath the zygomatic arch and is not incised. Once the periosteum on the root of the zygomatic arch is incised at the posterior aspect of the fossa, a flap with the outer temporalis fascia and periosteum is elevated and reflected anteriorly. This flap will also include soft tissue over the capsule as described further in this chapter. The superficial temporal vessels are either retracted with the flap or ligated.

4. From the arch to the inferior aspect of the incisionblunt dissection continues approximately  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the level of the arch to expose the TMJ capsule or fibrous connective tissue if the capsule has been operated previously. Exposure of the parotid gland lobule inferiorly should be avoided. During the above-mentioned anterior flap elevation over the root of the zygoma, a periosteal elevator is utilized to slide within a subperiosteal plane over the arch past the articular eminence. Once the articular eminence is reached, the periosteal elevator or a kitner slides inferiorly and anteriorly in a sweeping motion to further expose the lateral capsule of the TMJ.

5. This tissue flap, extending outside the deep layer of the temporalis fascia superiorly and beneath the subperiosteal tissue layer over the arch and over the capsule inferiorly, is elevated and retracted anteriorly just past the articular eminence. Frequent testing of all soft tissues with a nerve stimulator at the level of and below the arch may appreciate the temporal branch of the facial nerve. The nerve must remain within the retracted flap as it passes over the arch (1-3 cm anterior to the postglenoid tubercle) and divides to supply the forehead and the upper eyelid. Posteriorly, care is taken to avoid exposure or damage of the auricular cartilage

Incisions

The blue line depicts the location of the modified retromandibular incision. The green line represents the surgical division of the masseter muscle between the marginal mandibular and the buccal branch of the facial nerve to gain access to the lateral ramus.

to minimize chondritis. The postglenoid tubercle is the most posterior aspect of the dissection.

6. A deep incision is made through the soft tissue along the outer edge of the fossa from the postglenoid tubercle across to and slightly past the articular eminence. The incision continues in a large U-shaped fashion surrounding the entire capsule, or, if previously operated, fibrous connective tissue to expose the condyle or fibrous-bony mass. The subperiosteal reflection is carried anterior and inferiorly to the level of the condyle neck.

# Modified Retromandibular Approach

This is the approach that we have predominately used for decades. Standard retromandibular and submandibular techniques are certainly acceptable and occasionally used. This technique provides an aesthetic skin incision, encourages the dissection to pass between the branches of the marginal mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve, and continues through the masseter muscle to bone. Selection of this technique provides a more direct access to the ramus and is based on the length of the body portion of the condylar component, anticipated facial nerve involvement, aesthetics, and the surgeon's comfort zone. It gives the surgeon a choice of retracting superiorly or inferiorly the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve, usually avoids interaction with the parotid gland, and commonly avoids ligation of the facial vessels.

1. The angle and inferior border of the mandible are palpated and marked with a surgical marking pen. Care should be taken to not stretch the tissue as this can distort the surgical field. A  $3\mathrm{cm}$  slightly curved line is drawn that is not parallel to either the inferior or posterior border of the mandible, is slightly below the angle of the mandible, and is usually parallel to or within a natural skin crease. The line is just below and centered at the angle of the mandible unless there is anticipation of lowering the angle with the reconstruction.  
2. A vasoconstrictor (i.e., 1:200,000 epinephrine solution) is injected subcutaneously along the pre-marked incision line to minimize bleeding.  
3. The skin is placed under slight tension, and a #15 blade is used to incise the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissues along the pre-marked incision line to the level of the fascia overlying the platysma. Using a Ray-Tec, gently sweep the overlying subcutaneous tissue superiorly and inferiorly to fully expose the underlying platysma muscle. A #15 blade is used to sharply incise the platysma muscle. Neural testing should be performed deep to the platysma muscle to ensure that the marginal mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve are protected.  
4. After the platysma is incised, the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia is encountered. At this level, the facial vein and artery may be encountered at the

anterior aspect of the dissection at the level of the antigonial notch. Generally, this represents the most anterior aspect of a modified retromandibular dissection, and frequently the facial vessels can be retracted forward, if not ligated. Occasionally, the tail of the parotid gland is encountered and retracted posteriorly and superiorly at the posterior aspect of the dissection. Care must be taken to identify and protect the marginal mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve along the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. A nerve stimulator set at  $2\mathrm{mA}$  (mA) is used to identify facial nerve branches. Once identified (see Figure 40.38), the surgeon must decide whether to proceed inferior or superior to the marginal mandibular nerve. Typically, the procedure extends between the buccal and marginal mandibular nerves. In multiple operated patients, the facial nerves are frequently located within scar tissue and/or are encountered outside of normal dissection planes.

5. The pterygomasseteric sling and periosteum are incised over the angle of the mandible close to the inferior border, and a subperiosteal dissection plane is utilized to expose the lateral aspect of the mandibular ramus, the coronoid process, and the sigmoid notch. The posterior border of the mandible is dissected superiorly toward the condylar process and is connected with the preauricular dissection. A channel retractor is placed within the sigmoid notch along with toe-in retractors anteriorly and posteriorly to facilitate exposure of the entire ramus.

# Condylar Resection Without Massive Ankylosis

1. Once the preauricular and modified retromandibular dissections are completed and connected (see Figure 40.19), the condylar resection is initiated (see Figure 40.20). The previously determined osteotomy line below the condyle is marked via measurements taken from various anatomical landmarks on the model, such as the inferior aspect of the zygomatic arch and angle of the mandible. Alternatively, a custom surgical template can be fabricated prior to the procedure (see Figures 40.13 and 40.20). A reciprocating saw blade is used under copious irrigation to perform the osteotomy, separating the condyle and neck from the ramus of the mandible. A curved Freer or periosteal elevator is placed posteriorly and medially subperiosteally to protect vessels during the osteotomy. A Seldin retractor or curved Freer is used to bring the free condylar segment laterally for removal. On patients with decent lateral and protrusive lateral pterygoid muscle function, the anterior aspect of the condyle with its attached lateral pterygoid muscle can be placed at the top of the middle of the ramus and secured with a single bone screw to preserve such function (see Figure 40.6). Generally, the coronoid process is osteotomized and removed at this time. If sufficient opening can be achieved with the coronoid process in

may elect to preserve the coronoid process and the attachment of the temporalis muscle to allow for retraction and elevation of the mandible.

2. After the condylar segment has been removed, the glenoid fossa must be prepped for the fossa component. The remaining soft tissue must be thoroughly debrided from the entire glenoid fossa, zygomatic arch, and articular eminence. If necessary, the glenoid fossa is contoured under copious irrigation to mirror the presurgical model from which the prosthesis was fabricated. The zygomatic arch is exposed anteriorly as far as needed to accept the lateral flange of the glenoid fossa component.

# Condylar Resection with Massive Ankylosis: Two-Stage Alloplastic Reconstruction

1. A standard preoperative CT scan is obtained to determine the degree of ankylosis and the amount of bone to be removed (see Figure 40.31). With severe deformities or with a joint that has had multiple surgeries, a CT angiogram may be helpful (see Figure 40.33).  
2. Once the condylar mass is identified, a periosteal elevator is used to establish a cleavage plane, if possible, between the area of ankylosis and the natural glenoid fossa. A towel clip or large clamp may be placed at the angle of the mandible to facilitate movement of the ankylosis to aid in the identification of the cleavage plane. Once the cleavage plane is identified, a periosteal or Freer elevator is used to separate the mass from the underlying glenoid fossa.  
3. For large areas of ankylosis, the mass is typically resected in smaller segments to facilitate the atraumatic removal of pieces through either extraoral incision (see Figures 40.40, 40.41, and 40.42). A bur, saw, or piezoelectric device with copious irrigation is used for this process. Care is taken when transecting the lateral portion of the ramus as numerous large vessels are typically found in close proximity to the lateral and medial border of the ramus. The segments are removed and the gap is completed by removing any irregularities from the glenoid fossa to below the neck of the condyle. Any potential areas that may interfere with future prostheses placement or fabrication are removed. The ipsilateral coronoid process is also removed.  
4. For areas of massive bony ankylosis, a cleavage plane may not be identifiable, and the entire glenoid fossa will need to be recontoured with a round bur. Care is taken to minimize inadvertent middle cranial fossa penetration and exposure of mastoid air cells.  
5. Once the condylar mass is resected, the coronoidectomy is completed, and all ascending ramus and glenoid fossa irregularities are removed or reintoured, the incisions are covered and the maximum incisal opening (MIO) of the patient is verified. The MIO of the patient should be

35–40 mm. For unilateral cases where the MIO is less than 35–40 mm, a contralateral coronoidectomy may be necessary. In cases with sufficient resection and mobility of the ramus, but in which a contralateral coronoidectomy does not increase MIO, a contralateral arthroplasty should be considered. In addition, deep fibrous connective-tissue bands medial and anterior to the ramus may be present and require judicious removal. In cases with extensive surgical history and repeated episodes of fibrous-bony ankylosis involving the medial and superior aspects of the ramus, it may be necessary to carefully strip most, if not all, aspects of the medial surface of the ramus and place abdominal fat wherever tissue gaps are present from fibrous connective tissue or bone removal (see Figures 40.43 and 40.44).

6. After completion of the resection and verification of MIO, the oral cavity is covered and reprepped. Spacers should be placed within the site of the gap between the fossa and ascending ramus to prevent dense fibrous connective tissue formation while waiting for stage 2 surgery. Spacers may include homemade acrylic condyles, artificial eyeballs, radial or ulnar forearm, and toe prostheses. Occasionally, orthognathic surgery is performed at this surgical stage or during the second surgery when custom total joints are inserted.  
7. A manufacturer-specific CT scan is taken postoperatively, with the patient placed into wire IMF to generate a one-piece model (see Figure 40.45). If orthognathic or reconstructive procedures are planned at the insertion of the custom TMJ prosthesis, a pediatric bite block is placed to separate the teeth during the scan. A two-piece model is then produced to allow for the correction of the patient's occlusion, as described above in this chapter.

# Prostheses Placement: One- or Two-Stage Alloplastic Reconstruction

1. After the condyle is resected and the fossa prepared, the glenoid fossa component is placed. Care is taken to not scratch the plastic bearing surface with sharp instruments during insertion. The glenoid fossa component is seated without soft tissue entrapment in a superior and medial direction using a thin Freer elevator to elevate the flap and slide the fossa prosthesis along the elevator while forcing insertion. A fossa-seating tool provided by the manufacturer is used through the modified retromandibular or preauricular incisions to assist in prosthesis seating. The fossa prosthesis must fit securely within the fossa with no rocking or mobility, and the flange resting along the zygomatic arch should fit snugly. Failure to seat the fossa component properly may result in failure of the implant or non-ideal articulation of the condylar prosthesis. Any areas that are noted to prevent the fossa

seating or that contribute to mobility of the prosthesis are relieved. The fossa component screws are placed using slow speed and copious irrigation to prevent devitalizing the bone. The fossa- seating tool is used to stabilize the implant during fixation.

2. Once the fossa prosthesis is fixated, the patient is placed into IMF with stainless steel wires. In order to minimize the potential contamination of the sterile extraoral incisions with oral microbes, the extraoral incisions are covered prior to entering the oral cavity. Instruments used to place the patient into IMF should not be used for the remainder of the case as they are contaminated with oral microbes. After placing the patient into IMF, the surgeons should replace the oral covering (i.e., Tegaderm or Opsite), reprep the tissue adjacent to the oral cavity, and change their gowns and gloves before returning to the sterile field.  
3. Bony reintouring of the lateral ramus, if conducted on the model, is performed with the patient in IMF. Bone removal should be performed very conservatively with multiple fit tests of the condylar component to ensure proper fit and to minimize unneeded bone removal.  
4. The condylar component should be properly aligned with the lateral aspect of the mandible, using the model outlines along the posterior and inferior borders. The articulation is finalized by ensuring that the condylar head is centered within the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fossa cup in the medial-lateral direction and against the bearing's posterior lip (see Figures 40.22 and 40.48). The mandibular component may be held flush against the ramus with the mandibular forceps provided by the manufacture. A Freer elevator is used to check for gapping along the perimeter of the mandibular component, particularly around the superior portion where visualization is limited. Gapping may indicate insufficient condylar resection, inadequate mandibular contouring, or improper fossa component seating.  
5. The condylar component is held in position with mandibular forceps, the condylar head position is checked again to ensure its ideal articulation within the fossa, and the condylar prosthesis is fixated using the predetermined size and length screws provided by the manufacturer (see Figures 40.23 and 40.49). The drill guide provided by the manufacturer should be utilized for each screw placement. Copious irrigation and slow-speed drilling are required to minimize devitalization of the bone. The first two or three screw holes are drilled and screws placed, but not tightened. The remaining screw holes are drilled, and screws are placed sequentially. All screws are then tightened after drilling is completed.  
6. The extraoral incisions are covered, and the oral cavity is entered to release IMF and to assess occlusion and function. Using sterile technique, the assistant surgeon directly observes the joint components under function to ensure proper movement without dislocation. While

the patient is in occlusion, the condylar heads should continue to be centered in the fossa, bearing in the medial or lateral direction and seated against the fossa bearing's posterior lip.

7. Care must be exercised so as not to cross-contaminate the surgical sites from the oral cavity. Extraoral incisions are copiously irrigated and closed in a layered fashion. A pressure dressing is applied and maintained for 24 hours. Guiding elastics are placed for immediate postoperative comfort and to minimize dislocation of the condyle. Full range of motion testing at the end of the case is performed to observe any tendency for condyle dislocation.

# Postoperative Management

1. Pressure dressing for 48-72 hours.  
2. Guiding elastics are used for 1-2 weeks postoperatively as necessary, and excessive opening is avoided.  
3. Physical therapy should be initiated with jaw-exercising devices (i.e., Therabite, Atos Medical, West Allis, WI, USA) at 7-10 days. Nighttime elastics are used up to 3-6 weeks postoperatively.  
4. A full liquid diet is employed for 2-3 weeks postoperatively, and then the patient is advanced to a soft chew diet.  
5. Orthodontic brackets or arch bars are retained for a minimum of 6 weeks to allow the use of training elastics.  
6. Patients are followed weekly for 4-6 weeks to monitor function and occlusal, and to observe for remote postoperative complications.  
7. Nonresorbable sutures are removed at 7-10 days postoperatively.  
8. Sunscreen is placed along the incision lines to prevent potential hyperpigmentation.  
9. If occlusal adjustments are necessary, it is best to wait until mandibular opening is maximum, smooth, and demonstrates repetitive articulation. Occlusal adjustments are not recommended until 6-8 weeks postoperatively.

# Key Points

1. For patients with craniofacial syndromes, large ankylosis masses, or those who have undergone multiple previous approaches to the TMJ, a CT angiogram may be beneficial to determine the exact location of major vessels prior to surgery.  
2. Virtual surgical planning (VSP), with or without the fabrication of custom cut guides, will give the operator a better understanding of the patient's hard tissue anatomy and the extent of tissue that requires excision prior to fabrication of custom TMJ implants.  
3. For multiply operated patients, facial nerves and blood vessels are frequently located in atypical locations and/or within scar tissue. The surgeon should always adhere to strict surgical principles during dissection to prevent neural or vascular injuries.  
4. The prostheses and the seating tool are removed from the manufacturer's sterile wrapping and placed within a broad-spectrum antibiotic concentrated solution (i.e., a mixture of normal saline and Vancomycin and Cleocin) at the beginning of the case. During repeated try-ins, the prostheses are stored within the antibiotic solution to impregnate the prostheses with antibiotics to minimize the opportunity for postoperative infections.  
5. Perforation or severance of the external auditory canal is managed with reapproximation of the cartilage with 4-0 Vicryl sutures, placement of an ear wick impregnated with ciprodex or ciprofloxacin drops and postoperative otolaryngology consultation.  
6. It is very important to follow a subperiosteal tissue plane during dissection along the zygomatic arch and to stay between the inner and outer layers of the temporal fascia to minimize damage to the facial nerve.  
7. For ankylosed joints, a cleavage plane is often identified between the ankylotic mass and the glenoid fossa. A

Freer elevator may be used to elevate within this plane. Care is taken to minimize excessive pressure along the base of the skull to prevent fractures/perforations of the skull base, ear canal and/or mastoid air cells.

8. The gap arthroplasty/mandibular resection must be adequate for placement of the prosthesis. Typically, this involves creating a  $15 - 20\mathrm{mm}$  space between the glenoid fossa and the ascending ramus.  
9. Resurfacing of the mandible and fossa should be carefully completed to ensure that the prosthesis does not rock and fits passively. All fibrous and granulation tissue and irregular bone should be completely removed from the glenoid fossa, particularly the hard to visualize medial aspect of the joint cavity.  
10. For one- and two-stage reconstructions, always adhere to the manufactures CT scan protocol.  
11. Use the fossa-seating tool only to prevent fossa prosthesis damage when testing its fit.  
12. Secure the fossa component and the mandibular component with the indicated screws from the manufacturer.  
13. One- and two-piece models may be fabricated dependent on the patient's occlusion. One-piece models are ideal for patients with a stable occlusion before or after condylectomy. Two-piece models are best suited for patient's requiring correction of severe preoperative deformity or malocclusion by repositioning the mandible through total joint placement with or without simultaneous maxillary surgery.  
14. As a general rule, case involving condylar degeneration and small ankylosis are best suited for one-stage reconstruction. Cases involving facial reconstruction surgery, combined orthognathic surgery and large bony ankylosis may be better suited for two-stage reconstruction.  
15. Examples of atypical cases involving total TMJs and adjacent anatomical reconstruction include hemimandiblectomies (see Figure 40.7), glenoid fossa/ temporal bone reconstruction (see Figures 40.8) and combined orthognathic surgery.  
16. In patients with reasonably good lateral pterygoid and temporalis function, the preservation of their muscular attachments to the condyle and coronoid process will allow for increased postoperative mandibular range of motion, specifically lateral excursive and protrusive movements. If sufficient mandibular opening can be achieved after condylotomy, the coronoid process may be left to allow for function of the temporal muscle (mandible elevation and retraction). If the condyle can be resected with preservation of the lateral pterygoid attachments, the condyle may be rigidly fixated to the superior aspect of the mid-ramus (see Figure 40.6) to preserve the function of the lateral pterygoid muscle (protrusive and lateral excursive movements).

# Case Reports

Case Report 40.1. Custom total joint: one-stage procedure: bilateral idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR). A 28-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of a progressive malocclusion. On physical examination, the patient with retrognathia and mentalis strain to compensate for lip incompetence. On intraoral examination, the patient with significant malocclusion and an anterior open bite. The maxilla with no evidence of canting, deformity or asymmetry and the patient exhibited ideal maxillary tooth show at repose and animation. A CBCT scan was obtained that demonstrated bilateral and symmetrical condylar resorption. The patient denies congenital deformity, facial trauma, and systemic joint disease. Serological testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor, and other autoimmune disorders. The patient was treated with custom total joint replacement to correct her facial and dental deformity (see Figures 40.9 through 40.25).

Case Report 40.2. Custom total joint: two-stage procedure: bilateral bony ankylosis. A 34-year-old male presents 4 years after closed reduction of bilateral condyle fractures at an outlying facility with a chief complaint of limited opening, inability to adequately nourish himself and weight loss. Review of the initial orthopantomogram and CT scan from the incident demonstrated bilateral medially displaced condyles and a moderately displaced symphysis fracture (see Figures 40.26 and 40.27). No other facial fractures were identified. The patient was definitively treated with 6 weeks of IMF. The patient was lost to follow up and progressively developed a limited range of motion, condylar dysfunction, and progressive weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated a MIO of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  with a lack of lateral excursive movements. A CT scan was obtained that demonstrated bilateral bony ankylosis of the TMJs (see Figures 40.29 and 40.30). Due to the degree of ankylosis, the decision was made to perform a two-stage reconstruction. VSP (Medical Modeling Inc., Golden, CO, USA) allowed for 3D visualization of the bilateral ankylosed TMJs and enabled virtual treatment planning to determine the exact osteotomy location and design (see Figure 40.31). A CT angiogram was obtained that demonstrated extreme proximity of the internal maxillary artery to the medial aspect of the ramus bilaterally (see Figure 40.33). The Stryker Navigation System (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was used to allow for exact osteotomy placement and to avoid damage to anatomical structures (the internal maxillary artery and the inferior alveolar nerve). Electrodes were positioned that allowed for the identification of exact bony reference points identified by the Navigation System throughout the procedure (see Figure 40.32). After completion of the bilateral ankylosis resection, a protomed CT scan was obtained with the patient in IMF the day after surgery (see Figure 40.45). A one-piece TMJ Concepts (Ventura, CA, USA) stereolithic model was fabricated, and bilateral

total joints were waxed up, approved, manufactured, and inserted (see Figures 40.46 through 40.49). The patient's maximum vertical opening immediately status post bilateral total joint insertion was  $40\mathrm{mm}$ . The patient has maintained a maximum vertical opening of  $44\mathrm{mm}$  postoperatively (see Figures 40.26 through 40.52).
