# Indications

1. Reconstruction of soft tissue defects due to pathologic resection or traumatic avulsion in any region including the head and neck, scalp, oral cavity, chest wall, or the extremities.  
2. Need for a large skin paddle in extensive reconstruction. The broad muscle provides a large surface area that can virtually cover any defect size in the head and neck region.  
3. Reconstruction of multiple epithelial surfaces with a singular flap (chimeric flap).  
4. In general, a pedicled flap is preferred in a patient who is not medically stable for microvascular transfer. However, in the authors' experiences, microvascular transfer does not add significant time to the operating room time compared to the pedicled flap. Certainly, in vessel-depleted patients, a free vascularized flap is not a good option.

# Relative Contraindications

1. History of previous trauma or surgery in the back.  
2. Hypercoagulable conditions.  
3. This flap design requires placement of the patient in the lateral decubitus position to harvest. This limits the ability to perform the operation via a two-team approach. Placing the patient in a "lazy lateral (semilateral decubitus)" position allows a two-team approach. However, this position limits access to both donor and recipient sites. In addition, due to the proximity of the donor site and the recipient site, it is quite cumbersome to perform fluent surgery.  
4. Morbid obesity: Bulk may be too much for some defects, especially given the large amount of subcutaneous fat in obese individuals.  
5. Need for skin grafting and poor cosmetic result at the donor site if a large flap is harvested and primary closure is not able to be achieved.  
6. Large volume loss of the flap over time due to muscle atrophy.

7. Latissimus dorsi skin is usually lighter and thicker than the skin in the head and neck, thus providing poor soft tissue match.

# Anatomy

The latissimus dorsi is a broad, flat, roughly triangular-shaped muscle that covers a large portion of the back. The skin paddle provided can cover a defect size ranging from 25 to  $40\mathrm{cm}$  depending on the patient's torso size. The latissimus dorsi originates from the spinous process of the lower six thoracic vertebrae, from the thoracolumbar fascia that attaches it to both lumbar and sacral vertebrae medially, and from the posterior iliac crest laterally. It passes laterally and cephalad over the tip of the scapula and spirals around the inferior border of the teres major to insert onto the medial humerus at the inter-tubercular groove. The tendon of the latissimus dorsi, along with the teres major muscle, form the posterior axillary fold. The major actions of the latissimus dorsi are to adduct, inwardly rotate, and extend the arm, as well as to stabilize the scapula. If the latissimus is sacrificed due to flap harvest, its actions are well compensated for by the complementary muscles, i.e., the pectoralis major, which stabilizes the glenohumeral joint.

The latissimus dorsi flap has a consistent vascular anatomy based on the thoracodorsal artery and vein. The subclavian artery and vein give rise to the axillary artery and vein. The distal third of the axillary vessels gives rise to the subscapular artery and vein, which in turn gives off the circumflex scapular vessels and then gives rise to the thoracodorsal artery and vein. The thoracodorsal vessels course through the fibrofatty tissue of the axilla prior to providing a small, but consistent, angular branch to the scapular tip and larger branches to the serratus anterior. It then enters the hilum of the latissimus dorsi where it bifurcates into horizontal and vertical branches, both of which serve to perfuse the latissimus dorsi muscle. The average length of the thoracodorsal vascular pedicle is  $9.4\mathrm{cm}$  (average of  $6.0 - 16.5\mathrm{cm}$ ). The average diameter of the artery is  $2.7\mathrm{mm}$  (range of  $1.5 - 4\mathrm{mm}$ ), and the average

diameter of the vein is  $3.4\mathrm{mm}$  (range of  $1.5 - 4.5\mathrm{mm}$ ). It should be noted that the thoracodorsal nerve runs with a consistent anatomy with the artery and vein. It is this consistent anatomy that allows for the use of the latissimus dorsi flap to be utilized for facial reanimation in certain situations.

# Preoperative Management

1. A thorough history and physical, as well as appropriate laboratory studies and imaging, should be completed prior to surgery.  
2. The preoperative workup should include any history of prior head and neck surgery and/or radiation, as well as any prior surgeries or trauma to the torso. It should be noted that in a patient with a prior ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection, there is a high likelihood that the thoracodorsal vessels have been ligated.  
3. Preoperative workup for latissimus dorsi flap should include extensive physical examination of the thorax, but does not necessitate any additional imaging, such as angiography.  
4. Body Mass. Index  $(\mathrm{BMI}) > 30$  has been associated with increased risk of surgical complications such as flap failure and donor site morbidity, in addition to general medical complications.  
5. A pinch test should be performed preoperatively to determine if the donor site can be closed primarily or if a skin graft or adjacent tissue transfer is necessary.

# Technique

1. The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position ensuring all points of pressure are adequately padded. This includes supporting the head by placing a pad between the shoulder and the neck to prevent impingement of the brachial plexus. The ipsilateral arm can be included in the surgical field and should be prepped and draped accordingly. Alternatively, the ipsilateral arm may be draped and excluded from the operating field depending on surgeon preference. The contralateral arm should be positioned to not cause undue pressure on the shoulder girdle, or on the arm itself, and is not routinely included within the field.  
2. Major landmarks are marked to include the midpoint of the axilla, the iliac crest, and the tip of the scapula (see Figure 70.2 in Case Report 70.1). If the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi cannot be easily palpated, a line drawn from the mid-axilla to a point where the anterior and posterior iliac crest meet will denote its position. The superior extent of the muscle is located  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  above the scapular tip. The posterior extent of the muscle is at the vertebral column and the inferior extent is located at its attachment to the posterior superior iliac crest. The thoracodorsal artery

enters the latissimus dorsi muscle  $8 - 10\mathrm{cm}$  caudal to the axilla. The horizontal branch is usually found a few centimeters below the scapular tip and the vertical branch runs  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the anterior muscle edge.

3. The skin paddle is drawn and positioned along the long axis of the vertical branch of the thoracodorsal artery. The skin paddle is fusiform in shape to assist in closure. Up to a  $10\mathrm{cm}$  width can be closed primarily. The inferior extent of the skin paddle should be positioned  $8\mathrm{cm}$  above posterior iliac crest in order to avoid positioning over the relatively avascular thoracolumbar fascia. If a second skin paddle is required, it can be oriented along the horizontal branch. Alternatively, one large skin paddle can be harvested and the intervening skin de-epithelialized.  
4. The patient is prepped and draped according to surgeon preference.  
5. The incision is made through skin and subcutaneous tissue along the line drawn between the axilla and the iliac crest. The anterior edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle should be easily identified.  
6. Dissection is begun along the anterior border the latissimus dorsi. During this dissection, the serrates anterior branch is usually the first major vascular structure encountered and is easy to identify as it runs superficial to the serratus anterior muscle. Proximal dissection of this branch leads to the thoracodorsal neurovascular pedicle.  
7. Once the thoracodorsal vascular pedicle has been identified, the branch to the serratus can be divided to assist in mobilization of the flap.  
8. Following identification of the vascular pedicle, the anterior dissection of the latissimus can be completed along its length.  
9. Once anterior dissection is complete, the incision outlining the skin paddle can be completed and the back skin can be raised to reveal the full extent of the latissimus to just short of midline.  
10. The amount of latissimus dorsi muscle to be harvested is determined, and sharp dissection is employed to release it from its attachments to the iliac crest, vertebrae, and the lower ribs. The vascular feeders entering the deep surface of the muscle at the inferior and medial aspects must be ligated and divided. It should be noted that at this point the entire muscle need not be taken, only the planned amount that is to be brought to the recipient site with the skin paddle.  
11. Dissection proceeds distal to proximal toward the axilla until the vascular hilum is identified. Careful dissection of the thoracodorsal neurovascular pedicle along its extent will necessitate division of smaller muscular branches, as well as ligation and division of the angular branch to the scapula.

12. To completely mobilize the latissimus dorsi, the tendinous attachment to the humerus must be divided. Great care must be taken while doing this so as not to injure the vascular pedicle.  
13. If further pedicle length is required, dissection can be carried up to the subscapular trunk. This requires ligation and division of the circumflex scapular artery and vein.  
14. Following division, the flap is inset at the recipient site (see Figure 70.5 in Case Report 70.1).  
15. Hemostasis is judiciously obtained in the donor site and suction drains are placed and secured at the skin with drain stitches. If the patient's skin laxity permits, defects up to  $10\mathrm{cm}$  wide can be closed primarily (see Figure 70.6 in Case Report 70.1). Otherwise, a skin graft affords adequate cosmesis. The wound is closed per surgeon preference.

# Postoperative Management

1. Immediately postoperatively, the patient will be transferred to ICU for flap monitoring per standard protocol. At our institution, this includes an assessment every hour for the first 48 hours, every 2 hours for the next 24 hours, every 4 hours for the next 24 hours, and then every 6 hours until discharge from the hospital. This examination includes flap appearance, color, temperature, skin turgor, capillary refill time, as well as assessment by handheld Doppler or by implantable Doppler.  
2. The decision to keep the patient intubated and/or to perform a tracheostomy versus extubation is at the discretion of the surgeon and is guided by the location of the surgical site, the extent of the surgery, as well as the patient's medical comorbidities.  
3. Permissible hypertension is allowed to a systolic blood pressure of 160, but no higher to mitigate hematoma accumulation.  
4. Hypotension must be avoided to ensure adequate flap perfusion.  
5. Use of vasopressors should be limited to maintain adequate perfusion of the flap.  
6. Patients routinely receive steroids and antibiotic prophylaxis for 3-5 days following surgery.  
7. Closed suction drains are stripped and output is recorded every 4 hours. Drains are removed once the output is less than  $30\mathrm{mL}$  in 24 hours.  
8. Normal movement of the arm is permissible from postoperative day number one. Strenuous physical activity, such as lifting heavy weights, should be avoided for 6 weeks following surgery. Physical therapy is usually begun within the first few days following surgery, as long as the patient is able.  
9. Skin stitches or staples are typically removed 10-14 days after surgery.

# Early Complications

1. Bleeding: Although not common, hematoma formation does occur following latissimus dorsi harvest and flap inset. This can be mitigated with meticulous technique in obtaining hemostasis prior to wound closure.  
2. Seroma: Seroma formation is another rare complication that can be minimized by the use of closed suction drains that are left in place until output is less than  $30\mathrm{mL}$  in a 24 hour period.  
3. Infection: Use of perioperative antibiotics, proper sterile technique, and postoperative wound care can minimize the occurrence of postoperative infection.  
4. Flap failure: Recipient site complications can range from limited necrosis of distal skin edges to total flap failure. Necrosis and flap failure can be minimized by following standard protocols for microvascular transfer including proper patient selection, recipient vessel selection, avoiding kinking of the vascular pedicle and excess pressure on the flap itself, and maintaining perfusion of the flap via tight control of the patient's blood pressure.

# Late Complications

1. Shoulder weakness: Although limited due to the complimentary musculature involved in movement about the glenohumeral joint, shoulder weakness can be complicated by other procedures that weaken the shoulder girdle, such as radical neck dissection, which sacrifices the spinal accessory nerve or by inadvertent injury to the brachial plexus.  
2. Scarring: The scars from flap harvest are usually acceptable to patients and are generally well hidden by garments. However, postoperative wound complications can lead to unsightly scars that may require subsequent surgical interventions.  
3. Color mismatch: Depending on the recipient site, the skin of the latissimus dorsi is generally of a differing tone and thickness from the skin of the head and neck area.  
4. Excess bulk: The thickness of this flap may be too bulky for limited oral cavity or facial defects due to the regional anatomy of the donor site, as well as the amount of subcutaneous fat contained within it.

# Key Points

1. It may be difficult to accurately assess the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi in certain patients, such as obese individuals. Usually, the anterior muscle edge can be found along a line that runs from the dorsal axillary fold cranially to the midline of the iliac crest caudally. In thin individuals, adduction of the arm should allow easy palpation of the anterior muscle edge.

2. The branch to the serratus anterior muscle is the first branch visualized during dissection coming off the thoracodorsal artery. This branch should not be mistaken for the main trunk. It is advised to only divide this branch once the thoracodorsal neuromuscular pedicle has been definitively identified.  
3. The bulky aspect of the skin paddle, especially in obese individuals, may cause shear forces that can injure the perforator vessels and compromise perfusion to the skin island. Stay sutures can assist in fixing the skin to the underlying muscle and should be left in place until flap inset.  
4. Designing the skin paddle over the caudal extent of the muscle helps to improve the length of the vascular pedicle. However, the density of the perforators in this region is diminished, making the blood supply to the skin island less substantial, and if the skin paddle is too far caudal, it is positioned over the avascular thoracolumbar fascia.  
5. The latissimus dorsi is one of the thinnest muscles in the body, which makes it a good option for reconstructing two surface defects. This is done by folding the flap on itself and de-epithelializing the intervening skin bridge to close such defects as a combined oral cavity and cheek defect.  
6. Two surface defects can also be reconstructed by splitting the latissimus flap into two separate pedicles, one based on the vertical and the other based off the transverse branches of the thoracodorsal artery.  
7. The thoracodorsal artery is relatively unaffected by atherosclerotic disease.  
8. Although this selection focuses on the use of the latissimus dorsi as a free myocutaneous flap, it also has great versatility in the ability to be used as a pedicled flap for head and neck reconstruction. This can be indicated in patients who are not medically stable for more complex reconstructive procedures or in the vessel-depleted neck due to radiation or extensive surgery where adequate vessels for microvascular anastomosis are unable to be found. Its length allows it to reconstruct ipsilateral defects up to the midline of the neck, oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, midface, and scalp save for the parietal and frontal areas. Its use as a pedicled flap carries the same indications and contraindications for reconstruction of large defects with the extent of coverage limited by the arc of rotation and length of the pedicle. The harvesting of the flap is nearly identical

as well. During harvest, division of the branch to the serratus affords a longer pedicle length. Some surgeons advise preserving the circumflex scapular artery as it serves to help avoid kinking of the pedicle along its arc of rotation, but it may be divided if extra length is necessitated. Of course, in use of a pedicled flap the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle itself is not divided. Following harvest of the flap, a tunnel is created over the chest between the pectoralis major and minor. The pedicle exits the chest through an incision just below the clavicle. Care must be taken during this dissection so as to not incur injury to the thoraco-acromial artery and vein, as they should be preserved in the event a pectoralis major flap would be needed in the future. Once the flap is passed through this tunnel, it is inset and the harvest site is closed as described prior.

# Case Report

# Case Report 70.1. Myocutaneous free latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction of ablative cranial defect.

A 71-year-old male patient presents with an extensive skin squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp. Due to involvement of the dura, this tumor was resected in collaboration with neurosurgery (see Figure 70.1). Due to the substantial size of the defect, a myocutaneous free latissimus dorsi was used to provide coverage and bulk to the post-ablation surgical defect (see Figures 70.1 through 70.6).
