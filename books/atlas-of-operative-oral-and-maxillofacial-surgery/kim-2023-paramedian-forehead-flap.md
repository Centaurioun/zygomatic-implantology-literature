The harvest of a regional axial pattern flap from the forehead for reconstruction of adjacent soft tissue maxillofacial defects.

# Indications

1. Nasal reconstruction

a. Subtotal to total nasal defect up to  $1.5 - 2.0\mathrm{cm}$

i. If a defect involves  $>50\%$  of the cosmetic subunits of the nose, excision of the remaining subunit and reconstruction of the entire subunit with a paramedian forehead flap (PMFF) may result in improved cosmesis.  
b. May be combined with or follow efforts to reconstruct the nasal lining or bone and cartilaginous framework of the nose  
c. Defect commonly due to trauma, infection, or oncologic ablation (e.g., basal cell carcinoma)

2. Periorbital reconstruction

a. May be used in conjunction with skin grafts or other local flaps to repair larger orbitofacial defects  
b. Medial canthal defects, orbital exenteration defects, and paranasal defects have been documented to be reconstructed with the PMFF

# Contraindications

1. Absolute contraindications:

a. Compromised blood supply secondary to previous forehead or orbital trauma  
b. Patient unable to tolerate staged surgical procedures or leave the surgical sites undisturbed

2. Relative contraindications:

a. Chronic tobacco use  
b. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  
c. Advanced atherosclerotic disease  
d. Previous radiation to the donor site

# Anatomy

Supratrochlear artery: A branch of the ophthalmic artery. Exits the orbit  $17 - 22\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the facial midline and is typically located within  $3\mathrm{mm}$  lateral or

medial to a vertical line extending from the medial canthus. Upon exiting the orbit, the artery passes superficial to the corrugator muscle. At approximately the level of the medial eyebrow, the artery passes through the orbicularis oculi and frontalis muscles and continues ascending in a subcutaneous plane  $1.5 - 2.0\mathrm{cm}$  from the midline.

Supratrochlear vein: Runs inferiorly down the forehead in a parasagittal plane to join the supraorbital vein at the medial angle of the orbit to form the angular vein.

Supratrochlear nerve: Branch of the frontal nerve that exits the orbit at the supratrochlear notch to provide sensory innervation to the skin of the forehead and upper eyelid.

Supraorbital neurovascular bundle: The supraorbital artery travels with the supraorbital nerve through the supraorbital foramen, ultimately anastomosing with supratrochlear artery and the frontal branch of the superior temporal artery. The supraorbital nerve is a branch of the frontal nerve that resides approximately  $27\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the facial midline.

Frontalis muscle: Originates from the galea aponeurosis and inserts into the orbicularis oculi muscle to elevate the eyebrow.

Corrugator supercilii muscle: Originates from the supraorbital ridge, passing superiorly and laterally between the palpebral and orbital portions of the orbicularis oculi muscle to insert into the dermis of the skin. Functions to depress the eyebrow.

Orbicularis oculi muscle: Originates from the frontal bone, medial palpebral ligament, and lacrimal bone, and inserts into the lateral palpebral raphe. Functions as a sphincter to close the eyes, with the medial portion contributing to eyebrow depression. Divided into orbital and palpebral portions, the latter divided further into the pretarsal and preseptal orbicularis oculi muscles.

Procerus muscle: Origins at the nasal bone and lateral nasal cartilage and inserts into skin of the bridge of nose. Functions to depress the eyebrow.

# Technique: Stage I (Flap Harvest and Transfer)

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia with oral intubation in a slight reverse Trendelenburg position to mitigate venous congestion to the flap during harvest and inset.  
2. Corneal eye shields are placed for eye protection and a nasal trumpet may be placed to maintain alar patency.  
3. A Doppler is utilized to locate and facilitate marking the path of the supratrochlear artery.  
4. A template, from available material such as foil from suture packaging, is made from the dimensions of the anticipated defect and transferred from the defect onto the forehead. Directional indicators may be helpful to ensure correct flap orientation.  
5. A skin pedicle at least  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  width is designed based on the supratrochlear artery (see Figure 68.2 in Case Report 68.1.).  
6. The proposed flap's transposition and arc of rotation are tested with gauze or suture to ensure adequate length to reach the defect.  
7. The defect site is prepared by freshening the margins, if necessary, and undermining the adjacent skin up to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to facilitate closure.  
8. The flap is incised through skin and the subcutaneous plane.  
9. Bovie electrocautery or Metzenbaum scissors are used to elevate the pedicle from superior to inferior within the subgaleal plane, between the frontalis and the periosteum.  
10. Flap elevation is carried inferiorly until approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  from the superior orbital rim, where the periosteum is incised to carry the dissection subperiosteally to protect the pedicle.  
11. The corrugator muscle may be bluntly dissected from the underlying periosteum to allow greater mobility of the pedicle.  
12. The medial incision may be carried further below the level of the eyebrow through skin and subcutaneous tissue to improve the pivot point of the pedicle.  
13. The pedicle is rotated with the skin facing the ipsilateral eye to prevent drainage into the eye postoperatively and the distal aspect of the flap is approximated to the defect (see Figure 68.3 in Case Report 68.1.).  
14. If necessary, subcutaneous tissue and frontalis may be removed from the distal aspect of the flap to improve soft tissue contours to better match that of the defect. The subcutaneous tissue is maintained to ensure preservation of the subdermal plexus.  
15. The flap is inset at the defect with interrupted 5-0 Prolene at the skin. Sutures placement near the pedicle should be cautious or avoided in order to minimize inadvertent pedicle injury or compromise.

16. Perfusion to the distal flap is confirmed with appropriate capillary refill and positive Doppler ultrasound of the pedicle. Venous drainage is confirmed through clinical examination of capillary refill, skin turgor, and skin color.  
17. The donor site is closed in a layered fashion after undermining the adjacent tissue laterally within the subgaleal plane. The galea or frontalis is re-approximated with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin is closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures.

a. If closure is not easily achieved, larger caliber sutures can be used to pull the skin margins together to promote tissue creep or periosteal releasing incisions can be performed in a sagittal direction, parallel to the forehead incisions.  
b. Often, closure creates a standing cone deformity ("dog ear skin deformity") at the superior aspect of the flap. This can be closed with a Burow's triangle.  
c. If adequate tissue is not available through primary closure (greater than  $4\mathrm{cm}$ ), the wound can be left to heal by secondary intention with an occlusive dressing.

# Technique: Stage II (Pedicle Separation and Flap Inset)

1. Typically, pedicle division is performed around postoperative week three.  
2. The patient undergoes general anesthesia with oral intubation and is placed in a supine position.  
3. Corneal eye shields are placed for eye protection.  
4. Preoperatively, a vascular tie or sterile rubber band can be used to ligate the pedicle and confirm viability of the flap (see Figure 68.5 in Case Report 68.1.). Signs of ischemia to the donor tissue during this stage warrants consideration of an additional healing period.  
5. The pedicle is divided at the superior aspect of the defect.

a. If thinning or recontouring of the flap is needed, it is performed at the cephalic aspect of the flap, which may be elevated for access. The caudal attachment of the flap should not be elevated as it provides the necessary vasculature to the flap.

6. The pedicle is divided approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the eyebrow to facilitate repositioning of the tissue to its original position.  
a. This step often necessitates a triangular skin resection required at the medial brow in order to incorporate the pedicle stump and align the hair-bearing areas.  
7. The flap is primarily closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures at the skin.  
8. The proximal site is primarily closed in a layered fashion with 3-0 Vicryl suture in the deep tissue and 5-0 Prolene at the skin.

# Postoperative Care

1. A thin layer of antibiotic ointment is placed along the surgical margins for three days and subsequently transitioned to Aquaphor or Vaseline until healed.  
2. The exposed pedicle is gently wrapped with xeroform gauze. No external dressings should be applied, so flap circulation is not compromised.  
3. The patient is instructed on routine daily wound care and the importance of flap immobilization.  
4. Prolene sutures are typically removed 5-7 days postoperatively.  
5. A healing period of approximately 6 months will allow for resolution of scar contracture and lymphedema and, if applicable, observation for pathology recurrence. Fine recontouring procedures including debulking, laser scar revision, dermabrasion, and other necessary cosmetic procedures may be performed at this time.

# Complications

Flap necrosis: Risk may be increased with tobacco use and medical comorbidities, increased wound tension, poor patient compliance, operator inexperience, poor flap design, deep suture placement resulting in localized ischemia, and venous congestion. Prevented by delaying the time to pedicle separation and/or the use of topical nitroglycerin paste.

Venous congestion: May consider suture release or returning the flap and pedicle to the donor site rather than continuing with flap inset.

Poor cosmesis: Avoided with proper tissue recontouring and appropriate use of cartilage and bone grafts when necessary.

a. Pincushion or trapdoor deformity

i. Pincushion deformity - occurs when a bulky flap protrudes above the surface of adjacent skin.  
ii. Trap door deformity - occurs from inadequate subdermal undermining of the margins.

b. Abnormal hair distribution and direction on the nose  
c. Donor-site scarring  
d. Distortion of the periorbital anatomy including lid malposition

Infection: Typically iatrogenic due to poor sterile technique. Cartilage grafts may be source of infection and would necessitate removal. Conservative debridement with preservation of the PMFF is paramount to management.

Paresthesia: Nerve injury resulting in paresthesia in the distribution of the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerve.

# Key Points

1. The PMFF is an interpolated flap for complex nasal reconstruction that results in a predictable cosmetic outcome without the need for microvascular anastomosis.  
2. The PMFF is based off of the supratrochlear artery, which can revascularize mucosa, cartilage, and bone covered by the flap. Additionally, a plexus of arteries contributes to the flap to create a robust network of perfusion that may permit flap viability even if no Doppler signal is found.  
3. The flap reconstruction surgery can be staged or performed concurrently with oncologic resection or Moh's surgery.  
4. The design of the pedicle is primarily determined by the width of the pedicle and the distance to the defect. A thinner pedicle width may risk pedicle viability, whereas a thicker pedicle width may restrict pivoting or cause kinking.  
5. A flap ipsilateral to the defect is typically used to decrease the distance from the pivot point to the defect and thus the length of the pedicle. However, there is an increased possibility of kinking with an ipsilateral flap.  
6. Patients with a short forehead or a low hairline may require extension of the flap design into the hairline. Alternatively, the pedicle incision may be extended toward the level of the superior orbital rim to facilitate dissection of the pedicle from the soft tissue surrounding the supratrochlear artery. The flap may also be designed obliquely, angling the distal portion, to increase length while avoiding the hairline. Rarely, tissue expanders may be used before flap elevation.  
7. For nasal defects involving multiple tissue layers, consideration should be made for reconstruction of all three layers of the nasal structure – nasal lining, cartilaginous or bony framework, and skin. Additionally, paranasal defects may warrant adjunctive reconstruction. These reconstructive techniques may include mucoperichondral flaps and septal hinge flaps for nasal lining reconstruction, calvarial bone grafting and auricular or rib cartilage grafting for framework reconstruction, and bilobed flaps, melolabial flaps, and cheek advancement flaps for paranasal defects.

# Case Report

Case Report 68.1. Nasal tip reconstruction following cancer resection. A 61-year-old male diagnosed with recurrent basal cell carcinoma of the nose. Clinical examination demonstrated a  $1 \times 1$  cm nodule with rolled borders and telangiectasia on the nasal tip (see Figure 68.1). Intraoperatively, the lesion was outlined and removed with clear radial margins. The resection resulted in a defect of the nasal tip and underlying lower lateral cartilage. Doppler ultrasound was used to identify the supra-trichlear artery and the proposed paramedian flap was outlined with a necessary  $10\mathrm{mm}$  extension into the hairline (see Figure 68.2). A paramedian forehead flap was harvested, rotated, and transposed to reconstruct the nasal defect in tension-free fashion (see Figure 68.3). The

donor site on the forehead was primarily closed after undermining the adjacent tissue in the subgaleal plane. The galea was reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with 5-0 Prolene sutures. The exposed portion of pedicle was covered with Xeroform gauze (see Figure 68.4). The patient returned to the operating room on postoperative week five. A vessel loop was used to occlude the pedicle to ensure appropriate neovascularization to the donor tissue (see Figure 68.5). The pedicle was separated, and excess pedicle tissue was removed and reintoured at the right medial brow and nasal tip (see Figure 68.6). The surgical sites were closed for an acceptable cosmetic result (see Figure 68.7) (see Figures 68.1 through 68.8).
