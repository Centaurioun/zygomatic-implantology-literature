# Arthrocentesis of the Temporomandibular Joint

A highly successful minimally invasive procedure for the initial treatment of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain and dysfunction refractory to medical management.

# Indications

1. Medically refractory pain to TMJ muscles, headache, or earache impacting the patient's quality of life  
2. Altered jaw mechanics such as closed lock, joint hypomobility, and limited range of motion in maximal incisal opening (MCO), excursion, and/or protrusion  
3. Alterations of occlusion  
4. Joint noises associated with pain

# Contraindications

1. Presence of concomitant facial pain of separate etiologies  
2. Chronic pain disorders  
3. Presence of deformity or pathology of the TMJ  
4. Presence of local or systemic conditions that may interfere with normal healing process and subsequent tissue homeostasis

# Anatomy

Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ): A compound synovial ginglymoarthroid joint with rotation of the condyle within the inferior joint space. The TMJ has an overlying highly vascular and innervated fibroelastic capsule, which is thickened on the lateral aspect to form the temporomandibular ligament. The vascular supply to the TMJ is supplied with branches from the superficial temporal and maxillary arteries with an extensive venous plexus within the bilaminar zone.

Articular eminence: A prominent convexity lined with dense, compact connective tissue that is subject to loading during function.

Glenoid fossa: A nonloading, concave structure lined with a thin layer of fibrocartilage separated from the middle cranial fossa by  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  thickness of temporal bone.

Articular disc: A biconcave avascular fibrocartilage disc that divides the joint space into a  $1.2\mathrm{mL}$  upper compartment and a  $0.9\mathrm{mL}$  lower compartment and allows complex movements of rotation and translation.

Auriculotemporal nerve: Provides sensation to the posterior and lateral capsule.

Masseteric nerve: Provides sensation to the anteriomedial aspect of the joint.

Deep temporal nerve: Provides anterolateral sensation to the joint.

Holmlund-Hellsing line (H-H line): A line extending from the lateral canthus of the eye to a point bisecting the tragus of the ear (see Figure 38.1 in Case Report 38.1). The 10-2 point (10mm anterior and 2mm inferior to the mid-tragus along the line) correlates with the posterior recess/glenoid fossa. The 20-10 point (20mm anterior to the mid-tragus point along the line and 10mm below the line) correlates with the prominence of the articular eminence.

# Technique

1. Pre-procedural documentation of MIO, excursive movements, and subjective details of pain and dysfunction are measured and recorded.  
2. Bacitracin-soaked cotton is placed within the auditory canal to obtund the canal from blood and fluid accumulation.  
3. Landmarks are identified and marked with a skin marker referencing the Holmlund-Hellsing line (H-H line), the 10-2 point, and the 20-10 point (Figure 38.1).  
4. Surgical skin prep of the area is performed, with the hair taped superior to the auricle with sterile drape.  
5. An auriculotemporal nerve block and local infiltration with a solution of  $1\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000

epinephrine is performed at the marked 10-2 and 20-10 points (see Figure 38.2 in Case Report 38.1).

6. An 18-gauge needle attached to a  $10\mathrm{mL}$  syringe containing normal saline is inserted in an anterior-superior direction at the 10-2 point into the superior joint space (See Figure 38.3 in Case Report 38.1). The superior joint space is insufflated with enough normal saline to obtain bouncing-back pressure with the syringe and movement of the jaw.  
7. The first syringe is removed, leaving the 18-gauge needle in place to observe for a small amount of fluid backflow.  
8. A second 18-gauge needle is placed slightly anterior to the first 18-gauge needle along the same angulation to serve as an exit point for the saline lavage (See Figure 38.4 in Case Report 38.1).  
9. Approximately  $100\mathrm{mL}$  of normal saline lavage should be passed through the superior joint space.  
10. At the end of the procedure,  $1\mathrm{mL}$  of betamethasone is injected with  $1\mathrm{mL}$  of  $0.5\%$  Marcaine with epinephrine into the superior joint space.  
11. The inflow and outflow ports are removed, and pressure is applied over the joint for 5 minutes.

# Postoperative Management

1. Ice is applied over the joint for 15-20 minutes of every hour for the first 24 hours.  
2. Compression dressings are utilized for the first 24 hours for hemostasis and to minimize swelling.  
3. Patients are asked to sleep with  $30^{\circ}$  head-of-bed elevation for the first 48 hours.  
4. A soft mechanical diet is required for the first 72 hours postoperatively.  
5. Scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and as-needed (pro re nata, or PRN) narcotic analgesics are prescribed.  
6. Jaw-opening and range-of-motion exercises are begun the day of the procedure and are encouraged several times per day for the first week.

# Complications

1. Iatrogenic scuffing of fibrocartilage covering articular eminence and fossa  
2. Injury to temporal vessels or maxillary artery, and/or postsurgical bleeding  
3. Neuronal damage (CN V, VII, and VII)  
4. Damage to articular disc and/or retrodiscal tissue upon entering the joint space  
5. Intra-articular fibrosis and adhesions formed after hemorrhage  
6. Ear injury from middle-ear penetration  
7. Infection

# Case Report

Case Report 38.1. Anteriorly displaced disc without reduction. A 17-year-old male presents 5 days after extreme opening with subluxation and self-reduction of his left TMJ, with a chief complaint of left-sided TMJ pain, limited opening, and minor malocclusion. On examination, the patient has tenderness to the left TMJ area, a maximum incisal opening of  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , restricted lateral excursive movements, and malocclusion. Based on the patient's history and clinical symptoms, a diagnosis of an anteriorly displaced disc without reduction was made. The patient was successfully treated with left TMJ arthrocentesis, passive physical therapy, a soft mechanical diet, restriction of extreme opening, and a short trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without recurrence of pain, limited opening, or malocclusion (see Figures 38.1 through 38.4).

Figure 38.3. An 18-gauge needle attached to a  $10\mathrm{mL}$  syringe is inserted in an anterior-superior direction at the 10-2 point to enter the superior joint space. Entry into the superior joint space is confirmed with superior joint space insufflation and lower jaw movement.
