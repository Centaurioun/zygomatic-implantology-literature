traumatic orbital defects and restoration of pre-traumatic orbital volume.

# Indications for Reduction of Orbital Fractures

1. Entrapment demonstrated with a positive forced duction test  
2. Significant increase in orbital volume  
3. Dystopia (vertical or horizontal)  
4. Enophthalmos  
5. Binocular diplopia that lasts longer than 10-14 days  
6. Foreign body  
7. Hard and/or soft tissue loss: orbital floor defect of greater than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  or greater than half of the orbital floor surface area  
8. Intractable pain due to bone displacement or muscle paresis

# Contraindications

1. Medically unstable  
2. Edema significant enough to limit clinical exam (relative contraindication)  
3. Bleeding disorders or blood dyscrasias  
4. Globe rupture or hyphema, or other forms of ocular trauma or globe injury  
5. Active infection

# Anatomy

Bones composing the orbit (7): Maxilla, palatine, sphenoid (greater and lesser), zygomatic, frontal, ethmoidal, and lacrimal. The superior orbital fissure separates the greater and the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone.

Contents of the superior orbital fissure: CN III, IV, VI (nasociliary, frontal, and lacrimal branches of the ophthalmic nerve), and VI; sympathetic fibers from the

cavernous plexus and the inferior and superior ophthalmic veins.

Contents of the inferior orbital fissure: CN V2 (maxillary nerve), zygomatic nerve, infraorbital nerve, parasympathetic fibers from the pterygopalatine (Meckel's) ganglion, the infraorbital vessels, and emissary veins connecting the inferior ophthalmic vein to the pterygoid venous plexus.

Contents of optic canal: Optic nerve, meninges, sympathetic fibers, and the ophthalmic artery.

# Important Orbital Wall Landmarks

1. The optic nerve is located  $42\mathrm{mm}$ , on average, from an intact adult infraorbital (inferior orbital) rim.  
2. The anterior ethmoidal foramen-artery is located  $24\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the infraorbital rim and anterior lacrimal crest.  
3. The posterior ethmoidal foramen-artery is located  $36\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the infraorbital rim and anterior lacrimal crest.

# Transconjunctival (Retro-Septal) Approach

1. The patient is placed under general anesthesia with either oral or nasal intubation depending on the nature of the associated facial fractures and the need for maxillomandibular fixation (MMF).  
2. The patient is preferably positioned within a Mayfield headrest to allow for manipulation of the head during the procedure.  
3. The patient is prepped with ophthalmic betadine solution (betadine scrub is not recommended for mucous membrane application) and draped. Basic salt solution (BSS) irrigant is used to irrigate the globe. Eye lubricant and corneal shields are placed.

4. Local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor is injected at the sites of the proposed incisions (inferior fornix). A higher concentration of local anesthetic should be utilized to decrease the volume injected and minimize distortion of the soft tissue architecture.  
5. The lower lid is retracted anteriorly and inferiorly with the aid of a Desmarres lid retractor (see Figure 20.29 in Case Report 20.1) or a traction suture placed through the lower eyelid. A malleable retractor is used in conjunction with the corneal shield to retract the globe postero-superiorly. Care is taken to avoid excessive pressure on the corneal shield or globe. Additionally, the anesthesiologist should be informed that there will be pressure on the globe to alert him or her of the possibility of decreased pulse rate (oculocardiac reflex).  
6. The transconjunctival incision is initiated lateral to the medial puncta and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the scleral-conjunctival interface with a protected needle tip, a Colorado monopolar cautery tip or 15 blade. While using combined retraction of malleable and Desmarres retractors, the conjunctiva is retracted taught and the incision transects the conjunctiva just posterior to the infraorbital rim (see Figure 20.1). Once the conjunctiva is transected, the postseptal approach results in herniation of peri-orbital fat within the incision site (see Figure 20.44 in Case Report 20.4). Dissection through herniated fat is completed with aid of sterile cotton swabs. Herniated fat is retracted posteriorly with an orbital or malleable retractor. Dissection proceeds toward the periosteum overlying the infraorbital rim. The periosteum is incised and reflected to expose the infraorbital rim/floor of the orbit. Care is taken to not transect the inferior oblique muscle as it passes between the nasal (medial) and central fad pads.  
7. All displaced fractures (rim and floor) are exposed. Subperiosteal dissection is performed anterior to the transconjunctival incision to expose the infraorbital rim (see Figure 20.30 in Case Report 20.1) and posteriorly to expose any defects within the orbital floor. The transconjunctival incision may be extended laterally (see Figure 20.2) to the zygomaticofrontal (ZF) suture if additional exposure of the lateral orbital rim is necessary. A lateral canthotomy may be employed if sufficient exposure of the lateral rim cannot be achieved without stretching the lateral orbital tissues excessively.  
8. If additional exposure of the medial orbital wall is necessary, the transconjunctival incision may be extended medially (see Figure 20.2), posterior to the

caruncle (transcaruncular incision), and extended along the medial orbital wall. The transcaruncular incision is placed along the conjunctival groove just posterior to the lacrimal sac and semilunar fold. The incision can be extended along the medial orbital rim for approximately  $12\mathrm{mm}$ . A subperiosteal tissue dissection is utilized to expose the medial orbital rim and orbital wall.  
9. All orbital rim fractures should be exposed to include adjacent uninvolved bone for adequate fixation. All orbital floor fractures should ideally have an area of intact bone circumferentially surrounding the defect.  
10. All areas of tissue entrapment are carefully freed from the orbital floor defect with a blunt-tipped elevator (Cottle or freer elevator) prior to the placement of any orbital fixation devices (see Figure 20.3).  
11. Orbital fixation devices/implants include orbital rim plates, stock titanium orbital meshes, stock preformed titanium orbital reconstruction plates, and custom, prefabricated implants. Orbital rims are typically fixated prior to orbital floors. Orbital rim plates are adapted to the orbital rim and fixated to the uninvolved adjacent orbital rim bone once reduction is obtained. Orbital floor devices are placed, ensuring that all edges of the orbital floor device are positioned on solid bone and with no entrapment of orbital tissues beneath the device (see Figures 20.3 and 20.31 in Case Report 20.1). The posterior ledge of an orbital floor device requires a minimum of  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  purchase. The orbital floor device is evaluated for adequate antral bulge reconstruction, orbital volume restoration, and intact bone along the periphery of the device prior to fixation.  
12. The orbital floor implant can be fixated with self-drilling  $4\mathrm{mm}$  screws along the infraorbital rim (provided the rim is intact). If an orbital floor implant cannot be placed without entrapment of tissues, a molded piece of smooth alloplastic material can be utilized if the defect is not excessively large to accept the material without distortion. Once materials have been fixated, the orbital soft tissue around the margins of the implant are re-evaluated to ensure no tissue entrapment, and a final forced duction test is performed.  
13. Once anatomic reduction has been verified, additional fixation screws are placed. Complete closure of the transconjunctival incision is not recommended as excessive suturing can contribute to shortening of conjunctival tissues. For large incisions, 2-4, 6-0 plain gut sutures may be placed in an interrupted fashion to loosely reapproximate the conjunctiva.

# Infraorbital (Mid-Lid Incision) Skin Incision Approach to the Orbital Floor

1. Previous steps 1-4 for the transconjunctival approach are followed.  
2. The infraorbital approach is the least esthetic option for access to the orbital floor. However, it is a reasonable option in an elderly patient with deep facial skin folds and creases, when wide surgical access is required for grossly comminuted fractures or when surgery cannot be delayed and severe orbital edema obscures traditional surgical landmarks.  
3. The incision is marked in a prominent infraorbital skin crease (see Figure 20.35 in Case Report 20.2).  
4. The incision sharply transects skin and then blunt dissection continues through subcutaneous fat to the infraorbital aspect of the maxilla and infraorbital rim (see Figure 20.1).  
5. The periosteum is sharply incised and a subperiosteal dissection ensues around the infraorbital rim to the orbital floor and fracture. Care is taken to minimize pressure on the infraorbital nerve.  
6. Once all margins of the fracture are exposed, a periphery of solid bone is identified and an orbital

implant can be placed freely and passively to reconstruct the bony defect (see Figure 20.36 in Case Report 20.2).

7. A forced suction test is performed to assess free globe movement. After confirmation of fracture reduction, ideal orbital fixation device adaptation, and free globe movements, the deep layers are closed with resorbable sutures and the skin incision is closed with 6-0 plain gut sutures (see Figure 20.37 in Case Report 20.2). Steri-strips are recommended for additional incision support.

# Upper Eyelid (Superior Blepharoplasty, Supratarsal Fold) Incision Approach

1. Steps 1-4 of the above transconjunctival approach are followed.  
2. An incision is made parallel to the superior palpebral sulcus within a naturally occurring skin crease (see Figures 20.4 through and 20.6) or, if edema is present,  $10\mathrm{mm}$  above the upper eyelid margin. The involved upper eyelid may be compared to the contralateral side to ensure appropriate incision placement. The incision may be extended laterally into the crow's feet area for additional exposure, staying  $6\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the lateral canthus to avoid the frontal branch of the facial nerve.  
3. The incision transverses skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the orbicularis oculi. A skin-muscle flap is developed, staying superficial to the orbital septum-levator aponeurosis (see Figures 20.46 and 20.47 in Case Report 20.4). The dissection is directed superiorly and laterally toward the ZF suture or supraorbital rim. While retracting the skin-muscle flap superiorly with a double-ended skin hook, a periosteal incision is made over the rim. The trochlea and superior oblique muscle may be dissected from the trochlear fossa for added exposure of the orbital rim. Fractures are exposed, reduced, and fixated with orbital rim plates (see Figures 20.4, 20.7, 20.48, and 20.49 in Case Report 20.4) and/or mesh.  
4. After appropriate supraorbital rim reconstruction and orbital volume restoration, closure of the upper eyelid incision is performed in a layered fashion with deep 4-0 Vicryl sutures and 6-0 fast-absorbing gut sutures to close skin (see Figure 20.50 in Case Report 20.4). Avoid excessive bites of skin as this can contribute to shortening of the upper lid and increase scleral show.

# Preoperative Computer Planning and the Use of Patient-Specific Implants

1. The use of preoperative planning and patient-specific implants involves five phases: the (i) data-acquisition phase, (ii) planning phase, (iii) manufacturing phase, (iv) surgical phase, and (v) assessment phase.  
2. For planning of complex orbital reconstruction, where the use of patient-specific implants are planned, a parameter-specific CT scan is obtained (matrix of  $512 \times 512$  at  $0.625\mathrm{mm}$  slice thickness,  $25\mathrm{cm}$  or lesser field-of-view (FOV),  $0^{\circ}$  gantry tilt, and  $1:1$  pitch. It is important to note a slice thickness of  $0.625\mathrm{mm}$ ).  
3. The CT scan is imported into the virtual surgical planning (VSP) software.  
4. Once the data is de-noised and segmented and the STLs are imported, a planning session takes place and the patient's deformity is analyzed with the surgeon and VSP engineer in the 3D plane.

Figure 20.8. Patient 4 months after suffering a left zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture which included a fracture of the infraorbital rim, foreman, and floor. There was gross lateral and inferior displacement of the zygoma causing significant volume-related changes of globe position including vertical dystopias and enophthalmos. The patient had persistent binocular diplopia and was un-satisfied with his cosmetic result. He did not want to undergo osteotomies and repositioning of the zygoma. A custom titanium alloy/Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) alloplastic reconstruction including placement of an orbital floor component to reduce orbital volume and an orbital rim/maxillary/zygomatic component was planned to correct his deformity.

5. The patient's contralateral, unaffected facial skeleton and orbit are "mirrored" to the affected side. This allows the surgeon and engineer to design a custom implant reproducing facial and orbital volume in "ideal" dimensions.

6. The surgeon and engineer design a custom alloplastic implant. In this example, a two-part implant, one a PEEK component meant to reconstruct the orbital rim and the second being a titanium alloy meant to reconstruct the orbital floor was designed.

7. The patient-specific implants can be designed with numerous materials, and the placement of fixation screws can be carefully illustrated for the surgery

team. This is especially helpful in patients with limited bone for fixation.

Figure (b) guides the surgeon to find where screws are placed and what components are included with each screw placement. Figures (c and d) provide a guide to the vector needed for holding the screwdriver in order to achieve appropriate screw placement.

8. The implants developed during the virtual planning session are manufactured using 3D printers. Stereolithographic (SLA) models can also be

fabricated and are helpful to simulate positioning of the implant in surgery.

9. Surgery involves the insertion of the custom implants based on the preoperative plan. Intraoperative navi-

gation is useful to confirm implant placement and postoperative defect reconstruction.

# Postoperative Management

1. Immediate postoperative visual acuity and extraocular muscle movement tests are performed. Evaluation is ideally performed within the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) so that deficits amenable to surgical intervention may be performed as soon as possible. BSS irrigant should be used if there is suspicion that eye lubricants could be interfering with visual exams. Except in the setting of true entrapment with significant inflammation, extraocular movement should not cause pain postoperatively.  
2. Patients are typically admitted for 23-hour observation following extensive orbital surgery.  
3. If intraoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning is not readily available, a postoperative CT scan should be performed to evaluate the position of the orbital fixation device and to identify any areas of potential entrapment. The surgeon should still consider postoperative CT imaging in the setting where an intraoperative CT scan displays good plate placement and adaptation. Intraoperative CT imaging often has larger slice thickness and lower resolution than standard CT imaging and may miss the area of interest when compared to postoperative CT imaging.  
4. A course of steroids and antibiotics in the perioperative period is recommended.  
5. Head-of-bed elevation is recommended during the immediate postoperative period.  
6. Ice is applied to the affected periorbital region for the first 48 hours.  
7. Sinus precautions are used preoperatively and for 2 weeks after orbital repair.  
8. Oxymetazoline nasal spray is recommended for symptomatic relief in the immediate postoperative period for 2-3 days only.  
9. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is recommended for symptomatic relief in the immediate postoperative period and is scheduled for 5 days.  
10. Eye lubricant may be used in the setting of severe chemosis.  
11. Ophthalmic eye drops are not routinely prescribed, but they may be used for lagophthalmos with transconjunctival incisions for 5-7 days.

# Complications

Additional orbital fracture complications are extensively covered within the complication section of Chapter 19: Isolated Zygoma and ZMC Fractures.

# Early Complications

1. Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON): Results from damage to the optic nerve resulting in partial or complete vision loss. Causes of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) include fractured bone fragments compressing the optic

nerve, shearing forces at the optic foramen, nerve compression from either fractured bone segments or hematoma, and penetrating foreign bodies. Treatment includes the removal of the above causes. Signs and symptoms of TON include altered visual acuity, abnormal pupillary response, and diminished visual field on examination.

2. Entrapment of the extraocular muscles: Extraocular muscle entrapment is more common in the pediatric patient population. Signs and symptoms of muscular entrapment include diplopia, limited extraocular movement, CT scan revealing muscular entrapment within orbital fractures, pain on eye movement, and a positive forced duction test. None of the previously listed signs and symptoms are absolutely specific to muscular entrapment. Causes of limited or restricted extraocular muscle (EOM) movement other than entrapment that do not require surgical intervention include muscle contusion, pain, and nerve paresis.  
3. Corneal abrasion: Corneal abrasions are caused by the resultant trauma or from poor globe management during surgery. Corneal protection in surgery involves the use of corneal shields or tarsorrhaphy sutures. Corneal abrasions are managed with ophthalmic topical NSAIDs and analgesics.

# Late Complications

1. Orbital volume changes: Changes in orbital volume typically result from inadequate reduction of orbital fractures. Correction of orbital volume changes involves secondary orbital reconstruction to re-establish pretraumatic orbital volume.

a. Enophthalmos: Post-reduction enophthalmos occurs from an increase in orbital volume following fracture reduction. Causes of early enophthalmos include inappropriate reconstruction of the orbital floor and medial orbital wall. Treatment includes reconstruction of pre-traumatic orbital volume with a stock or custom orbital implant. Causes of late enophthalmos include global orbital fat atrophy and orbital device (plate) displacement. Treatment involves orbital volume reconstruction with autogenous grafting or custom implants (PEEK).  
b. Dystopia: Vertical dystopia is defined as a difference in the horizontal levels of the orbits, most commonly caused by a "blowout" type of orbital floor fractures or an inappropriately placed orbital implant. Treatment involves ideal orbital floor and rim reconstruction.

2. Entropion: Lower lid retraction resulting in an inward rotation (inversion) of the lower lid resulting in corneal abrasion from the constant irritation of the lower lid lashes. Symptoms include a foreign body feeling, epiphora, pain, irritation, inflammation, photophobia, and overall eye sensitivity. In a trauma setting, entropion typically results from excessive retraction during a transconjunctival approach (see Case Report 20.4).

3. Ectropion: Lower lid eversion resulting in exposure of the eye causing irritation to the globe. Many of the symptoms of ectropion are similar to entropion.

# Key Points

1. Pre-septal approaches are prone to ectropion, which is particularly true when combined with a lateral canthotomy. When performing lateral canthotomies, care should be taken to resuspend the periorbital musculature and to perform an accurate lateral canthopexy upon closure. When wide access is required to expose the infraorbital rim, particularly in a post-traumatic patient where edema persists, an infraorbital (mid-lid) incision is a predictable means of obtaining wide surgical exposure of the infraorbital rim and orbital floor without the need for a lateral canthotomy. The infraorbital incision provides acceptable cosmesis, while minimizing the risk of ectropion and increased scleral show.  
2. In the author's experience, a transconjunctival incision combined with a lateral canthotomy for disarticulation of the lower lid often results in an unnatural appearance of the lateral periorbita. An isolated postseptal transconjunctival approach combined with an upper lid blepharoplasty approach typically provides adequate access to the orbit for most applications and results in better postoperative cosmesis. For grossly comminuted or displaced fractures of the supraorbital rim, combined neurosurgical intervention, or orbital fractures combined with additional facial fractures, a coronal approach provides direct access to the upper half of the orbit and supraorbital roof (see Figure 20.27).  
3. The key to successful orbital reconstruction is to establish pre-traumatic orbital volume through restoration of the critical orbital bulges located postero-inferiorly (antral bulge) and postero-medially (ethmoidal bulge). The typical error is that the surgeon places the orbital implant flush with the anterior portion of the orbit, and the implant extends posteriorly without a solid purchase point. The orbital implant may extend inferiorly into the maxillary sinus (see Figure 20.24) or superiorly into the orbital cone (see Figure 20.26). A similar error is made along the medial orbital wall by inaccurately positioning the orbital implant into the ethmoidal labyrinth or stopping short of the medial orbital wall (see Figure 20.25).  
4. In the authors' experience, titanium meshes are the most predictable and versatile orbital implant materials due to the rapid bending of the devices to the anatomical contours of orbital floor and medial orbital wall fractures without the need for a second surgical site (autogenous grafting). For larger fractures, preformed titanium orbital reconstruction implants allow for rapid and accurate restoration of orbital volume. Care must be taken to avoid "yaw" inaccuracies during device placement, which result in unfavorable positioning of

the implant within the posterior-medial orbit with resultant postoperative enophthalmos.

5. Once the orbital implant is secured, a forced duction should be performed to verify free ocular mobility. Projection, globe position, and eyelid anatomy should also be evaluated prior to extubation.  
6. Intraoperative CT scanners provide immediate quality control and allow for intraoperative revision of inaccurately positioned orbital devices. A radiolucent and carbon-fiber Mayfield headrest is required, and preoperative consent for the possibility of multiple CT scans is advisable. Modern mobile CT scanners can be linked to navigation systems to provide real-time assistance in accurate implant placement.  
7. Recently, preoperative computer-assisted planning with virtual correction and construction of SLA models has been combined with intraoperative navigation in an attempt to more accurately reconstruct the bony orbit and optimize treatment outcomes. Surgical procedures are preplanned with virtual correction by mirroring an individually defined 3D segment of the unaffected side into the deformed side, creating an ideal unilateral reconstruction. These computer models are used intraoperatively as a virtual template to navigate the preplanned bony contours and globe projection.  
8. Patient-specific custom 3D implants add a level of enhanced predictability to orbital and facial reconstruction. Combined with intraoperative and postoperative imaging assessment, these management entities can be used to predictably reconstruct complex orbital fractures and bony defects (see Figures 20.8 through 20.15).

Figure 20.27. Grossly comminuted or displaced fractures of the supraorbital roof, combined neurosurgical intervention, or orbital fractures combined with additional facial fractures are best managed with wide surgical access via a coronal approach with or without additional approaches.

Case Report 20.4. Complication: Entropion. A 44-year-old male involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident with resultant comminuted left vertical ramus fracture of the mandible, bilateral orbital rim fractures, bilateral Le Fort I fractures, right Le Fort II fracture, and left Le Fort III fracture. The patient was treated with submental intubation, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of involved facial fractures and a short-term course of MMF. The left ZF suture was plated via a superior blepharoplasty approach and the bilateral infraorbital rims and orbital floors were approached with transconjunctival incisions. The patient underwent an uneventful postoperative course. At a 6-week postoperative visit, the patient complained of eye irritation, excessive tearing (epiphora), and "felt like something was always in his eye." Physical examination revealed the inward rotation of the right lower lid and lashes into the globe. A diagnosis of entropion was made. The patient was treated palliatively at his clinic visit with trimming of his lower lid lashes to minimize his corneal irritation and with artificial tears. The condition was definitively managed with Quickert sutures to evert the lower lid margin (see Figures 20.42 through 20.59).
