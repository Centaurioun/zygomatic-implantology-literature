# Atypical Mandibular Osteotomies

A means of repositioning the mandible to correct congenital and acquired dentofacial deformities via osteotomies other than sagittal split and vertical ramus osteotomies.

# Indications

1. Large mandibular advancements, especially those involving a significant counterclockwise rotation of the occlusal plane to result in increased projection of the lower third of the face  
2. Severe asymmetries of the mandible that require a significant correction in yaw or cant  
3. Inverted L osteotomy: High mandibular plane class II patients that require lengthening of the lower facial third as well as large advancement of the chin  
4. C osteotomy: Significant clockwise rotation of the occlusal plane  
5. Mandibular subapical osteotomy: Patients with dentoalveolar hypoplasia of the mandible with acceptable positioning of the mandibular basal bone and chin

# Contraindications

1. Mild to moderate dentofacial deformities more adapt to treatment via more conservative surgical modalities (BSSO/IVRO)  
2. Medical or psychological conditions prohibiting surgery

# Intraoral Inverted L Osteotomy Technique

1. The patient is placed supine on the operating room table and nasally intubated. The anesthesia tube is secured, all extremities are padded, and a urinary catheter is placed for procedures exceeding 150 minutes. Lacrilube is placed within the orbits, and opsites are placed to protect the periorbital regions during the procedure. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx, and the oral cavity is prepped with betadine solution and/or chlorohexidine gluconate

$0.12\%$  oral rinse and a toothbrush to include all teeth, the gingiva, the tongue, and the palate. The maxillofacial skeleton is prepped with betadine scrub from the hairline to the clavicles, and the patient is draped in a sterile fashion to allow for exposure of and access to the oral cavity, nasal bridge, and orbits.

2. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected bilaterally along the external oblique ridge, retromolar trigone, and posterior buccal vestibule. Additionally, anesthetic should be deposited more posteriorly lateral to the ramus as the dissection is broader in this region.  
3. In select cases, enameloplasty is performed with a large diamond bur and copious irrigation on selected tooth surfaces as determined preoperatively. A bite block is placed posteriorly on the contralateral side.  
4. Using a #15 blade, an incision is made in the mandibular vestibule  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the external oblique ridge through mucosa only. The soft tissue is carried medially over the external oblique ridge and the periosteum incised.  
5. A #9 periosteal elevator is used to reflect the soft tissue laterally so that the entire ramus is exposed including the antagonial notch, posterior border, and sigmoid notch. A V notch retractor is positioned to elevate and retract the temporalis attachment from the ascending ramus. A Bauer retractor can be placed at the posterior border and sigmoid notch to aid in visualization.  
6. The cutting guide is placed on the lateral ramus and should be indexed to fit to the posterior border, antegonial notch, lateral ramus, and possibly the sigmoid notch. Once in place, the cutting guide should be immobile, verified to be in a good position, and should be fixated using a predictive hole and appropriate screw placed transbucally via a trocar. The trocar allows placement of rigid internal fixation perpendicular to the cortex.  
7. Using percutaneous trocar access, all predictive holes of the cutting guide are drilled to allow placement of bicortical screws at a later point in the operation.

8. A reciprocating saw is utilized to score the superior osteotomy, ensuring not to pass completely through the ramus at this time.  
9. A  $90^{\circ}$  oscillating saw is then used to perform the vertical osteotomy, ensuring to cut through and through along the entire aspect of the osteotomy.  
10. The fixation screw and cutting guide are removed, and the custom plate is introduced into the area. Prior to completion of the superior osteotomy, the plate is fixated to the eventual proximal segment using bicortical screws and the previous transbuccal access and predictive holes.  
11. The reciprocating saw is used again to complete the superior osteotomy. At this point, the proximal and distal segments should move independently and the

plate should be secured completely to the proximal segment.

12. Steps 4-11 are then repeated for the contralateral side.  
13. Maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) is established using the prefabricated occlusal splint and 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires.  
14. The custom plates on each side are fixated in place to the distal segments of the mandible using bicortical screws and previous predictive holes. If the transbuccal access does not allow for drilling or placement of screws into the most anterior holes of the plate, direct transoral access can be utilized instead.  
15. At the completion of fixation, MMF is released and the occlusion is verified.

16. The trocar incision is closed with a single interrupted suture (6-0 fast gut or 5-0 Ethilon), and the intraoral incisions are closed with resorbable sutures.  
17. Prior to extubation, an orogastric tube is passed to empty contents of the stomach.  
18. The patient is placed into guiding elastics to help guide the jaw into occlusion.

# Z Osteotomy Technique

1. The patient is placed supine on the operating room table and nasally intubated. The anesthesia tube is secured, all extremities are padded, and a urinary catheter is placed for procedures exceeding 150 minutes. Lacrilube is placed within the orbits, and opsites are placed to protect the periorbital regions during the procedure. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx, and the oral cavity is prepped with betadine solution and/or chlorohexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  oral rinse and a toothbrush to include all teeth, the gingiva, the tongue, and the palate.

A V notch retractor is positioned to elevate and retract the temporalis attachment from the ascending ramus. A Bauer retractor can be placed at the posterior border and sigmoid notch to aid in visualization.  
6. The cutting guide is placed on the lateral ramus and should be indexed to fit to the posterior border, antegonial notch, lateral ramus, and possibly the sigmoid notch. Once in place, the cutting guide should be immobile, verified to be in a good position, and should

be fixated using a predictive hole and appropriate screw placed transbucally via a trocar. The trocar allows placement of rigid internal fixation perpendicular to the cortex.

8. A reciprocating saw is utilized to score the superior osteotomy, ensuring not to pass completely through the ramus at this time.  
9. A  $90^{\circ}$  oscillating saw is then used to perform the vertical osteotomy, ensuring to cut through and through along the entire aspect of the osteotomy.  
10. A reciprocating saw is then used to perform the inferior horizontal osteotomy, ensuring to cut through and through along the entire aspect.  
11. The fixation screw and cutting guide are removed, and the custom plate is introduced into the area. Prior to completion of the superior osteotomy, the plate is fixated to the eventual proximal segment using bicortical screws and the previous transbuccal access and predictive holes.  
12. The reciprocating saw is used again to complete the superior osteotomy. At this point, the proximal and distal segments should move independently, and the plate should be secured completely to the proximal segment.  
13. Steps 4-12 are then repeated for the contralateral side.  
14. MMF is established using the prefabricated occlusal splint and 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires.  
15. The custom plates on each side are fixated in place to the distal segments of the mandible using bicortical screws and previous predictive holes. If the transbuccal access does not allow for drilling or placement of screws into the most anterior holes of the plate, direct transoral access can be utilized instead.  
16. At the completion of fixation, MMF is released and the occlusion is verified.  
17. The trocar incision is closed with a single interrupted suture (6-0 fast gut or 5-0 Ethilon), and the intraoral incisions are closed with resorbable sutures.  
18. Prior to extubation, an orogastric tube is passed to empty contents of the stomach.  
19. The patient is placed into guiding elastics to help guide the jaw into occlusion.

# C Osteotomy Technique

1. The patient is placed supine on the operating room table and nasally intubated. The anesthesia tube is secured, all extremities are padded, and a urinary catheter is placed for procedures exceeding 150 minutes. Lacrilube is placed within the orbits, and

opsites are placed to protect the periorbital regions during the procedure. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx, and the oral cavity is prepped with betadine solution and/or chlorohexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  oral rinse and a toothbrush to include all teeth, the gingiva, the tongue, and the palate. The maxillofacial skeleton is prepped with betadine scrub from the hairline to the clavicles, and the patient is draped in a sterile fashion to allow for exposure of and access to the oral cavity, nasal bridge, and orbits.

2. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected bilaterally along the external oblique ridge, retromolar trigone, and posterior buccal vestibule. Additionally, anesthetic should be deposited more posteriorly lateral to the ramus as the dissection is broader in this region.  
3. In select cases, enameloplasty is performed with a large diamond bur and copious irrigation on selected tooth surfaces that are determined preoperatively. A bite block is placed posteriorly on the contralateral side.  
4. Using a #15 blade, an incision is made in the mandibular vestibule  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the external oblique ridge through mucosa only. The soft tissue is carried medially over the external oblique ridge and the periosteum incised.  
5. A #9 periosteal elevator is used to reflect the soft tissue laterally so that the entire ramus is exposed including the antagonial notch, posterior border, and sigmoid notch. A V notch retractor is positioned to elevate and retract the temporalis attachment from the ascending ramus. A Bauer retractor can be placed at the posterior border and sigmoid notch to aid in visualization.  
6. The cutting guide is placed on the lateral ramus and should be indexed to fit to the posterior border, antegonial notch, lateral ramus, and possibly the sigmoid notch. Once in place the guide should be immobile, verified to be in a good position, and should be fixated using a predictive hole and appropriate screw placed transbucally via a trocar. The trocar allows placement of rigid internal fixation perpendicular to the cortex.  
7. Using percutaneous trocar access, all predictive holes of the cutting guide are drilled to allow placement of bicortical screws at a later point in the operation.  
8. A  $90^{\circ}$  oscillating saw is then guided in a semicircular fashion from inferior to superior to perform the C

ensuring to cut through and through along the entire aspect of the osteotomy.

9. The fixation screw and cutting guide are removed.  
10. Steps 4-9 are then repeated for the contralateral side.  
11. MMF is established using the prefabricated occlusal splint and 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires.  
12. The custom plates on each side are fixated in place to the proximal and distal segments of the mandible using bicortical screws and previous predictive holes. If the percutaneous access does not allow for drilling or placement of screws into the most anterior holes of the plate, direct transoral access can be utilized instead. Alternatively, stock L plates can be used to fixate the mandible in position (see Figure 29.20 in Case Report 29.2).  
13. At the completion of fixation, MMF is released and the occlusion is verified.  
14. The trocar incision is closed with a single interrupted suture (6-0 fast gut or 5-0 Ethilon), and the intraoral incisions are closed with resorbable sutures.  
15. Prior to extubation, an orogastric tube is passed to empty contents of the stomach.  
16. The patient is placed into guiding elastics to help guide the jaw into occlusion.

# Mandibular Subapical Osteotomy Technique

1. The patient is placed supine on the operating room table and nasally intubated. The anesthesia tube is secured, all extremities are padded, and a urinary catheter is placed for procedures exceeding 150 minutes. Lacrilube is placed within the orbits, and opsites are placed to protect the periorbital regions during the procedure. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx, and the oral cavity is prepped with betadine solution and/or chlorohexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  oral rinse and a toothbrush to include all teeth, the gingiva, the tongue, and the palate. The maxillofacial skeleton is prepped with betadine scrub from the hairline to the clavicles, and the patient is draped in a sterile fashion to allow for exposure of and access to the oral cavity, nasal bridge, and orbits.  
2. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected bilaterally along the entire mandibular vestibule.  
3. In select cases, enameloplasty is performed with a large diamond bur and copious irrigation on selected tooth surfaces that are determined preoperatively.

A bite block is placed posteriorly on the contralateral side.

4. Using a #15 blade, an incision is made in the mandibular vestibule from the external oblique ridge to the contralateral side leaving a cuff of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of soft tissue to aid in closure. Sharp dissection is done down to and through the periosteum, including dissecting through the mentalis muscle anteriorly.  
5. A #9 periosteal elevator is used to reflect the soft tissue laterally so that the entire mandible is visualized from angle to angle.  
6. The prefabricated cutting guide is placed to outline the mandibular cortex lateral to the IAN, and a corticotomy is performed to expose and lateralize the IAN.  
7. Once the nerve is freed bilaterally, the subapical osteotomy is completed with a reciprocating saw and the dentoalveolar segment of the mandible is mobilized.  
8. MMF is established using the prefabricated occlusal splint and 24- or 26-gauge stainless steel wires.  
9. Stock fixation plates and bicortical screws are then used anteriorly to secure the dentoalveolar segment in its final position.  
10. At the completion of fixation, MMF is released and the occlusion is verified.  
11. Prior to extubation, an orogastric tube is passed to empty contents of the stomach.  
12. The patient is placed into guiding elastics to help guide the jaw into occlusion.

# Postoperative Management

1. A pressure dressing and ice packs are utilized to minimize edema and hematoma formation. Ice is utilized for the first 24-48 hours. Warm heat with gentle massage may be applied after the initial 48 hours. The pressure dressing may be removed after 48 hours.  
2. Meticulous oral hygiene is reinforced.  
3. Humidified oxygen and head-of-bed elevations are recommended for 24 hours.  
4. A Yankauer suction is placed bedside for persistent intraoral secretions.  
5. Scissors or wire cutters should be on the patient at all times if heavy MMF is applied.  
6. Antibiotics, analgesics, anti-emetics, and steroids are prescribed.  
7. Adequate oral intake is necessary to maintain hydration. Initial intake is generally in the form of clear

liquids with a conversion to a soft non-chew diet over the first week. The consistency of the diet increases gradually over the following weeks as discomfort and edema subside and as range of motion and activity return.

8. Guiding elastics are applied early in the postoperative period to facilitate neuromuscular reprogramming. The pattern frequently follows the skeletal correction; class II vector (upper 2s to lower 3s) after mandibular advancement. The elastics are worn routinely over the first week with removal for isolated intervals for intake and hygiene.

# Key Points

1. Maxillary and mandibular wisdom teeth typically do not interfere with any of the atypical osteotomies, and can be exposed and removed during osteotomy surgery.  
2. When using custom fixation with atypical bimaxillary osteotomy cases, it is imperative to perform mandibular surgery first. This will allow for minor discrepancies in positioning to be adjusted for during maxillary surgery.  
3. When designing the cutting guide, care should be taken to avoid positioning fixation or predictive holes in the line of the osteotomies as fixation or predictive holes may be inadvertently damaged during osteotomies that extend beyond the cutting fence.  
4. Fixation of the custom plate to the proximal segment is much easier prior to osteotomy completion and mobilization of the two mandibular segments. Thus, the plate should be fixated to the proximal segment prior to separation of the segments whenever possible.  
5. Gaps at the osteotomy sites may be grafted if desired with autogenous or allograft bone. Grafting is performed after fixation and after the final occlusion has been verified. Templates can be fabricated during the virtual planning session and bone grafts mitered to aid in placement.  
6. At least three holes within the proximal and distal segments of the mandible are necessary for proper rigid fixation with custom plates in cases with significant movements and rotations.  
7. The decision between utilizing inverted L versus Z osteotomies is based on which segment the angle will be attached to. If there is a need for posterior facial elongation and movement of the angle inferiorly, the Z osteotomy should be chosen.
