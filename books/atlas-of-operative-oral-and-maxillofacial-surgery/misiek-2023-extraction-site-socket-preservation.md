# Extraction Site (Socket) Preservati

Dale J. Misiek

Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA

A method of preserving and augmenting bone height and width immediately after tooth extraction for future dental implant placement.

# Indications

1. Prevention of alveolar ridge atrophy after tooth extraction  
2. Restoration of bony defects caused by infection, trauma, and/or traumatic extractions

# Contraindications

1. Sites where future implant placement is unachievable  
2. Medical conditions that preclude implant placement

# Technique

1. Preoperative antibiotics and chlorohexidine rinses are administered immediately prior to extraction.  
2. Atraumatic exodontia is performed to maintain the buccal cortical plate and septal bone (see Figure 4.2 in Case Report 4.1).  
3. All periapical and granulation tissue is curetted from the extraction site, and the extraction site is copiously irrigated.  
4. A particulate grafting medium is placed and compacted within the defect (see Figures 4.5 and 4.6 in Case Report 4.1).  
5. A collagen membrane is placed (see Figure 4.7 in Case Report 4.1) to stabilize the graft and to guide tissue regeneration. A resorbable double figure-of-eight suture is used to secure the collagen membrane and to close tissue flaps/elevations.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative discomfort is managed with analgesics and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  
2. Patients are instructed to minimize pressure to the grafted area. Patients are asked to refrain from using straws, to avoid masticating on the area of the graft and to maintain a soft diet for 1 week postoperatively.

3. Gentle saltwater rinses are begun after 48 hours and are continued until mucosalization of the graft site occurs.  
4. Smoking cessation is encouraged during the recovery period.  
5. If a removable prosthesis was fabricated, the prosthesis should be modified to minimize pressure from the pontic against the augmented alveolar ridge.

# Complications

1. Graft loss: Graft loss is frequently the result of poor suture placement with the loss of the suture or membrane prematurely. Substantial graft loss may result in the inability to place dental implants without additional grafting in the form of tunnel or onlay grafting.  
2. Inadequate graft consolidation: Poor graft consolidation may occur if the bone graft is not properly condensed against the lateral walls and apex of the extraction site. Excessive grafting outside of the extraction site (above the alveolar ridge) may consolidate within the soft tissues crestal to the extraction site. This excessive grafting should be removed at the time of implant placement as it will not enhance bone to implant contact or implant stability  
3. Infection: Infection is rare with socket preservation grafting. Minor infections are treated with removal of inflamed tissue, peridex irrigations, and a 5-day course of oral antibiotics. More significant infections are treated with graft removal and a longer course of oral antibiotics.

# Key Points

1. Not all extraction sockets require grafting, particularly extraction sockets without wall defects and with thick buccal plates of bone.  
2. The preservation of the buccal and lingual plate of bone during extraction is the key to preserve the vertical height of bone at the extraction site. Significant removal of the buccal and lingual plates of bone will result in

decreased vertical bone height and decreased graft retention of the extraction site after graft healing.

3. Socket preservation grafting has numerous applications including single socket grafting, multiple socket grafting, and combination socket and onlay grafting.  
4. Temporization should be limited to tooth-supported prosthesis as a tissue-supported prosthesis (flipper) may place pressure into the graft site and lead to infection, poor soft tissue architecture, or graft displacement.  
5. Recombinant human bone morphogenic protein 2 has received US Food and Drug Administration approval for alveolar ridge augmentation for defects associated with extraction sockets.  
6. After tooth extraction, predictable alveolar ridge atrophy occurs. Tan et al. (2012) reported  $29 - 63\%$

horizontal bone loss and  $11 - 22\%$  vertical bone loss 6 months following tooth extractions without socket preservation grafting.

7. Depending on the size of the bone defect after tooth extraction, implant placement is typically after 10-14 weeks of graft healing. Large apical abscess curettage and removal may result in large bone defects and require additional time for graft consolidation prior to implant placement.  
8. Grafted sites with soft bone (low Hounsfield units) may require additional time to heal. Areas of soft bone that fail to increase in density over time should be treated with graft removal and regrafting prior to definitive implant placement.

demonstrated root decay and apical abscess. After socket preservation, site #5 will be allowed to heal for 3 months prior to implant placement at edentulous sites #4 and #5 (see Figures 4.1 through 4.7).
