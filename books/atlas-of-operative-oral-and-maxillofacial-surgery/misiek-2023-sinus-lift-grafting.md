A procedure designed to augment the vertical height of the maxillary sinus to facilitate implant placement in patients with pneumatized sinuses.

# Indications

1. Pneumatized maxillary sinus with a lack of vertical osseous support  $(< 10\mathrm{mm})$  for dental implant(s) placement within the posterior maxilla

# Contraindications

1. Chronic and acute maxillary sinusitis  
2. Odontogenic infection  
3. Maxillary sinus pathology (cysts, tumors, or polyps)  
4. Medical comorbidities

A. Coagulopathy or patients on anticoagulants  
B. Uncontrolled systemic disease  
C. Heavy smoking/vaping  
D. Systemic healing conditions (previous radiation therapy, intravenous bisphosphonates, and chronic immunosuppression)

# Anatomy

Pneumatization of the maxillary sinus refers to the enlargement of the sinus cavity that occurs with advancing age and tooth loss. The maxillary alveolus resorbs, and the sinus walls thin with loss of masticatory forces and function. The Schneiderian membrane lines the sinus cavity and contains ciliated epithelium, which propel sinus contents against gravity through an ostium located along the medial wall of the maxillary sinus, which drains into the middle meatus of the nose. Membrane thickness varies from 0.13 to  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ . Bony septae are variable in size and can be found emanating from the sinus floor, dividing the sinus cavity into multiple compartments. The blood supply to the maxillary sinus originates from three arteries—the infraorbital artery, the posterior superior alveolar artery, and the posterior lateral nasal artery—all of which are branches of

the maxillary artery. Intraosseous, and sometimes extraosseous, anastomoses between the infraorbital and posterior superior alveolar arteries give off networks of fine branches toward the alveolus.

# Direct Sinus Lift: Lateral Wall Technique

1. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended prior to any invasive sinus procedure. Intravenous sedation is typically utilized for prolonged cases, sinuses requiring extensive grafting, or anxious patients. For smaller grafting procedures and for procedures lasting less than 45 minutes, local anesthesia alone is frequently sufficient.  
2. Local anesthetic is infiltrated within the maxillary vestibule and the alveolar mucosa. Infraorbital and posterior superior alveolar blocks are recommended. Injection into the greater palatine canal provides profound anesthesia to the sinus cavity.  
3. The teeth and gingiva are brushed with betadine or chlorohexidine to disinfect the oral cavity.  
4. Adjacent to the edentulous region, a full-thickness semilunar vestibular incision is made at the mucogingival junction with extension into the vestibule. A subperiosteal dissection is performed to expose the maxillary antral wall at the proposed site of entry into the maxillary sinus (see Figure 6.13 in Case Report 6.2 and Figure 6.29 in Case Report 6.4). Alternatively, a sulcular-crestal incision (See Figure 6.4 in Case Report 6.1) with single or bilateral vertical releases may be used to gain access to the alveolar crest and the lateral wall of the sinus simultaneously.  
5. A round diamond bur with copious irrigation is used to create an oval window (Figure 6.30 in Case Report 6.3) within the area of the proposed bone graft. Care is taken to not perforate the Schneiderian membrane during removal of the antral bone window. An island of bone (Figure 6.31 in Case Report 6.3) may be left in the center of the sinus window, which will be elevated with the Schneiderian membrane. Piezosurgical

manipulation can be used as well, but with a thick lateral sinus wall, bone removal can be tedious.

6. Various instruments are used to carefully lift the Schneiderian membrane from the walls of the maxillary sinus (see Figure 6.15 in Case Report 6.2 and Figure 6.32 in Case Report 6.3). Once initially freed, the membrane is elevated from the floor and medial wall of the maxillary sinus. The anterior boundary of the sinus cavity should be determined with instrument palpation. The membrane should be freed in all directions to allow for the placement of sufficient grafting material. The sinus window can be enlarged with the use of a Kerrison rongeur (see Figure 6.33 in Case Report 6.3), if needed.  
7. The bone graft material of choice is placed and compacted within the sinus cavity without perforating the Schneiderian membrane. To minimize voids, the graft should be packed anteriorly, posteriorly and medially first (Figure 6.35 in Case Report 6.3). With simultaneous implant placement (see Figure 6.8 in Case Report 6.1 and Figure 6.37 in Case Report 6.3), the implants are placed after initial anterior, posterior and medial packing, and then additional grafting material is packed lateral to the implants.  
8. A membrane may be placed lateral to the graft, but it is not mandatory. The mucosal incision is primarily closed with 4-0 chromic gut sutures.

# Indirect Sinus Lift: Sinus Bump Technique

1. Indirect sinus lifts are performed at the time of implant placement. After the administration of local anesthesia to the implant site, the implant osteotomy is initiated and terminates just prior to the inferior floor of the maxillary sinus (see Figure 6.44 in Case Report 6.4).  
2. After implant osteotomy creation, sinus lift osteotomes (see Figure 6.1) may be utilized to tap the sinus floor superiorly with a surgical mallet. Alternatively, osseodensification drills may be utilized to elevate the bone apical to the implant osteotomy site into the overlying sinus. Osseodensification drills (see Figure 6.45 in Case Report 6.4) may be run in a reverse direction with copious irrigation to compact bone along the lateral surfaces of the implant osteotomy site and at the apex of the osteotomy site.  
3. With either technique, there is a tactile feel for once the maxillary sinus is entered. Care should be taken to not tear the overlying sinus membrane. After completion of the indirect sinus lift, the authors prefer to place particulate bone within the implant osteotomy site and blindly place the graft material along the floor of the sinus (see Figure 6.46 in Case Report 6.4) either using a sinus lift osteotome or with the implant placement itself.

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics are prescribed based on the invasiveness of the procedure.  
2. Oral antibiotics are prescribed for coverage of sinus microorganisms. Chlorohexidine mouth rinse is utilized twice daily for 7 days.  
3. Sinus precautions are recommended and include restricting smoking/vaping, spitting, nose blowing, heavy lifting, and valsalva maneuvers. Sneezing is allowed with an open mouth only to minimize sinus pressure and graft displacement.  
4. Expected postoperative sequelae include moderate facial edema, light epistaxis, ecchymosis, and discomfort. The extent of the postoperative sequelae varies depending on the invasiveness of the procedure, the graft material employed, and the patient's medical history and age.  
5. In cases where a sinus membrane tear or perforation occurred, nasal/sinus lavages are encouraged for 7-10 days.

# Complications

# Intraoperative and Early Complications

1. Sinus perforation: Risk factors include irregularities of the sinus floor (septae), tooth root formations, scar tissue from prior sinus surgeries, lower residual alveolar ridge height, acute angles between the medial and lateral walls, and an inexperienced operator. Minor perforations are managed with the use of resorbable membranes. Major perforations may require abandonment of the procedure and reattempts the procedure after 6 months of healing. However, the use of rhBMP-2 will typically succeed, even with large perforations.  
2. Hemorrhage: The intraosseous artery is commonly located  $16 - 19\mathrm{mm}$  from the alveolar ridge

and is closer in more resorbed ridges. The posterior lateral nasal artery may be encountered with vigorous curettage of the posterior lateral wall of the sinus.

# Late Complications

1. Sinus infection: Risk factors include sinus membrane perforation allowing bacteria to contaminate the graft or free-floating graft material within the sinus itself. Early sinus infection may be managed conservatively with oral antibiotics and nasal/sinus lavages. Late or severe sinus infection requires definitive treatment with opening the sinus, removing the infected graft material, direct sinus lavage and culture and sensitivity to guide antibiotic therapy.  
2. Non-integration of the implant(s): Risk factors include soft bone, poor graft consolidation, and low insertional implant torque values. Proper patient selection, under sizing implant osteotomies, and osseodensification may minimize the previously mentioned causes of implant failure.

# Key Points

1. Multiple episodes of sinusitis warrant an evaluation of the patency of the maxillary ostium with a computed tomography (CT) scan (traditional or cone beam CT [CBCT]) and/or via nasal endoscopy.  
2. Prior sinus surgery, such as closure of an oral antral fistula after tooth extraction or Caldwell Luc procedure, may result in scarring and confluence of the sinus and oral mucosa.  
3. Anticoagulants should be held prior to surgery to minimize the risk of hemorrhage, as there are no effective local hemostatic measures to control anticoagulant bleeding with the sinus cavity. Anticoagulant suspension should be performed only after discussion with the primary care physician or anticoagulant prescribing physician.  
4. Smokers should refrain from smoking 2 weeks prior to surgery and 6 weeks after surgery to minimize its deleterious effects on wound healing.  
5. The restorative treatment plan (the type of prosthesis, and the number and location of implants) will dictate the volume of sinus graft augmentation.  
6. CBCT is recommended prior to sinus augmentation to determine sinus anatomy, to identify anatomic variations such as septae, to identify the presence of pathology, and to quantify the amount of vertical augmentation required.  
7. Sinus augmentation techniques are selected based on the amount of augmentation needed. General guidelines are as follows:

A. Internal osteotome technique (sinus bump):  $1 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical augmentation  
B. Lateral wall technique:  $>3\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical augmentation  
C. Le Fort 1 osteotomy with interpositional graft: severely atrophic, edentulous maxilla

8. Simultaneous implant placement requires initial primary stability of the implant. Implant techniques may be modified, such as under preparation of the osteotomy, to ensure stability.  
9. Perforations usually occur during instrumentation and are best avoided by initial circumferential membrane elevation of at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  to prevent tension during floor and medial wall membrane elevation.  
10. Bone grafts should be allowed to heal for 3-6 months prior to placement and/or loading/restoring of implants. Unless extreme sinus atrophy is present, most situations allow for simultaneous grafting and implant placement.

# Case Reports

Case Report 6.1. Direct sinus lift with simultaneous implant placement via crestal incision. A 28-year-old female patient presents with absent tooth #14 with insufficient vertical and horizontal bone volume for implant placement. Due to the need to perform simultaneous vertical and horizontal bone augmentation, a sulcular-crestal incision was utilized with a distal release to gain access to the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus and to the lateral alveolar crest of bone. The site was grafted with a mixture of particulate bone with Tisseel fibrin sealant to allow for the formation of a moldable gel that would adhere to the sinus floor and lateral maxilla. The addition of compounds (fibrin sealants, protein based regenerative gels, PRP, PRF) to create a bone putty has the advantage of allowing the graft to remain intact should a minor sinus perforation occur (see Figures 6.2 through 6.11).

Case Report 6.2. Direct sinus lift with delayed implant placement via vestibular incision. A 52-year-old male patient presents with a chief complaint of a failing right sided posterior fixed bridge. Eight weeks prior, the patient underwent simultaneous left sided sinus lift and implant placement. Due to the amount of vertical augmentation required and the need to extract failing tooth #5, the decision was made to extract tooth #5 and

m simultaneous sinus augmentation via a direct sinus lift. After 3 months of healing, virtual surgical plan-ning was performed to create a surgical guide for the placement of implants at sites #3, #4, and #5. After implant healing, scan bodies were placed and a digital model was utilized for final crown fabrication (see Figures 6.12 through 6.27).

Figure 6.44. Implant placement is planned to utilize a  $10\mathrm{mm}$  length implant. The implant osteotomy is designed to stop  $1.0\mathrm{mm}$  to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  prior to entering the maxillary sinus. Osseodensification burs are run in a reverse direction to compact bone against the lateral and apical walls of the implant osteotomy site.

Figure 6.46. A 10-mm implant is placed simultaneously with an indirect crestal sinus lift. Additional xenograft was placed within the implant osteotomy and transferred apically during implant placement. Note elevation of the sinus membrane and graft material in place. A  $4.1 \times 10\mathrm{mm}$  tissue level implant is placed at site #14 to absorb the significant masticatory forces of first molar occlusion.
