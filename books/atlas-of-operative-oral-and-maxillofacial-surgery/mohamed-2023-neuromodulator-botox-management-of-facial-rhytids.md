The use of neuromodulators to temporarily paralyze selective muscles of facial expression for the prevention, minimization, or elimination of facial rhytids. The degree of improvement is directly correlated to the degree of rhytids present and the amount of neuromodulator injected. Alternative uses include the treatment of muscle spasms, hyperhidrosis, and muscle-related temporoman-dibular disorders (TMD).

Multiple trade names exist using Botulinum Toxin A differing in their accessory attachment proteins (Botox, Dysport, Xeomin, jeuveau).

Botulinum Toxin B also exists under the trade name Myobloc.

# Facial Aesthetic Indications

1. Horizontal forehead rhytids (frontalis muscle)  
2. Glabellar rhytids (corrugator and procerus muscles)  
3. Periocular rhytids/blepharospasm (orbicularis oculi muscle)  
4. Bunny lines (levator labii superioris alaequie nasi and transverse nasalis muscles)  
5. Nasal tip ptosis (levator labii superioris alaequie nasi and nasalis muscles)  
6. Nasal (alar) flaring (nasalis muscle)  
7. Excessive gingival show (zygomaticus minor and levator anguli oris muscles)  
8. Perioral rhytids (orbicularis oris muscle)  
9. Ptosis of oral commissures/marionette lines (depressor labi inferioris muscle)  
10. Mental dimpling/peau d'orange chin (mentalis muscle)  
11. Platysmal banding (platysma muscle)

# Contraindications

1. Allergy or hypersensitivity to ingredients (albumin, sodium chloride, Botulinum Toxin A/B)  
2. Infection at the proposed injection site  
3. Neuromuscular disorders (Eaton-Lambert Syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis, motor neuron diseases)  
4. Coadministration with aminoglycoside antibiotics or other agents (penicillamine, quinine, calcium channel

blockers, neuromuscular blocking agents, anticholinesterases, magnesium sulfate, etc.) that interfere with neuromuscular transmission, which may potentiate the effect of Botulinum Toxin

5. Pregnancy (Pregnancy Class C) and lactation (unknown whether Botox is excreted in human milk)  
6. Heavy facial rhytids at rest (injection of modulators may provide little to no benefit)  
7. Unrealistic expectations (patients better treated with surgical intervention or patients with psychological disorders)

# Anatomy

1. Frontalis muscle: Originates from the galea aponeurotica and inserts within the dermis at the level of the eyebrow, procerus, corrugator, and orbicularis oculi muscles. Elevates the eyebrow and produces horizontal forehead rhytids.  
2. Corrugator supercilii muscle: Originates from the medial supraorbital ridge and inserts at the caudal aspect of the frontalis muscle, the medial aspect of the orbicularis oculi, and the skin in the region of the midbrow. Contraction produces vertical glabellar rhytids (#11) and/or a dimpled radix depression.  
3. Procerus muscle: Origins at the periosteum of the nasal bone and inserts into the mid-forehead dermis. Contraction produces transverse rhytids over the nasal bridge (bunny lines).  
4. Orbicularis oculi: Origins from the frontal process of the maxilla, the nasal portion of the frontal bone, and the medial palpebral ligament, and inserts laterally around the orbit and at the lateral palpebral raphe. The lateral orbicularis oculi are responsible for lateral canthal rhytids (crow's feet).  
5. Orbicularis oris: Originates near the midline on the anterior surface of the maxilla and modiolus at the angle of the mouth and inserts into the mucous membrane of the margin of the lips and raphe with the buccinator at the modiolus. The orbicularis acts to narrow the mouth, purse the lips, and pucker the lip edges.

6. Mentalis: Origins from the incisive fossa on the alveolar process of the mandible in the region of lateral incisor. The muscle fibers radiate and insert into the skin of the chin. Acts to protrude the lower lip and elevate the skin on the chin.  
7. Platysma: Origins at the subcutaneous tissues of the infraclavicular and supraclavicular regions. Inserts into the base of the mandible, the skin of the cheeks and lower lip, and the angle of the mouth and orbicularis oris. It is contiguous with the superficial musculo aponeurotic system (SMAS). Primary action is to depress the skin of the lower face and neck.

# Technique

1. After consent, the patient is seated in an upright position and the treatment areas are cleansed with alcohol. If topical anesthetic is desired, common forms of Eutectic Mixtures of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) in differing concentrations of Lidocaine/Tetracaine creams compounded in a pharmacy formula can be applied to the area for 10-15 minutes. The area is then recleansed with alcohol. Injectable local anesthesia is generally not utilized.  
2. The patient can be treated in an upright position or seated at a  $45^{\circ}$  angle with the injector in front of or

behind the patient depending on the preference of the injector.

3. The patient is asked to animate the muscles being treated, allowing the practitioner to identify the size, degree, and strength of the targeted muscles.  
4. The muscle action can be simply noted mentally or indexed (see Figures 45.2 and 45.3) with a sterile marking pen for beginning injectors. As comfort level and experience improves, injectors may modify treatment to suit individual patient needs and increase or decrease amounts administered to specific areas.  
5. Neuromodulator should be ideally mixed at least 15 minutes before use with preservative-free saline. Several different concentrations are used frequently varying from  $2 - 4\mathrm{mL}$  per 100-unit vial; however, consensus recommendations on the use for Botulinum Toxin A determined  $2.5\mathrm{mL}$  per 100 units to be the most commonly used concentration. The total amount of units administered varies on the areas the patient wishes to be treated and the degree of facial expression. Typical amounts used to treat the three most common areas (forehead, glabella, and crow's feet) conservatively range from 20 to 40 units. See Table 45.1 for recommended dosages.  
6. In treating the forehead and the glabella, care should be taken to remain at least  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  from the bony brow

(supraorbital rim) to reduce the possibility of eyelid or brow ptosis. This should be further extended higher, lateral to the midpupillary line, in females to maintain the arch of the lateral brow.

7. Lateral canthal rhytids are addressed at injection sites placed a minimum of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the bone orbital rim, above the zygomatic arch and away from visible blood vessels (see Figure 45.4).  
8. Lateral nasal rhytids or bunny lines (see Figure 45.5) are treated using 2-3 units per side with injection into the nasalis muscle and/or levator labii superioris alaequie nasi muscles. Alar flaring is treated with a similar amount along the alar portion of the nasalis muscle.  
9. Perioral rhytids are treated by injection micro-doses of 1-2 units directly above or on the vermillion border of the lips and can be placed anywhere along the circumference of the lips. Patients should be warned

that it may affect the ability to purse the lips together (whistling or the use of a straw).

10. Down turning of the lateral commissures can result from a lack of equal opposing balance between the depressor anguli oris (DAO) and zygomaticus muscles. This can be minimized through injection of 2-4 units to each side of the DAO muscles. For further effect, the 2-4 units can also be injected into the mentalis muscle.  
11. Dimpling of the skin overlying the chin (Peau D'orange chin) can be treated with 4-8 units injected directly into the mentalis muscle.  
12. Platysmal banding on the neck can vary greatly. Patients are asked to flex the neck muscle to allow the surgeon to identify the number and degree of bands present. Two to four units are injected  $1.5 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  apart along the length of the band.

# Postoperative Management

1. Generally, no treatment is required directly after the application of Botox. However, ice may be applied to the areas for several minutes postinjection to minimize injection site edema.  
2. It is preferred to minimize strenuous activity and to maintain an upright position for 6 hours after treatment to decrease theoretical migration of the neuromodulator.  
3. Patients are asked to avoid touching or manipulating the treatment areas directly after procedure to minimize migration and redistribution of the neuromodulator.  
4. Patients are suggested to animate the injected muscles periodically for several hours after treatment to speed the onset of the effect, however, this is not required.

# Complications

# Early Complications

1. Injection site pain: Typically caused by the initial perforation of the skin. The use of a 32-gauge needle, application of topical anesthetic creams to the injection sites, injection into relaxed muscles (patient not contracting), and injecting superficial to the periosteum will lessen injection discomfort

![](images/8f6d75c2f5d292d14662ae3f361d518159c341f54f9247a241b63c7531b7c2b8.jpg)  
Figure 45.6. Frontalis muscle injections are performed within the mass of the muscle.

2. Injection site ecchymosis: Caused by injection trauma of a blood vessel (commonly the supratrochlear vessels) or injecting deep within the region of the lateral orbicularis oculi. Prior to injecting, the course of the superficial vessels should be noted and needle insertion should avoid vessels.

3. Injection site edema: Minimized with ice and/or light pressure at the injection site and the correct placement of the Botulinum Toxin.  
4. Headaches and transient flu-like symptoms: Managed palliatively with over the counter analgesics.

# Late Complications

1. Facial asymmetry: Caused by asymmetrical injection technique, aberrant muscle patterns, or pre-existing facial asymmetry.  
2. Brow ptosis (frozen face): Caused by complete paralysis of the frontalis muscle. Conservative treatment of the frontalis muscle, and cautious treatment at the lateral aspect of the brow will minimize this complication.  
3. Eyelid ptosis: Placement of injection at the supraorbital rim or the use of diluted Botox (increased chance of toxin migration) can result in paralysis of the levator palpebrae superioris. Placement of neuromodulator  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  above the bony orbital rim should be adhered to minimize eyelid ptosis. Treatment consists of  $0.5\%$  apraclonidine drops to the affected eye for several weeks to stimulate the contraction of Mueller's muscle to allow  $1 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of upper eyelid elevation.  
4. Diplopia: Occurs as a result of paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle from placing injection too close to the lateral orbital rim. Injection placement should be  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  from the lateral orbital rim.  
5. Lagophthalmos: Cause by excessive placement too close to the inferior eyelid margin. This can result in a round eye appearance. Conservative placement of the Botox 1 cm below the lid margin should be performed.  
6. Spock brows: Undertreatment of the lateral frontalis fibers can result in hyper-elevation of the lateral forehead and brow resulting in excessively arched brows. Treated with touch-up doses of neurotoxin placed lateral to the midpupillary line in the area of animation.  
7. Perioral incompetence or asymmetry: Injection sites adjacent to the zygomaticus major can result in inability to appropriately elevate the lateral commissures. Avoided by placing injections above the zygomatic arch when treating periorbital rhytids.

# Case Report

Case Report 45.1. Botulinum Toxin A management of facial rhytids. A 30-year-old female with a chief complaint of dynamic rhytids in the forehead, glabellar, and periorbital (crow's feet) regions. She has received neurotoxin treatment biannually since age 26. The patient received 40 units of

# Key Points

1. Recommended reconstitution is  $2.5\mathrm{cc}$  preservative-free saline per 100-unit vial resulting in a concentration of 4 units per  $0.1\mathrm{cc}$ . This allows the injection of 2-unit and 4-unit increments with ease. A 27-gauge  $\frac{1}{2}$ -inch needle is used to draw the neurotoxin into a 1-cc end tip syringe. A 32-gauge needle is then used to administer the neurotoxin to the desired sites.  
2. Botox is ideally allowed to mix for 15 minutes prior to use. It is recommended that Botox be used within 24 hours of reconstitution; however, studies demonstrate consistent potency if administered up to 4 weeks after reconstitution.  
3. Available brands of Botulinum Toxin A on the market include Botox, Reloxin (Dysport), Xeomin, and juveau. Myobloc is Botulinum Toxin B.  
4. Recommended dosages for cosmetic treatment range from 20 to 100 units administered every 3-6 months for maintaining results. Males generally receive higher doses due to increased muscle mass.  
5. Evaluating facial expression at rest and during animation allows for identification of the muscle groups and guides placement of the injection sites. Botox should be injected directly into the mass of the muscle.  
6. Patient discomfort can be minimized by not injecting into a contracting muscle and remaining superficial to the periosteum. Periorbital injections should remain superficial within the subcutaneous plane to minimize discomfort and ecchymosis.  
7. Botox diffuses up to  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  spherically from the site of injection. Therefore, care must be taken to remain  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  from the supraorbital and lateral orbital rim.  
8. Through the use of a more concentrated solution (4 units/0.1cc), less diffusion, discomfort, and edema are likely to occur.  
9. Botox effects begin 24-72 hours postinjection and peak at approximately 10-14 days. The results begin to decline after 3-4 months. The duration varies per individual.  
10. Touch-up injections are in 2-4 unit increments are commonly performed 2 weeks after initial treatment for greater effect.
