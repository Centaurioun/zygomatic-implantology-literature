Soft tissue volumizers (fillers) encompass autogenous, synthetic biodegradable temporary and permanent soft tissue fillers for facial augmentation, rejuvenation, and reconstruction.

Autogenous fat: Semipermanent to permanent. Used for all forms and areas of facial soft tissue augmentation, and patients with a hypersensitivity to synthetic fillers.

Temporary synthetic fillers: Composed of hyaluronic acid in various particle sizes and volumizing effect that cater to multiple areas of facial augmentation. Several products exist with differing indications to include Juvederm (Allergan, Irvine, California, USA) (hyaluronic acid [HA]), Perlane (Medicis Aesthetics Inc, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA) (HA), and Restylane (Medicis Aesthetics Inc, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA) (HA).

Semipermanent synthetic fillers: Radiesse (Merz Aesthetics Inc, Franksville, Wisconsin, USA) (calcium hydroxylapatite [CaHa]), Sculptra (Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, Laval, Quebec, Canada) (ploy-lactic acid [PLLA]), and Bellafill (formerly known as ArteFill) (Suneva Medical Inc, Santa Barbara, California, USA) (polymethyl methacrylate microspheres [PMMA]).

There are currently no FDA approved truly permanent fillers available. Bellafill is reported to last up to 5 years. See Table 46.1 for a list of common injectable fillers and recommended injection sites.

# Contraindications

1. Unrealistic expectations and psychosocial disorders  
2. Hypersensitivity to injectable materials and ingredients  
3. Infection and the proposed treatment area

# Anatomy

Epidermis: Layers, from superficial to deep, are the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.

Dermis: Layers, from superficial to deep, are the papillary dermis and reticular dermis.

Hypodermis: Contains the fat, connective tissue, neural tissue, and vasculature.

Periosteum: Layer of dense connective tissue overlying and in intimate contact with the bone below.

Vasculature: Danger zones correspond to the course of supratrochlear, supraorbital, infraorbital, facial, superior labial, inferior labial, and angular arteries of the face. Inadvertent filler injection into a vessel can lead to occlusion, thrombosis, ischemia, and skin necrosis.

# Injection Technique

1. Patients are advised to avoid anticoagulant medications or supplements prior to the day of the procedure.  
2. Makeup is removed and the treatment areas are prepared with alcohol gauze. Baseline photos are recommended without makeup.  
3. For a majority of patients, anesthesia to the treatment area can be accomplished with the placement of topical anesthetic creams at least 30 minutes prior to injection. Common forms include Eutectic Mixtures of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) in differing concentrations of Lidocaine/Tetracaine creams compounded in a pharmacy. For individuals desiring complete anesthesia of the soft tissue areas being treated (sensitive areas such as the lips), sensory nerve blocks may be performed. Minimal local anesthetic is utilized to minimize distortion of the soft tissue anatomy of the area being treated.  
4. The depth of injection is determined by the area being treated and the type of filler being used. Recommendations provided by the manufacturer are

suggested for beginner injectors. In general, nonpermanent fillers are injected in the dermal layer and are based on particle size: the smaller the particle size, the more superficial the placement can be. For semipermanent fillers, placement is recommended within the hypodermis and deeper. The deeper a soft tissue filler is placed, the less conspicuous the effect is.  
5. It is recommended to aspirate when injecting to avoid intravascular placement of material. Injections are slow, deliberate and in a retrograde fashion (deposit filler as the needle is retracted). The bevel is placed up on entry into the skin and turned deep to inject deep to the syringe tip.  
6. A methodical sequence is recommended to measure the amount deposited at each injection site and to ensure all areas are treated symmetrically. If an asymmetric appearance is noted during initial evaluation, then asymmetric deposits of filler can be placed to establish balance and facial harmony.  
7. A crosshatch pattern of injection can be applied to areas with deep rhytids.  
8. If ecchymosis is encountered, slight pressure can be applied to the area, and further placement should be made away from this position.  
9. Once the filler is placed, the material can be gently molded to carefully direct filler deposition with manual compression.  
10. A conservative amount of filler is recommended for beginners, future touch-ups can be performed at a later date.

11. Results are immediate and patients with minimal to moderate edema 24-72 hours post treatment.  
12. Patients are typically seen at 10-14 days postinjection to evaluate final soft tissue filler outcome, to perform minor touch-ups, and for corrections of any subtle asymmetries.

# Postinjection Management

1. Ice may be applied to the treatment areas with minimal pressure if evidence of ecchymosis is present.  
2. Strenuous activity is avoided for 8-10 hours after treatment.  
3. Make up can be applied after treatment, if necessary, although this is generally not recommended.  
4. Patients are recommended to avoid massage or manipulation of the treated areas.

# Complications

# Early Complications (0-7 Days Postinjection)

1. Injection site-related sequelae and hypersensitivity reaction: Include redness, edema, discomfort, pruritis, and ecchymosis. Typically resolves spontaneously after 3-7 days.  
2. Overcorrection: Overcorrection can be minimized by injecting slowly and allowing the patient to provide feedback during the process. Excess material can present as clumping or obvious asymmetry and can be avoided by a controlled and conservative injection technique. Excessive placement, if minimal, can be decreased by dispersing the material to adjacent or deeper tissue through manual compression or massaging. If significant overcorrection of asymmetry is present, the use of hyaluronidase (Vitrase 200 units/mL) can be injected directly into the treated areas. Effects are immediate and continue into the first 24 hours. General guidelines recommend using 5 units/0.1 mL of HA used.  
3. Infection: Infection can develop if treatment areas are not cleansed appropriately. Treatment is with oral antibiotics. Rarely, surgical drainage may be necessary if an abscess or cellulitis develops. If the patient has a history of herpes labialis breakouts, pretreatment with acyclovir or valacyclovir is recommended to prevent a breakout when treating the lips.  
4. Vascular compromise and necrosis: Results from intravascular injection of material, direct needle injury to a vessel, or compression of a vessel by surrounding filler. Vascular compromise and necrosis can be minimized with cautious technique, by injecting slowly and with minimal pressure, aspirating prior to injection, injecting small volumes per pass, and using small-caliber needles or cannulas. Acute symptoms include blanching of the skin supplied but the injured vessel, pain, duskiness, and ecchymosis. Treatment includes

immediate massaging of the area, placement of nitroglycerin paste to the overlying skin, and heat compresses. The use of hyaluronidase can be used if an HA filler was placed. High risk areas for vascular compromise include the glabella, nose, and nasolabial folds.

# Late Complications (Greater Than 7 Days Postinjection)

1. Subcutaneous nodule formation, lumps, and beading: Occur as a result of superficial placement of filler, especially superficially, and poor injection technique. Treatment for HA filler is time or injection of hyaluronidase for immediate resolution. Treatment for semipermanent filler is intralesional steroids (Triamcinolone).  
2. Raleigh or Tyndall Effect: Results from the superficial placement of HA filler in the immediate infraorbital area or in the nasolabial fold. It can also be encountered if HA is placed behind the orbital septum. This adverse outcome can last years if not corrected and therefore should be addressed by the administration of hyaluronidase to remove the injected filler.  
3. Granulomatous reaction: All fillers can potentially cause granuloma formation. CaHa is frequently linked to the formation of granulomas. Treatment involves intralesional steroids.  
4. Filler migration: The gradual extravasation of filler beyond the desired margins. May be encountered when injecting the outline of the lips. Migration can be minimized through conservative retrograde injection technique, avoiding strenuous activity following treatment, and injectors massaging filler immediately after placement to direct the deposit.

# Key Points

1. Pre- and post-treatment photographs are always taken to objectively document the change in facial appearance.  
2. Fillers provide volume to areas of deficiency, minimize the appearance of rhytids at rest, and accentuate areas where injected. It should be noted that fillers do not alter the appearance of dynamic rhytids or significant skin elasticity. Patients should be made aware prior to treatment so that unrealistic expectations are not expected. Fillers can be used as an adjunct to surgery and Botulinum Toxin treatment.  
3. First time patients receiving filler are best treated with synthetic biodegradable fillers (HA). This allows patient to evaluate outcomes and avoid situations of unsatisfied patients if semipermanent filler is used.  
4. Filler selection is crucial to achieve repeatable positive outcomes as a myriad of fillers exist with different indications. The viscosity, particle size, volumizing effect, half-life, and injection depth vary among filler types. The manufacturer's recommendations are suggested as to where and how the specific filler should be administered.

5. Certain fillers are more prone to complications than others (nodules and granulomas with PLLA and CaHa). HA fillers, when injected properly, offer temporary augmentation with little to no side effects and the comfort of reversal through hyaluronidase.  
6. Overall recommendations are to err on the side of conservative injection amounts injected deep versus superficial. Superficial treatment can overcorrect and demonstrate irregularities to the skin surface more readily and may cause the epidermis to appear translucent with a bluish hue (Tyndall Effect).  
7. Beginners should undercorrect treatment areas as patients can return 10-14 days postinjection to evaluate final tissue filler outcome, to perform minor touch-ups and for corrections of any subtle asymmetries.  
8. Patients can anticipate peak edema to occur 48-72 hours after treatment with final result achieved after 2 weeks postinjection. Patients should be advised that typically a  $20\%$  reduction in soft tissue volume can be expected after the peak edema phase.

# Case Report

Case Report 46.1. Soft tissue augmentation with Juvederm. A 32-year-old female presents with a desire to add volume and definition to her upper and lower lips, and to soften her nasolabial folds. The patient did not desire the "injected look." The patient was treated with 1 cc Juvederm Volbella to her upper and lower lips and 1 cc Juvederm Vollure to her nasolabial folds. Volbella offers control over volume and definition as it can be placed superficially in the lips with minimal risk of clumping. Vollure contains larger particle sizes and offers larger plumping effect which proves ideal for the nasolabial folds (see Figures 46.1 through 46.9).
