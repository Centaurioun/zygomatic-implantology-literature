A method of obtaining large amounts of cortical, cancellous, or corticocancellous autogenous bone from the posterior ilium.

# Indications

1. When autogenous grafting is desired that requires a high ratio of cancellous to cortical bone (a high volume of osteocompetent cells)  
2. Hard tissue maxillofacial defects requiring up to  $100\mathrm{mL}$  of uncompressed bone or  $5\mathrm{cm}$  of structural cortical graft  
3. The presence of a bone void unable to be filled with local tissue-grafting techniques  
4. The need for augmentation of biologic healing capability (transfer of osteocompetent cells) to fracture or osteotomy sites  
5. The need for additional osseous structural stability within traumatic or surgical defects

# Contraindications

1. Local infection at, or adjacent to, the harvest site  
2. Relative: The obese population is at increased risk for postoperative complications  
3. Relative: The smoking population is at increased risk for postoperative complications  
4. Relative: Osteoporotic and osteopenic patients are more likely to sustain intraoperative or postoperative fracture at the site of harvest. The procedure should be approached with caution in this population.

# Anatomy of the Posterior Ilium

Osseous structure: The borders of the posterior ilium are the iliac crest superiorly, the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) posteriorly, and the greater sciatic notch inferiorly. The bone is slightly concave on its lateral surface with three distinct ridges comprising the posterior, anterior, and inferior gluteal lines.

Musculature and fascia: The outer surface of the ilium serves as the broad attachment site for the gluteus minimus (between the anterior and inferior lines), the gluteus medius (between the anterior and posterior lines),

and the gluteus maximus (from the posterior line to the iliac crest). The gluteus medius and minimus comprise the hip abductors and are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. The gluteus maximus functions to extend and externally rotate the hip and is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve. The medial edge of the posterior iliac crest is the attachment site for the lumbodorsal fascia.

Vasculature: The superior gluteal vessels arise from the posterior division of the internal iliac system and run adjacent to the cortex in the superior aspect of the sciatic notch. They supply the gluteal musculature and are located at an average of  $63\mathrm{mm}$  anteroinferiorly from the PSIS and  $37\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to a line drawn perpendicular to the vertical axis at the level of the PSIS.

Neurologic structures: The superior cluneal nerves originate from the L1 to L3 nerve roots and cross directly over the posterior iliac crest. The superior cluneal nerves supply sensory innervation to the superior two-thirds of the buttocks and are located an average of  $68\mathrm{mm}$  anterosuperiorly from the PSIS. The middle cluneal nerves originate from the S1-S3 nerve roots and course from the sacral foramen laterally. The middle cluneal nerves supply sensory innervation to the medial buttock. Excessive traction or laceration to the superior and/or middle cluneal nerves can lead to numbness or symptomatic neuromas.

The greater sciatic notch contains the following nerves: the sciatic, superior and inferior gluteal, internal pudendal, posterior femoral cutaneous nerves, the nerve to quadratus femoris, and the nerve to obturator interuns. The greater sciatic notch is located  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the posterior iliac crest and must not be violated during the surgical approach to the posterior ilium.

# Posterior Iliac Crest Bone Graft (PICBG) Harvesting Technique

# Posterior Iliac Approach

1. Harvesting from the posterior iliac region can be performed with the patient positioned either prone or in the lateral position. For harvesting in a prone position,

the patient is intubated supine and then positioned prone, with  $210^{\circ}$  of reverse hip flexion.

2. Anatomical landmarks are palpated and marked, and include the posterior iliac crest, PSIS, the sacral midline and the site of the proposed incision (see Figure 63.3 in Case Report 63.1). Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is injected at the surgical site. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
3. A  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  oblique or curvilinear skin incision (see Figure 63.1) originating  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the midline and  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the posterior superior iliac spine is placed overlying and following the arc of the palpable bony prominence of the posterior iliac crest. The dissection proceeds through skin and subcutaneous tissue until the prominent dorsolumbar (i.e., lumbodorsal or thoracolumbar) fascia is encountered. The dorsolumbar fascia is transected, and dissection continues to the posterior iliac crest. A full-thickness flap, including the dorsolumbar fascia, gluteus maximus muscle, and periosteum, is elevated  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the PSIS to expose the outer cortex of the posterior ilium (see Figure 63.4 in Case Report 63.1). Preserving the continuity of this single, stout layer will greatly facilitate closure of the surgical site once the graft is obtained and will minimize postoperative complications. Preserving the PSIS and its attachments (sacroiliac ligaments) will minimize postoperative pelvic instability and will aid in maintaining a safe distance from the sacroiliac joint.  
4. Subperiosteal elevation continues lateral to the PSIS and inferior to the posterior iliac crest for approximately  $4 - 6\mathrm{cm}$ , depending on the size of the graft to be harvested. Care is taken with inferior reflection of the tissues to minimize damage to the structures within the sciatic notch and to the superior gluteal vessels.

# Corticocancellous (Unicortical) Harvesting

1. After exposure of the grafting-donor site, the osteotomy design is contrived (see Figure 63.2). The osteotomy size is dependent on the amount of bone required by the recipient site. The medial aspect of the osteotomy should originate  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the PSIS, should extend no more than  $5\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the iliac crest, and should be directed perpendicular to the crest-iliac rim to avoid undermining the PSIS, to orient the medial osteotomy distal to the sacroiliac joint, and to reduce the potential for a future stress fracture of the posterior ilium.  
2. The location of the lateral (distal) osteotomy is placed  $4 - 6\mathrm{cm}$  lateral (distal) to the medial osteotomy. The inferior osteotomy should extend no more than  $5\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the posterior iliac crest-iliac rim. The superior osteotomy may be designed to incorporate the iliac rim or may be performed just inferior to the iliac rim (a rim-sparing osteotomy) (see Figures 63.2 and 63.6). The deep aspect of the osteotomy should extend just

into the marrow cavity. The osteotomies may be performed with combinations of chisels and saws (i.e., reciprocating and oscillating).

3. The outer cortical table of the posterior ilium may be harvested in strips or as a whole, depending on the reconstruction needs of the recipient site. The outer cortical table is elevated with a combination of a chisel and a freer. Care is taken to orient the chisel away from the sacroiliac joint and sciatic notch-superior gluteal vessels to minimize iatrogenic damage to these key structures (see Figure 63.2).  
4. Once the outer table has been removed, cancellous bone (see Figure 63.6 in Case Report 63.1) may be harvested from the underlying marrow space. Care is taken to not undermine the PSIS and to avoid penetration of the inner table. Cancellous bone is harvested utilizing large curved and straight curettes in a two-handed, controlled maneuver, ensuring the inner table is not violated.

# Cancellous-Only Harvesting: The Trapdoor Technique

1. In this technique, the lateral soft tissue attachments are not stripped from the ilium.  
2. After exposure of the grafting site, an incision is made through the lateral rim of the cortex of the iliac crest using osteotomies. The crest is reflected medially, ensuring that all medial and lateral musculature remains intact.  
3. Once exposed, cancellous bone can be cutted through the "trapdoor," in which three sides of the rectangular block are cut and hinged opened on the fourth side. The harvest should only extend lateral (distal) to the PSIS, and care should be taken to avoid perforating the inner table of the ilium.  
4. Once the cancellous bone harvest is complete, the trapdoor is closed and gently secured into place with a bone tamp.

# Closure

1. After bone harvesting is complete, all exposed cancellous surfaces are copiously irrigated and covered with bone wax or Gelfoam to obtain hemostasis at the graft site and to minimize postoperative hematoma formation.  
2. Meticulous hemostasis should be obtained as soft tissues are closed. Drains are not required if wound hemostasis is achieved.  
3. Any subperiosteally dissected musculature should be repaired to its origin on the iliac crest utilizing heavy, absorbable sutures (i.e., 0-0 Vicryl).  
4. The wound is closed in a layered fashion. The full-thickness deep flap (dorsolumbar fascia, gluteus maximus muscle, and periosteum) is re-approximated with 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The subcuticular layer is closed with

a running 3-0 Monocryl suture. Skin tension is achieved with surgical skin glue or sterile-strips with an island dressing overlay.

5. Judicious infiltration on local anesthetic both superficially and deep will assist in postoperative pain control.

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics should be prescribed as necessary. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided as their use may slow the bone-healing process.  
2. Up to 24 hours of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics may be utilized on an individualized basis.  
3. The patient can begin weight bearing as tolerated immediately following surgery.  
4. The wound should remain sterilely dressed for 5 days prior to showering. Complete submergence of the wound should be avoided until the wound is sealed and healed at about 4 weeks postoperatively.

# Complications

1. Donor site pain: Reported to occur in  $3 - 40\%$  of individuals (highly variable). Pain at the graft site will often decrease with time, but some individuals develop a persistent low-grade pain that may last for months to years.  
2. Superficial infection: The rate of superficial infection is similar to that of most orthopedic procedures (ranging from 0.5 to  $5\%$ ). Superficial infections are treated with or without antibiotics based on the clinical presentation.  
3. Deep infection: The rate of deep infection is  $1 - 2.5\%$ . Deep donor site infections are addressed by surgical irrigation and debridement with antibiotics as indicated based on the clinical situation.  
4. Cluneal nerve injury: May occur if dissection is carried too far laterally from the PSIS (more than  $6\mathrm{cm}$ ). If damaged, the patient may experience numbness, dysesthesias, or chronic neuroma pain in the upper two-thirds (superior cluneal) or medial aspect (middle cluneal) of the buttocks.  
5. Sacroiliac joint disruption: May occur if bone harvesting is undertaken in proximity to the joint or if the joint is undermined with inappropriate osteotomy design. Disruption of this joint will predispose the patient to sacroiliac joint pain, instability, and early-onset arthritis.  
6. Abductor weakness: Muscle weakness can occur without appropriate repair of the lateral musculature dissected free from the ilium. This will result in a patient with a Trendelenburg gait, which is characterized by a drop in the contralateral pelvis during the stance phase of the affected limb. The patient will compensate by leaning their body over the affected side during the stance phase.  
7. Major vessel injury: The superior gluteal vessels run against the cortex of the superior portion of the greater sciatic notch and can be injured if aggressive retraction, dissection, or harvest extends into the notch.

8. Major nerve injury: The sciatic and superior gluteal nerves run within the greater sciatic notch and can be damaged with errant violation of this space.

# Key Points

1. The posterior iliac region can provide a large amount of cortical and cancellous bone graft (up to  $100\mathrm{mL}$  of uncompressed bone).  
2. Preoperative counseling regarding the likelihood of donor site pain is an important part of setting realistic expectations for the patient undergoing this procedure and will increase patient satisfaction even if pain is encountered.  
3. When performing posterior iliac crest bone-grafting procedures in the prone position, care is taken to ensure the endotracheal tube is adequately secured and to appropriately cushion the patient to prevent pressure ulcerations and to provide adequate space for respiratory function.  
4. Appropriate incision location, osteotomy design, and procurement of the posterior iliac bone graft will minimize postoperative complications such as vessel, nerve, and muscle injury; damage and instability of the sacroiliac joints; and fracture (see Figures 63.1 and 63.2).  
5. Meticulous subperiosteal dissection and packing of cancellous graft sites with bone wax or Gelfoam will minimize significant hemorrhage and lessen the likelihood of postoperative complications secondary to hematoma formation and infection. Postoperative drains may be required if hemostasis cannot be achieved with local measures.  
6. If additional particulate graft is required, a bone mill may be used to convert cortical bone into uniform-sized particulate bone (see Figure 63.7 in Case Report 63.1).  
7. Care should be taken to avoid injury to the superior gluteal artery. If lacerated, local control and cauterization should be attempted immediately. If the vessel retracts into the pelvis, the area should be packed with laparotomy sponges, and an approach to the vessel should be made in a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal fashion. Additionally, catheter embolization is advised when local control cannot be obtained.  
8. In patients with known osteopenia or osteoporosis, graft harvesting should be undertaken with caution. These patients are more likely to sustain a fracture intraoperatively and postoperatively. Additionally, the amount of bone available for harvest may be insufficient. A computed tomography scan of the pelvis may be of benefit during preoperative planning to assess the amount of bone available for harvest.  
9. In patients with symptomatic sacroiliac joints, the graft harvest should be performed on the symptomatic side to avoid iatrogenic injury to the asymptomatic joint.
