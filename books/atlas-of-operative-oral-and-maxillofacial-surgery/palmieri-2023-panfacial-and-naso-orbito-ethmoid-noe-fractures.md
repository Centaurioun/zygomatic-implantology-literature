Reduction and reconstruction of hard and soft tissue injuries of the facial skeleton to allow for early and total restoration of facial form, symmetry, and function.

# Indications for Reduction of Panfacial and NOE Fractures

1. To establish airway security in the presence of unstable fractures, expanding hematoma, and foreign body aspiration  
2. Extensive soft tissue injury requiring debridement with primary closure  
3. Profuse blood loss from facial injuries  
4. Large, open, contaminated compound wounds  
5. Concomitant systemic injuries requiring immediate operative intervention by another surgical subspecialty  
6. Restoration of pre-injury facial aesthetics and function  
7. Prevention of latent cosmetic and functional deficits

# Contraindications

1. Patients with severe, compromising, concomitant systemic trauma, rendering them unstable for open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF)  
2. Unstable patients requiring correction of blood volume, electrolyte, and nutritional deficits  
3. Significant facial edema in stabilized patients that interferes with the ability to obtain an accurate clinical evaluation, obscures maxillofacial anatomy or surgical landmarks, and makes the surgical procedure itself more difficult  
4. Increased intracranial pressure  $(>15\mathrm{mmHg})$  in patients with concomitant head injuries

# Anatomy

The facial skeleton receives support and stability from a series of transverse and vertical facial buttresses. Facial buttresses represent areas of thick bone that support the surrounding thinner facial bones, sustain masticatory

forces, and protect vital structures. Restoration of facial width, height, and projection is achieved by reducing and reconstructing the facial buttresses.

# Transverse (Horizontal) Facial Buttresses

1. Superior transverse facial buttress (frontal bar): Orbital plate of the frontal bone and the cribriform plate of the ethmoid  
2. Middle transverse facial buttress: Temporal bone, zygomatic arch, infraorbital rim and orbital floor, frontal process of the maxilla, and nasal bones. Crosses the zygomaticotemporal, zygomaticomaxillary, and nasofrontal sutures  
3. Inferior transverse facial buttress: Hard palate and maxillary alveolus  
4. Superior transverse mandibular buttress: Inferior alveolar ridge of the mandible  
5. Inferior transverse mandibular buttress: Inferior border of the mandible from angle to angle

# Vertical Facial Buttresses

1. Central nasoethmoidal buttress: Ethmoid and vomer bones  
2. Nasomaxillary buttresses: Frontal process of maxilla, nasal bones, nasion and medial walls of maxillary sinuses, and orbits  
3. Zygomaticomaxillary buttress: Posterior maxillary molars vertically through zygomaticomaxillary sutures, zygomatic bodies, and lateral orbital walls into the frontal bones  
4. Pterygomaxillary buttresses: Pterygoid processes of sphenoid bone and posterolateral and posteromedial walls of maxillary sinuses  
5. Posterior mandibular buttress: Ascending ramus and condyle

Figure 23.1 shows horizontal and vertical facial buttresses.

ethmoidal (NOE) complex: often divided into two components, the interorbital space and the medial orbital wall

a. Interorbital space: two ethmoidal labyrinths, superior and middle turbinates, and perpendicular plate of ethmoid  
b. Medial orbital wall: anteriorly—lacrimal bone, lacrimal apparatus, and lamina papyracea; posteriorly—body of sphenoid and medial canthal tendon (MCT)  
c. Signs of NOE fractures include a lack of skeletal support on palpation of the nose, a wide and depressed nasal radix (flat nose), an upturned nasal tip, lacrimal dysfunction, a swollen medial canthal area, traumatic telecanthus, a shortened palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, ocular dystopia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, and a positive eyelid traction test.

Medial canthal tendon (MCT): The MCT is formed from fibrous bands that originate from the tarsal plates of the upper and lower lids and insert at the frontal process of the maxilla (anterior limb) and at the posterior and superior aspect of the lacrimal bone (posterior limb). The segment of bone that the MCT attaches to is often called the central fragment.

Markowitz NOE classification system: Based on the fracture patterns of the central fragment and associated MCT attachment,

Markowitz Type I: A large central fragment of bone without avulsion of the MCT

Markowitz Type II: Comminution of the central fragment without avulsion of the MCT

Markowitz Type III: Comminution of the central fragment with avulsion of the MCT

# Panfacial Fracture and NOE Reduction Technique

1. The patient is positioned supine on the operating room table, the cervical spine (if involved) is stabilized, and the airway are secured.  
2. Corneal shields are lined with LacriLube ointment and placed over the corneas.  
3. The patient's posterior oropharynx is suctioned, and a moistened Ray-Tec gauze is placed within the posterior oropharynx to serve as a throat pack.  
4. The patient's oral cavity is cleaned with chlorohexidine gluconate  $0.12\%$  mouth rinse and a toothbrush. Care is taken to scrub the existing dentition, gingiva, and tongue thoroughly.  
5. The patient is prepped and draped to allow for visualization of all involved structures and normal adjacent anatomy.  
6. All planned incision sites are marked and subsequently injected with local anesthesia containing a vasoconstrictor.  
7. Avulsive and contaminated soft tissue injuries are irrigated and debrided to remove all foreign bodies and debris, often with pulsatile lavage. Soft tissue injuries are assessed for use as possible areas of surgical access.  
8. Maxillary and mandibular arch bars are placed in order to re-establish the patient's pre-trauma occlusion and to serve as a stable base for the repair of mandibular and facial bone fractures.  
9. If mandibular fractures are present, attention is first turned toward the reduction of the mandibular fractures based on the patient's occlusion and known anatomical landmarks. Mandibular fractures are exposed using the standard intraoral or extraoral incisions,

reduced, and internally fixated (see Figure 23.4 in Case Report 23.1). In cases with bilateral subcondylar fractures, at least one condyle is opened, reduced, and rigidly fixated in order to establish proper vertical height (see Figure 23.5 in Case Report 23.1).  
10. Once the mandible is repaired, attention is directed toward midface fractures.  
11. All remaining facial fractures are exposed through a combination of approaches. Existing lacerations can be utilized as well. Specific techniques are discussed in detail in preceding chapters.  
12. NOE fractures are reduced and fixated by reconstructing the nasomaxillary vertical facial buttresses and the superior and middle transverse facial buttresses. Often, calvarian and columellar strut grafting and concomitant MCT resuspension is required.  
13. Markowitz type I and mild type II fractures are repaired with repositioning of the central segment with bone plates. Markowitz III and grossly comminuted type II fractures are repaired with a combination of bone plates and transnasal wiring in order to reposition the displaced or avulsed MCT.  
14. The avulsed MCT or small bone segment containing the MCT (central fragment) is identified. For unilateral Markowitz type II/III fractures, a 28- or 30-gauge wire (with or without a barb) is used to pass twice through the MCT or central fragment. The wire is passed through the nasal cavity posterior and superior to the lacrimal bone with either a bone awl or a spinal needle. A small fixation plate (anchor plate) is secured to the contralateral side within solid bone along the medial orbital wall or reconstructed nasal bridge. The wire is secured to the anchor plate to restore the intercanthal distance. For bilateral Markowitz type II/III fractures, transnasal wiring of the bilateral MCT or central fragment is performed and secured to the anchor plate to correct the intercanthal distance. In either situation, a slight overcorrection is performed.  
15. After reduction and fixation of all facial fractures, maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) is released and the occlusion is checked to ensure adequate stability. If the occlusion is non-ideal, the patient is placed back into MMF, the facial fractures are re-evaluated, and adjustments are made.  
16. All incisions are irrigated with copious normal saline and closed. Large, avulsive tissue injuries may require debridement and closure with either local or regional flap elevation.  
17. At the completion of the procedure, the patient's oropharynx is suctioned, the throat pack is removed, and MMF is typically reapplied with either elastics or stainless steel wires.  
18. The corneal shields are removed, and the eyes are flushed with balanced salt solution. All blood and

prep are removed from the patient's skin with a wet and a dry lap.

19. Steri-strips and pressure dressings are applied. If indicated, a rigid c-collar is placed.

# Postoperative Management

1. Multidisciplinary management is necessary during the immediate postoperative period. This includes coordination with any and all consult teams (i.e., trauma, oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, hospitalist, nutritionist, physical therapy, and occupational therapy).  
2. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the face with 3D reconstruction should be obtained immediately postoperatively to assess for proper fracture reduction and fixation. Importance should be paid to 2D views (axial, coronal, and sagittal) in particular because they may show levels of detail that are unavailable in 3D images. In cases involving the frontal sinus, additional CT scans of the head and face should be obtained at periods of 3-6 months postoperatively for the first year and then yearly for the next 5 years to ensure proper pneumatization of the sinuses, to rule out mucocele formation, and to assess for proper stability of the fracture segments.  
3. A vision exam is necessary immediately upon awakening in the operating room (if applicable) and daily thereafter as indicated by ophthalmology.  
4. Immediate postoperative medications include analgesics, decongestants, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Triple-antibiotic ointment may be applied liberally to all skin wounds, and oral disinfectant mouth rinses such as  $0.12\%$  chlorohexidine gluconate (Peridex) may be used.  
5. If drains have been placed, they are removed when output is less than  $20 - 30\mathrm{mL}$  in a 24-hour period.  
6. In cases where the nasal bones are involved, hemostatic packings placed perioperatively are removed 24-48 hours postoperatively. Doyle splints are removed in 7 days. External nasal splints are left in place for 1-2 weeks postoperatively.  
7. Ice packs are beneficial for the first 24-48 hours postoperatively to minimize edema.  
8. Nonresorbable sutures are removed from the skin in 5-7 days. Staples are removed in 10-14 days. Patients are advised to avoid sun exposure and to apply sunscreen and/or Kelo-Cote ointment to the wounds for a period of 6 months.  
9. Sinus precautions are necessary for a minimum of 3 weeks to avoid possible periorbital subcutaneous emphysema and/or oroantral fistula formation. This requires that the patient not perform nose blowing and that they sneeze with their mouths open to

decrease sinus pressure. Postoperative decongestants, oxymetazoline nasal spray, and nasal saline sprays are taken as needed to minimize congestion.

10. In cases where the patient is placed into MMF, the duration of MMF is highly variable and dependent on several factors, including the degree and type of fractures involved, the type of fixation applied, the age of the patient, and the stability of the patient's occlusion. Arch bars are cleaned daily with disinfectant mouth rinses utilizing a soft toothbrush, with care made to avoid the intraoral incisions. Wax can be applied to the wires to minimize trauma to the labial mucosa.  
11. In cases where MMF is utilized, the patient is kept on tube feeding immediately postoperatively until the patient has stabilized and is able to tolerate full liquids. At that time, the patient is maintained on a full liquid diet until the MMF has been released. After MMF is released, and in cases not requiring MMF, patients are limited to a soft, non-chew diet for a minimum of 6 weeks to minimize masticatory forces on the healing facial bones.  
12. In cases involving mandible fractures, physiotherapy is utilized to prevent and/or address postoperative trismus and ankylosis of the condyles. The goal should be made to achieve a maximal incisal opening of  $40\mathrm{mm}$  within 4 weeks postoperatively.

# Complications

Complications are specific to the bones and structures involved as panfacial and NOE-type fractures involve numerous facial regions.

# Early Complications

1. Decrease in posterior facial height: Occurs with significant continuity defects to the vertical buttresses of the face and with unreduced bilateral mandibular condyle fractures (typically presents as an anterior open bite). Treatment involves osteotomizing the fractures and/or orthognathic surgery.  
2. Increase in facial width: Often results from nonreduced or poorly reduced palatal fractures. Also occurs when combined mandibular symphysis fractures and bilateral condylar neck fractures are not adequately reduced or fixated. Results from a tendency of the midface and mandible to splay open with or without concomitant malocclusion, when anatomical reduction is not achieved. Treatment involves osteotomizing the fractures and/or orthognathic surgery.  
3. Decrease in anterior-posterior facial projection: Can occur with any fracture that increases the facial width and NOE fractures. Treatment involves osteotomizing the fractures and/or orthognathic surgery.

4. Traumatic telecanthus: Normal intercanthal distance in males is  $33 - 34\mathrm{mm}$ , in females  $32 - 33\mathrm{mm}$ , or an interpupillary distance of  $60 - 62\mathrm{mm}$ . Traumatic telecanthus should be repaired early with transnasal wiring or late with canthotomy and canthopexy.  
5. Infections and brain abscess  
6. Hydrocephalus  
7. Meningitis  
8. Neurologic deficits, including motor and sensory (anesthesia and paresthesia) deficits  
9. Nasal obstruction and/or deformities  
0. CSF leak

# Key Points

1. Facial trauma repair is typically performed from a bottom-top (beginning with the mandible) and outside-inside sequencing (ZMC fractures first and then working medially toward the NOE fractures). Rigid reconstruction of the mandible first will allow for the re-establishment of the width, height, and projection of the midface once MMF is applied. In instances with gross comminution to the maxilla/ midface, numerous avulsed or missing teeth and/or with displaced palatal fractures, an occlusal splint (see Figure 23.23 in Case Report 23.2) may be warranted to aid in the establishment of MMF. In cases involving significant impaction of the maxilla, Rowe disimpaction forceps or maxillary osteotomies

(see Figure 23.21 in Case Report 23.2) may be necessary to establish MMF for facial reconstruction. Working from outside-inside will allow for the reestablishment of the width of the midface prior to reconstructing midline structures such as orbital, frontal sinus, and NOE fractures.

2. Often, cervical spine stabilization is required. Cervical spine stabilization involves leaving the patient within a c-collar, stabilization with a three-pronged Mayfield head clamp, or sandbags placed lateral to the neck (least preferred method). Regardless of the technique, cervical spine mobilization should be minimal.  
3. Important anatomical landmarks include knowledge of the correct horizontal and vertical buttresses of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton.  
4. Panfacial trauma is often associated with severe concomitant systemic injuries, and therefore necessitates a multidisciplinary team approach to management.  
5. Panfacial fractures can result in widening of the facial complex with concomitant loss of facial projection. Emphasis must be placed on anatomical reduction of the bones and restoration of the maxillomandibular arch form.  
6. With sagittal palatal fractures, or in situations with a mandibular symphysis fracture associated with bilateral condylar neck fractures where anatomical reduction is not achieved, there is a tendency for the midface and mandible to splay open with possible concomitant malocclusion (see Case Report 17.7 in the Mandibular Trauma chapter).  
7. Traumatic telecanthus with an intercanthal distance of greater than  $40\mathrm{mm}$  is nearly pathognomonic of an NOE fracture. Traumatic telecanthus is due to disruption of the MCT or the central fragment of bone that serves as an attachment for the MCT.  
8. Transnasal wiring is necessary with displaced NOE fractures that involve central fragments too small to plate

(some Markowitz type II fractures) and with grossly comminuted central fragments with complete avulsion of the insertion of the MCT (Markowitz type III).

9. Goals of NOE repair include anatomical reduction of all fractures, correcting traumatic telecanthus, obtaining a midline position of the nasal septum, reconstruction of dorsal nasal deformities (calvarian strut grafts and columnar strut grafts), anatomical positioning of the lower lateral cartilages, and the correction of enophthalmos, ocular dystopia, and lacrimal dysfunction.  
10. Lateral midface width and projection are dependent on the anatomical repositioning of the ZMC, with the reduction of the zygomaticosphenoid suture being of utmost importance.

# Case Reports

Case Report 23.1. Motor vehicle accident. Panfacial fracture with bilateral condyle fractures. A 40-year-old male reports to the emergency department after a high-speed all-terrain vehicle accident. On arrival, a cricothyrotomy was emergently performed due to upper airway obstruction. Once the patient was stabilized, a CT scan was obtained that demonstrated panfacial fractures involving all facial bones with the exception of the frontal bone. Fractures included an NOE-type I fracture, a Le Fort II fracture, bilateral zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures, bilateral infraorbital rim and orbital floor fractures, a midline palatal fracture, bilateral subcondylar fractures, and a symphysis fracture. In addition to his extensive facial injuries, the patient also sustained a cervical spine fracture and was stabilized in a c-collar. With the airway and cervical spine secured, the patient was taken to the operating room, and the urgent cricothyrotomy was converted to an open tracheotomy. The facial fractures were reduced and fixated utilizing a bottom-top and outside-inside sequence (see Figure 23.2 through 23.14).

Case Report 23.2. Motor vehicle accident. Panfacial fracture with maxillary osteotomies and occlusal splint fabrication. A 21-year-old female involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision where she was ejected from the vehicle. Injuries included a  $5\mathrm{cm}$  scalp laceration,  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  laceration along right medial canthus, Le Fort II fracture, Le Fort III fracture, comminuted nasal fractures,

and a right orbital floor fracture. Physical examination revealed significant periorbital edema, malocclusion as evidence of an anterior open bite and widening of the radix of the nasal bridge. The patient was taken to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation of facial fractures 1 week after injury to allow for partial resolution of significant facial edema (see Figure 23.15 through 23.28).

Case Report 23.3. Complication. Traumatic telecanthus, dystopia, and poor cosmetic result. A 20-year-old male involved in a motor vehicle collision sustaining multiple injuries including sacral fracture, foot fractures, subdural hematoma, and multiple facial fractures. The facial fractures included mandibular symphysis fracture, frontal sinus fracture, left ZMC fracture, left zygomatic arch fracture, Le Fort I fracture, palatal fracture, and nasal fracture. The patient was taken to the operating room for tracheotomy and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)

of facial fractures. The patient underwent an uncomplicated postoperative recovery. One year after initial ORIF, the patient presented to the clinic complaining of a depression of the left forehead leading to poor cosmesis. At that visit, vertical orbital dystopia and traumatic telecanthus were noted. The patient was definitively treated with replacement of the depressed mesh to the left frontal bone, correcting vertical orbital dystopia with re-establishment of pre-traumatic orbital volume and transnasal wiring to correct traumatic telecanthus (see Figure 23.29 through 23.36).
