# Free Vascularized Fibula Graft Harvest

Earl Peter Park and Robert M. Laughlin

Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA

The harvest of a free vascularized fibula for the reconstruction of composite hard and soft tissue maxillofacial defects.

# Indications

1. Reconstruction of surgical defects following oncologic ablation, traumatic defects, and congenital anomalies requiring cutaneous and/or osseous vascularized tissue.  
2. Segmental continuity defects of the maxilla and mandible greater than  $5\mathrm{cm}$ . A long segment of bone up to approximately  $25\mathrm{cm}$  is available for harvest. The skin paddle is dependable if care is taken to preserve the fasciocutaneous perforators. Innervation of the flap is possible. The flap has adequate bone stock, which can be contoured and accept endosseous dental implants.

# Contraindications

1. Poor performance score, medical comorbidities incompatible with extended operative procedures  
2. Hypercoagulable states  
3. Relative contraindications:

A. Vasculitis  
B. Connective tissue disorders  
C. Peripheral vascular disease  
D. Venous insufficiency  
E. Congenital anomalies of the peroneal artery  
F. Other disorders that may impact coagulation and wound healing

Note: Evaluation of the patient's physiologic status is more important than the chronologic age of the patient in determining the appropriateness of a free tissue transfer procedure.

# Preoperative Studies

1. Bilateral lower extremity angiogram or magnetic resonance angiography. The arteriogram should demonstrate normal three-vessel runoff of the right

and left popliteal artery with normal patency of the anterior, posterior, and peroneal vessels bilaterally.

2. Palpation of the dorsalis pedis (anterior tibial artery) and posterior tibial pulses.

# Flap Anatomy

1. Dominant-peroneal artery

Length:  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$  (2-4cm)  
Diameter:  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  (1-2.5 mm)

2. Minor-periosteal and muscular branches

Length:  $1.2\mathrm{mm}$ $(0.8 - 1.7\mathrm{mm})$

Diameter:  $1.0\mathrm{mm}$ $(0.8 - 1.7\mathrm{mm})$

Typically, 4-8 cutaneous arteries arise from the peroneal artery. These vessels are septal or septo-muscular cutaneous perforators coursing through the posterior cranial (lateral) septum.

# Surgical Anatomy

The lower leg can be viewed as four compartments:

Lateral compartment: Bordered by the posterior crural septum and the anterior crural septum and contains the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. The neurovascular anatomy includes the superficial peroneal nerve.

Anterior compartment: Bordered by the anterior crural septum and the interosseous membrane and contains the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, tibialis anterior, and peroneus tertius. The anterior tibial vasculature and deep peroneal nerve lie on the superficial aspect of the interosseous membrane in this compartment.

Deep posterior compartment: Bordered by the interosseous membrane and the intermuscular membrane between flexor hallucis longus and soleus muscles (aka transverse intermuscular septum). The muscles include the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), flexor digitorum longus, tibialis posterior, and popliteus. The peroneal vessels lie deep to the interosseous membrane and is sandwiched

between the chevron-shaped tibialis posterior and FHL. The single artery and two interconnected venae comitantes course along the medial aspect of the fibula. The posterior tibial vessels and tibial nerve are located medial to the peroneal vasculature; the surgeon differentiates these confidently before harvesting the flap.

Superficial posterior compartment: Bordered by the transverse intermuscular septum and the posterior cranial septum; it contains the gastrocnemius, the soleus, and plantaris. Neurovascular anatomy includes the sural nerve and lesser saphenous vein, which are encountered when dissecting the posterior cutaneous aspect of the flap.

# Preoperative Preparation

1. A bump may be placed under the ipsilateral hip to aid in access to the lateral surface of the lower extremity. Specifically, this encourages the bent leg to lie medially, which is especially important for obese patients.  
2. A heel bump (i.e., a 5 lb sandbag, 1 L IV fluid bag, surgical bed accessory) is placed on the operating room table that allows the lower extremity to maintain  $90^{\circ}$  of flexion at the knee; larger legs should be placed in a slightly more oblique angle.  
3. Doppler flow meter.  
4. Tourniquet (recommended, but optional).  
5. A second set of instruments for the harvest team.

# Surgical Procedure

1. A normal preoperative arteriogram of bilateral lower extremities demonstrating three-vessel runoff of the right and left popliteal artery with normal patency of all distal vessels.  
2. The patient is placed in a supine position. The knee is flexed to  $90^{\circ}$ , and the hip is internally rotated with the use of a hip bump. The heel is then placed on a gel bumper, which is secured to the table. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A sterile tourniquet is applied.  
3. Anatomic landmarks are palpated and marked (see Figure 72.1) to include the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus of the ankle. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpated and marked with Doppler accordingly (see Figure 72.2). With a surgical pen, a mark is placed  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the head of the fibula and  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the lateral malleolus. This allows the proximal and distal  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  of the fibula and its ligamentous attachments to be preserved. A line is drawn along the posterior crural septum connecting the two marks.  
4. If a skin flap is to be harvested in conjunction with the fibula, the flap should be designed along the posterior septal crural. A Doppler will allow for the identification of septocutaneous perforating vessels. Typically, the skin

flap is designed in the distal one-third of the flap where perforators are more likely to occur (see Figure 72.3).

5. The extremity is exsanguinated using large esmark compression bandage, and the tourniquet inflated to  $300\mathrm{mmHg}$ . Time of inflation must be recorded. Inflation time must be keep under 100-120 minutes to avoid possible ischemic events.  
6. The anterior skin incision is made to the depth of the superficial fascia along the length of the incision, then dissection proceeds posteriorly (see Figure 72.4). The transition from suprafacial to subfascial plane occurs just behind the peroneus longus tendon. A subfascial dissection proceeds posteriorly to elevate the skin island and expose the posterior crural septum (see Figure 72.5). Septocutaneous perforators are seen emerging along the posterior crural septum (see Figure 72.6). If no septocutaneous perforators are seen, a muscle cuff is included to capture any musculocutaneous perforators. The superficial peroneal nerve should be identified and preserved.  
7. The posterior skin incision is made similarly to the depth of the superficial fascia, then dissection proceeds anteriorly. The transition from suprafacial to subfascial plane occurs just in front of the sural nervelesser saphenous vein. A subfascial dissection occurs on top of the soleus muscle to the posterior crural septum. Note, this step can be also performed after step 12 if required skin paddle size is uncertain.  
8. The lateral compartment dissection begins: the peroneus longus muscle is elevated from the lateral fibula and the muscle is retracted anteriorly and medially (see Figure 72.7). A  $5\mathrm{mm}$  cuff of muscle is maintained to protect and preserve the underlying periosteum, while allowing access to the fibular bone. Dissection of the lateral compartment ends at the anterior crural septum, which demarcates the anterior compartment of the leg.  
9. A subperiosteal dissection is performed at the proposed proximal and distal osteotomy sites. Protecting the medial aspect of the fibula and peroneal vessels, the proximal and distal osteotomies are performed with a reciprocating or oscillating saw, ensuring that a minimum of  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  of fibula remains distal to the fibular head and proximal to the lateral malleolus (see Figures 72.8 and 72.9).  
10. The anterior compartment dissection begins: The anterior crural septum is divided to expose the extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis muscles. Maintaining a  $5\mathrm{mm}$  cuff of muscle around the fibula, the extensor muscles are elevated to expose the interosseous membrane medially (see Figures 72.10 and 72.11). The anterior tibialis vessels and the deep peroneal nerve are identified anteriomedial to the fibula in the anterior compartment and retracted medially.  
11. Bone clamps are employed distally and proximally to lateralize the fibula and expose the interosseous

membrane. The membrane is incised  $5\mathrm{mm}$  away from the fibula along its entire length. Care must be taken when incising the interosseous membrane due to the proximity of the peroneal vasculature on the deep aspect of the membrane.

12. A further lateral retraction allows visualization of the peroneal vessels distally, which are double ligated (see Figure 72.12). To expediate pedicle dissection, the surgeon may now choose to perform an additional osteotomy and discard the proximal bone, which will not be used for fibula harvest (see Figure 72.13). The posterior tibialis muscle is divided distal to proximal to allow the pedicle to be visualized the length of the fibula. At this point, the only component holding the fibula into the donor site is the FHL.  
13. The flap is grasp in the surgeon's hand with the pedicle within the surgeon's fingers for protection. The FHL is divided from distal to proximal, carefully leaving a safe muscle cuff to protect the pedicle. FHL is also left intact at the donor site so ensure optimal great toe flexion postoperatively. Often 2-3 large soleus vessels are discovered as the operator moves proximally, and these large caliber vessels must be ligated carefully as injury to these vessels will cause appreciable bleeding.  
14. The peroneal vessels are differentiated from the posterior tibial vessels at the proximal take off. This step ensures maximal pedicle length. The operator is always mindful: the pedicle can be easily shortened, but lengthening requires significant intervention and increased risk.  
15. The tourniquet is let down and time recorded. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses are verified by palpation or Doppler ultrasound. The flow through the peroneal vessels is also verified as is the flow in the skin paddle. The signal strength of the skin paddle at the leg should mirror the signal after microvascular anastomosis (see Figure 72.14). The distal peroneal vascular bundle is then double ligated and divided. The fibula and skin paddle are passed to the reconstruction team at the recipient site (see Figure 72.15).  
16. After adequate hemostasis is achieved, the muscle layers are re-approximated with 2-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures (see Figure 72.16). Specifically, the FHL is approximated to the interosseous membrane, then the peroneus muscles are attached to the soleus. Two suction drains are placed, one deep to the FHL and one deep to the peroneus muscles. The dermal layer is reapproximated and the skin is closed (see Figure 72.17). In the event that the skin flap is greater than  $4\mathrm{cm}$ , a split-thickness skin graft will be required with overlying wound VAC for 5 days.  
17. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses are palpated, Dopplered, and marked. The foot is checked for warmth and adequate capillary refill.

18. Bacitracin is applied to the surgical site, and a Telfa dressing is placed over the incisions. The lower leg is circumferentially wrapped with cotton batting and an Ace bandage. The leg is then elevated and placed in a controlled, ankle, motion (CAM) boot for 4 weeks.

Figure 72.1. Anatomic landmarks are palpated and marked to include the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus of the ankle. Marks are placed  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the head of the fibula and  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the lateral malleolus. This allows the proximal and distal  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  of the fibula and its ligamentous attachments to be preserved. A line is then drawn along the posterior crural septum connecting the two marks.

Figure 72.3. For cases requiring a skin paddle, markings for skin paddle harvest begin with identification of the posterior aspect of the fibula (demarcated with dots); this broadly represents the posterior crural septum. The Doppler is used to identify the perforators along the posterior crural septum. The skin paddle is centered on the perforators and a  $10 \times 7 \mathrm{~cm}$  soft tissue component is drawn. Finally, a vertical incision along the leg from proximal to the skin paddle is drawn approximately  $1 - 2 \mathrm{~cm}$  anterior to the posterior crura; this allows for skin paddle adjustment in case: (a) Doppler did not correctly identify the exact location of perforators, or (b) ablative surgeon notes that skin paddle must be significantly larger than previously planned.

Figure 72.7. The peroneus longus muscle is elevated and retracted anteriorly and medially. This provided the approach through the lateral compartment.

Figure 72.10. Anterior compartment dissection involves cutting the extensor muscle group away from fibula, while maintaining the  $5\mathrm{mm}$  cuff of muscular tissue on the bone. In the above figure, the extensor muscles are being held back by the operator's thumb. Slight posterior traction with bone clamps creates tension on the muscles to facilitate separation in this tight space.

Figure 72.11. After extensor muscles are separated from fibula, the interosseous membrane comes into view. An assistant can use army navy retractors to expose the membrane; however, a single operator can use a blunt ended self-retraining Beckman retractor. The interosseous membrane can be incised with the understanding that the peroneal pedicle is protected by the posterior tibial muscle underneath.

Figure 72.13. To improve efficiency and save time, the proximal, non-useful bone segment can be removed. Specifically, subperiosteal dissection is performed and a reciprocating saw is used to create an additional osteotomy inferior to the proximal cut. Subperiosteal dissection is carefully performed along the bone segment that will be discarded. The surgeon will identify the peroneal pedicle, as well as the posterior tibial vessels and tibial nerve. In the above figure, only the posterior tibial muscle (held by thumb) and FHL (held by index finger) keep the flap tethered to the donor site. The peroneal vessels are sandwiched between these two muscles.

# Complicati

For complications related to venous and arterial flap insufficiency, please refer to the complication section of Chapter 71. Microvascular Principles.

Complications associated with fibula harvest typically relate to the muscles, nerves, and blood vessels encountered within the harvest site.

Compartment syndrome: Signs include pain out of proportion to clinical situation, deep muscle ache or burning sensation, persistent pain and/or weakness on passive muscle stretch, hypoesthesia or anesthesia of the nerve with the compartment involved, weak or absent pulse, and tenseness of the fascial boundaries of the compartment. Treatment includes fasciotomy with wound exploration. Additional surgery to address necrotic tissues and skin defects may be necessary.

Ankle instability: Important to maintain  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the lateral malleolus. This allows the ligamentous attachments to the fibula to be preserved.

Nerve damage to the peroneal nerves and muscle branches: Results in weakness and limitation of the range of motion of the foot.

Neurosensory damage with resultant numbness on the dorsal aspect of the foot

Chronic muscle weakness

Infection

Chronic pain of lower extremity

# Key Points

1. Flap harvest requires meticulous dissection of the vascular pedicle. Magnification and an experienced, microvascular-trained assistant surgeon are ideal.  
2. Preoperative verification of collateral blood flow is required prior to flap harvest. Potential necrosis with loss of lower extremity function may occur with no collateral circulation.  
3. Perioperative antibiotic coverage is continued for 72 hours postoperatively. Sterile technique is used to change any dressings associated with the wound. Lower extremity infections can cause significant morbidity and disability.

Case Report 72.1. Ameloblastoma resection with primary repair with fibular free flap reconstruction with simultaneous dental implant placement. A 52-year-old female experienced dental shifting and subtle malocclusion within the left mandibular premolar area. Imaging demonstrated a multilocular radiolucency of the parasymphysis. Incisional biopsy yielded a diagnosis of solid ameloblastoma. Virtual surgical planning (VSP) for the mandibular resection and fibula free flap reconstruction was performed preoperatively, including a plan for immediate dental implant placement and patient-specific titanium plate. Intraoperatively, resection occurred transorally with  $1.0\mathrm{cm}$  hard tissue margins and preservation of one anatomical barrier around the tumor. The mandibular resection and fibula contour osteotomies were all driven by

Figure 72.20. VSP allows the surgeon and bioengineer team to create a virtual surgical treatment plan. The osteotomies, the fibula contouring and the surgical guides are designed using computer-aided design software (CAD). In this instance, selective laser melting (SLM) technology was used to produce surgical guides, as well as a patient-specific plate.

computer-designed cutting guides. Neck exploration was performed to secure ideal recipient vessels. The submandibular gland was excised to allow for ideal visualization of the facial artery and common facial vein. A second team performed the fibula free flap harvest simultaneously.

Surgical guides serve several key functions. First, they facilitate excellent bone adaptation throughout the reconstruction without having to spend excessive time contouring the osteotomies. Second, the predictive holes (raised holes) allow for drilling into sites that correspond to the patient-specific custom plate. Finally, the guides permit dental implant placement using a fully guided kit; this armamentarium controls the 3D placement of the implants, including implant depth, thus minimizing damage to the pedicle (see Figures 72.20 through 72.30).

![](images/2dd7e2537b4f2be22a0b2c147226d7e9f01e55057e8eed9e38def20e86b54e88.jpg)  
Figure 72.21. Flat drill holes represent locations at which the guide can be fixated to the mandible, while raised drill holes will accept the screws for fixation of the custom plate. It is prudent not to over use predictive holes because inserting and withdrawing screws multiple times may expand the hole, necessitating an "emergency" screw usage. Moreover, wrapping the plate or guides around contours with tabs or extensions, increases surface area and will improve the precision of fit.

![](images/6d58cca198c3406a633ea4cdc109c2a2707f4c67e39f9b5491437c5e2c8d3a3c.jpg)  
Figure 72.22. Dental implant placement can occur within the fibula at the harvest site by using a guide created with implant insertion capability. This allows for precise implant placement in 3D, but also a depth restriction, decreasing the likelihood of a drill inadvertently traumatizing the pedicle.

Figure 72.24. Submandibular gland removal will facilitate dissection and sparing the facial artery as it wraps around the gland superiorly. In addition, gland excision allows for an unencumbered view of the common facial vein, which can be traced to ensure it feeds directly into the internal jugular vein. This increases recipient vessel length and also decreases the concern for excessive edema on the microvascular anastomosis during the postoperative period.

Figure 72.25. Surgical guides allow the fibula to precisely match the virtual surgical plan, the custom plate contour and the recipient bone interface. This decreases the need for excessive bony adjustment during inset and minimizes ischemia time.

Case Report 72.2. Complication-Venous flap congestion. A 78-year-old male was referred to our institution with a nonhealing wound within the right premolar area. This area had a dental extraction and bone graft, which later became an area of implant exfoliation. Biopsy of the area yielded squamous cell carcinoma and subsequent workup revealed bony invasion, which upstaged his pathology to stage 4, cT4aN0M0.

Mandibular resection with fibula reconstruction proceeded without complication, until the first evening, where skin paddle exhibited signs of slight venous congestion. The patient was taken back to the operating room, where a small neck hematoma was washed out and venous coupler was revised. Cook internal Doppler was placed on the venous and arterial anastomosis for

monitoring. The next day, the skin paddle was ecchymotic around the periphery and the venous cook Doppler became positional, and arterial Doppler became more faint. The patient was taken back to the OR for neck exploration, where both arterial and venous anastomoses were revised, as well as injection of tPA to treat microvascular thromboses. Unfortunately, vascular flow through the flap could not be established, thus, the flap was discarded. The patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rhythm and became unstable, thus the neck and oral cavity were packed for several days to decrease salivary leakage and infection of the neck. After the patient became medically optimized, a pectoralis flap was placed to close the oral cavity from the neck and to protect the great vessels (see Figures 72.31 through 72.38).

Figure 72.31. During the first postoperative evening, the skin paddle demonstrated edema and a slight purple color change. Moreover, venous blood emanated from around the periphery of the skin paddle and there was mild neck swelling. All signs supported venous congestion and lack of outflow. Interestingly, arterial internal Doppler was loud and triphasic throughout. The patient was taken back to the OR for microvascular revision of the venous coupler device and a cook internal Doppler was placed on the artery and vein.

Figure 72.32. After the microvascular anastomosis was revised, the periphery of the flap retained its ecchymosis. Progressively throughout postoperative day 2, the venous coupler signal progressively decreased, as did the arterial internal signal. This prompted another neck exploration to analyze the microvascular anastomosis. Multiple attempts to revise the microvascular anastomosis were attempted to no avail.

Figure 72.33. The fibula free flap was completely removed and the wound was packed from the oral cavity. It is critical that saliva and bacteria from the oral cavity is diverted away from the neck wound. Saliva on the neck wound increases the likelihood of injury to the great vessels.

Figure 72.34. The neck is packed and the wound was optimized with daily irrigation and low concentration acetic acid to gently debride the defect. Granulation tissue will begin to form, which should be encouraged, especially over the great vessels.

Figure 72.35. A pectoralis flap is designed to reconstruct the oralcutaneous defect. The pedicle is marked and measured to ensure that the most inferior aspect of the pectoralis skin will reach the most anterior aspect of the oromandibular defect at the incisors.

Figure 72.37. The skin paddle refined the oral mucosa and the pectoralis musculature served to cover the great vessels. The oral mucosa is tenuous after free flap failure, thus horizontal mattress sutures are used to improve wound eversion. Oral breakdown is inevitable, although can be minimized with meticulous attention during this closure.
