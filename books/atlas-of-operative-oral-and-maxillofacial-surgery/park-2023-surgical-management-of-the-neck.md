Neck dissection is the surgical removal of fibrofatty structures within the neck which contain the lymph nodes. The complex cervical lymphovascular system consists of approximately 300 lymph nodes (40% of the body's estimated 800 nodes) and drains the entire head and neck region. Cervical lymph node involvement  $(\mathrm{N}+)$  is the single most important prognostic indicator, resulting in a  $50\%$  decreased overall survival. It is synonymous with regional oncologic spread and is a sign of late stage, specifically stage III or IV.

# Indications

Timely and appropriate removal of at-risk cervical lymphatics serves two critical purposes: to remove disease (macroscopic or microscopic) and to properly diagnose the neck, guiding adjuvant therapies based on histopathologic features. Fundamentally, several options exist regarding management of the neck:

1. Observation involves monitoring through serial physical examination and imaging. This option is undertaken when the probability of metastatic spread falls below a  $20\%$  threshold described by Weiss et al. Patients with T1 lesions are amenable to this plan when their tumors are only superficially invasive (depth of invasion  $< 2\mathrm{mm}$ ), they have no cervical lymph adenopathy (N0), and they have capacity for reliable surveillance.  
2. Neck irradiation is generally undertaken when treatment of the primary lesion is radiation (for example, certain oropharyngeal carcinomas) or when the patient is medically unfit for surgery.  
3. Elective neck dissection is the removal of at-risk nodal basins in a patient without clinically or radiographically evident cervical metastases. The procedure is bilateral when the lesion approaches or crosses midline, for example, tumors of the floor of mouth, palate, base of tongue, pharynx, and larynx.  
4. Therapeutic neck dissection is the removal of at-risk node-bearing tissues in the patient with clinically or radiographically evident neck disease (see Table 58.1).

# Contraindications

1. Oncologic: distant metastasis (M1).  
2. Surgical: unresectable disease includes those tumors that cannot be removed without causing unacceptable morbidity.  
3. Medical: ECOG or Karnofsky performance status precludes curative surgical intervention.

# Neck Dissection Classification

After establishing that neck dissection is indicated, the specific extent of surgery is planned, which corresponds to the classification. The first widely used classification system was presented in 1991 by the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery and was adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. This system was revised in 2002 and clarified in 2008 with respect to boundaries between sublevels. The classification nomenclature is based on four basic procedures:

1. Radical neck dissection is the basic procedure wherein the cervical lymphatics (I-V) are removed along with the SCM, CN IX, and IJV.  
2. Modified radical neck dissection involves preservation of one or more of the non-lymphatic structures (SCM, CN IX, and IJV).  
3. Extended radical neck dissection designates a modification where additional lymph node groups or non-lymphatic structures are removed.  
4. Selective neck dissection involves preservation of one or more cervical lymphatic levels.

In 2011, Ferlito et al. proposed an updated, concise classification system based on three components:

1. Symbol  $ND$  with laterality indicated  
2. Specific lymphatic levels removed (Ia/b, IIa/b, III, IV, Va/b, VI, and VII)  
3. Specific non-lymphatic structures removed ( sternocleidomastoid muscle [SCM]; internal jugular vein

# Selectivity

Over the past three decades, management of the neck has evolved to increase surgical selectivity and decrease morbidity. This concept is based upon a predictable pattern of metastasis for head and neck carcinoma. The landmark article by Shah et al. in 1991 studied 1081 head and neck oncology patients. Specifically, oral cavity tumors demonstrated propensity to levels I, II, and III; oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal carcinomas include levels II, III and IV. Moreover, for oral cavity cancer, levels IV and V were rarely involved. This was a departure from the previous concepts

by Crile and Martin who routinely performed radical neck resections to remove neck contents en bloc.

Levels IIB and IV have received further scrutiny in more recent literature. Level IV has traditionally been resected as an extension of the selective neck resection of I, II, and III. In a 1997 study, Byers et al. discussed the concept of skip metastasis, in which lymphatic metastasis occurs in levels III and IV without affecting the initial node echelons I and II. This study demonstrated skip metastasis rate of  $15.8\%$ . Known as the "extended" supraomohyoid neck dissection, levels I-IV resection was thought to decrease regional recurrence by  $10\%$ . However, a more recent 2019 systematic review reanalyzes previous data, discovering a skip metastasis rate closer to  $0 - 5.5\%$ , a rather rare event. The study's meta-analysis of data from 1970 to 2017 demonstrated  $0 - 11.4\%$  overall involvement

of level IV. They conclude for a cN0 oral cavity tumor, levels I-III is effective surgical treatment.

Level IIB is frequently dissected but carries the risk of postoperative shoulder weakness and dysfunction. Meta-analysis notes a  $6 - 7\%$  incidence of metastasis to level IIB. The data suggests a surgeon may consider avoiding dissection in early stage tumors. However, level IIB should be included for tongue cancer as well as  $\mathbf{N}+$  patients.

# Anatomy

Neck dissection requires detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the entire neck, extending from the mandible to the clavicle and from the midline to the trapezius muscle. Selective neck dissection of levels I, II, and III demands understanding the fascial layers enveloping the neck contents and the maneuvers necessary to "unwrap" the muscles to deliver an intact specimen. Levels and key structures include the following (see Figure 58.1):

# 1. Level I

- Ia (submental): Extends from the mandible superiorly to the hyoid bone inferiorly and is bounded laterally by the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles bilaterally. The submental artery will be encountered and must be preserved if the submental island flap is planned.  
- Ib (submandibular): Bounded by the mandible superiorly to the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle anteroinferiorly, and the stylohyoid muscle posteriorly. The perifacial lymph nodes, facial artery and vein, and submandibular gland are encountered, as well as the marginal mandibular, lingual, and hypoglossal nerves.

# 2. Level II (upper jugular)

- IIa: Includes the tissues bounded by the skull base superiorly, inferiorly by the hyoid bone radiographically and carotid bifurcation surgically, the stylohyoid muscle anteriorly, and posteriorly by the spinal accessory nerve. The jugulodigastric node (i.e., the principal node of Kuttner), the retromandibular vein, hidden in the tail of the parotid gland, is commonly encountered and ligated.  
- IIb ("submuscular recess"): The posterosuperior extension of level IIa and IIb is delineated anteriorly by a vertical line at the level of the spinal accessory nerve and posteriorly by the posterolateral edge of the SCM. The superoinferior boundaries are identical to those of level IIa.

3. Level III (midjugular): Level III is bounded superiorly by the inferior aspect of level II, anteriorly by the sternohyoid muscle, and posterolaterally by the posterolateral edge of the SCM. The inferior edge is demarcated by the omohyoid muscle surgically and cricoid

cartilage radiographically. The jugulo-omohyoid node is contained in level III.

4. Level IV (lower jugular): Extends from the inferior border of level III superiorly to the clavicle inferiorly and from the lateral border of the sternohyoid muscle anteriorly to the posterolateral edge of the SCM. Level IV contains the transverse cervical artery and, in the left neck, the thoracic duct. A smaller accessory thoracic duct may be encountered in the right neck.  
5. Level V (posterior triangle): Extends from the posterior edge of the SCM to the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle, and inferiorly to the clavicle. Level V contains the spinal accessory nerve as it penetrates the SCM, coursing posteroinferiorly to innervate the trapezius muscle on its deep surface.  
6. Level VI (central compartment): Bounded by the hyoid bone superiorly and the suprasternal notch inferiorly, and extending to the carotid sheaths bilaterally, level VI contains the pretracheal (Delphian), prelaryngeal, and paratracheal lymph nodes.  
7. Level VII (superior mediastinal): Extends from the suprasternal notch superiorly to the level of the innominate artery inferiorly and bounded laterally by the carotid sheaths. Although often considered outside the boundaries of the neck, the definition of level VII nodes as an inferior extension of paratracheal lymph nodes into the superior mediastinum persists in contemporary literature and is included here in the interest of completeness.

# Surgical Technique

# Selective Neck Dissection, Levels I-III

1. With the patient in the supine position, a shoulder roll is placed to allow slight neck extension, optimally exposing the anterolateral neck. Using monopolar electrocautery (or a scalpel blade), a transverse incision is made within a natural skin crease from the mastoid process to the midline at the level of the cricoid cartilage. If unilateral neck dissection is planned, the incision must be carried past the midline to allow sufficient exposure of level Ia with retraction of the platysmal flaps.  
2. The incision is carried through skin and subcutaneous tissues using electrocautery until the platysma muscle is exposed along the length of the incision. Skin hooks or Lahey clamps may be used to aid in skin retraction.  
3. The platysma is incised along its length, and subplatysmal flaps are raised superiorly to the inferior of the mandible and inferiorly to just above the clavicle. The platysma is deficient in the midline and posteriorly, and in these areas skin flap elevation is within the subcutaneous plane. Keeping the greater auricular nerve and external jugular vein down on the SCM at this step indicates that elevation is proceeding within the proper plane. Superior traction with skin hooks or finger grip and countertraction with a Kittner or sponge facilitate expeditious subplatysmal flap elevation in a relatively avascular plane.  
4. The neck dissection may proceed in an anterior-to-posterior direction, starting from level Ia with elevation of the fibrofatty node-bearing contents off of the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles bilaterally, the mandibular symphysis superiorly, and the mylohyoid muscle on the deep aspect. The submental artery will be encountered and should be ligated just posterior and deep to the anterior digastric-mandible junction. The specimen is brought inferiorly to the level of the hyoid bone, then slightly posterior as the strap muscles are encountered to elevate the fascia and nodal tissue from the surface of the sternohyoid muscle.  
5. The specimen is then freed sharply from the underlying musculature using monopolar electrocautery and carried posteriorly, crossing the digastric tendon, until the posterior edge of the mylohyoid muscle is encountered in level Ib. The inferior border of the mandible is cleaned superiorly, taking care to control vessels in this area with vascular clips or suture ligatures.  
6. Attention is then directed to the submandibular gland, which may be appreciated as a bulge just beneath the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia. The fascia is incised at the inferior aspect of the gland, approximately  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the

mandible, and elevated. This deep cervical fascia forms a flap and is developed safely using a needle point microbipolar electrocautery. The exposed tissue deep to this flap is the submandibular gland and the Ib lymph node contents. Care is taken to protect the marginal mandibular nerve from injury, which may be visualized coursing through the fascia.

7. The facial artery and vein are dissected, ligated, and divided. Further protection to the facial nerve may be afforded by keeping the superior ties on the facial vein long and retracting superiorly. This tie will keep the deep cervical fascia flap and marginal mandibular nerve retracted superiorly, which is now separated from the Ib tissue.  
8. The posterior edge of the mylohyoid muscle is retracted superomedially using an army-navy retractor, which is applied in a sweeping motion to expose the lingual nerve, submandibular duct, and hypoglossal nerve. An Allis clamp may be used to retract the submandibular gland and remaining specimen inferoposteriorly.  
9. The submandibular ganglion at the inferior aspect of the lingual nerve is ligated. Then, the submandibular duct is then ligated and divided, as are numerous Ranine veins. Failure to adequately control venous bleeding in this region increases the risk of injury to the underlying hypoglossal nerve and deep aspect of the facial artery. A small arterial branch to the mylohyoid muscle will likewise be encountered here and is controlled with vascular clips.  
10. The deep aspect of the facial artery is dissected free from the submandibular gland and ligated. If microvascular reconstruction is anticipated, careful dissection with bipolar electrocautery and clips is advised to avoid thermal injury to the vessels with subsequent increased risk of thrombosis. An additional  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  of length may be gained by freeing the artery from the medial aspect of the gland until the first major branch point is encountered. This maneuver is especially important when upper or midface reconstruction is planned, and it may avoid the need for vein grafts.  
11. Level Ib dissection is completed by retracting the specimen posteroinferiorly and cleaning the posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscles inferiorly and the mandible superiorly. Care must be taken to avoid dissection on the deep aspect of the muscles, which exposes the hypoglossal nerve and great vessels to injury. Dissection is then carried posteriorly across the tail of the parotid gland, where the retromandibular vein is ligated and divided. Excision of the parotid tail leads to significantly increased postoperative edema; therefore, its judicious removal is advised when it is clinically uninvolved with disease.  
12. Attention is then directed to the midline, where dissection proceeds from along a broad front, from level

Ia superiorly to the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle inferiorly. Fascia is bluntly undermined with tonsil hemostats and divided with electrocautery. The superior laryngeal and superior thyroid arteries and the common facial vein will be encountered and are preserved. The carotid artery will come into view with further reflection of the specimen in a posterior direction. The internal jugular vein is identified at this point and may be cleaned; however, transitioning from a posterior to anterior approach is an option, especially when the internal jugular vein isn't easily localized.

13. At this point, attention is directed to the medial edge of the SCM. The external jugular vein is ligated and divided, again protecting length in anticipation of immediate or future microvascular anastomosis. Fascia is reflected off the muscle, starting laterally and proceeding medially. Numerous muscular vessels are controlled with vascular clips or cautery. Past-pointing into the fascia flap will thin or weaken the flap, or risk injury to the great vessels on the deep surface.  
14. At the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds of the SCM, the spinal accessory nerve is identified by bluntly dissecting in a superomedial to posteroinferior direction and mobilized in anticipation of IIb dissection. Two other landmarks to indicate spinal accessory proximity includes the SCM tendon and the occipital artery (the guardian of XI). The nerve is cleaned of overlying specimen in a superomedial direction until the internal jugular vein is encountered. The upper edge of the vein may be cleaned of specimen at this point to prevent subsequent injury.  
15. Level IIb is then cleaned of nodal contents by placing army-navy or appendiceal retractors at  $90^{\circ}$  angles, retracting the SCM laterally and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle superiorly. It is recommended to start the dissection laterally, incising until the fascia overlying the splenius capitus muscle is encountered deeply and carry the specimen inferomedially. A branch of the occipital artery, when inadvertently divided here, may lead to troublesome bleeding. Care must be taken to identify and protect the internal jugular vein and spinal accessory nerve medially. Following sufficient mobilization of the nerve, the IIb nodal contents are then brought under the nerve in continuity with the remainder of the specimen.  
16. With the spinal accessory nerve protected superiorly, monopolar cautery is used to define the posterior extent of the dissection at the posterolateral edge of the SCM. Outward retraction of the specimen with Allis clamps and posterolateral retraction of the muscle with army-navy retractors aid in visualization as the deep surface is cleaned. The cervical plexus rootlets are encountered deeply and define the "floor of

neck." The rootlets serve as an important early landmark, as maintaining the plane of dissection superficial to the nerves will ensure integrity of the scalene fascia and minimize risk of injury to the underlying brachial plexus and phrenic nerve as dissection proceeds anteriorly.

17. With the omohyoid muscle retracted inferiorly, the inferior edge of the specimen is defined, taking care to avoid injury to the transverse cervical artery and thoracic duct lying inferiorly in level IV. A high-riding subclavian vein may also be encountered, which when inadvertently injured presents significant risk of cervical as well as intrathoracic hemorrhage. If level IV dissection is performed, the omohyoid muscle may be divided to aid in exposure without significant functional deficits.  
18. The entire specimen is then carried medially along a broad front, tracing the cervical plexus rootlets anteriorly to the internal jugular vein and the deep jugular chain lymph nodes. With the specimen retracted laterally, the vein is retracted medially with a moistened laparotomy sponge. Kittner dissecting sponges are useful at this step to bluntly dissect the vein from the carotid sheath fascia. Branching tributary veins are controlled with silk ligatures. The shrewd ablative surgeon will leave several millimeters of stump attached to the jugular vein in case of the need for future flap anastomosis. Dissection is carried out carefully as the specimen is essentially "unwrapped" from the vein at this step.  
19. The specimen is delivered intact and oriented for permanent section. Prior discussion with the pathologist can optimize communication regarding their preference to send the specimen divided into neck levels or to send the specimen en bloc.  
20. Closure is achieved in layers over closed suction drains, 19-french round Jackson Pratt.

# Radical Neck Dissection

1. The steps that differ from the selective neck dissection steps described in this chapter are outlined here, namely the sacrifice of the internal jugular vein, spinal accessory nerve, and SCM.  
2. The incision to expose levels I through IV may be the same as for the selective neck dissection; however, exposure to level V is limited. Visualization is improved by dropping a Schobinger or Lahey releasing incision inferolaterally toward the clavicle.  
3. Superior and inferior skin flaps are elevated as in steps 2-3 of the "Selective Neck Dissection, Levels I-III" section. The external jugular vein and greater auricular nerves are divided superiorly and inferiorly in anticipation of SCM resection.  
4. Levels I and II are dissected as in steps 4-15 in the "Selective Neck Dissection, Levels I-III" section.

5. The anterior aspect of the trapezius muscle is then identified, and the SCM is divided approximately  $2\mathrm{cm}$  above the clavicle. The SCM may be transfixed with heavy silk sutures to prevent postoperative ooze.  
6. The omohyoid muscle is identified, traced to level V, and divided posteriorly. Care is taken to identify and protect the phrenic nerve and brachial plexus deep to the scalene fascia at this point, as well as to suture ligate the thoracic duct to prevent postoperative chyle leak.  
7. The anterior edge of the trapezius is cleaned from inferiorly to superiorly, defining the posterior extent of the dissection. Blunt finger dissection at this step is a valuable aid. The spinal accessory nerve in level V is divided. The superior edge of the SCM is then divided and ligated with silk transfixion sutures.  
8. Dissection is then carried along the posterior belly of the digastric muscle until the internal jugular vein is encountered.  
9. With the specimen retracted anteriorly, dissection is carried along a broad front, again taking care to maintain the scalene fascia intact, avoiding injury to the phrenic nerve and cervical plexus. Cervical nerve rootlets are divided.  
10. The carotid sheath is approached, and the specimen is returned to its anatomic position. The internal jugular vein is then isolated inferiorly and double suture ligated (one circumferential, one transfixion). The remaining specimen is then divided at the level of the clavicle and retracted superiorly. The ansa cervicalis is divided.  
11. With the carotid artery and vagus nerve in view, the specimen is elevated superiorly toward the posterior belly of the digastric muscle.  
12. With the posterior belly of the digastric muscle retracted superiorly, the hypoglossal nerve is identified and the descendens hypoglossi divided. Multiple Ranine veins of the hypoglossal plexus are controlled with vascular clips and ties.  
13. The superior aspect of the internal jugular vein is double suture ligated and divided. The anterosuperior aspect of the spinal accessory nerve is divided deep to the digastric muscle, and the specimen is delivered.  
14. Closure is achieved in layers over closed suction drains.  
15. The specimen is oriented and submitted for permanent section. One practice is to identify the lymph node levels with sutures: one suture in level I, two sutures in level II, and so on.

# Complications and Postoperative Management

# Neurologic Injury

Spinal accessory nerve: The division of CN XI with resultant shoulder weakness and pain syndrome has been the basis of many of the modifications to the radi-

cal neck dissection. Preserving the nerve results in improved outcomes, although function remains compromised in many cases. Level IIb may be preserved with decreased risk of shoulder dysfunction in the absence of macroscopic disease. Physical therapy is indicated for patients with postoperative complaints.

Phrenic nerve: May be injured if the deep layer of deep cervical fascia is violated. This may occur when defining the inferior and deep boundaries of the dissection at the point where the nerve lies on the anterior scalene muscle, deep in level IV. Postoperative elevation of the affected hemidiaphragm with decreased lung volumes may be appreciated; however, adverse sequelae are limited in the absence of preexisting pulmonary disease.

Facial nerve: The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve may be injured when dissecting level Ib. Visualization of the nerve when dissecting the perifacial lymph nodes and along the inferior border of the mandible is helpful in decreasing risk of injury. Use of the Hayes-Martin maneuver may also minimize, but not absolutely prevent, injury to the nerve.

Hypoglossal nerve: Risk of injury to CN XII is increased in patients requiring dissection of level Ib, as hemorrhage from the neighboring Ranine plexus of veins may obscure visualization of the nerve. Careful dissection is key with vascular control using clips or ties. Unilateral injury is manifested postoperatively by deviation of the tongue to the affected side; bilateral injury may result in oral phase dysphagia.

# Chyle Leak

Chylous leakage is reported in  $1 - 2.5\%$  of radical neck dissections, and it commonly occurs on the left side  $(75 - 92\%)$  of cases) when dissecting deep into level IV. To prevent injury, the nodal specimen in this region should be ligated prior to division. Intraoperatively, clear or milky fluid egress may be appreciated; the opacity of the fluid depends on the concentration of lipids in the patient's preoperative diet and duration of NPO (nil per os, i.e., no food or fluids) status. The anesthesiologist may assist in identifying a leak by maintaining positive pressure briefly, increasing intrathoracic pressure and venous return. Oversewing using nonresorbable sutures may be attempted to repair a leak, with topical application of a fibrin sealant. Management of chylous leakage is critical to minimize electrolyte derangement and hypoalbuminemia.

Management: Chyle leakage noted postoperatively will be most noticeable when tube feeding is initiated. Options for conservative management include maintaining closed suction drains, applying a pressure dressing (contraindicated in free tissue transfer and if skin flaps demonstrate vascular compromise), and administering a medium-chain triglyceride diet. Daily needle

output fistulae (<1000 mL/day) following suction drain removal and/or negative pressure wound therapy at  $-50\mathrm{mmHg}$  may offer resolutions. If conservative measures fail to resolve the leak in a timely fashion, surgical exploration is indicated, although identification of the injured duct may be difficult due to fibrin debris. Oversewing the region of injury and coverage with vascularized tissue are recommended to improve success rates and avoid delays in adjuvant radiation therapy.

# Bleeding

Intraoperative injury to the great vessels of the neck must be managed expeditently to minimize blood loss and operative morbidity. The use of monopolar cautery in immediate proximity to the vein must be performed with caution, as charring of the adventitial layer may predispose the patient to late vessel wall rupture and exsanguinating hemorrhage several days or even weeks postoperatively.

In the rare case of internal jugular injury, the defect must be immediately occluded to avoid air embolism. To provide exposure for repair, finger tamponade of the vein above and below the laceration is maintained by the assistant, expressing blood from that portion of the vein while the rent is repaired with fine nonresorbable vascular sutures on a tapered needle.

# Case Reports

Case Report 58.1. Infrastructure maxillectomy and ipsilateral neck dissection for gingival and palatal squamous cell carcinoma. A 79-year-old woman presents for the evaluation of her right posterior maxilla. The patient acknowledged a two-month history of pain and ulceration of her right maxillary gingiva and palate. Tooth #3 was nonmobile, but there was a significant focal periodontal defect. Dental radiographs demonstrated osteolytic change around the right maxillary first molar. Incisional biopsy revealed and oncologic workup demonstrated maxillary gingiva and palatal squamous cell carcinoma, stage T4aN0M0. The patient's medical history was significant for congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia with pacemaker placement, and chronic kidney disease, stage 3, GFR 50. While CT scan demonstrated shotty lymphadenopathy on the ipsilateral neck, there were no lymph nodes that met criteria radiographically. Ablative treatment plan included infrastructure maxillectomy and ipsilateral neck dissection secondary to adverse features, namely bone invasion (see Figures 58.2 through 58.17).

Late bleeding due to carotid blowout is associated with radiation therapy and is more common following radical neck dissection with minimal overlying vessel coverage. A high rate of mortality is associated with this untoward event.

# Key Points

1. If tracheostomy is performed with neck dissection, subplatysmal flap elevation should avoid extension into the tracheostomy site. Maintain the surgical sites as two separate compartments to avoid contamination and infection of the neck dissection wound.  
2. The posterior belly of the digastric muscle is an important landmark. Known as the "resident's friend" in neck dissection, maintaining it in view minimizes risk to major structures (carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve, and hypoglossal nerve).  
3. The use of gentle finger dissection along the scalene fascia cannot be underestimated.  
4. Have the anesthesiologist apply intraoperative Valsalva while examining deep level IV under loupe magnification to identify an early thoracic duct injury with chyle leak.  
5. Application of appropriate traction and countertraction is essential when identifying fascial planes, as it facilitates dissection while minimizing blood loss.

Figure 58.6. Subplatysmal flaps are prepared exposing just short of the inferior border of mandible and inferior to the clavicle. With proper traction and countertraction, the operator avoids inadvertently incising through the platysma onto the skin surface, also known as "button holing." At the midline, the right and left platysma demonstrate a decussation, thus it is helpful to locate the contralateral subplatysmal plane and draw a line in the mind's eye to connect to the ipsilateral subplatysmal. Note the external jugular vein (green) and anterior jugular vein (purple), which should be ligated after discovery.

Figure 58.7. When the dissection is carried "front to back," level 1a (green arrow) is explored first. Care is taken to ensure that the marginal mandibular nerve is protected within the deep cervical fascia. The deep cervical fascia flap (blue arrow) is developed from the inferior aspect of the submandibular gland (purple arrow) and carefully dissected upward to the inferior border of mandible.

Figure 58.8. The deep cervical fascia flap contains the marginal mandibular nerve (purple arrow), but can also be intimately related to perifacial nodes (tip of tonsil hemostat). The view of the perifacial structures is enhanced by downward retraction of the submandibular gland with an Allis clamp retractor (green arrow).

Figure 58.9. The sublingual space has three vital structures to identify. First, the lingual nerve forms a "V" as the superior most structure (green arrows). At the nadir of the "V," one will find the submandibular ganglion (purple arrow), which is ligated to preserve the nerve and avoid bleeding from the rich vascular network, Ranine veins. The duct appears next which is ligated (light blue arrow), followed by the hypoglossal nerve inferiorly, which should be preserved (navy blue arrow).

Figure 58.11. Continuing back to front, one will encounter the great vessels in the carotid sheath. The carotid sheath is rich in lymphatics that can collect metastatic cells. The external carotid artery has branches such as the lingual artery (green arrow) and superior thyroid artery (purple arrow), while the internal carotid does not have any branches. The internal jugular (navy blue arrow) has a lymph node in close approximation (light blue arrow). While IJ invasion is the impetus for removal, a distinct plate between the IJ and node may allow for preservation.

![](images/e7ba7e2c2f01adaa30a2e7432505b64878c75a811cf36338f2f2e5e4007bfee2.jpg)  
Figure 58.10. The facial artery (tonsil hemostat) is found deep to the submandibular gland (Alice forceps) and above the posterior digastric (green arrow). The prudent ablative surgeon will preserve a significant portion of the facial artery for the involved reconstructive colleague. A time investment in preserving significant facial artery length will payoff during an efficient and safe microvascular anastomosis.

Figure 58.12. When a distinct plate between the IJ and lymph node can be found, the two can be separated. While internal jugular invasion should be suspected, another possible reason for intimate relation can be venous branch feeding into the IJ.

Figure 58.13. The spinal accessory can be visualized above the tendon of the SCM. On palpation, the nerve will feel like a distinct cord running from posterior-inferior to anterior-medial. Imprudent force can injure the nerve causing postoperative disorders and includes traction injury with retractors, compression injury from grasping with a forcep, and electrical injury with monopolar electrocautery. In the figure above, note that two retractors create the corner of the 2b "box," and the internal jugular is protected from injury.

Figure 58.14. Clearance in the posterior neck dissection involves removing all lymph nodes behind the IJ, under the sternocleidomastoid and superficial to the cervical branches. Over-resection underneath the IJ in the medial direction can cause injury to the carotid or vagus nerve.

Figure 58.15. Hemostasis is achieved by visualizing and ligating all visible vessels. Double ligating named vessels is prudent to obviate the possibility of a life-threatening bleed. The anesthesia team can perform a Valsalva maneuver and/or raising the patient's blood pressure to near baseline levels can allow the operator to see any bleeding vessels. The neck is analyzed to ensure no obvious and dangerous lymph nodes are left behind. It is prudent to palpate the perifacial nodal basin, as well as level IV. Moreover, placing clips in the most superior (level IIb) and inferior (level IV) levels allows the radiation oncologist to visualize the extent of the neck dissection when planning for radiation therapy.

Case Report 58.2. Infrastructure maxillectomy for maxillary squamous cell carcinoma with mandibular recurrence and subsequent mandibulectomy with neck dissection. A 75-year-old gentleman presented with oral squamous cell carcinoma of his left maxilla, stage T2N0M0. Significant comorbidities included coronary artery disease treated with cardiac stents just over 1 year ago and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient's surgery was staged, first performing the partial maxillectomy, and then performing the neck dissection if warranted based on pathology. The pathology yielded a  $3\mathrm{mm}$  depth of invasion and no other adverse features. After multidisciplinary tumor board discussion, the decision was made to not undertake adjuvant therapy and to closely watch the neck through serial examination. Three months after tumor resection, the patient noted a small submandibular swelling. On examination, there was a  $2.5 \times 2.5\mathrm{cm}$  palpable node at level 1b, which was fixated to the lower border of mandible. CT neck with contrast and PET scan revealed solitary nodule on inferior border of mandible and ultrasound-guided needle biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent definitive therapy in the form of marginal mandibulectomy and neck dissection (see Figures 58.18 through 58.25).

Figure 58.18. Contrasted CT neck demonstrated a suspicious 1b node measuring  $15 \times 17 \mathrm{~mm}$  (arrow), which exceeds the  $15 \mathrm{~mm}$  threshold. The node presents other concerning features including central necrosis evidence by rim enhancement, and a circular shape, rather than kidney bean morphology.

Figure 58.19. Ultrasound (US)-guided biopsy performed under local anesthesia and sedation. US image demonstrates hypoechoic mass (dark with irregular borders, gold arrows). The long straight hyperechoic object is a 19-gauge trochar needle (purple arrow), which is introduced into the mass to derive a core needle tissue sample. This sample returned squamous cells.

Figure 58.20. Positron emission tomography (PET-CT) is combined with standard computed tomography to create an image that localizes metabolic activity in the body. A radioactive atom is applied to glucose to create a radionuclide, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). This radiotracer is injected intravenously and migrates to areas requiring high glucose consumption including the brain, heart, and malignancies. In this circumstance, the radiotracer is localized to the concerning lymph node, but spares the remainder of the neck, as well as other areas of squamous cancer trophism, such as the lungs.

Figure 58.22. The lymph node was intimately related to several structures in the area. The lymph node was not readily separable from the inferior border or the submandibular gland; a marginal mandibulectomy (green arrow) and gland excision was performed en bloc.
