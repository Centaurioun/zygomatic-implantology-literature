Procedures aimed toward addressing brow ptosis and forehead/glabellar rhytids. Approaches include endoscopic, trichophytic (subgaleal and subcutaneous), and coronal. While all techniques address brow ptosis, treatment planning is often guided by cosmetic diagnoses, surgeon preference, and supplemental procedures such as bony orbital recontouring, muscle resection, hairline repositioning, and concomitant upper blepharoplasty.

# General Indications

1. Brow ptosis  
2. Brow asymmetry  
3. Deep rhytids and furrows traversing the forehead, glabella, and/or nasal radix  
4. Appearance of heavy or redundant forehead and temporal skin  
5. Pseudoblepharoptosis and/or visual field restriction

# General Contraindications

1. Lagophthalmos  
2. Previous or current dry eye symptoms  
3. Unrealistic patient expectations

# Anatomy

Supraorbital nerve: Exits the superior orbit parallel to medial limbus. The nerve forms branches, which innervate the frontoparietal skin (deep branch) and upper eyelid (superficial branch).  
Supratrochlear nerve: Exits the superomedial orbit and is located  $9.0\mathrm{mm}$ $(\pm 3\mathrm{mm})$  medial to the supraorbital nerve. Innervates the skin of the lower forehead (midline glabella), the medial upper eyelid, and a portion of the conjunctiva.  
Sentinel vein: Located approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the zygomaticofrontal suture. Serves as a warning for the proximity of the temporal branch of the facial nerve.  
Temporal branch of the facial nerve: As the temporal branch courses superiorly to the zygomatic arch, it is

located within or along the undersurface of the temporoparietal fascia. The temporal branch provides motor innervation to the brow musculature and the superior portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The anticipated course of the temporal branch can be approximated by drawing a line from a point  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the tragus to a point  $15\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the lateral taper of the ipsilateral brow.

Conjoint (conjoin) tendon: The fusion of the galea, superficial, and deep temporal fascia and periosteum/ pericranium within the anterior temporal region.

# Preoperative Markings

1. Patients are marked preoperatively while sitting upright.  
2. The brow lift is simulated with manual manipulation of the brows prior to placing the patient supine, and the desired vectors of pull are marked.  
3. Important markings include: incision sites, skin to be resected, and the anticipated location of nerves (supraorbital, supratrochlear, and temporal nerve).  
4. Standard preoperative photographs are taken and placed in the operative within the surgeon's field of view for reference during the procedure.

# Endoscopic (Closed) Brow Lift

# Indications

1. Circumvent need for trichophytic or visible scar  
2. Patient preference for less invasive procedure  
3. Patient with short to normal upper facial third (less than  $6\mathrm{cm}$  from brow to hairline.) Note that endoscopic procedure may raise hairline.

# Contraindications

1. Excessive hairline recession  
2. Excessively curved forehead inhibiting the passing of endoscopic instruments to periorbita

# Technique

1. Preoperative markings are made with the patient sitting upright (see Figure 49.1 in Case Report 49.1).  
2. Intravenous sedation or oral endotracheal intubation is employed. A single dose of intravenous antibiotics are recommended prior to the start of the procedure.  
3. The patient is positioned supine (see Figure 49.2 in Case Report 49.1) with the endoscope monitor within view of the surgeon and surgical assistant, typically at the foot of the operating table.  
4. Tumescent solution is injected within the anticipated tissue planes to be elevated. Local anesthesia is injected supraperiosteally along the supraorbital and lateral orbital rims. Local block of the auriculotemporal and zygomaticotemporal nerves is recommended with intravenous sedation.  
5. Five incisions (ports) are placed and hidden within the patient's hairline: a single vertical  $2\mathrm{cm}$  midline incision (see Figure 49.3 in Case Report 49.1), two  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  vertical paramedian/parasagittal incisions (see Figure 49.4 in Case Report 49.1) located superior to the proposed highest point of brow arch (lateral limbus of the eye), and two beveled  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  horizontal incisions (see Figure 49.9 in Case Report 49.1) located within the temporal hair-bearing region  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the temporal crest and  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the hairline. The midline and paramedian incisions are made through all layers of the scalp to the cranium, and the temporal incisions are carried to the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia.  
6. Blind dissection (without the endoscope) is performed with a curved periosteal elevator to develop a full-thickness subperiosteal flap using the midline and paramedian ports (see Figure 49.5 in Case Report 49.1). Blindly, a curved endoscopic elevator is utilized to dissect within a subperiosteal tissue plane posteriorly to the coronal suture (vertex of the skull), anteriorly to a point  $2\mathrm{cm}$  cephalic to the supra orbital rims, and laterally along the lateral orbit rims below the lateral canthus approaching the infraorbital rim. Care is taken to fully release the arcus marginalis from the orbital margins (see Figure 49.6 in Case Report 49.1).  
7. A  $30^{\circ}$  endoscope with a protected sheath is inserted through the midline port (see Figure 49.7 in Case Report 49.1). Endoscopic instruments are inserted through the paramedian ports and dissection proceeds caudally toward the supraorbital rim, glabella, and lateral orbital rims. The endoscope is used to visualize and dissect the remaining central periosteum and to expose the brow (galeal) fat pad. The supraorbital nerves are often visualized (see Figure 49.8 in Case Report 49.1) through the overlying tissue and the periosteum is subsequently released around the nerve bundles. Below the brow fat pad, a horizontal

release of the periosteum is typically carried out with a scoring instrument. The periosteal release is enlarged until the defect is at least  $1\mathrm{cm}$ . This allows passive mobilization of the forehead and minimizes relapse. Care is taken not to tear the supraorbital neurovascular bundles as they are often denuded at this point.

8. With periosteum exposure and scoring completed, resection or ablation of the corrugators/procerus muscled may be carried out if desired. The authors typically recommend scoring with the electrocautery as an alternative to muscle resection to minimize postoperative soft tissue defects and an unnatural brow appearance. Laterally, utilizing the temporal ports (see Figure 49.9 in Case Report 49.1), a curved elevator is used to blindly dissect (see Figure 49.10 in Case Report 49.1) within a tissue plane created between the temporoparietal fascia and the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia. The entire superficial temporal space is released anteriorly and posteriorly to allow passive posterior movement of the scalp. Inferiorly, the dissection comes to a "soft" stop approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above zygomatic arch where the temporoparietal fascia fuses with the temporal fascia at the conjoint tendon. Aggressive dissection below this point raises significant risk of injuring the facial nerve as it crosses the arch. The sentinel (medial zygomatic temporal) vein is located  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the zygomaticofrontal suture and should also be avoided.  
9. The lateral subgaleal and the central subperiosteal dissection planes are connected by dividing the conjoint tendon (see Figure 49.11 in Case Report 49.1) at the superior temporal line. A sharp dissector is placed through the temporal port and is driven through the conjoint tendon into the frontal pocket slightly above the supraorbital rim. The conjoint tendon is then opened posteriorly with a sweeping motion until there is a complete connection between the two pockets.  
10. Fixation is accomplished at the temporal ports first and then at the paramedian ports. A 0-0 Nuolon suture is utilized to grasp the temporoparietal fascia on the medial aspect of the incision (see Figure 49.12 in Case Report 49.1). The suture is superiorly and posteriorly ligated to the deep temporal fascia (see Figure 49.13 in Case Report 49.1). The vector follows the line formed from the ala to lateral canthus (see Figure 49.1 in Case Report 49.1). Occasionally, a second suture is required to secure the flap. This suture placement is performed bilaterally to symmetrical endpoint. Note, if the corrugators were aggressively released earlier, this step has the risk of excessively widening the interbrow distance. Fixation is accomplished at the paramedian incisions with the placement of resorbable  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  Endotine devices. Skin hooks are utilized to retract the paramedian incision laterally. The Endotine drill is used to engage the cranium to the depth of the Endotine drill

bit along the anticipated vertical vector (typically, the lateral limbus of the eye) of the brow lift (see Figure 49.15 in Case Report 49.1). The osteotomy (see Figure 49.15 in Case Report 49.1) site is irrigated to remove any residual bone shavings. The Endotine insertion tool is used to secure the Endotine into the predrilled Endotine osteotomy. The Endotine is fully seated when it is flushed with the cranium (see Figure 49.16 in Case Report 49.1). Endotines are placed bilaterally at each of the two paramedian incisions. The forehead scalp is elevated and positioned onto the Endotine devices. This maneuver sets the height and arch of the brows. Care is taken not to over or under elevate the brow. If resistance to elevation is noted, additional periosteal release along the lateral supraorbital rims may be required. We recommend leaving the forehead scalp secured to the anchors for at least 10 minutes and then reassess for any soft tissue creep and resulting laxity. If necessary, the lax scalp is then gently lifted off of the Endotine devices, re-elevated to the proper height with tension, and then resuspended.

# Case Reports

Case Report 49.1. Endoscopic brow lift. A 37-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of brow ptosis, forehead rhytids, and an "angry" appearance. Physical examination reveals brow asymmetry and brow ptosis. Chronic corrugator activation is noted. Forehead height is normal to slightly short (see Figures 49.1 through 49.16).

![](images/f5a4d65c2650a32a3b7f2245debea32c54b6c8e0a84db0e3459ed6e2e230442a.jpg)  
Figure 49.1. Preoperative markings are made with the patient in the upright position. The pink lines represent the anticipated vectors of pull.

11. Scalp incisions are closed with either skin staples or sutures and bacitracin is applied. Drains are usually not necessary. Light pressure dressing may be placed depending on the preference of the surgeon.

# Key Points: Endoscopic Brow Lift

1. Advantages of the endoscopic brow lifting technique include a minimally invasive approach, rapid recovery time, decreased alopecia, decreased bleeding, decreased tissue edema, decreased scalp anesthesia/paresthesia, and minimal scarring compared to open techniques.  
2. Endoscopic brow lifts may elevate the hairline, particularly in patients with thick, redundant forehead skin and should be used cautiously in patients with excessive vertical brow height.  
3. Failure to maintain a subperiosteal tissue plane while performing the central dissection will result in poor hemostasis of the surgical field and will make further endoscopic visualization difficult.

# Trichophytic Brow Lift

# Indications

1. Excessively high hairline and tall forehead with supplemental desire to lower the hairline

# Contraindications

1. Progressive recession of hairline in female patients may expose transverse surgical scar  
2. Male patients  
3. Simultaneous medium depth skin resurfacing

# Technique (Subgaleal Brow Lift)

1. Preoperative markings are made with the patient sitting upright. The amount of scalp to be excised should be determined prior to the initiation of the procedure.  
2. Intravenous sedation or oral endotracheal intubation is employed. A single dose of intravenous antibiotics is recommended prior to the start of the procedure.

![](images/3a023b2d25a6fa9646b4c6a7f41484b55b42f71d6c045f514713349a03d72a2e.jpg)  
Figure 49.18. Six-month postoperative three-quarter view depicting resolution of dermatochalasis, correction of lower eyelid fat prolapse, brow ptosis, periorbital wrinkles, and generalized tightening of the skin.

3. The patient is positioned supine and tumescent solution is injected within the subgaleal tissue planes to be elevated. Local anesthesia is injected supraperiosteally along the supraorbital and lateral orbital rims. Local block of the auriculotemporal and zygomaticotemporal nerves is recommended with IV sedation.  
4. Three to four millimeters of the thin hair located at the anterior hairline is trimmed with scissors (Figure 49.20 in Case Report 49.3) and the lateral extension of the proposed incision are shaved for  $5\mathrm{cm}$  as it enters the temporal region.  
5. A wavy trichophytic incision is initiated  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the anterior hairline and is continued to the depth of the galea. The trichophytic aspect of the incision extends to the middle of the lateral hairline curvature. The trichophytic incision is beveled in three distinct regions. The anterior aspect of the incision is beveled to transect the hair follicles and the lateral aspect of the incision is beveled to parallel (not transect) the hair follicles.

6. The frontal and temporal flaps are created within the subgaleal plane (Figure 49.21 in Case Report 49.3). Frontal dissection is carried to the level of the supraorbital rim. The supraorbital neurovascular bundle is identified and preserved. The temporal flap is elevated just superficial to the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia in order to preserve the temporal branch of the facial nerve. If brow elevation with flap manipulation is easily achieved, the frontal dissection is complete. If the brow does not move passively to the extent desired, dissection is continued within a subperiosteal plane around the supraorbital ridge, inferior to the nasal radix, and inferiorly along the lateral orbital rim. Flap elevation posterior to the hairline is typically not required. Once the entire forehead flap is mobilized, the glabellar musculature may be addressed.  
7. The forehead flap is retracted superiorly, allowing skin to be drawn upward from the lateral brow over the undissected scalp. The amount of skin to be excised is determined by the position of the brows and the vertical height of the forehead after the superior elevation of the forehead flap (see Figure 49.22 in Case Report 49.3). Vertical guide cuts (see Figure 49.23 in Case Report 49.3) may be made within the flap as it overlaps the scalp to aid in determining the amount of skin to be excised. A  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  wedge of skin is removed with a #15 blade (see Figure 49.24 in Case Report 49.3). A slight overcorrection may be necessary.  
8. A #15 blade is used to create a reverse beveling of the recipient skin site to incorporate trichophytic hair-sparing flap margin. Fibrin sealant is applied under the forehead flap to facilitate fixation and to minimize hematoma formation. Alternatively, or in cases with moderate muscle oozing, a closed suction drain may be placed.  
9. The galea is closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue is closed with 4-0 Monocryl sutures, and the skin edges are reapproximated with a running 6-0 plain gut suture (see Figure 49.25 in Case Report 49.3). Incisions in the temporal hair-bearing areas are closed with staples.

# Key Points

1. The trichophytic lift may be performed in either a subcutaneous or a subgaleal tissue plane. Both share a frontal hairline incision that extends laterally and inferiorly into the temporal hairline. Both approaches allow for the correction of forehead rhytids, brow ptosis, and brow asymmetries, but the subgaleal brow lift approach allows for lowering of the hairline and shortening of the vertical forehead.  
2. With the trichophytic incision, the bevel has three separate parts or segments. In the anterior segment of the incision, the beveling transects the follicles and allows for hair grow through the incision to hide the scar.

Thus, the bevel is at an angle that transects the shaft of the hair follicle while maintaining the base of the hair follicle. The lateral segment of the incision is located within the hair-bearing areas, similar to the coronal incision. In the lateral segment of the incision, the incision is parallel to the hair follicles in order to not transect the hair follicles.

3. The trichophytic incision may become visible with time as the anterior hairline recedes.

# Case Reports

Case Report 49.4. Trichophytic brow lift. A 67-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of a high hairline, brow asymmetry, and facial aging. Physical examination reveals Glogau wrinkle score III, Fitzpatrick skin type II, an elongated upper facial third, mild brow

ptosis with slight asymmetry, upper eyelid ptosis, lower eyelid fat prolapse with dermatochalasis, loss of facial volume with excessive facial and neck laxity with fine lines and wrinkles (see Figures 49.27 through 49.28).

# Treatment Plan

1. Trichophytic brow lift (subperiosteal posterior and subcutaneous anterior dissection) with forehead shortening  
2. Facelift with platysmaplasty  
3. Upper eyelid ptosis repair  
4. Lower eyelid blepharoplasty  
5. Fat transfer for additional facial volume  
6. Full face  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser skin resurfacing

# Coronal Brow Lift

# Indications

1. Excessive supraorbital bone protrusion requiring recontouring  
2. Subcutaneous fat loss accentuates supraorbital bony protrusion

# Contraindications

1. Progressive recession of hairline in female patients  
2. Male patients

# Technique

1. Preoperative marking are made with the patient sitting upright.

2. Intravenous sedation or oral endotracheal intubation is employed. A single dose of intravenous antibiotics are recommended prior to the start of the procedure.  
3. The patient is positioned supine and tumescent solution is injected within the anticipated tissue planes to be elevated. Local anesthesia is injected supraperiosteally along the supraorbital and lateral orbital rims. Local block of the auriculotemporal and zygomaticotemporal nerves is recommended with IV sedation.  
4. The hair is parted with hair clips to expose a horizontal segment of scalp  $5 - 6\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the hairline (see Figure 49.30 in Case Report 49.5). An undulated, beveled incision is created parallel to the hair follicles (see Figure 49.31 in Case Report 49.5) from temporal tuft to temporal tuft. Centrally, the incision is carried through the galea, and a subgaleal dissection proceeds to a point several centimeters cephalic to the supraorbital rim. A subperiosteal dissection is then initiated and continues to expose the supraorbital rims, the radix of the nose and the lateral orbital rims (see Figure 49.32 in Case Report 49.5). The supraorbital neurovascular bundles are identified and preserved (see Figure 49.33 in Case Report 49.5).  
5. Depending on the depth of bony removal planned, the dissection is carried subperiosteally into the orbit

with care not to detach the lateral canthal tendon. Supraorbital neurovascular bundles within their foramina may need to be released with a small osteotome and mobilized into the scalp flap.

6. The temporal flap is elevated just superficial to the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia in order to preserve the temporal branch of the facial nerve. The lateral subgaleal and the central subperiosteal dissection planes are connected by dividing the conjoint tendon at the superior temporal lines bilaterally.  
7. Subperiosteal dissection allows for exposure of osseous structures, thus allowing the recontour of the supraorbital and lateral orbital rim prominences. Preoperatively, a determination should be made as to the three-dimensional osseous change desired. Guide cuts (see Figure 49.34 in Case Report 49.5) are placed within the bone to be reduced with a crosscut fissure burr to map out the extent of reduction. The reduction is carried out with a  $4\mathrm{mm}$  egg-bur (see Figures 49.34 and 49.35 in Case Report 49.5) with copious irrigation. Periodic redraping of the coronal flap over the upper brow is necessary to observe progress and symmetry.  
8. After bony recounturing is completed (see Figure 49.36 in Case Report 49.5), the periosteum is released below the brow (galeal) fat pads to allow for flap advancement. Glabellar musculature may be addressed at this time.  
9. Towel clamps are used to retract the tissue flap superiorly, allowing the skin to be drawn upward from lateral brow. If necessary, paramedian bone tunnels or Endotine devices may be used to further suspend the central component of the flap and to stabilize the arch of the brows. The temporal portion of the flap is secured with heavy, nonresorbable sutures passed from the temporoparietal fascia to the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia in a superolateral vector.  
10. A #10 blade is used to trim the excessive flap tissue. Fibrin sealant is applied under the forehead flap to facilitate fixation and to minimize hematoma formation. Alternatively, or in cases with moderate muscle oozing, a closed suction drain may be placed. The galea is closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures and the scalp is secured with staples.

# Key Points

1. For women, recounturing of the supraorbital region allows for feminizing of frontonasal angle and brow prominence.  
2. Care should be taken when recounturing the supraorbital rim to avoid penetration into the frontal sinus. Preoperative CT scans will allow the surgeon to map out frontal sinus anatomy and minimize inadvertent perforation.

# Case Report

Case Report 49.5. Coronal brow lift. A 40-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of deep set eyes, deep rhytids, and a "tired" appearance. Physical examination reveals normal upper facial third height, prominent superolateral bony orbital rims, and mild brow ptosis with slight asymmetry (see Figures 49.29 through 49.38).

# Postoperative Management for Brow Lift Procedures

1. A thin layer of bacitracin is placed over all skin incisions, and a light pressure dressing is placed at time of surgery.  
2. An antibiotic and analgesic are prescribed postoperatively.  
3. The patient is asked to sleep with their head of the bed elevated for the first week postsurgery.  
4. On postoperative day #2, the pressure dressing is removed, and all incisions are cleaned with a 50/50 mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sterile water to prevent incision site crusting.  
5. Patients are allowed to gently shampoo their hair on postoperative day #3.  
6. Patients are advised to avoid hot curlers, straightening irons, excessive blow drying, and caustic hair chemicals as surgical anesthesia may lead to self-inflicted tissue damage.  
7. Staples are removed 7-10 days postoperatively.  
8. Patients are asked to minimize strenuous activities for 3 weeks postoperatively.

# Early Complications

Hematoma: Unrecognized hematoma formation may lead to flap necrosis. Once a hematoma is recognized, immediate evacuation and flap repositioning are performed.

Supraorbital or supratrochlear paresthesia-hypothesis: Typically resolves with conservative management and tincture of time. For persistent cases, consider short course steroid treatment or low-dose amitriptyline (Elavil).

Figure 49.38. Patient appearance at 1 year postoperatively.

Muscle weakness: Weakness of the brow elevators due to injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve. Typically resolving within 3-4 months. To mask resolving or permanent brow paralysis, adjunctive Botulinum Toxin can be used to weaken the contralateral frontalis to create symmetry.

# Late Complications

Lagophthalmos: Typically from over elevating the brow. Minor lagophthalmos typically resolve time and with inferior massage of the eyelids. Severe cases often result from simultaneous brow lifting and upper blepharoplasty procedures performed by an inexperienced surgeon. Severe cases require resuspension of the brow lift if noticed early. Late lagophthalmos is treated with upper lid skin grafts, muscle resuspension procedures, Botulinum Toxin and gold weight application.

Unnatural appearance (operated look): Aggressive resection of the corrugator and procerus may lead to a widened interbrow distance and movement abnormalities. Complete or partial removal of muscle may lead to a soft tissue deficit once edema resolves. Movement abnormalities may be masked with Botulinum Toxin therapy. Soft tissue topography deficits may be camouflaged with injectable soft tissue fillers.

Incisional scarring: Thickened scars are amenable to dermabrasion or laser resurfacing at 6-8 weeks. Keloids are treated with serial Kenalog injections.

Alopecia: May be temporary or permanent along areas of incision tension or fixation. Hair follicles typically display hair regrowth within 4-5 months. However,

hair loss can be permanent with overzealous cautery and ischemia of the hair follicles. Follicular unit hair grafting or scar excision with scalp advancement may camouflage troubled areas.

# Key Points

1. Brow lifting surgery is often not just about brow elevation. Flattening of forehead skin, lowering of the hairline, and bony recontouring are occasionally primary or secondary goals. Open approaches allow for direct access and more aggressive muscle resection (frontalis, procerus, corrugator). The trichophytic approach allows the surgeon the opportunity to shorten a tall forehead. The coronal approach allows the surgeon the best access to perform osseous reintouring.  
2. Novice surgeons should be cautious of combining brow lifting procedures with upper eyelid blepharoplasty due to the risk of lagophthalmos. Lagophthalmos can be minimized by performing the procedures in two stages with the elevation of the brow first, followed by upper blepharoplasty after 3 months.  
3. Tumescent solution (25cc  $1\%$  lidocaine + 1 cc 1:1000 epinephrine in a 500cc bag of normal saline) is diffusely injected with a  $22\mathrm{g}$  spinal needle into all tissue planes that are expected to be elevated during the surgery. Tumescent anesthesia facilitates hydro-dissection of the desired tissue planes and aids in hemostasis. A 7-10 minute delay after tumescent infiltration allows sufficient time for the ideal vasoconstrictive and hemostatic properties of the tumescent solution.  
4. The vectors of pull should coincide with the final placement of the brow (see Figure 49.1). The ideal placement of the highest point (apex) of the brow typically coincides with a vertical line drawn from the lateral limbus of the eye. The lateral margin of the brow

ideally terminates along an oblique line connecting the lateral canthus and the lateral nasal ala.  
5. Failure to achieve desired flap elevation and/or long-term results is frequently a result of failure to fully release the arcus marginalis from the orbital rims.  
6. If excessive skin has been excised with open lifting procedure, a posterior subgaleal dissection can often facilitate closure while minimizing lagophthalmos.  
7. Methods of fixation along the paramedian vector may include resorbable Endotines, bone tunnels, percutaneous screws, and cranial plates. Bone fixation is never placed within the midline in order to prevent inadvertent damage to the superior sagittal sinus.  
8. Some surgeon's prefer to place Botulinum Toxin 10-14 days prior to brow lifting procedures. 18-24 units of Botulinum Toxin deposited within the brow depressors will weaken the inferior pull of the depressors and promote maintenance of the new position of the brow during the immediate postoperative period.
