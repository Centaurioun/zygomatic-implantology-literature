The use of a chemical exfoliant to injure specific tissue layers to lessen fine facial rhytids, to decrease dispigmentation and actinic changes, and to rejuvenate damaged areas in a minimally invasive manner.

# Indications

1. Photo dyspigmentation  
2. Superficial rhytids  
3. Melasma  
4. Acne vulgaris  
5. Ephelides

# Contraindications

1. Active cutaneous infection (i.e., herpes)  
2. Ice-pick or deep atrophic acne scars  
3. Allergy to agent  
4. Extreme sunburn  
5. Open wounds (open acne wounds will propagate peel depth)  
6. Unrealistic patient expectations  
7. Patient is unable or unwilling to perform postoperative care  
8. Caution with patients using skin sensitizers (i.e., Retin-A, Retinol, Accutane)

# Anatomy

Epidermis: Layers from superficial to deep: stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale

Dermis. Layers from superficial to deep: papillary dermis and reticular dermis

# Pretreatment Protocol for Chemical Peel Patients

1. Commercially prepared skin systems that contain tretinoin 0.05-0.1 and  $4\%$  hydroquinone, such as Obagi Nu-Derm (Skin Specialists, PC, Omaha, NE), are available and are recommended for 4-6 weeks prior to the

application of a peel in order to allow for a more uniform depth of peel and to minimize complications associated with melasma and postinflammatory pigmentation.

2. Valacyclovir (Valtrex) is recommended beginning the day prior to the peel and for 7-14 days post-peel.

# Technique: Medium Depth Chemical Peel

1. All patient consents are reviewed, signed, and all patient questions are answered. All patient make up is removed, and the maxillofacial skeleton is prepped with alcohol from the hairline to a point several inches below the inferior border of the mandible.  
2. For medium depth and deep peels, intravenous sedation is performed.  
3. The patient is positioned supine on the surgical table. The skin is degreased with acetone and standard nerve blocks are performed with long-acting local anesthetic in the areas of the anticipated peel.  
4. A pre- peel is performed with Jessner's solution to include the forehead, periorbital region (the upper lids and thin tissue below the lower lid lash lines are avoided), the nasal bridge, the perioral region, and the lower face to the inferior border of the mandible (see Figure 47.2 in Case Report 47.1). After the Jessner's solution has dried and a thin layer of frosting has occurred,  $25 - 35\%$  Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is applied to the above-mentioned regions with  $4\times 4$  gauze (see Figure 47.3 in Case Report 47.1).  
5. When using TCA solution, it is important to wait several minutes after the application of the solution in order to allow for the frosting of the tissue and to assess the depth of the peel. The peel is typically carried into the hairline in order to minimize any demarcations of the peel. Areas such as the central forehead, glabellar region, and perioral region contain thicker tissue and are resilient to peels. Additional solution may be applied to these areas. The use of a cotton-tipped

applicator may be used to rub the solution into areas such as deep perioral and glabellar rhytids. The upper eyelid is avoided in medium to deep peels and the ciliary margin is the upper extend of the lower lids involvement. The solution is feathered as the inferior border of the mandible is reached in order to prevent a line of demarcation to the thinner and more vulnerable cervical tissue. Additional layers of TCA may be applied until the desired amount of frosting is observed (see Figure 47.4 in Case Report 47.1) and the desired depth of penetration is reached.

6. Once the desired depth of the peel has been reached, a facial moisturizing cream is applied to the facial skeleton. In the immediate recovery period, the use of cool compresses and/or a fan will aid in minimizing immediate postoperative discomfort.

# Postoperative Management

1. Moisturizing cream. The patient is required to keep the peeled area moisturized at all times during the post- peel period. Moisturizing creams prevent drying and crusting of the peeling areas and provide patient comfort while the skin re-epithelializes. Depending on the depth of peel, moisturizing creams may be combined with topical antibiotics.  
2. Analgesics. Prescribed based on the depth of the peel and adjunct procedures performed at the time of the peel.  
3. Valacyclovir. Continued 7-14 days post- peel.  
4. Wound care. Should be initiated on post- peel day #2. Involves lightly washing the peeled area with mild soap in a blotting fashion several times a day and then reapplying the moisturizing cream. Avoid scrubbing, itching, picking, or pulling at sloughing skin as this may cause scar and keloid formation. Pre- peel skin care systems are typically restarted 2 weeks after the chemical peel.  
5. Sunblock. Direct sun exposure is avoided and SPF 30 or above is necessary to minimize the stimulation of melanocytes and further postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH).

# Early Complications

1. Discomfort, edema, and tissue erythema: Common to all peels, corresponds to the depth of the peel.  
2. Hyperpigmentation: Frequently occurs within the recovery period, especially with early sun exposure. Hyperpigmentation is typically transient and responds to tretinoin and  $4\%$  hydroquinone.  
3. Prolonged flaking after a peel: Requires generous moisturizer application and avoidance of restarting topical retinoids.

4. Milia formation: Treated by sterilely unroofing the lesion.  
5. Wound infection (bacterial/fungal): Symptoms include increasing deep erythema, pruritis, and discomfort around days 3-5 after the peel. Early suspicion of an infection should be managed with cultures and sensitivities, systemic antibiotics, and acetic acid solution rinses. Fungal infections are managed with topical and systemic antifungal agents.  
6. Herpes labialis. Suspected if the classic vesicular eruption appears. Antiviral therapy dosage is changed from a prevention to a treatment dosage.

# Late Complications

1. Persistent erythema (greater than 2-3 months). May be caused by early sun exposure; however, persistent erythema may be an early indicator of scarring and future keloid formation.  
2. Scarring/keloid formation. If an eschar forms post- peel that does not shed for greater than 14 days, one can expect some degree of scarring/keloid formation and pigmentary disturbances. Thickening consistent with keloid formation may be treated upon recognition with monthly intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide  $(10\mathrm{mg / mL})$  and/or 5-fluorouracil (off-label use). Selective treatment with  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  or ER:YAG laser can be helpful in releasing and smoothing scars.  
3. Depigmentation. Areas of depigmentation are typically observed for 3-6 months before return of pigmentation. After 6 months, it can be assumed that a permanent depigmentation has occurred.

# Key Points

1. As a general rule, the deeper the depth of the peel, the greater the possible improvements and the greater the potential complications.  
2. Superficial peel depth varies  $(0.02 - 0.06\mathrm{mm})$  depending on the chemical exfoliant used and the number of applications. Superficial peels injure the epidermis without extending into the dermis. Indications for superficial depth peels include superficial dispigmentation, solar lentigines, and/or minimal photo damage.  
3. Medium depth peels span from the superficial papillary dermis to the upper reticular dermis  $(0.45\mathrm{mm})$ . Indications for medium depth peels include moderate rhytids, melasma, pigmentary dyschromia, actinic keratosis, depressed scars, and ephelides.  
4. Deep chemical peels have a goal depth of mid-reticular dermis  $(0.6\mathrm{mm})$ . They are the most aggressive type of chemical exfoliant, are associated with the highest potential for complications, and are indicated for moderate to deep rhytids and depressed scars.

5. Jessner's solution (14 g of each resorcinol, salicylic acid, and lactic acid (85%) mixed in 95% ethanol to make a quantity of 100 mL) may be used to perform superficial peels or as a pre- peel for medium and deep chemical peels. The use of acetone and Jessner's solution prior to the application of a stronger chemical exfoliant will remove the oily, keratinized superficial layer of the skin and allow the second, more aggressive chemical agent a more uniform depth of penetration and a better final result.

# Case Reports

Case Report 47.1. Medium depth peel. A 42-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of "inconsistent skin tone and fine wrinkles." The patient admits to excessive sun exposure through her second and third decade of life as well as a 15-pack/year history of smoking. Physical examination demonstrates a Glogau II, Fitzpatrick II skin

6. Peel depth may be assessed based on the type of frosting achieved after the application of the peeling solution. A thin, transparent frost with a pinkish background indicates that the peel has reached the papillary dermis. A solid, thick frost indicates that the peel has reached the upper reticular dermis. A thick, white-gray frost indicates that the peel has reached the midreticular dermis and that subsequent application of solution should be avoided.

type, ephelides, pigmentary dyschromia, depressed acne scars, and moderate rhytids (see Figure 47.1). The patient was placed on a 6-week pre- peel skin regimen of Obagi Nu-Derm followed by a medium depth skin resurfacing procedure utilizing Jessner's solution and  $30\%$  TCA (see Figures 47.1 through 47.6).

# Technique: Melanage Skin Brightening System

1. Pretreatment with commercially prepared skin systems that contain tretinoin 0.05-0.1 and  $4\%$  hydroquinone such as Obagi Nu-Derm (Skin Specialists PC, Omaha, NE, USA), are available and are recommended 4-6 weeks prior to the application of a peel to allow for a more uniform depth of peel and to minimize PIH.  
2. All patient questions are answered and consents reviewed and signed. All makeup is removed and area to be treated is prepped with alcohol. The patient is positioned supine on the surgical table.  
3. The Melanage skin brightening system (SkinLuma LLC, Berlin, CT, USA) is available as a kit, containing multiple ingredients including arbutin, a lightening agent. The system entails the application of a cream masque which is prepared and applied to the skin and worn for 6-12 hours depending on the severity of the condition to be treated (see Figure 47.7).  
4. Patients are given an at-home skin care kit to be used following removal of the mask. Agents used to cleanse, moisturize, and protect the skin are available with the kit.  
5. Peeling may start 48 hours after treatment and last up to 7 days. The irritation expected is typical of a sunburn. During this time, moisturizing and cleansing the face with the products provided in the kit are essential. Avoiding direct sun exposure and use of sunscreen with an SPF 30 or above is necessary to minimize PIH. Pain may be managed with analgesics. Continuation of Valacyclovir for 7-14 days is recommended.

# Key Points

1. Pigmented skin will have increased deposition of melanin and present as shades of tan, olive, brown, and black. These individuals are classified as Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI.  
2. Melasma, which is seen primarily in Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI is characterized by blotchy brown hyperpigmentation in sun-exposed regions of the body.  
3. Caution should be made in using chemical peels for Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types or in those patients with Melasma, as these patients are predisposed to PIH and depigmentation with deeper depth chemical peels.  
4. Treatment of Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI with chemical peels are more limited  
5. Superficial peels such as alpha hydroxy peels (30–70% glycolic acid or 92% pure lactic acid), beta hydroxy peels (20–30% salicylic acid), Obagi Blue Peel (20–30% TCA with a blue peel base), and Melanage skin brightening system are recommended chemical peels to use in pigmented skin types.  
6. Melanage skin brightening system has the advantage of requiring fewer treatments compared to other superficial peels.
