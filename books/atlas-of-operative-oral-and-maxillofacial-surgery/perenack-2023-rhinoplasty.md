Procedures aimed at improving the form and/or function of the nose and associated structures.

# Indications

# Correction of Functional Nasal Deformities

1. Septal deformity: Deviated nasal septum, bone spurs, internal/external nasal valve deformities  
2. Intranasal abnormalities: Turbinate hypertrophy, septal perforations, synechiae and intranasal pathology

# Correction of Aesthetic Deformities as a Result of Congenital and Acquired (Trauma) Deformities

1. Upper nose deformities: High or low dorsal hump, lateral dorsal hump, elongated nose, thin or broad nasal dorsum, and nasal deviations  
2. Lower nose deformities: Poorly defined nasal tip, nasal tip deviation, over or under projection of the nasal tip, large or asymmetrical nostrils, and excessive columella show  
3. Post-traumatic deformities: Crooked nose and saddle nose deformities  
4. Revision rhinoplasty: Undesired cosmetic result from prior rhinoplasty

# Contraindications

1. Uncontrolled systemic illness  
2. Large septal perforations  
3. Unstable nasal support structures secondary to trauma  
4. Multiply operated rhinoplasty patient with scarred/ avascular skin-soft tissue envelope (S-STE)  
5. Heavy smoker  
6. Psychological disorders: Body dysmorphic disorder, depression, personality disorders

# Anatomy

Membranous septum: The portion of the septum located between the cartilaginous septum and the columella.

Nasal septum: The nasal septum is a combined bony and cartilaginous structure which separates the nasal vault into two halves, provides support to the nasal tip, and stabilizes the upper and lower lateral cartilages. The anterior aspect of the septum is cartilaginous, and the posterior and cephalic aspect of the septum is osseous. The cartilaginous septum is quadrangular in shape and is fused to the paired upper lateral cartilages dorsally and to the anterior nasal spine and maxillary crest anteriorly and inferiorly. The osseous septum comprises the bones of the vomer and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. The vomer bone articulates with the posterior maxillary crest. The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid articulates with the nasal bones, frontal bone, and the cribriform plate.

# Septal Procedures

Caudal septoplasty: Procedures performed to address the deviated cartilaginous portion of the nasal septum to improve obstructive nasal breathing and correct cosmetic deformities/ deviations and/or to harvest a section of cartilage for adjunctive grafting procedures. A large quantity of cartilage may be harvested from the central cartilaginous septum (quadrangular resection). It is paramount to leave at least a  $10\mathrm{mm}$  dorsal and caudal cartilaginous strut (see Figure 52.1) for support. During revision rhinoplasty, if the septum has been previously harvested, alternative sites for cartilage harvesting include the conchal bowl of the ear and the costochondral cartilage obtained from the sixth and seventh ribs.

Septal repositioning: Repositioning of a deviated cartilaginous septum within the midline of the nasal cavity. The cartilaginous septum may be repositioned with or without cartilage resection. A mucoperichondrial dissection is initiated along the inferior aspect of the cartilaginous septum to mobilize it from the anterior nasal spine and maxillary crest. The cartilaginous septum is mobilized and positioned along the midline of the nasal cavity. Alternatively and more commonly, a “swinging

Figure 52.1. Anatomy of the nasal septum and quadrangular cartilage harvest.

door" technique is utilized to resect a conservative inferior strip of cartilage to allow repositioning along the midline of the nasal vault. A nonresorbable suture is frequently placed through the anterior and inferior portion of the cartilaginous nasal septum and secured to the anterior nasal spine or the periosteum overlying the anterior nasal floor/maxillary crest (Wright suture).

Cartilage scoring: Cartilage scoring is performed to facilitate septal cartilage straightening. Scoring is done perpendicular to the orientation of the deviation and is frequently required on both sides of the involved cartilage to soften and reform deviated cartilage.

- Spreader grafting: A section of cartilage, typically harvested from the nasal septum, is positioned bilaterally between the superior articulation of the cartilaginous septum and the upper lateral cartilages (see Figures 52.31 through 52.33 in Case Report 52.2). Spreader grafts are utilized to open the internal nasal valve (increase nasal airflow), to reconstruct/widen a narrow middle nasal vault, to increase nasal length in patients with a short nose, and to reconstruct hump deformities during revision rhinoplasty.

# Turbinate Anatomy and Procedures

Turbinates: The three paired nasal turbinates (superior, middle, and inferior) are positioned along the lateral nasal wall via thin turbinate bones. Their function is to

humidify and warm inspired air. The inferior turbinate is a common cause of obstructive nasal breathing.

Total inferior turbinectomy: Involves the out-fracture of the turbinate bone and the resection of the entire turbinate along its lateral attachment to the lateral nasal wall. This procedure is infrequently performed due its alteration of nasal physiology leading to postoperative epistaxis, crusting, atrophic rhinitis, and dryness.

Partial anterior turbinectomy: Involves the removal of the anterior one-third to one-half of the affected inferior turbinate. Minimizes the risks associated with total inferior turbinectomy.

Submucous resection: Involves removal of the inferior turbinate bone while preserving the overlying mucosa. By maintaining the overlying mucosal flaps, the normal mucosal functions are preserved and complications (crusting, atrophic rhinitis, and dryness) are minimized.

Other methods of turbinate treatment include electrocautery, radiofrequency and laser reduction, cryosurgery, and out-fracture without reduction/removal.

# Nasal Valves Anatomy and Procedures

Internal nasal valve: The junction of the nasal septum and the caudal margin of the upper lateral cartilages (normally  $10 - 15^{\circ}$ ). The internal nasal valve comprises the narrowest portion of the nasal airway and is

commonly associated with obstructive nasal breathing. Narrowing of the internal nasal valve is corrected with spreader grafts to increase the internal valve angle and to stent the airway open.

External nasal valve: Located caudal to the internal nasal valve and bounded by the ala laterally and medially by the septum and columella. The external nasal valve is essentially the vestibule that serves as the entrance to the nose. A collapsed external nasal valve frequently presents as a collapse of the alar rim during inspiration. Collapsed external nasal valves are treated by correcting any underlying septum deviations and with alar barton grafts to open the angle of the external nasal valve.

# Nasal Skin-Soft Tissue Envelope (S-STE)

Thick S-STE: Thick and sebaceous tissues are more adaptable to concealing deformities and hiding minor irregularities and asymmetries. It is more difficult to obtain well-defined cosmetic results with thicker nasal tissues.

Thin S-STE: Underlying definition of the nasal skeleton is readily visible. Allows for well-defined nasal tip anatomy, also readily shows nasal irregularities, imperfections, and asymmetries.

# Nasal Skeleton

Nasion: The intersection of the nasal bone and the frontal bone. Represents the deepest aspect of the nasofrontal angle. A deep nasion can be augmented with alloplastic (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) and/or autogenous (morselized septal cartilage, costochondral cartilage, temporal fascia) grafts to increase the nasofrontal angle.

Nasal bones: The paired nasal bones form the bony roof of the nose and articulate with each other medially, with the maxilla laterally, the frontal bone superiorly, the upper lateral cartilages inferiorly, and the perpendicular plates of the ethmoid posteriorly.

Upper lateral cartilages (ULC): Attach to the midline septum and form the cartilaginous mid-vault. The cephalic portion of the upper lateral cartilages are attached and overlapped by the paired nasal bones.

Lower lateral cartilages (alar cartilages) (LLC): The C-shaped and paired lower lateral cartilages are each comprised of a medial, middle, and lateral crura. Supported inferiorly by the caudal aspect of the septum and the pyriform aperture. The lower lateral cartilages determine the majority of the nasal tip shape, size, and projection.

Scroll region: The junction where the lower lateral cartilages overlap the upper lateral cartilages.

Keystone area: The junction of the upper lateral cartilages, the nasal bones, and septum.

# Initial Nasal Examination

1. Discussion regarding the patient's chief complaints regarding nasal function and aesthetics.  
2. Preoperative photographs are taken that will allow the surgeon to manipulate the images in their preferred computer software program (to be used as a visual aid for evaluation with the patient) and will allow for an intraoperative reference during the rhinoplasty surgery.  
3. Aesthetic evaluation of the entire face and nasal anatomy to include the nasal tip, dorsum, nasal base, alar rims, columella, nasal bones, radix, S-STE, and overall symmetry on both animation and repose.  
4. Intranasal examination with a nasal speculum to look closely at the nasal septum to identify areas of deviation, mucosal condition, septal perforations, synechiae and intranasal masses. Particularly important in patients with functional complaints, with previous nasal surgery, and requiring septal harvest and grafting. The inferior turbinates are also evaluated for hypertrophy contributing to obstructive nasal breathing.  
5. A treatment plan may either be created at the initial visit and reviewed with the patient or be developed and reviewed with the patient at a subsequent visit prior to surgery. The treatment plan should address both functional and aesthetic patient concerns and allow for an open discussion with the patient and surgeon regarding treatment.

# Septal Access: Killian and Transfixion Incisions

# Killian Incision

# Indications

1. Allows access to harvest a quadrangular graft specimen  
2. Allows access to the mid-septum (quadrangular septum), vomer, and ethmoid  
3. Minimal disturbance of adjacent structures

# Contraindications

1. Poor access to caudal and dorsal septal deformities

# Technique: Killian Approach Septoplasty

1. Anesthesia options include intravenous sedation, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or oral endotracheal general anesthesia. A single dose of intravenous antibiotics is administered prior to the start of the procedure.  
2. The patient is positioned supine and a countable throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx. The external and internal nose are prepped with Hebcilense solution and draped so that the forehead, chin, and ears are visible.  
3. The nasal cavities are packed with oxymetazoline soaked  $\frac{1}{2}$ -inch ribbon gauze. One percent lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine is injected into the septum

with a 27- or 30-gauge needle. The septum is injected bilaterally within a subperichondrial (anterior cartilaginous septum) and subperiosteal (posterior osseous septum) plane. Appropriate injection technique allows the hydro-dissection of the tissue from the underlying septum and blanching of the overlying tissues. The pyriform aperture, nasal floor, and inferior turbinates (if inferior turbinectomy is to be performed) are also injected. Blocks are performed at the supratrochlear and infraorbital neurovascular bundle locations.

4. For access to the cartilaginous septum, the incision is placed  $10\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to and parallel to the caudal border of the cartilaginous septum (see Figure 52.2 in Case Report 52.1). The Killian incision may be placed on either side of the septum depending on the surgeon's hand preference and/or nature/location of the septal deformity. A #15 blade is utilized to transverse the mucoperichondrium without penetrating the underlying septum. The discoid end of a Cottle elevator is used to dissect within a subperichondrial (cartilaginous septum) and a subperiosteal (bony septum) tissue plane just beyond the area of deviation and/or the site of cartilage harvest. A #15 blade is used to incise through the cartilaginous septum just posterior and parallel to the Killian incision, thus preserving at least a  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  caudal strut. Subperichondrial dissection is performed on the opposite side of the septum with the Cottle elevator. Care is taken to not perforate the opposing sides mucoperichondrium. With the mucoperichondrial tissue flaps protected, a Ballenger swivel knife is used to resect the deviated cartilage/cartilage to be harvested preserving at least a  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  strut of dorsal septum. The resected cartilage is delivered with Debakey pickups (see Figure 52.3 in Case Report 52.1). The specimen is kept in moist gauze.  
5. The site is irrigated and the Killian incision is closed with a 6-0 plain gut suture on a P3 needle. Quilting sutures are placed within the area of the cartilage defect to eliminate the dead space (minimizing hematoma formation) with a 4-0 plain gut suture on a Keith needle.

# Key Points: Killian Access

1. Although traditionally placed  $1\mathrm{cm}$  posterior and parallel to the caudal edge of the septum, the exact location of the Killian incision may vary depending on the location of the septal deformity. A Killian incision can be used to address vomer and ethmoid deviations/bone spurs with the Killian incision placed just anterior to the site of bony abnormality, with or without extension of the incision onto the floor of the nose for increased access.

# Case Reports

Case Report 52.1. Obstructed nasal breathing (deviated cartilaginous nasal septum). A 46-year-old patient presents with a chief complain of right-sided nasal obstruction not relieved with medical management. Nasal speculum examination demonstrated significant deviation of the cartilaginous septum and hypertrophy of the right inferior turbinate. Treatment included resection of deviated cartilage via Killian incision and submucous resection of the right inferior turbinate (see Figures 52.2 and 52.3).

# Transfixion Incisions

s

1. Access to anterior caudal septum to correct caudal septal deviations and to harvest graft material  
2. Access to the anterior nasal spine and floor of the nose  
3. Need for tip deprojection

# Contraindications

1. When less invasive procedures are indicated (Killian incision)

# Technique: Three Variations

1. Full transfixion incision: An incision is made completely through the membranous septum, beginning superiorly from the caudal/dorsal septal angle and terminating inferiorly through the footplate attachments. Subperichondrial dissection allows for cartilage graft harvest and correction of septal deformities. Provides tip deprojection and access to the anterior nasal spine.  
2. Hemitransfixion incision: An incision is made through only one side of the membranous septum. A #15 blade sharply accesses the caudal septum without complete disruption of footplate attachments. Subperi-chondrial dissection allows for cartilage graft harvest and correction of septal deformities.  
3. Partial transfixion incision: An incision is made completely through the membranous septum above the footplate attachments. Subperichondrial dissection allows for cartilage graft harvest and correction of septal deformities.

# Key Points: Transfixion Access

1. Transfixion incisions allow for excellent access to the caudal septum.  
2. Incisions are placed as close as possible to the caudal margin of the septum in order to minimize disruption of the membranous septum.

# Open Approach Rhinoplasty

# Indications

1. Anticipated complex shaping or grafting rhinoplasty, particularly to the nasal tip  
2. Severely deviated or twisted nose deformity  
3. Complex revision rhinoplasty  
4. Surgeon preference, novice surgeon

# Contraindications

1. When minimal changes are required (i.e., isolated dorsal hump) that may be accomplished by limited dissection (endonasal approach) or with injectable fillers

# Technique

1. Preoperative treatment plan is reviewed with the patient and surgical markings are placed.  
2. Intravenous, LMA, or oral endotracheal intubation is employed. A single dose of intravenous antibiotics is administered prior to the start of the procedure.  
3. The patient is positioned supine and a countable throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx. The external and internal nose are prepped with Hibiclense solution and draped so that the forehead, chin, and ears are visible.  
4. The nasal cavities are packed with oxymetazoline soaked  $\frac{1}{2}$ -inch ribbon gauze. One percent lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine is injected into the septum with a 27- or 30-gauge needle. The septum is injected bilaterally within a subperichondrial (anterior septum) and subperiosteal (posterior septum) plane. Appropriate injection technique allows the hydro-dissection of the tissue from the underlying septum and blanching of the overlying tissues. The pyriform aperture, nasal floor, and inferior turbinates (if inferior turbinectomy is to be performed) are injected. The marginal incision sites, nasal tip, nasal dorsum, lateral nasal walls, and the columella are injected. With any nasal procedure, the minimal amount of local anesthetic required for hemostasis is used to limit tissue distortion (typically  $7 - 8\mathrm{mL}$  total). A 10-15 minutes delay after the administration of local anesthesia should be observed in order to allow for the ideal vasoconstrictive properties of the local anesthesia and to allow postinjection tissue distortion to resolve.  
5. A stair-stepped, Chevron or "W" transcolumellar incision is marked (see Figure 52.15 in Case Report 52.2) just cephalad to the medial crural footplates (typically the narrowest part of the columella) and incised with an #11 blade (see Figure 52.16 in Case Report 52.2). The incision is carried out in a sawing motion and perpendicular to the skin. The columellar artery is frequently encountered superficial to the medial crura and should be managed with conservative bipolar cautery.  
6. Marginal incisions are created with a #15 blade. A finger is placed on the outer surface of the lower lateral cartilages (LLC) and a two pronged skin hook is used to evert the nostril. This maneuver will show the demarcation of the caudal aspect of the LLC. The marginal incision is created along this caudal aspect of the lateral crura with care to not transect the underlying cartilage. The marginal incision extends medially along the caudal margin of the middle and medial crura and joins the transcolumnellar incision (see Figure 52.17 in Case Report 52.2).

7. Angled Converse or Iris scissors are used to dissect across the columella from the medial marginal incisions and the columellar flap is freed with an #11 blade (see Figure 52.18 in Case Report 52.2).  
8. Angled Converse or Iris scissors are used to elevate the S-STE within the relatively avascular tissue plane superficial to the domes (see Figure 52.19 in Case Report 52.2) until the paired LLC can be delivered with an 8-mm double hook (see Figure 52.20 in Case Report 52.2).  
9. Dissection is carried from the LLC cephalically to the upper lateral cartilages (ULC). The ULC are exposed within the same relatively avascular plane until the nasal bones are reached. A subperiosteal dissection is created over the nasal bones with a Cottle or #9 elevator (see Figure 52.21 in Case Report 52.2) to reveal the upper vault. Residual fibrous attachments are swept off of the ULC with a Joseph knife (see Figure 52.22 in Case Report 52.2) or #9 periosteal elevator. An Aufricht retractor is placed to retract the S-STE and to allow direct visualization of the entire nasal skeleton.  
10. Open septoplasty is performed to harvest cartilage for additional grafting procedures and to resect, score, and reposition the septal cartilage.  
11. Modifications to the nasal tip and dorsum are performed as planned. Surgeon preference dictates the order, but throughout, the S-STE is redraped after adjustments to visualize changes until the planned result is obtained.  
12. Nasal tip modifications frequently involve the placement of columellar struts (see Figures 52.24 and 52.25 in Case Report 52.2), cephalic trim (see Figure 52.25 in Case Report 52.2), intradomal sutures, interdomal sutures (see Figure 52.26 in Case Report 52.2), and nasal tip grafting (see Figure 52.27 in Case Report 52.2).  
13. Dorsal modifications may include dorsal hump reduction (see Figures 52.28 through 52.30 in Case Report 52.2), augmentation, and/or correction of deviations. Cartilaginous dorsal reductions are performed with either a #10 or a #15 blade. Bony dorsal reduction is performed with a sharp monobeveled osteotome. Open roof deformities may occur after large dorsal reductions and are managed with spreader grafts (see Figures 52.31 through 52.33 in Case Report 52.2) and nasal osteotomies.  
14. Osteotomies are performed as needed (see Figures 52.5 and 52.34). Lateral osteotomies are typically used to correct nasal bone deviations/asymmetries and to close open roof deformities. A #15 blade is used to create a stab incision for lateral osteotomies at the pyriform aperture just superior to the inferior turbinate. A #9 periosteal elevator develops a subperiosteal path for the osteotomes. The lateral osteotomies are created using a guarded osteotome so that the direction of the osteotome can be palpated through the skin at all times and to minimize tissue damage. Occasionally, a

transcutaneous osteotomy using a 2-mm straight osteotome is necessary to mobilize the fractured nasal bones.

15. Alar modifications are performed as planned. Alar batton grafts (see Figures 52.35 and 52.36 in Case Report 52.2) may be placed to correct for collapse of the external nasal valve during inspiration and to provide support to the lateral nasal sidewall. Cartilage struts are placed within pockets developed superficial, lateral, and superior to the LLC.  
16. The columellar incision is closed with interrupted 6-0 plain gut sutures.  
17. Intranasal incisions are closed with 5-0 plain gut sutures and a 4-0 plain gut suture on a Keith needle is used to perform a septal quilting stitch.  
18. Lidocaine blocks are administered to the supratrochlear, infraorbital, and the nasolabial fold.  
19. Mastisol is applied to the external nose and  $\frac{1}{4}$ -inch steri-strips are applied to the external nose to create compression of the dissected spaces. A thermoplastic Aquaplast splint (Aquaplast Corp., Wyckoff, NJ, USA) is trimmed with heavy scissors and heated within a hot water bath to allow shaping of the material. The splint should provide coverage from the supratip to glabella and laterally to the naso-jugal groove. Properly trimmed and positioned, the splint applies compression to close dead space, limits edema, supports the position of osteotomized nasal bones, and serves as reminder to the patient to not sleep on their stomach during the healing period. If the nasal bones appear to medialize more than desired, intranasal silastic splints (Doyle splints) are placed within each nasal cavity and secured to each other with a 2-0 nylon trans-septal suture. Antibiotic ointment and a moustache dressing are applied. The nose is rarely packed.  
20. The throat pack is removed, the patient's posterior oropharynx is suctioned, and the patient is extubated and recovered per standard protocol.

# Key Points: Open Rhinoplasty

1. The open approach allows the surgeon to perform complex procedures to the nasal skeleton in a relatively undistorted fashion. Complex grafting and corrective techniques may be accomplished under direct vision. Disadvantages include the columellar incision scar and increased nasal tip edema.  
2. A stair-stepped, Chevron or "W" columellar incision aids in camouflaging the incision scar. Care is taken when performing the transcolumellar incision to not transect the underlying medial crura.  
3. During nasal skeletonization, it is important to stay just superficial to the LLC and ULC to maximize the S-STE thickness in order to minimize damage to the S-STE, maintain blood flow, minimize scar tissue formation, minimize edema, and minimize intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.

# Closed (Endonasal) Rhinoplasty

# Indications

1. Surgeon preference  
2. Primary rhinoplasty or minor revision rhinoplasty  
3. Need for limiting skin incisions (keloid formers)

# Contraindications (Relative)

1. Complex rhinoplasty requiring numerous grafting procedures  
2. Complex revision rhinoplasty  
3. Complex post-traumatic rhinoplasty with severe deviation or twisted component  
4. Novice surgeon unfamiliar with endonasal technique

# Technique: Closed (Endonasal) Rhinoplasty

1. Steps 1-4 of the open rhinoplasty technique.  
2. The septum is accessed first and addressed as needed. If necessary, a septal cartilage graft is harvested for structural and shaping grafts as planned preoperatively.  
3. Attention is turned to the closed rhinoplasty incisions. Access is through a transcartilaginous incision between the LLC and the ULC (scroll area) (see Figure 52.4). The tip is manually displaced caudally until the ULC/LLC junction (scroll area) is visualized within the nasal vestibule. A #15 blade is used to incise nasal mucosa and to transverse the scroll area parallel to the lateral aspect of the ULC. Dissection is carried onto the nasal dorsum with blunt (Cottle elevator) and sharp (Iris scissors) dissection. Care is taken to dissect just superficial to the cartilage to minimize bleeding, maintain a uniform S-STE thickness, and minimize tissue trauma and edema.  
4. The same access is performed at the opposing side and the tissue planes are joined.  
5. Once the bony dorsum is reached, a subperiosteal dissection with a Cottle or #9 periosteal elevator creates a pocket over the upper bony vault.

Figure 52.4. Endonasal rhinoplasty incision transecting the scroll area.

6. A Joseph knife is used to sweep any remaining soft tissue attachments from the lateral ULC. Lateral dissection is necessary to allow passive redraping of S-STE after hump resection.  
7. Dorsal height modifications are carried out with a combination of  $\# 10 / \# 15$  blades, chisels, and rasps.  
8. Medial, intermediate, and lateral osteotomies are performed as needed. Medial and intermediate osteotomies are carried out with a straight  $2\mathrm{mm}$  osteotome through the transcartilaginous incision. Lateral osteotomies are carried out through a vestibular approach as previously described.  
9. Attention is next turned to the nasal tip. To expose the LLC, a #15 blade is used to create bilateral marginal incisions along the LLC caudal margins. The incisions extend along the entire caudal aspect of the LLC from lateral crura to medial crura. Using Iris or Converse scissors, dissection continues superficial to the LLC and domes until the previous transcartilaginous dorsal dissection is connected.  
10. The LLC may be delivered through one nostril or the other to carry out the planned shaping, grafting, and suturing maneuvers.  
11. Alar rim modifications and grafting are performed if required.  
12. Incisions are closed with a 5-0 plain gut. A quilt stitch utilizing a 4-0 gut suture on a Keith needle is performed to close the dead space between the nasal mucosa and the septum if nasal cartilage was reshaped or resected.  
13. Steps 18-20 of the open rhinoplasty technique.

# Key Points: Closed (Endonasal) Rhinoplasty

1. Advantages of endonasal rhinoplasty include no external scar, minimal postoperative edema, decreased operating time, and quicker patient recovery. Nasal tip edema after open rhinoplasty may take up to 9-12 months to completely resolve, thus delaying the final appearance of the surgery.  
2. Disadvantages of endonasal rhinoplasty include difficulty in performing complex grafting and tip work, prohibits direct visualization of anatomy, and typically requires a more experienced surgeon. Many modifications are done blindly or require significant tissue distortion to view the changes directly. For this reason, complex procedures and grafting should only be attempted by experienced surgeons familiar with the endonasal approach.

# Correction of Specific Nasal Deformities

# Upper Bony Vault/Middle Cartilaginous Vault

Excessive width: Small reductions may be corrected with reductive lateral osseous rasping and cartilage scoring. Large reductions require nasal osteotomies to medialize nasal bones (see Figure 52.5).

Narrow width: Frequently seen after previous aggressive rhinoplasty. Treatment typically involves nasal osteotomies and spreader graft placement. Medial and lateral osteotomies are performed to lateralize the nasal bones from the bony septum. The cartilaginous septum is dissected from the ULC and spreader grafts are inserted to maintain the new position. Consider camouflage onlay grafts or injectable filler for small defects.

High dorsum: Small dorsal reductions may be rasped (bony) and sharply planed (cartilage) lower. Larger dorsal reductions require an en bloc resection of cartilage and bone (see Figures 52.28 through 52.30 in Case Report 52.2). The cartilage is first incised at the proposed height along each ULC. Intranasal mucosa at the height of the vault is elevated and rolled  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  inferiorly into the nasal cavity. The cartilaginous septum is incised at the new height until the bony septum is encountered. The nasal mucosa is elevated from the underside of the bony vault. A monobevel chisel is used to reduce the bony dorsum to slightly higher than the desired final position. Sharp bony edges are smoothed with a push rasp and finished with a diamond rasp. A gap will frequently exist between the septum and the ULC/nasal bones on each side (open roof deformity). Depending on the presence of pre-existing nasal obstruction and the planned cosmesis, the gap is typically filled with septal cartilage spreader grafts (see Figures 52.31 through 52.33 in Case Report 52.2) and lateral osteotomies (see Figure 52.34) are performed to complete the closure. Any planned correction of a deviated septum must be completed prior to the closure of the open roof deformity. The spreader grafts will also act as barton grafts in reinforcing the straightened septum.

Low dorsum: Typically corrected with dorsal onlay grafting to augment the dorsal height. Augmentation materials include morselized septal cartilage, deep temporal fascia, carved autologous rib, and alloplastic materials. A variant of the low dorsum is the saddle nose deformity. Correction involves large dorsal onlay grafts, frequently silicon implants placed via endonasal access.

Deviated and/or twisted dorsum: Typically results from fractures of the nasal bones, septum, ULC, and/or the ULC insertion on the underside of the nasal bones. Corrected with lateral, intermediate, and medial osteotomies (see Figure 52.5). High septal deformities may require osteotomies of the bony septum. Small defects and asymmetries may be corrected with camouflage onlay grafts or injectable fillers. Septal scoring with batton and spreader grafts may be indicated depending on the specific type of deformity.

incision alone will deproject the nasal tip  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$ . Significant overprojection may be treated with a combination of a full transfixion incision, cephalic trim and crura division, resection, and reconstitution.

Underprojected nasal tip: Minor cases are treated with a columellar strut graft. Significant cases are treated with combinations of columellar strut grafting, shield grafting, and Goldman tip procedure.

Ptotic or derotated nasal tip: Treatment includes cephalic trim, resection of the caudal/dorsal septal angle with the dome rotated toward the septum, and augmentation of the anterior nasal spine for a deficient, acute nasolabial angle. Most techniques that project the tip also cause cephalad tip rotation, particularly if the medial crura are lengthened (columellar strut, shield graft, cap graft, and suturing techniques).

Over-rotated nasal tip: Often seen secondary to previous aggressive rhinoplasty. Treated with camouflage grafts to increase the infratip lobule (shield graft, mastoid fascia graft to infratip). When seen concomitantly with alar rim retraction, alar rim cartilage graft or composite ear graft to alar vestibule should be considered.

Broad, bulbous, or boxy nasal tip: A wide intermediate crura is frequently responsible for broad or boxy tip deformities. This condition may be corrected with a combination of intermediate crura resection, cephalic trim, interdomal sutures, intradomal sutures, structural cartilage grafts (columellar strut, shield, cap graft), and selective defatting of the S-STE in patients with thick sebaceous skin.

# Alar Base and Nostrils

Asymmetric nostrils: Frequently due to caudal septal deviation from the maxillary crest. The caudal septum is straightened with concave surface scoring and reinforced

with batton grafting. The cartilaginous septum is secured to the midline maxillary crest periosteum with 4-0 Poly-L-lactic suture (Wright suture).

Wide alar base: Consider alar cinch suture with 2-0 Nurolon suture. The periosteum must be released around the nasal aperture to facilitate medialization of the ala. Consider alar base resection (Weir incisions) for excessively wide nostrils.

# Postoperative Management

1. The Aquaplast splint and nasal tape are maintained for 7-10 days.  
2. Incisions receive topical antibiotic ointment for 2 days and then moist occlusive petroleum ointment for 5 days.  
3. Plain gut sutures are trimmed flush at 7 days.  
4. Arnica gel is applied to any areas of ecchymosis after 3 days.  
5. Patients are typically seen at postoperative weeks 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24. Patients are reminded that the final result of their rhinoplasty may not be apparent until 9-12 months after surgery due to resolving nasal edema, especially with open rhinoplasty procedures.

# Early Complications

Hemorrhage: Bleeding in the immediate postoperative period is typically from improper usage of local anesthetic, inadvertent mucosal trauma, and bleeding from the vascular turbinate incision after inferior turbinectomy. Bleeding may be minimized with appropriate local anesthetic injection technique, meticulous flap dissection, placing oxymetazoline impregnated sponges into the nasal passages for 5-10 minutes after inferior turbinectomy, and the administration of additional local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor at the end of the procedure if hemostasis is not ideal.

Infection: Rare. Rhinoplasties are generally considered contaminated procedures. Infections are managed with antibiotics, wound debridement, hematoma evacuation, and the removal of infected materials (nasal packing, and alloplastic and autogenous grafts).

Septal hematoma: An unrecognized septal hematoma may lead to infection, ischemia and necrosis of the septal cartilage, and decreased tip support resulting in a saddle nose deformity. Septal hematoma prevention includes meticulous dissection of the mucoperichondrium flaps, hemostasis upon termination of the procedure, the placement of quilting (horizontal mattress) sutures, and early recognition. Treatment involves early evacuation, elimination of the dead space (nasal packing, drain placement, horizontal mattress/quilting sutures), and antibiotic coverage.

Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea: Rare complication. Symptoms include headaches, a clear nasal discharge,

and a salty or metallic postnasal drip. Causes include mucoperichondrium tunneling too far posterior and superior with a Cottle elevator and extending beyond the ethmoid roof and by fracturing the cribriform plate with excessive force during osteotomy/resection of an osseous septal deviation or bone spur. Initial treatment involves prophylactic coverage of meningitis with antibiotics. Persistent CSF rhinorrhea is treated with lumbar drain placement and/or layered repair.

# Late Complications

Septal perforations: Occurs with septal cartilage resection and bilateral mucosal tears in corresponding segments of the septum. Symptoms include nasal crusting, obstruction, dryness, epistaxis, pain, and whistling during nasal inspiration. Large perforations may compromise the structural integrity of the nose and may lead to cosmetic changes including saddle nose deformity. Septal perforations are minimized with meticulous mucoperichondrium flap dissection, repair of intraoperative tears immediately, and close follow-up with excellent nasal hygiene. Delayed repair is often accomplished with bilateral bipedicled mucosal flap advancements.

Synecchia: Typically occurs with opposing damaged mucosal surfaces, but may also occur with infection and nasal trauma. Often occurs at the site of inferior turbinectomy, due to the denuded turbinate site contacting the nasal septal mucosa. Patients with posterior synechiae are frequently asymptomatic. Patients with symptomatic synechiae typically present with obstructive nasal breathing and/or a Starling defect. Prevention of synechiae involves meticulous flap dissection, avoidance of inadvertent and accidental mucosal damage, utilizing nasal splints or nasal packings for 1-2 weeks postsurgery, and septal sutures.

Over-resection: These complications are often the most devastating and difficult to correct. Revision surgery is almost always warranted, and plans should be made to harvest structural cartilage grafts from the ear or rib as necessary.

1. Ptotic nasal tip (over-rotated tip, deprojected tip): Often the result of aggressive cephalic trim, over-resected caudal septum, scar tissue formation, and/or weakened, unsupported medial crura. Treated with columellar strut grafting and/or nasal tip grafting.  
2. Alar rim retraction: Due to aggressive cephalic trim. Consider alar rim strut graft for small retractions. Larger retractions may require composite skincartilage grafts from the anterior conchal bowl to the nasal vestibule.  
3. Uni-tip deformity: Frequently associated with overzealous narrowing and grafting of the nasal tip

coupled with aggressive cephalic trim leading to collapse of ala. Treatment typically consists of alar strut grafts or composite grafts.

4. Keel deformity: Due to closure of an open roof without adequately sized or absent spreader grafts. The dorsum cross-section comes to a point instead of a rounded or square dome. Corrected with nasal osteotomies and generous spreader graft placement.  
5. Internal/external nasal valve collapse: A frequent cause of revision rhinoplasty. Treatment is based on the site of valve collapse.  
6. Saddle nose deformity: Results from undiagnosed septal hematoma with resulting cartilage necrosis, over-resection of the dorsal hump (uncorrected open roof deformity), and failure to preserve sufficient septal cartilage (10mm dorsal and caudal struts). Corrected with combination of spreader grafting, onlay grafting, and nasal osteotomies.

Under-resection: These complications are the result of an incomplete treatment plan or suboptimal execution. They are generally easier to correct than over-resection complications.

1. Pollybeak deformity: Presents as a thick and humped nasal dorsum accompanied with under rotation of the nasal tip, resembling a parrot's beak. Frequently due to under resection of the caudal dorsal septum during correction of a dorsal hump and a loss of tip support. Treatment included revision rhinoplasty with adequate hump reduction and the placement of columellar and nasal tip grafts.  
2. Residual dorsal lumps/bumps: Most noticeable on profile. Typically corrected with reoperation. Small irregularities may be amenable to injectable filler to augment deficiencies.  
3. Residual or new deviation/twisted deformity: Patients with traumatic nasal deformities should always be cautioned preoperatively that complete symmetry is rarely achieved. If gross asymmetry remains after surgery, consider revision rhinoplasty or injectable fillers or grafts to camouflage deficient areas.

# Key Points

1. When performing aesthetic rhinoplasty, the surgeon should always be cognizant of racial and cultural anatomical norms and desires.  
2. The patient's cosmetic and functional goals must be discussed and understood. The unrealistic patient should be educated about likely surgical outcomes.  
3. Imaging provides a tool to facilitate the surgeon-patient conversation. Imaging also provides a

framework for the surgeon to develop an anatomically based rhinoplasty technique treatment plan (see Figures 52.13 and 52.14 in Case Report 52.2). Various computer software programs offer imaging analysis of digital photographs that allow the surgeon to measure and evaluate facial angles, facial proportions, and symmetry and to make visual modifications to preoperative photos that simulate results that are felt to be achievable (see Figures 52.10 and 52.11 in Case Report 52.2). The pre- and post-operative imaging allows the surgeon the ability to virtually plan treatment procedures and outcomes (see Figure 52.12 in Case Report 52.2). The pre- and post-operative imaging is reviewed with the patient to ensure that the patient agrees with the treatment plan and has realistic expectations of surgery. It should be stressed that the imaging is not a guarantee of the final result. Typically, a final treatment plan or outcome is reached between the surgeon and the patient. Alternatively, it may become apparent that the patient has unrealistic goals and the decision to not proceed with surgery may be determined.

4. The surgical approach should be chosen to maximize the opportunity to achieve the desired results while minimizing the destructive nature of the rhinoplasty dissection. The surgeon should choose the technique that is most familiar and predictable.  
5. A Cottle test is performed by applying lateral traction to the cheek and lateral nostril and assessing nasal airflow. A positive Cottle test occurs when lateral cheek-lateral nostril traction improves nasal breathing. The positive Cottle test suggests collapse of nasal valves in general. A more specific test to differentiate between collapse of the internal versus the external nasal valve involves placing a cotton tip applicator into the nostril and selectively elevating the lower lateral cartilage and the upper lateral cartilage on the affected side. Improved breathing with elevation of the lower lateral cartilage coincides with a collapse of the external nasal valve, while improved breathing with elevation of the upper lateral cartilage coincides with a collapse of the internal nasal valve.  
6. Medical management (topical steroids, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and sympathomimetics) is recommended prior to any nasal obstructive surgical procedure in order to assess the true need for surgery. For cases refractory to medical management, surgical intervention is warranted.  
7. For patients with nasal obstruction, a complete work-up to include radiographic evaluation with CT scanning, speculum examination, evaluation of the internal and external nasal valve, and a trial of medical management is required prior to surgical intervention. CT scanning is not only beneficial to

valuate turbinate hypertrophy and septal deviation, but also crucial in identifying nontraditional causes of obstruction such as neoplasms, congenital disorders (choanal stenosis), and foreign bodies. Speculum examination should be performed to evaluate for conditions such as turbinate hypertrophy, septal deviation, synechiae, papilloma formation, tissue inflammation, and septal perforations. Identification of preoperative nasal septal perforations in the previously unoperated patient may be a sign of cocaine abuse.  
8. Consideration should be given to the thickness of the skin-soft tissue envelope (S-STE). Appropriate dorsal hump reduction and tip refining techniques are directly affected by this often under-appreciated aspect of the nose.  
9. Care should be taken when elevating mucoperichondrial flap over areas of septal deviation and bone spurs in order to minimize tears.  
10. When harvesting septal cartilage, the largest feasible caudal and dorsal strut should be preserved (minimum of  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$ ) in order to provide support for the nose.  
11. When performing a cephalic trim, at least  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of LLC width must be preserved to ensure adequate support and to avoid nasal tip and columella deformities.  
12. In general, it is better to err on the side of under treatment and under resection as complications are easier to correct. Over treatment typically requires complex grafting techniques and distant graft harvest.

Case Report 52.2. Open rhinoplasty. A 42-year-old female presents with a chief complaint that she has an "old looking" nose and would like the tip elevated and narrowed. She reports mild nasal obstruction on the left while working out. Her past medical history is unremarkable. Her physical examination reveals: Fitzpatrick sun reactive type II, Glogau wrinkle score III, and moderately thick, sebaceous skin. The upper vault is mildly wide with a slight depression of the left nasal bone. The middle vault is similarly wide with depression of the left lateral wall. A moderate dorsal hump is present that is equally bony and cartilaginous. The nasal tip is wide, bulbous, and slightly ptotic. The alar base is of appropriate width. Profile examination of the nasal tip shows a retracted columella with a  $90^{\prime}$  nasolabial angle. The tip is slightly overprojected. Intranasal examination reveals a deviated septum in the mid-body to the dorsum. Turbinates are normal. Functional examination reveals no obstruction with normal breathing and left middle vault collapse/obstruction with dynamic breathing. A Cottle test was positive on the left.

Standard preoperative photographs were taken and consisted of anterior-posterior view (see Figure 52.6),

$\frac{3}{4}$  views (see Figure 52.7), lateral views (see Figure 52.8), and worm's eye view (see Figure 52.9). All preoperative and postoperative photographs are taken in the same manner and with the Frankfurt plane (auriculo-orbital plane) parallel to the floor.

# Treatment Plan

1. Full transfixion incision for septal access: quadrangular resection of septum with preservation of dorsal/caudal struts, release of footplate/septum attachment, and tip set back  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  with reattachment of footplates to septum.  
2. Open approach rhinoplasty.  
3. Nasal tip modifications: columellar strut, cephalic trim, interdomal sutures, and shield graft.  
4. Dorsum modifications: resection of dorsal hump (cartilage and bone), correction of deviated septum with scoring and batton/spreader graft placement.  
5. Lateral nasal osteotomies

Postoperative photographs are taken at 1 year (see Figures 52.40 through 52.42) and 7 years (see Figures 52.43 through 52.45). The patient has subsequently undergone facial volumizing with fillers and fat grafting and a neck lift. Subtle refining changes are noticeable within the nose between the 1- and 7-year follow-up.

Case Report 52.3. Open rhinoplasty. A 21-year-old female presents with a chief complaint that she has a "large hump and bulbous nose." She reports no nasal obstruction. Her past medical history is unremarkable. Her physical examination reveals Fitzpatrick sun reactive type II and Glogau wrinkle score I. A large dorsal hump is present that is equally bony and cartilaginous. The nasal tip is wide, bulbous, and slightly ptotic. The alar base is of appropriate width. Intranasal examination reveals no deviation with normal turbinates. Functional examination reveals no obstruction with normal breathing.

Standard preoperative photographs were taken and consisted of anterior-posterior view (see Figure 52.46), three-quarters view, lateral views (see Figure 52.47), and worm's eye view.
