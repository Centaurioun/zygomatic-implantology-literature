The reconstruction of congenital anterior maxillary alveolus and maxilla defects, and the closure of associated oronasal fistulae.

# Indications

1. To provide adequate bone stock for the eruption and orthodontic movement of teeth within the region of a maxillary cleft  
2. Closure of oronasal fistulae  
3. Improvement of facial aesthetics by providing osseous support to the nasal base and continuity to the dentoalveolar arches  
4. To establish continuity of the premaxilla in bilateral cases for potential future orthognathic procedures  
5. To provide bone stock for implant placement if required

# Contraindication

1. Active infection  
2. Poor patient compliance with oral hygiene  
3. Collapsed lesser segment requiring arch expansion. Eruption needs of canine will take precedence in the situation where canine is approaching eruption into the cleft, yet expansion has not been completed.

# Technique

1. The patient is positioned supine and orally intubated with an oral RAE endotracheal tube.  
2. The neck is hyperextended for better visualization of the palate and alveolar process. A throat pack is placed within the posterior oropharynx. The patient is prepped in standard fashion to include the nasal passages. If bone is to be harvested from the anterior hip, the anterior iliac crest bone graft (AICBG) site is prepped and an Ioban, transparent dressing is placed (see Case Report 62.2 in Chapter 62 for details regarding pediatric anterior hip graft technique). The patient is draped to allow for exposure of the oral cavity, nasal passages, and AICBG site as a separate field (see Figures 32.6 and 32.11 in Case Report 32.1).

3. Marcaine containing a vasoconstrictor is injected along the palate, nasal floor, maxillary vestibule, and attached and unattached tissue of the anterior maxilla or cleft. The local anesthesia needle is used as a probe and allows the operator to determine the extent of the cleft and the position of the bone prior to making an incision. In cases involving a complete bilateral cleft with a mobile anterior segment, injection of the anterior segment with a vasoconstrictor is contraindicated due to the tenuous blood supply to the segment.  
4. An incision is initiated along the lateral aspect of the cleft (see Figure 32.1). A #15 blade is utilized to create a full-thickness mucoperiosteal incision along the lateral aspect of the cleft overlying sound bone. The anterior aspect of the incision extends to the height of the maxillary vestibule, and the posterior aspect of the incision extends along the posterior border of the cleft along the hard palate (see Figure 32.7 in Case Report 32.1). The incision should divide the oral and nasal mucosa.  
5. The incision is extended laterally utilizing buccal and palatal sulcular incisions. The lateral extent of the incision extends to the distal aspect of the last molar and terminates with a buccal superior releasing incision (see Figure 32.2). It is important to bring this release straight vertically to allow for anterior rotation and coverage of the cleft site.  
6. The medial incision extends in an intrasulcular fashion along the buccal and palatal surfaces of the teeth and terminates at the contralateral lateral incisor for unilateral clefts (see Figure 32.2). The medial incision terminates at the midline for bilateral clefts.  
7. A subperiosteal dissection is utilized to expose the piriform aperture, the anterior nasal spine, and the floor of the nose. Supernumerary or malformed teeth are extracted at this time. Care is taken to avoid exposure of the crown of developing impacted canine teeth. If the crown of an impacted canine tooth is exposed during the cleft dissection, strong consideration for the extraction of the tooth should be made. Grafting procedures adjacent to the crown of an exposed tooth significantly decrease the overall success rate of the graft.

8. In cases where a fistula is present, a subperiosteal, full-thickness tissue dissection is initiated along the internal aspect of the cleft and is extended superiorly along the lateral walls of the cleft to the floor of the nose (see Figure 32.8 in Case Report 32.1) and the cartilaginous nasal septum. The tissue reflected from the internal aspect of the cleft is carefully elevated, inverted, and sutured together to form a new nasal barrier. The tissue edges are sutured together using 4-0 Vicryl sutures with the knot residing within the nasal cavity and in a horizontal mattress fashion, resulting in the tissue edges being inverted within the nasal cavity (see Figure 32.3).

9. Once the oronasal fistula is repaired, a nasal bulb with normal saline is placed within the cleft side nostril and irrigated while viewing the nasal floor. This allows testing for watertight closure (see Figure 32.10 in Case Report 32.1).  
10. The palatal mucosa is then closed in a horizontal mattress fashion with the knots remaining on the oral mucosa side. This will create the pocket to receive the bone graft.  
11. A collagen or amniotic membrane may be trimmed and adapted to the nasal floor.  
12. Periosteal releasing incisions are made within the full-thickness mucoperiosteal tissue reflections, and the labial mucosa is advanced until the tissue can

Figure 32.1 Incision is initiated along the lateral aspect of the cleft overlying sound bone within the keratinized tissue lateral to the cleft. The anterior aspect of the incision extends to the height of the maxillary vestibule, and the posterior aspect of the incision extends along the posterior border of the cleft within the hard palate.

Figure 32.2 The incision extends medially to the canine and laterally to the tuberosity. The nasal mucosa is inverted and closed, and grafting material is placed within the cleft defect.

easily be approximated over the cleft defect without tension.

13. Grafting material is placed within the cleft defect and compacted to eliminate dead space (see Figure 32.12 in Case Report 32.1). The authors prefer to use either bone marrow from the anterior hip (see Figure 32.11 in Case Report 32.1) or a mixture of mineralized and demineralized human cadaveric bone combined with bone morphogenic protein (BMP) depending on the size and nature of the cleft and specific patient needs. The grafted area should extend from the nasal floor to the alveolar crest (see Figure 32.3).  
14. The mucoperiosteal tissue elevations are closed over the grafted defect and membrane in a tension-free manner (see Figure 32.13 in Case Report 32.1). Additional releasing incisions, subperiosteal dissection, and/or periosteal scoring are accomplished in order to obtain a tension-free primary closure (see Figure 32.4).

![](images/e2f85103336553e51513e06a70ae5585c9b4e772dca6a6acd12cefa8bc92dd73.jpg)  
Figure 32.4 The oral mucosa advancement flaps are primarily closed in a tension-free manner.

15. In the case of a bilateral cleft, the procedure described in steps 1 through 14 would be performed with a few modifications:

a. A preoperative impression must be taken and a hard acrylic splint fabricated to provide stabilization to the premaxillary segment. Note, the premaxilla is only connected via the cartilaginous septum, so some movement is expected prior to stabilization. Having orthodontic appliances in place preoperatively facilitates securing the device intraoperatively.  
b. The subperiosteal dissection of the premaxillary segment is limited bilaterally to prevent loss of blood supply. The incision and dissection can be carried to the distal aspect of the lateral or central incisors.  
c. Bone expansion may be needed with BMP, allogenic bone materials, or both.  
d. Posterior segment flap advancement needs will be greater due to limited premaxillary dissection. If the degree of advancement cannot be attained with this limited stripping, one may consider completing a single side as a first stage, followed by the contralateral side at a later date.

16. At the conclusion of the procedure, the patient receives liposomal bupivacaine injections at the donor site and cleft site. A 25-gauge or greater diameter needle must be used.

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients receiving an AICBG are admitted for 23-hour observation. If a patient undergoes grafting with allogenic bone and BMP, they are discharged same day, unless additional medical history necessitates admission.  
2. Meticulous oral hygiene is mandatory to minimize the risk of infection. Peridex is supplied to aid in this endeavor.  
3. Nasal decongestants are prescribed.  
4. Pureed diet for 6 weeks is recommended.  
5. Physical activity should be limited for 4-6 weeks. Swimming is restricted for 2-3 weeks.  
6. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics are utilized for pain control.  
7. Antibiotics are continued for 5 days postoperatively.  
8. Postoperative imaging is obtained after 4-5 months of healing. However, bone consolidation may continue beyond this point.

# Complications

1. Infection: Infections are rare and typically result from inadequate oral hygiene in the immediate postoperative period or from the exposure of a retained impacted tooth. Infections may result in loss of the graft and the creation of larger oronasal fistulae.  
2. Failure of spontaneous eruption: Although rare, canines that fail to erupt through the grafted alveolar

segment may be surgically exposed following graft consolidation in a manner no different from that seen in noncleft patients.

3. Graft loss: Common reasons for graft loss include infection and inadequate soft tissue coverage. Meticulous attention is paid to achieving a tension-free closure of the overlying mucosal flaps. A small intraoral dehiscence may be effectively treated with local debridement and typically will not result in complete graft loss. Some graft size reduction is expected after all grafting procedures (especially in compromised areas) and is not considered a complication. Over grafting is recommended provided sufficient soft tissue coverage.

4. Maxillary growth restriction: Maxillary growth restrictions are frequently associated with primary (time of cleft lip repair) grafting procedures and present as asymmetric maxillary hypoplasia resulting from scar tissue formation from the initial grafting procedure. This is not to be mistaken for symmetric maxillary hypoplasia that is often present in cleft patients regardless of surgical correction. Definitive treatment involves widening the palate and maxillary advancement surgery via orthognathic surgery or distraction osteogenesis once skeletal maturity is reached (14-18 years of age).

# Key Points

1. Bone grafting within the maxilla may be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the timing of surgical intervention. Primary grafting (less than 1 year of age with cleft lip repair), however, has been associated with adverse effects on maxillary skeletal growth, and, as a result, secondary grafting procedures are preferred. Tertiary bone grafting refers to repeat bone grafting of the cleft site for periodontal support, or increased bone volume for implant placement at skeletal maturity.  
2. Secondary bone grafting of maxillary dentoalveolar clefts is typically performed during the mixed-dentition stage prior to the eruption of the involved canine, ideally between the ages of 9 and 11 years. Higher success rates are achieved when grafting is performed when the canine root is approximately two-thirds formed and the clinical crown is completely encased in bone. Occasionally, early secondary grafting (prior to eruption of lateral incisor), may be completed if the lateral incisor is present and appears to possess appropriate anatomy on imaging.  
3. Bilateral maxillary clefts require limited stripping during alveolar grafting. Occasionally, a premaxillary setback or two-stage grafting procedure may be useful.  
4. Incisions are ideally placed within areas that will allow for the eruption of impacted teeth through keratinized tissue in order to ensure optimal periodontal support.

this is not always possible due to the relative lack of keratinized tissue in the cleft area.

5. Both autogenous (donor sites include the hip, calvaria, tibia, mandible) and allogenic grafting material have been used with success to reconstruct dentoalveolar clefts. High success rates have been achieved using recombinant bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) with demineralized bone matrix as an off-label substitute for autogenous grafts in both initial and salvage procedures.  
6. Supernumerary or malformed teeth are removed either preoperatively or at the time of graft placement depending on the needs of the patient. Exposed canines within the cleft contribute to the failure of grafting procedures. Care should be taken to minimize clinical crown exposure, and if significant exposure occurs, consideration should be made to extracting the exposed canine.  
7. Collagen or amniotic membranes may or may not be placed, depending on the surgeon's preference, the size of the cleft, and the ability to achieve primary closure of the mucoperiosteal tissue flaps.  
8. Immobilization of the premaxillary segment in patients with bilateral clefts is crucial to minimize the potential for non-union. Splints may be utilized to provide stability and are typically left in place for 6-8 weeks postoperatively.  
9. Orthodontic treatment should resume 6 weeks after the closure of oronasal fistulae and successful graft placement. Passive orthodontics remain in place during this period to aid in stability across the segment.  
10. Significant lip and nose changes are expected with bilateral cleft reconstruction. As such, delayed lip-nose revisions are recommended over simultaneous procedures with grafting.  
11. Tertiary bone grafting procedures are necessary prior to endosteal implant placement in approximately  $40\%$  of cases. However, even with sufficient hard tissue volume, there is often a lack of keratinized tissue present within the edentulous site, which leads to non-ideal periodontium and increased risk of future implant failure. Therefore, it is imperative that the restoring dentist is actively involved with the treatment planning of these patients prior to their grafting procedure. Careful consideration should be made when comparing implants versus fixed prosthodontics. Appropriately positioned and axially loaded dental implants have the advantage of stimulating graft retention.  
12. In certain cases, canine substitution may be utilized to approximate the canine to the central incisor. This has shown favorable aesthetics once the canine undergoes appropriate lateralization. This has the benefit over implants in that the edentulous space can be restored prior to skeletal maturity.

Figure 32.6. The nasolabial fistula and the narrow cleft alveolus are visualized. Despite the mucosal surfaces being in contact, the fistula communicates with the nasal cavity. There are two components of the cleft dissection on the buccal surface. There are full-thickness incisions and partial-thickness incisions. This transition can be seen at the blue arrows. Above this point, there is no bone deep to the dissection. The dissection will be carried deep with either a 15 blade or tenotomy scissors.
