# Definitions

Internal derangement: An abnormal relationship involving the articular disc, condyle, and articular eminence.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A non-ionizing radiation modality utilizing magnetic frequencies and radiofrequencies in image generation. MRI provides cross-sectional multiplanar images that illustrate both soft and osseous tissue abnormalities of the joint, surrounding structures, and dynamic assessment of condylar translation and disc movement (with open and closed views).

T1-weighted MRI images: The anatomy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is clearly defined, and the articular disc is distinctly visible. Fluids are hypointense, whereas fats are hyperintense.

T2-weighted MRI images: Useful for visualizing degenerative periarticular changes and the presence of joint effusions. Fluids are hyperintense in T2-weighted images.

Technitium-99m (T99m) bone scan: T99m is a radioactive compound, which is useful in determining active bone metabolism. The compound uptake depends on osseous blood flow and osteogenesis. Common uses include utilization in determining active condylar growth (i.e., condylar hyperplasia) and bone tumors.

Postgadolinium dynamic enhancement: Contrast agent used to enhance retrodiscal inflammation. Gadolinium can cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (i.e., nephrogenic fibrosing dermatopathy) in patients with diminished renal function.

# Anatomy

Articular disc: Composed of dense fibrous connective tissue that is nonvascular and non-innervated. The articular disc can be divided into three distinct regions: a thickened anterior and posterior band, and a central intermediate zone. The three distinct regions of the articular disc contribute to the bowtie morphology as seen in sagittal T1-weighted closed-mouth MRI images. The central intermediate zone is the thinnest area, and the area under function between the condylar head and the articular eminence during translation. The posterior band is the thickest area and attaches to the retrodiscal tissues. The normal position of the posterior band in relation to the condyle is the 12 o'clock position in open and closed views. The normal position of the central intermediate zone in relation to the condyle is the 10 o'clock position in the open and closed views.

Retrodiscal tissues: The posterior band of the articular disc is continuous with the highly innervated and highly vascular retrodiscal tissues located within the bilaminar zone. Compression of the retrodiscal tissue is a potential source of TMJ discomfort.

Bilaminar zone: Posteriorly the disc blends with the bilaminar zone, which is composed of the superior and inferior retrodiscal lamina.

Superior retrodiscal lamina: Composed predominately of elastic fibers, which provide the posterior attachment of the articular disc to the tympanic plate and to the external auditory canal perichondrium. Functions to resist extreme translatory disc movements.

Inferior retrodiscal lamina: Composed of dense, longitudinally oriented fibers that attach the articular disc to the posterior condyle. Functions in preventing extreme rotation of the disc with rotational movements of the condyle.

Figure 37.1 illustrates the articular disc in its normal position.

# Five Temporomandibular Joint Ligaments

1. Medial and lateral collateral (discal) ligament: Attaches the articular disc to the medial and lateral condylar head (see Figure 37.4 in Case Report 37.1). Separates the joint into superior and inferior compartments. Allows the disc to rotate on the condylar head.  
2. Capsular ligament: Attaches to the condylar head anteriorly, posteriorly, medially, and laterally to surround the entire joint maintaining the synovial fluid compartment. Originates superiorly from the articular fossa and inserts inferiorly to surround the condylar head. Prevents inferior distracting forces of the condyle.  
3. Temporomandibular ligament: Origins at the articular tubercle and zygomatic process, and inserts along the lateral pole and lateral aspect of the condyle. Limits inferior distraction and posterior movement of the condyles.  
4. Sphenomandibular ligament: Origins from the spine of the sphenoid bone and inserts onto the lingula. Provides medial support of the TMJ.  
5. Stylomandibular ligament: Origins from the styloid process and inserts onto the angle of the mandible. Limits protrusive movements of the TMJ.

Innervation of the TMJ: The auriculotemporal, masseteric, and deep temporal nerves.

Vascularization of the TMJ: Multiple vessels participate in the vascularization of the joint, including the superficial temporal, middle meningeal, internal maxillary, deep auricular, anterior tympanic, and ascending pharyngeal vessels.

# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Technique

T1- and T2-weighted image with thin slices (1–3 mm) in open- and closed-mouth orientation with axial, coronal, and sagittal reformating. The technician must ensure that the MRIs are aligned such that the sections will be oriented along the long axis of the condyle and the entire joint space and surrounding structures are captured.

# Articular Disc Function and Common Disorders

Normal articular disc function: Normal translation involves maintenance of the central intermediate zone of the disc between the condylar head and the articular eminence during opening and closing. This process is represented on an MRI with the posterior band of the disc located at the 12 o'clock position and the central intermediate zone of the articular disc located at the 10 o'clock position in relation to the condyle on both open and closed views (see Figures 37.2-37.4 in Case Report 37.1).

Anterior displaced disc with reduction (ADDWR): Typically presents as a limited opening with or without clicking after excessive function severs the superior retrodiscal lamina. When anteriorly displaced, the classic bowtie appearance of the disc is altered to an elliptical shape. This process is represented on an MRI with the posterior band of the disc located anterior to the condylar head in the closed view, but with a normal disc-condyle relationship in the open view.

Anterior displaced disc with reduction (ADDWOR): Typically presents as the inability to open after excessive function severs the superior retrodiscal lamina. This process is represented on an MRI with the posterior band of the disc located anterior to the condylar head in both open and closed views (see Figure 37.5 in Case Report 37.2). Adequate open views are frequently difficult to obtain due to limited opening from the mechanical obstruction of the anteriorly displaced disc.

# Key Points

1. For patients undergoing MRI evaluation with limited opening due to discomfort, it is important to obtain a vertical opening of at least  $20 - 25\mathrm{mm}$  in order to ensure adequate translation of the discs for open view evaluation. Failure to obtain adequate opening will impair the ability to evaluate the translation of the disc. Patients are often given a mouth prop or bite block to

utilize during imaging to ensure adequate open views and to minimize inadvertent movement.

2. When evaluating a TMJ MRI, the articular disc morphology and the relationship between the articular disc, the mandibular condyle, the articular eminence, and the glenoid fossa are evaluated in both open and closed views.  
3. The mandibular condyle is evaluated for irregularities such as erosion, flattening, resorption, sclerosis, osteo

# Case Reports

# Case Report 37.1. Normal articular disc position.

A 24-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of left-sided facial pain on jaw functioning. The patient has no appreciable joint sounds or dysfunction. On examination, no occlusal discrepancies were identified. The patient demonstrated normal forward and lateral mandibular protrusions and displayed a maximum vertical opening of  $25\mathrm{mm}$  without pain and  $40\mathrm{mm}$  with pain. Bilateral

dral marrow edema, and intracapsular fractures. The articular eminence and glenoid fossa are evaluated for morphology and air cells. The joint cavity itself is evaluated for hemar-throses, effusions, masses, and synovitis.  
4. Although anterior displacement of the disc is the most common type of displacement, the disc may also be displaced posteriorly, laterally, and/or medially in relation to the condyle.

open- and closed-mouth MRI demonstrated no joint abnormalities, no disc irregularities, and normal translation of the disc on open and closed views. No condyle anomalies or effusions were noted. The patient was diagnosed with myofascial pain and treated with conservative therapy consisting of a monoplane occlusal splint, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and a soft mechanical diet (see Figures 37.2, 37.3, and 37.4).

Case Report 37.2. Anteriorly displaced articular disc without reduction (ADDWOR). A 19-year-old male presents with chief complaints of recent left-sided facial pain and limited opening. The patient reports a subluxation of his TMJ after extreme opening. The subluxation was reduced by an emergency room physician. The patient presents 4 days after reduction with moderate pain located within his left TMJ and limited opening.

An MRI was obtained, and the T1-weighted sagittal open and closed views demonstrated an anteriorly displaced disc without reduction. The patient was successfully treated with arthrocentesis of the symptomatic joint, a soft mechanical diet, restriction of extreme opening, and a short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see Figure 37.5).

Case Report 37.3. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) effusion. A 32-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of right-sided TMJ pain without dysfunction. T1-weighted open and closed images demonstrate no signs of disc displacement, no evidence of condylar anomalies, and normal translation of the disc. T2-weighted images

strate a hyperintense signal within the right joint space on open and closed views consistent with a joint effusion. The patient was successfully treated with conservative therapy utilizing a soft mechanical diet, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 3 months of splint usage (see Figure 37.6).

Case Report 37.4. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) mass. A 58-year-old male presents 5 weeks after a blow to the chin with a chief complaint of limited opening  $(10\mathrm{mm})$ , right-sided TMJ pain, and malocclusion. The patient did not seek treatment until 5 weeks after the insult. T1- and T2-weighted MRI were obtained

and demonstrated a soft tissue mass within the right joint space and an anteriorly displaced disc without reduction. The patient was treated with open arthroplasty, removal of the mass (granulation tissue), and posterior disc repositioning using a Mitek anchor (see Figure 37.7).

Case Report 37.5. Facial asymmetry in growing patient. An 18-year-old patient presents with a chief complaint of increasing facial asymmetry appreciated over the past 12 months. An orthopantomogram demonstrated left condylar hyperplasia. A T99m-scan was attained and noted increased uptake of radiotracer within

the left mandibular condyle. The patient was reappointed for a repeat scan in 6 months to determine cessation of his hyperplastic condition. The patient will undergo surgical correction of their skeletal deformity once growth stabilizes (see Figure 37.8).
