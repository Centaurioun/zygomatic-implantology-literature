A method of correcting cosmetic and functional defects of the frontal sinus via obliterating nonfunctional nasofrontal ducts (NFDs) and reconstructing the anatomy of the anterior table. A method of prophylactically minimizing the formation of mucoceles and pyoceles by removing respiratory mucosa from the frontal sinus. A method of removing displaced posterior table segments via craniotomy and cranialization.

# Indications to Frontal Sinus Obliteration

1. Significant anterior table displacement  
2. Significant anterior table comminution  
3. Foreign body within the frontal sinus, contaminated site  
4. Potential injury to NFDs  
5. Cosmetic deformity

# Indication for Frontal Sinus Cranialization

1. Significant posterior table displacement  
2. Significant posterior table comminution  
3. Penetrating injury  
4. Foreign body within the anterior cranial fossa  
5. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak with extensive dural tears  
6. Frontal lobe damage or need for craniotomy access

# Contraindications for Surgical Management of Anterior Table Frontal Sinus Fractures

1. No evidence of NFD damage on computed tomography (CT) scanning, and minimal cosmetic defect  
2. Medically unstable

# Contraindications for Surgical Management of Posterior Table Frontal Sinus Fractures

1. Nondisplaced posterior table fractures  
2. Medically unstable

# Anatomy

The frontal sinus begins to develop at age 6 and is completely developed by age 12-16. The floor of the frontal sinus is formed medially by the ethmoid bones and laterally by the supraorbital roof. The entire frontal sinus is lined with pseudostratified ciliated respiratory epithelium. The cilia beat backward and medial to lateral as they push mucus into the NFDs, which drain below the middle meatus, anterior to the ethmoid infundibulum.

# Coronal Incision Layers

1. Skin  
2. Subcutaneous connective tissue  
3. Galea aponeurotica  
4. Loose areolar subgaleal connective tissue  
5. Pericranium

# Surgical Management of Anterior Table Frontal Sinus Fractures

1. The patient is positioned in  $30^{\circ}$  reverse Trendelenburg. The head is placed within a Mayfield headrest (with or without three-pin skull fixation), and the head is positioned in  $15 - 20^{\circ}$  extension. The scalp is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  
2. Triple-antibiotic ointment and a comb may be utilized to create a horizontal part within the patient's hairline approximately  $5\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the patient's hairline. Alternatively, a strip of hair may be shaved within the site of the proposed coronal incision. For patients with signs of male pattern baldness, it is acceptable to place the incision more posteriorly in order to minimize the potential for a noticeable scar.  
3. Local anesthesia containing epinephrine is injected along the incision line, and tumescent solution is deposited within the loose areolar subgaleal connective tissue in order to further aid in hemostasis and to

hydro-dissect this layer from the underlying pericranium (see Figure 22.7 in Case Report 22.1).

4. A scalloped coronal incision (see Figure 22.5 in Case Report 22.1) is created from preauricular region to preauricular region. The inferior extent of the incision is determined by the amount of exposure required. The forehead and supraorbital regions can be accessed by limiting the inferior incision to the level of the auricular helix. Access to the zygomatic arch requires a preauricular extension to the level of the ear lobe (see Figure 22.6 in Case Report 22.1).  
5. Scalp bleeding is controlled with either Raney clips or needle-tipped cautery.  
6. Elevation of the coronal flap occurs within the subgaleal loose areolar connective tissue just superficial to the pericranium (see Figure 22.8 in Case Report 22.1). The temporal and preauricular plane of dissection is superficial to the temporalis fascia (see Figure 22.9 in Case Report 22.1). Care is taken during coronal flap design and reflection to preserve pericranial attachments for the use of a pedicled, vascularized pericranial flap (see Figure 22.19 in Case Report 22.1).  
7. The anterior table of the frontal sinus is removed in order to allow for wide surgical access of the frontal sinus. The peripheral margins of the frontal sinus can be identified with instrumentation (see Figure 22.11 in Case Report 22.1) and/or a fiberoptic light source (see Figure 22.10 in Case Report 22.1). The anterior table may be removed with any combination of saws, burs (see Figure 22.12 in Case Report 22.1), chisels, and/or ronguers. The use of saws and burs will frequently allow for the anatomical repositioning of the removed segments at the completion of the frontal sinus exploration or obliteration.  
8. Once all bony fragments from the anterior table have been removed, the NFDs are evaluated for trauma and patency. Patency is determined by placing a sterile medium within the frontal sinus (propofol, methylene blue, or sterile water) and observing for drainage from the nasal cavity or posterior oral pharynx. Frontal sinuses with patent NFDs are repaired by anatomically reconstructing the anterior table. If damage to the NFDs is suspected, a curette and/or handpiece is utilized to remove bony septi and mucosa from within the NFDs and from the entire frontal sinus (see Figures 22.14 through 22.18).  
9. The NFDs are obliterated with temporalis muscle and fibrin sealant (see Figures 22.21 and 22.22 in Case Report 22.1). A pedicled pericranial flap is laid within the frontal sinus (see Figure 22.23 in Case Report 22.1). In cases where the pericranial flap does not completely fill the frontal sinus defect, either abdominal fat or a custom PEEK implant may be utilized to obliterate the frontal sinus defect.

10. Depending on the comminution of the anterior table, the original segments of the anterior table are anatomically repositioned and secured with rigid fixation (see Figure 22.25 in Case Report 22.1), or a titanium mesh is placed.  
11. The coronal incision is closed in a three-layered fashion: 2-0 interrupted Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the galea, 3-0 Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon sutures or skin staples to close the skin. If a preauricular extension was required, the subcutaneous tissues are closed with 4-0 Monocryl sutures, and 5-0 plain gut sutures are used to close the skin (see Figure 22.26 in Case Report 22.1).  
12. A thin layer of triple-antibiotic ointment, an overlying telfa dressing, and a light pressure dressing are placed over the incisions. Drains are typically not required with adequate closure.

# Surgical Management of Posterior Table Frontal Sinus Fractures

1. Steps 1-6 of the surgical management of anterior table frontal sinus fractures are performed. It is recommended that three-pin Mayfield skull fixation is utilized to prevent movement of the head during craniotomy.  
2. A perforator drill and craniotomy are utilized to perform an anterior craniotomy (see Figure 22.33 in Case Report 22.2) to remove both the anterior and the posterior table of the frontal sinus and to provide access to the anterior cranial fossa. Care is taken to not penetrate the superior sagittal sinus posterior to its origin at the foramen cecum of the frontal bone.  
3. A blunt-ended Penfield elevator is utilized to separate the dura from the overlying calvarium prior to elevating and removing the craniotomy segment. For noncomminuted fractures, the anterior and posterior tables of the frontal sinus are removed en bloc. For comminuted table fractures, the bone fragments are removed, providing wide surgical access to the anterior cranial fossa.  
4. All respiratory mucosa and septi are removed from the bone segments on the back table (see Figure 22.37 in Case Report 22.2).  
5. The posterior table is removed in order to allow forward herniation (cranialization) of the frontal lobes into the frontal sinus (see Figure 22.38 in Case Report 22.2).  
6. The anterior cranial fossa is inspected, and appropriate neurosurgical intervention is performed. Bone shards and foreign bodies are removed. The dura is inspected for tears, and repairs are made as needed (see Figure 22.38 in Case Report 22.2). If the anterior frontal dura mater is disrupted, direct watertight repair can

be difficult because the dura is thin and the working space under the frontal lobes is limited. In order to minimize postoperative CSF fistula formation through the cribriform plate, a pedicled galea rotational flap can be inserted between the dura and the cribriform plate, with or without an additional layer of dural substitutes (e.g., Duragen or Duraform).

7. Respiratory mucosa is removed from the NFDs, and the NFDs are obliterated.  
8. The anterior table is anatomically repositioned provided sufficient segment size exists (see Figure 22.42 in Case Report 22.2). Reinforced mesh (see Figure 22.43 in Case Report 22.2) or custom implants are placed based on the severity of the injury, the ability to reposition the anterior table segments, and the reconstruction of potential cosmetic defects to the anterior calvarium.  
9. Steps 11-12 of the surgical management of anterior table frontal sinus fractures are performed.

# Postoperative Management

1. Intravenous analgesics and anti-emetics are administered based on symptoms.  
2. A short course of intravenous steroids is administered.  
3. Postoperative antibiotics are given based on the contamination of the wound and serial examinations during the postoperative period.  
4. Incisions are cared for with meticulous incision management and the application of triple-antibiotic ointment for 5-7 days.  
5. Drains and pressure dressings are typically removed at 48-72 hours postoperatively.  
6. Follow-up CT scans are performed at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 5 years, and 10 years postoperatively in order to identify mucoceles, pyococeles, abscess formation, and osteomyelitis.

# Complications of Frontal Sinus Fractures

1. CSF rhinorrhea: Results from fractures of the posterior table and/or cribriform plate. CSF rhinorrhea is detected via B2 transferrin testing (most accurate), ring testing, and glucose concentration testing of nasal secretions.  
2. Neurologic disorders: From damage to the underlying frontal lobe and associated structures.  
3. Meningitis: May develop from either CSF leak or traumatic blockage of the NFDs.  
4. Osteomyelitis: May result after surgery. More commonly results from long-term infections of the frontal sinus from nonsurgical treatment at the time of initial injury.  
5. Mucoceles and pyoceles: Mucoceles are the most common chronic complication associated with operated and non-operated frontal sinus fractures. Mucoceles are formed from chronic secretions of mucous within a paranasal sinus, often as a result of a non-functioning,

blocked (i.e., polyp) or damaged sinus ostium. Within the frontal sinus, the etiology is typically from damage to the nasal frontal ducts during an initial trauma that is left untreated, or from frontal sinus surgery with incomplete removal of the pseudostratified ciliated respiratory epithelium that lines the frontal sinus. Symptoms of frontal sinus mucoceles may include pain, swelling, exophthalmos, diplopia, and loss of vision. Erosive mucoceles may develop meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, pneumocephalus, or CSF fistula formation. A pyocele or mucopyocele results when a mucocele becomes secondarily infected (see Figure 22.1). Treatment of both mucoceles and mucopyoceles consists of exploration of the frontal sinus with curettage or ostectomy of mucoceles, pyoceles, and surrounding involved bone, nasal frontal duct obliteration, and either frontal sinus obliteration or cranialization. With erosive mucoceles or pyoceles, adjacent damages structures require repair.

6. Anosmia: Results from damage to the cribriform plate.  
7. Cosmetic defect and contour deformities: Corrected initially with the anatomical repositioning of noncomminuted anterior table segments and/or the use of titanium mesh. Postoperative defects are treated with bone grafts, custom implants, and fillers.  
8. **Brain abscess:** Results from sinus bacteria contamination, displaced skull fractures, foreign bodies, contaminated wounds, and poor surgical techniques. Symptoms include headache, seizures, fever, fatigue, malaise, vision changes, and elevated white blood cell counts. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and exploratory surgery to remove the etiology of the abscess.

# Key Points

1. The goal of frontal sinus surgery is to create a "safe sinus." When the NFDs are damaged/non-patent, all respiratory mucosa must be removed in order to minimize the formation of mucoceles and pyoceles.  
2. NFDs must be evaluated and their patency determined. This is accomplished by placing an angiocatheter into the NFDs, introducing a sterile liquid medium (propofol, normal saline, sterile infant milk, methylene blue, or fluorescein), and watching for the emergence of the liquid from beneath the middle meatus within the nose or its collection within the posterior oral pharynx.  
3. Nondisplaced frontal sinus fractures without evidence of NFD damage are managed nonsurgically.  
4. Anterior (outer) table fractures with damage to the NFDs are managed with exploration of the frontal sinus, the removal of all respiratory mucosa from the frontal sinus, obliteration of the NFDs and frontal sinus, and the reconstruction of the anterior table (frontal sinus obliteration).  
5. Posterior (inner) table fractures are managed with exploration of the frontal sinus and anterior cranial fossa, the removal of all respiratory mucosa from the frontal sinus, obliteration of the NFDs, and the reconstruction of the anterior table (frontal sinus cranialization).  
6. Cranialization involves the removal of the entire posterior table through a formal craniotomy and allowing the frontal lobe to herniate forward into the frontal sinus (see Figure 22.46 in Case Report 22.2).  
7. NFDs are obliterated in all cranialization procedures in order to prevent nasal contaminants from entering the anterior cranial fossa. When the posterior table is intact and the NFDs are patent, there is no need to obliterate the frontal sinus or the NFDs.  
8. It is recommended that abdominal fat grafts be taken from the lower left quadrant as scars to the right upper quadrant may mimic cholecystectomy incisions and scars to the right lower quadrant may mimic appendectomy incisions (see Figure 22.53 in Case Report 22.3).  
9. In cases of frontal sinus fracture infections and mucocele/ pyocele formation, bone biopsies should be obtained for histopathological examination to evaluate for osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis should be suspected with necrotic and non-bleeding bone and with chronic infection. Osteomyelitis is treated with wide surgical resection and culture and sensitivity guided intravenous antibiotic therapy. Definitive reconstruction should only be performed after eradication of osteomyelitis.  
10. For large frontal sinus defects, bone resections from osteomyelitis or tumor ablation surgeries, large frontal or parietal bone depressions and adjacent structure damage; custom PEEK (polyetheretherketone) implants may be utilized to restore pretraumatic/ preablative bony anatomy and skull contours.

11. Operated and non-operated frontal sinus fractures should be followed with serial examinations and CT scans to evaluate for infection, mucocele/pyocele formation, and osteomyelitis for several years after injury.

# Case Reports

Case Report 22.1. Obliteration (isolated anterior table fractures). A 28-year-old male presents status post an all-terrain vehicle rollover in which he sustained multiple facial fractures, including an anterior table frontal sinus fracture, Le Fort III fractures, Le Fort II fractures, Le Fort I fractures, and bilateral orbital floor and zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. On review of the head and maxillofacial CT scans, there were no signs of intracranial injury, no damage to the posterior table of the frontal sinus, and significant radiographic evidence of damage to the bilateral NFDs. The patient was taken to the operating room and submentally intubated. Access to the facial fractures was obtained through a coronal approach with inferior extension to the ear lobes, subtarsal approaches to the orbits, and intraoral incisions. The patency of the NFDs were assessed intraoperatively with the application of sterile propofol placed within the frontal sinus and the failure of the propofol to drain from the nasal cavity. The associated facial fractures were repaired, the frontal sinus and the NFDs were obliterated, and the outer table was repositioned into an anatomical and cosmetic position (see Figure 22.2 through 22.27).
