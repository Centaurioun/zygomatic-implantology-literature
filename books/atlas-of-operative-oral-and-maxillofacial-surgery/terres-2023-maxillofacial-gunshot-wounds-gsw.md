In its simplest form, energy transferred from a projectile to its target is a relationship between the mass and velocity of the projectile (bullet) as defined in the following equation:

$$
\mathrm {E} = 1 / 2 \mathrm {m v} ^ {2}
$$

$\mathrm{E} =$  muzzle energy of projectile (energy as the bullet leaves the barrel) in joules

$\mathrm{m} =$  mass of the bullet in kilograms

$\mathbf{v} =$  velocity of the bullet in meters per second

In the United States, muzzle energy is typically measured in feet per pound, so the calculation is modified:

$$
\mathrm {E} = \left(\mathrm {m} \times \mathrm {v} ^ {2}\right) / 4 5 0, 4 3 5
$$

Example 24.1 A low-velocity 9-mm handgun load with a mass of 124 grains and velocity of 1150 feet per second.

$$
\mathrm {E n e r g y} = 1 2 4 \times (1 1 5 0) ^ {2} / 4 5 0, 4 3 5
$$

$= 364$  feet per pound of muzzle energy

Example 24.2 A high-velocity .308 rifle load with a mass of 125 grains and a velocity of 3100 feet per second.

$$
\mathrm {E n e r g y} = 1 2 5 \times (3 1 0 0) ^ {2} / 4 5 0, 4 3 5
$$

$= 2668$  feet per pound of muzzle energy

Note that similar bullet weights (124gr versus 125gr) can have vastly different terminal performance (wound damage) due to the velocity at which they are propelled. Doubling the velocity of the projectile will increase its downrange energy by fourfold.

Wound damage is proportional to energy transfer between the projectile and the target. Projectiles with higher energy transfer more energy to the wound bed (hard and soft tissues) and cause significant wound bed damage. Conversely, projectiles with lower energy transfer less energy to the wound bed and thus cause less wound damage.

While bullet mass and velocity contribute to the terminal bullet performance or wound damage, other factors such as bullet designs (i.e., hollow-point, full metal jackets, bonded, etc.), bullet diameter, site of impact, distance traveled before impact, tumbling, fragmentation, and bullet ricochet also contribute to overall wound characteristics and devastation. In the past, gunshot wounds (Gsw) were classified as either high-velocity or low-velocity injuries. However, Gsw are more accurately classified as low energy transfer (LET) or high energy transfer (HET) injuries.

# Low Energy Transfer Gunshot Injuries (Standard Handguns and Shotguns)

LET injuries transfer less kinetic energy to the target and generate less hard and soft tissue damage and are often amendable to early and definitive treatment. Wound debridement with reduction of associated facial fractures and wound closure in a tension-free manner is recommended. The removal of all foreign bodies, loose bone, unsalvageable teeth, necrotic tissue, and fracture reduction and fixation will decrease the infection rate. A layered repair/closure of the soft tissue defect will minimize the chance of continued bleeding and hematoma formation. A tension-free closure is key as the patient will continue to experience moderate post-traumatic edema for several days after injury. For areas that are not amendable to primary closure due to avulsive soft tissue defects, local rotation or advancement flaps or distal free flaps may be utilized. For low-velocity injuries where definitive hard and soft tissue repair is not possible at initial presentation (unstable patient, other more urgent injuries, gross wound contamination, extensive edema, or avulsive soft tissue defects), definitive repair should be attempted as soon as possible (within 7–10 days). Secondary surgeries such as flap debulking, bone grafting for continuity defects and/or future dental implants, dental implant placement and palatal obturator fabrication occur three or more months after initial injury treatment.

# High Energy Transfer Gunshot Injuries (Military and Hunting Rifles and Magnum Handguns)

HET injuries transfer significant kinetic energy to the target and result in extensive hard and soft tissue damage that is typically not amendable to early and definitive care. HET injuries may be associated with both entry and exit wounds, wound cavitation, gross tissue avulsion, and severe bone comminution. Due to the HET, these types of wounds characteristically have a zone of damaged tissue that is prone to progressive necrosis as a result of compromised blood supply and wound sepsis. HET injuries should be initially managed with debridement, irrigation, and loose tacking suture placement to minimize infection as moderate to severe continued facial edema is expected. Open mandibular fractures may be treated via closed reduction or with external fixation placement after definitive airway stabilization. The use of local rotation or advancement flaps or distal free flaps are not recommended in the early phase of treatment of HET injuries. Definitive soft tissue closure and fracture reduction should be completed within 14-17 days in order to minimize the chance of malunion/nonunion of facial fractures and scar contracture of the soft tissues. The involved blood vessels typically repair themselves 7-10 days after injury. Therefore, anastomoses should be delayed and performed on high-velocity injuries at least 2 weeks status post insult.

# Complications

# Early Complications

Infection: Infection rates for GSW are typically higher than that for other types of maxillofacial injuries. All bullet wounds are inherently contaminated (soil, clothing fragments, skin flora, oronasal secretions, etc.). Also, the types of injuries with resultant hard and soft tissue injuries, bullet fragmentation, bone comminution, necrotic tissue, and hematoma formation lead to a high infection rate. Therefore, early and aggressive wash out and debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary for all types of bullet injuries.

# Late Complications

Scar contracture: Scar contracture status post maxillofacial GSW can lead to lagophthalmus, trismus, microstomia, incompetent lips, and restricted neck movements.

# Key Points

1. It is important to understand that the management of GSW is variable and that all cases are treated on a case-by-case basis.  
2. Patients involved in GSW, whether suicide attempts or not, typically develop long-term psychological

issues (or have pre-existing, pre-injury psychological issues) that need to be addressed with a team approach (psychologist, psychiatrist, supportive surgeon and ancillary staff, medications, therapy, etc.).

3. Initial maxillofacial GSW management follows the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) with specific care for airway and cervical spine stabilization and control of bleeding.  
4. As GSW may undergo rapid edema, early establishment of an airway is paramount (intubation, cricothyrotomy, or tracheostomy). If the anterior mandible is involved, concern for a flail jaw with airway embarrassment must be considered.  
5. If bleeding cannot be controlled via external pressure, stick ties, or selective cauterization, consider angiography and elective embolization. Blind use of cautery or clipping is never recommended as it can damage adjacent nerves or arteries and veins that may be utilized for microvascular repair of extensive hard and soft tissue defects at a secondary surgery.  
6. Wounds should be debrided to remove all sources of loose foreign bodies (superficial and loose bullets, shrapnel, dirt, glass, asphalt, etc.) and to remove necrotic tissues (unsalvageable teeth, loose segments of bone not attached to periosteum, and poorly vascularized soft tissue). Wounds are copiously irrigated and either packed or primarily repaired depending on the type of injury.  
7. Loose, fractured, and involved teeth should be removed as they are a potential source not only of infection, but also of aspiration. The surgeon must decide which teeth are salvageable and may be utilized for maxillomandibular fixation (MMF). MMF is paramount for re-establishing the anterior and posterior position of the mandible, as well as the height, width, and projection of the midface.  
8. Additional soft tissue structures that require examination include the globes, facial nerve, Stensen's duct, internal and external nasal and ear structures, and the scalp.  
9. For patients with extensive maxillofacial injuries that are stable, but will require a lengthy hospitalization with numerous procedures, a tracheostomy and gastrostomy should be considered.  
10. Retained bullets or bullet fragments rarely require removal as migration and infection rates are low. Occasionally, a superficial bullet or bullet fragment may cause localized soft tissue inflammation and infection that may require removal.  
11. GSW may be characterized as penetrating and perforating. A penetrating GSW is caused by an LET projectile and has a small entry point leading to the projectile becoming embedded within the tissue. A perforating GSW is caused by a HET projectile that enters and exits the tissue. This type of wound has more extensive

and avulsive damage and the exit wound is larger than the entrance wound. HET injuries have a zone of injury, which is defined as an area of evolving tissue deterioration, resulting from inflammation and disturbed blood circulation. This zone of injury results in an area of non-viable tissue that is greater several days after injury than originally thought. For this reason, HET injuries are initially debrided and stabilized and definitive reconstruction is recommended after several days to allow for anticipated tissue necrosis and edema.

12. If a high energy projectile enters soft tissue and does not make contact with bone, then the bullet may exit soft tissue and cause minimal damage.  
13. When an LET projectile is fired in contact with the skin, it causes extensive tissue damage and necrosis resembling a HET projectile due to the propellant gases expelled from the muzzle of the weapon. The bullet also has a higher energy transfer due to the extreme proximity to the target. This explains why point blank GSW often present with extensive hard and soft tissue damage, regardless of the caliber.  
14. LET projectiles may enter the face and hit bone and result in extensive soft tissue damage from the bullet

tumbling or fragmenting. HET projectiles are associated with gross bone comminution, cavitation, tissue avulsion, and a large exit wound.

15. Shotgun injuries may be classified as HET or LET. Placing a shotgun barrel in contact with the skin (i.e., submental area) will result in a HET GSW from the full transfer of energy and from the propellant gases expelled from the muzzle. A shotgun blast from a distance will result in LET as the pellets loose much of their energy in flight.  
16. When suicide is attempted with a long gun ( rifle or shotgun), due to the length from the mandible to the trigger of the weapon, when the trigger is pulled it frequently moves the barrel anteriorly and can result in damage of the maxillofacial structures without damaging the intracranial cavity. Additionally, the propellant gas expelled (blast) results in hyperextension of the neck and an exit wound through the forehead and nasal cavity. The resultant damaged structures involve the mandible (most commonly involved structure), base of the tongue, maxilla, palate, nose, and orbits. Thus, patients may survive their injury, but suffer extensive maxillofacial damage, deformities, and disabilities.

# Case Reports

Case Report 24.1. LET GSW injury to the anterior mandible resulting in a flail mandible and airway embarrassment. A 12-year-old male presents immediately status post GSW to the anterior mandible with a low-velocity handgun caliber. Upon presentation, the patient was alert and oriented, in no distress and with a GCS of 15. Films were obtained and the patient was prepared for surgery. In route to the OR, the patient was laid supine and underwent airway embarrassment due to the lack of support of the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles from the grossly comminuted anterior mandibular lingual plate. Intubation was not possible due to airway edema and the posterior position of the anterior mandible. The patient underwent awake tracheostomy. Once airway stabilization was achieved, unsalvageable teeth, loose segments of bone not attached to periosteum, and poorly vascularized soft tissues were removed. The wounds were copiously irrigated, the mandible was primarily repaired with a stock reconstruction plate, the large, fractured segment of the lingual plate was secured to the reconstruction plate with 24-gauge stainless steel wires, and all wounds were closed primarily (see Figures 24.1 through 24.9).

Case Report 24.2. LET GSW injury to the left mandible and midface resulting in gross comminution. A 20-year-old female presents status post GSW x 2 to the left face. The initial bullet grazed the left cheek resulting in a deep laceration. The second bullet entered the left cheek at the ZMC and ricocheted off of the ZMC, tumbling and fragmenting inferiorly resulting in moderate mandible comminution. The second bullet exited the oral

cavity. Cranial nerve 7 was irreversibly damaged. Due to the degree of comminution of the posterior mandible, the mandible was reduced with MMF. All LET injuries were repaired primarily and definitively the day of presentation. After 6 weeks of MMF, the patient underwent aggressive physical therapy and guiding elastic therapy (see Figures 24.10 through 24.23).

Case Report 24.3. HET GSW injury to the anterior mandible and maxilla resulting in extensive midline soft tissue loss. A 24-year-old male presents immediately status post GSW to the anterior mandible and facial midline with a high-velocity assault rifle. Upon presentation, the patient was intubated and sedated. Films were obtained and the patient was prepared for surgery. In the OR, the patient underwent a tracheostomy for definitive airway management. Once airway stabilization was achieved, unsalvageable teeth, loose segments of bone not attached to periosteum, and poorly vascularized soft tissues were removed. The facial wounds were copiously irrigated and the mandible was primarily stabilized with an external fixation device. Initial soft tissue injuries were only passively closed with 3-0 prolene sutures and daily wound checks with bedside debridement was performed. On day 7, formal wound closure was performed, along with a tongue flap to recreate the entire loss of the upper lip. Remaining nasal tissue was closed with internal

bilateral Doyle splint placement and recreating remaining portion of the patient's nasal septum. Nasal splints remained in place for 6 weeks, which allowed for ideal midline septum form, secondary healing, and nasal patency. A portion of a 9-0 endotracheal (ET) tube was cut and secured to both mandibular bone edges (due to bone loss in the midline) and soft tissue closure was done for space maintenance in anticipation of future bone grafting. After 3 weeks of healing, the tongue flap was sectioned and repositioned to recreate the avulsed upper lip. After the nasal tissue declared itself (no further necrosis), a para-median forehead flap was used to reconstruct lost nasal tip tissue. The external fixation device was kept in place for 8 weeks and then replaced with a reconstruction plate and the anterior mandibular defect was grafted (the soft tissue envelope that was created with the ET tube). The anterior maxilla was also grafted and a vestibuloplasty was performed to allow for a future dental prosthesis (see Figures 24.24 through 24.27).

Case Report 24.4. HET GSW injury to the mandible, maxilla, orbits, and zygomatic regions resulting in a flail mandible with airway embarrassment and extensive midline soft tissue loss. A 41-year-old male presents immediately status post GSW to the submental region involving the facial midline with a high-velocity rifle. Upon presentation, the patient was intubated and lightly sedated, but able to answer basic questions with blinking and gestures. Films were obtained and the patient was prepared for surgery. In the Emergency Room (ER), the patient underwent airway embarrassment and was unable to be intubated due to impressive facial edema, hematoma formation, and extensive soft tissue damage. An immediate tracheostomy was performed. Once airway stabilization was achieved, the patient was taken to the OR and all unsalvageable teeth, loose segments of bone not attached to periosteum, and poorly vascularized soft tissues were removed. The facial wounds were copiously irrigated, extensive bone comminution was passively repositioned into a more correct anatomic location and tacking sutures were placed over "intra-facial" antibiotic-coated gauze packings. On day 3, the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of midfacial injuries (orbits, NOE, ZMC) and included nasal reconstruction with bilateral nasal trumpets and internal Doyle splints. The trumpets were used to maintain the outer nasal opening, while the internal splints were used to aid with septum reconstruction. The mandible was stabilized with a reconstruction plate with minimal midline coverage. This was a controversial decision (traditionally, an external fixation device is utilized). The decision to immediately fixate with a reconstruction plate was made for concerns of severe scar contracture and facial collapse due to the extensive soft tissue and hard tissue damage. The reconstruction plate will aid in minimizing facial collapse by re-establishing the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the mandible and maintaining the projection of the midface and associated structures. The base of the tongue was secured to the plate to aid with future positioning. The anterior submental wound had limited soft tissue coverage and was the area that sustained the most

t tissue loss from the primary GSW insult and from surgical debridement. The submental soft tissue defect was treated with extensive soft tissue undermining and local rotation flaps. After several weeks of wound packing, the defect underwent a successful osteocutaneous free flap for definitive closure. The decision to fixate the fractures earlier than normal (after initial edema had peaked) was successful in maintaining facial dimensions and in minimizing facial soft tissue collapse (see Figures 24.28 through 24.32).
