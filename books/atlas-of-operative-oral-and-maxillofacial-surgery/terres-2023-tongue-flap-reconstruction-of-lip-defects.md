The anterior tongue flap may be utilized to primarily reconstruct lip defects involving the upper and/or lower lips with or without involvement of the oral commissure. The anterior-based tongue flap may be utilized for traumatic injuries (GSWs or complex traumatic tissue loss) or cancers resulting in large soft tissue defects.

# Indications

1. Defects of upper or lower lip with or without commissure involvement from pathology or trauma  
2. Lip defects of substantial size where primary lip closure is not possible or is not advised  
3. An alternative to the Karapandzic flap for lower lip defects constituting closure of defects greater than one-half to two-thirds of the lower lip  
4. Reconstruction of lip defects when concern of microstomia with other flap techniques (Abbe, Estlander, Karapandzic flaps) exists

# Contraindications

1. Pathology or trauma to the tongue  
2. Damage to distal blood supply of the tongue  
3. Significant anatomical defects of the tongue  
4. Severe medical comorbidities that precludes general anesthesia or inability to sustain perioperative compliance due to psychiatric or developmental disorders

# Flap Anatomy

The lingual artery is the predominant blood supply to the tongue and floor of the mouth. The lingual artery originates from the external carotid artery. The lingual artery further branches to feed the deep, sublingual, and dorsal lingual arteries. The deep lingual artery serves as the pedicle for the anterior tongue flap. The vena comitans/ranine vein begins at the tip of the tongue and drains into the lingual or the common facial vein.

# Technique

1. The patient is placed in a supine position with nasal endotracheal intubation. The surgical site is prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  
2. The defect is measured and the anterior tongue flap is designed and marked. The size of defect will dictate the thickness of the tongue flap.  
3. Local anesthetic with epinephrine is injected within the surgical site.  
4. The lesion is resected or the traumatic soft tissue defect margins are refreshed (see Figure 67.3 in Case Report 67.1).  
5. The tongue is advanced with the anterior tongue incised in horizontal fashion to allow the dorsal flap to be elevated and rolled over the defect of the lower lip (see Figure 67.5 in Case Report 67.1). The anterior ventral tongue is secured to the lower labial mucosal layer. Adequate mobilization of the flap is necessary to prevent excessive tension causing detachment of the tongue flap. Adequate muscle tissue should be incorporated within the dorsal flap to add bulk and to include adequate blood supply to the pedicle.  
6. The dorsal tongue flap is sutured to the skin of the lower lip utilizing permanent sutures (see Figure 67.6 in Case Report 67.1). Care must be taken to avoid strangulation of the vascular pedicle.  
7. The vascular pedicle is released after 14-21 days once collateral circulation is established (see Figure 67.8 in Case Report 67.1).  
8. The lower lip and reduced anterior tongue may be recontoured and closed prior to definitive closure (see Figures 67.9 through 67.11 in Case Report 67.1).

# Postoperative Management

1. The patient is monitored for airway compromise resulting from immediate postoperative surgical edema. Perioperative steroid should be considered if tolerated by the patient.

2. Limit excessive movement of the tongue during the perioperative period to prevent detachment of the tongue flap.  
3. Patients are maintained on a soft or liquid diet until flap release. Occasionally, Dobhoff or gastric feeding tubes are necessary during the healing period (typically flap size dependent).

# Complications

1. Flap necrosis: Due to compromised vasculature within the soft tissue pedicle. Minimized with adequate flap mobilization, care with flap inset to avoid strangulation of the vascular pedicle, preventing pressure on the inset flap (oral intubation, orogastric tubing, oral feeding tubes, etc.) and postoperative assessment of flap color, perfusion, and turgor.  
2. Premature flap detachment: Minimized by establishing sufficient pedicle release for passive flap inset and avoiding excessive tongue movements.  
3. **Asymmetry:** Donor site or lower lip deformity such as asymmetry or significant notching results from insufficient pedicel length or inappropriate flap inset.  
4. Alterations in speech or development of sibilance: Frequently corrects over time as the tongue musculature heals and the patient adapts. Long-term speech issues are rare.

# Key Points

1. The anteriorly based ventral tongue flap may be unilateral, bilateral, or midline based.  
2. Adequate mobility/advancement of the anterior tongue flap with minimal tension is essential to allow for proper flap inset and to minimize vascular compromise.  
3. Avoid premature flap detachment by suturing the muscle underlying the flap to prevent strangulation of blood supply leading to necrosis.  
4. Excessive tongue movement during recovery can detach the flap. Consider stabilization techniques such as Barton bandage, Jaw Bra, and maxilla-mandibular fixation (MMF) as tolerated by the patient.  
5. Scar revision may be performed during flap release to aid in aesthetics, especially in areas involving the oral commissure.  
6. Partial necrosis may be managed with debridement, antibiotics, and wound irrigation. Complete necrosis requires debridement and reoperation.  
7. The tongue flap is released after 14-21 days to allow adequate development of collateral circulation prior to pedicle division.

# Case Report

Case Report 67.1. Anteriorly based tongue flap reconstruction of surgical defect from lower lip cancer resection involving the oral commissure. A 64-year-old male presents with a progressive lesion to his left lower lip. The patient has a medical history significant for a 50 pack year history of tobacco usage and daily alcohol consumption. A punch biopsy was performed and confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. A complete head and neck workup was performed, and a treatment plan was developed to include complete lesion resection with adjuvant-modified radical neck dissection. Given the anticipated surgical defect size and the involvement of the left oral commissure, the patient was planned for primary reconstruction utilizing an anterior dorsal tongue flap. The tongue flap was chosen over other local and regional flap techniques due to the size of the surgical defect, the involvement of the oral commissure, the concern of minimizing microstomia, and severely compromising future oral function. The lip defect was resected with negative margins. Cervical lymphadenectomy was negative. The pedicled tongue flap reconstruction provided a thick tissue bed with a muscle component that allowed for future adequate oral opening, aesthetics, and function. The final TNM classification of the patient was T2M0M0 (see Figure 67.1 through 67.14).
