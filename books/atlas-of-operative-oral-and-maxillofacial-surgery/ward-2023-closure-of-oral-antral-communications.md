A method of obtaining closure of oral-antral communications (OAC) and oral-antral fistulae (OAF).

# Indications

1. OAC over  $4\mathrm{mm}$  in dimension noted intraoperatively  
2. OACs or OAF that persist postoperatively

# Contraindications

1. Defects smaller than  $4\mathrm{mm}$ . Defects smaller than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  frequently close with conservative treatment consisting of sinus precautions, antibiotics, and decongestants.  
2. OAC or OAF with signs and symptoms of active infection.  
3. Obstruction of the osteomeatal complex. Evaluation of the osteomeatal complex with a sinus computed tomography (CT) is warranted, especially in the case of recurrent fistulae. If the osteomeatal complex is obstructed, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) prior to OAF closure is indicated.

# General Considerations for Fistulctomy

1. Circumferential fistula excision is paramount to resolution of chronic fistula formation. With care, the fistula may be excised and the medial edges approximated with sutures as a first-layer sinus closure (see Figure 61.1).  
2. Additional tissue may be advanced for an additional one or two layers of closure, based on the size of the defect and the planned reconstructive technique.  
3. Suture tissue into place in an interrupted fashion.  
4. Consider a protective splint as indicated.

# Specific Surgical Techniques for Oral-Antral Communications and Oral-Antral Fistulae Closure

1. Primary closure  
2. Buccal advancement flap  
3. Palatal rotation advancement flap

4. Buccal fat pad flap  
5. Bone graft  
6. Temporalis muscle flap  
7. Temporoparietal galea flap

# Primary Closure

Used only when tissue can be closed without tension (not specifically described).

# Buccal Advancement Flap

# Indication

1. First-line treatment when insufficient soft tissue is available for primary closure

# Contraindication

1. Buccal vestibular tissue that cannot be adequately mobilized and advanced to obtain primary closure due to scarring or size of defect

# Technique: Buccal Advancement Flap

1. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal tissue flap is raised, and anterior and posterior releasing incisions are incorporated into the flap design (see Figure 61.6 in Case Report 61.2). The divergent releasing incisions allow for the creation of a wide flap base and additional tissue advancement over the defect.  
2. Additional periosteal releasing incisions (see Figure 61.7 in Case Report 61.2) may be incorporated as needed for enhanced flap mobility to achieve a tension-free closure.  
3. Adjunctive alveoloplasty may be necessary to remove sharp bony ridges and to reduce the buccal plate in order to allow for additional flap advancement.  
4. The buccal flap is advanced over the defect to obtain primary closure (see Figure 61.10 in Case Report 61.2). Closure is obtained with resorbable sutures such as polyglactin (i.e., Vicryl, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, New Jersey, USA), which will maintain strength during healing.

# Palatal Rotation Advancement Flap

# Indication

1. Secondary alternative for closure of defects with insufficient soft tissue available for primary closure  
2. Previously failed closure with a buccal advancement flap

# Contraindications

1. When the thick palatal tissue cannot be adequately mobilized for defect coverage due to scarring or large defect size  
2. Relative contraindication: Where previous surgeries or trauma have disrupted the blood supply of the greater palatine artery. However, random pattern flaps of the palate have been reported successful in most cases

# Surgical Anatomy

The palatal flap is a full-thickness axial flap based on the greater palatine artery, which exits the greater palatine foramen. The artery courses along the lateral aspect of the palate and anastomosis with the incisive and contralateral artery, allowing the entire palate to be elevated based on a single greater palatine arterial supply. The palate consists of oral mucosa, submucosa, and periosteum, which attaches to the hard palate by Sharpey's fibers. The soft palate consists of the tensor veli palatine, levator veli palatini, and uvula muscularis muscles. The tensor

muscles pass around the hamulus, insert into the palatal aponeurosis, and may tether flap rotati

# Technique: Palatal Rotational Advancement Flap

1. The greater palatine foramen and neurovascular bundle are identified by manual palpation.  
2. The necessary pedicle length is measured from the buccal aspect of the defect to the greater palatine foramen. The flap design is outlined with a sterile marking pen (see Figure 61.2 in Case Report 61.1).  
3. A full-thickness incision is made lateral to the neurovascular bundle and carried anteriorly, up to the palatal mucosa of the central incisors, or extended to the contralateral side as necessary for the defect size and location.

A. At least  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of mucosa apical to the gingival sulcus is preserved.  
B. In the edentulous patient, the incision may extend just palatal to the alveolar crest.  
C. Unilateral flaps may be rotated up to  $180^{\circ}$ , allowing the flap to be positioned with the mucosal side oral or nasal.  
D. A full palate flap has the additional flexibility of  $360^{\circ}$  rotation, allowing the flap to fold back onto itself for oral and nasal coverage when necessary.  
E. When elevating a full palatal flap, the neurovascular bundle of the incisive canal must be severed and cauterized or tied.

4. The full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is raised from anterior to posterior and rotated into place (see Figure 61.3 in Case Report 61.1). Care is taken to preserve the vascular supply of the flap.  
5. The flap is sutured in place with 3-0 resorbable sutures to obtain a tension-free closure (see Figure 61.4 in Case Report 61.1).  
6. If further laxity is necessary to obtain passive approximation, the hamulus can be fractured, which will provide additional length to the flap. Alternatively, an island flap can be created with a circumferential incision, leaving the pedicle as the only anchor of the flap.  
7. A soft plastic surgical stent may be placed over the flap and denuded palate for patient comfort. Care should be taken to avoid any pressure on the pedicle. The stent is removed 7-10 days after surgery.  
8. Separation of the pedicle is usually required for small lateral defects when the flap bridges normal palatal tissue to reach the surgical site. This can be performed at 3 weeks. Prior to separation of the pedicle, verification of sufficient collateral supply can be assessed by tightly fastening a suture around the pedicle. If sufficient collateral blood supply is present, the flap will remain pink and well perfused. The pedicle may then be taken down, excess tissue trimmed, and inset at the new margin.

# Case Report

Case Report 61.1. Palatal Rotational Advancement Flap. A 58-year-old patient presents with a chief complaint of a bump to her right posterior maxilla. On examination, an  $8\mathrm{mm} \times 5\mathrm{mm}$  mass was identified within the

right posterior maxilla. An incisional biopsy was performed that rendered a diagnosis of a clear cell adenocarcinoma. A definitive resection was performed with wide local excision. The resulting oroantral communication was primarily reconstructed with a palatal rotational advancement flap (see Figures 61.1 through 61.4).

# Buccal Fat Pad Advancement

# Indications

1. Used alone or in conjunction with buccal or palatal advancement flaps as an additional layer of closure  
2. Useful for persistent fistulae or as a local flap where adjacent tissue is inadequate for closure. The described technique may be used in defects up to  $6\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter.

# Contraindications

1. Prior buccal fat surgery, trauma, or harvest  
2. Defect sizes greater than  $6\mathrm{cm}$

# Anatomy

The buccal fat pad serves as a gliding pad during masticatory and facial muscle contraction. It consists of the main body and three lobes: anterior, intermediate, and posterior. The main body lies on the anterior border of the masseter muscle, extends deeply to lie on the posterior maxilla, and extends forward along the buccal vestibule. The buccal extension is intimately related to Stenson's duct, and the buccal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve, and gives fullness to the cheek. Each lobe is separated by investing connective tissue and has its own blood supply. This necessitates disruption of the septa to allow delivery of the fat pad, but it must be done carefully to prevent disruption of the blood supply.

# Case Report

Figure 61.5. Preoperative image of patient undergoing extraction of teeth #14 and #15 due to extensive decay and pain.

# Technique: Buccal Fat Pad Advancement

1. An incision is made through the periosteum elevated with the full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap and lateral to the maxillary tuberosity (see Figure 61.6 in Case Report 61.2).  
2. Metzenbaum scissors or fine hemostats are directed posterior and lateral, inserted with the beaks closed to puncture through the periosteum, and gently spread to provide access to the buccal fat pad and to gently disrupt the interlobular septa (see Figure 61.8 in Case Report 61.2).  
3. The fat pad is gently teased out with a pair of toothed Gerald forceps. Pressure may be placed within the temporal region to assist in delivering the fat pad. Minimal traction should be placed on the fat pad, as excessive tension will disrupt the blood supply. If the operator is having difficulty achieving sufficient fat pad release, the Metzenbaum scissors or fine hemostats are reinserted and spread to free the fat from its surrounding connective tissue.  
4. The fat pad is draped across the OAC and passively sutured in place (see Figure 61.9 in Case Report 61.2).  
5. When used as a second layer of closure, the buccal fat is anchored to bone or sewn to submucosa to allow primary mucosal closure above the level of the buccal fat flap (see Figure 61.10 in Case Report 61.2). The pedicled buccal fat pad flap undergoes complete epithelialization within 2-3 weeks.

removal of tooth #15, an oral-antral communication (OAC) with a 1 cm bony defect was appreciated. The OAC was repaired with a layered closure technique utilizing a buccal fat pad advancement and a buccal tissue advancement flap (see Figures 61.5 through 61.10).

# Bone Graft

# Indications

1. Where future implant placement is planned and separation of the sinus and oral mucosa can be achieved  
2. Previously failed closure of an OAC or OAF

# Contraindications

1. Defect size too large to allow stable bone graft placement  
2. Alveolar ridge atrophy too severe to allow graft placement or fixation  
3. Previously failed bone graft

# Technique: Bone Graft

1. The bony defect of the maxillary sinus is standardized with a trephine bur just large enough to create a round defect.  
2. When possible, the sinus mucosa is closed.  
3. A block bone graft is obtained from the donor site of choice, often the mandibular ramus or mental region. A monocortical bone graft is harvested with a second trephine bur with an inner diameter matching the outer diameter of the trephine bur used to define the defect.  
4. Gentle pressure is used to press fit the bone graft to the defect with care not to displace the block of bone into the sinus. If primary stability is not achieved, a mini-plate or bone screw may be used to provide fixation.

5. A second-layer closure is then achieved, utilizing the oral mucosa described in the buccal advancement flap.  
6. Three months following closure, the sinus may be reentered for a sinus lift. Any previously placed plates and screws may be removed at this time.

# Temporalis Muscle Flap

# Indication

1. Large, persistent defect requiring closure

# Contraindications

1. Defects amenable to less invasive therapies  
2. Previous surgery or trauma disrupting the blood supply of the anterior and posterior deep temporal arteries or middle temporal artery  
3. Relative: Balding hair patterns with inability to hide surgical scars and the appearance of temporal wasting

# Anatomy

It is of utmost importance that the surgeon is able to identify the layers of the face and their contents. The temporal branch of the facial nerve extends from the zygomaticotemporal branch, anteriorly and superior, below a line from the tragus to a point  $2\mathrm{cm}$  lateral and  $3\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the superior orbital rim. Care must be taken in flap harvesting to avoid injury to the facial nerve.

The blood supply to the temporalis muscle flap is derived from the anterior and posterior deep temporal arteries supplying the anterior and middle thirds, and the posterior portion of the muscle is supplied primarily by the middle temporal artery. The venous drainage and innervation follow the arterial supply.

The temporalis fascia, or deep temporal fascia, covers the superficial portion of the temporalis muscle. Two centimeters superior to the zygomatic arch, the fascia splits into the deep and superficial temporalis fascia, which surrounds the temporal fat pad and attaches to the medial and lateral surfaces of the zygomatic arch.

The temporalis muscle lies within the temporal fossa. The temporalis muscle varies in thickness from 5 to  $15\mathrm{mm}$ .

The temporalis muscle flap can be divided to create a bilobed flap by preserving both the anterior and posterior

# Case Report

Case Report 61.3. Temporalis Muscle Flap. A 74-year-old patient referred from an outside institution presents with a chief complaint of halitosis, fluid communication to the right sinus, and chronic right-sided sinus pain and obstruction. The patient reports a previous history of a resected right posterior maxillary gingival squamous cell carcinoma and multiple failed attempts at sinus

deep temporal arteries using a one-third anterior and two-thirds posterior rule.

# Technique: Temporalis Muscle Flap

1. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A corneal shield is placed on the ipsilateral side, and the hair overlying the incision is banded or shaved to allow access to the incision site.  
2. A standard pre-auricular or modified endaural incision is outlined with a marking pen. The superior aspect of the pre-auricular marking is extended into the scalp sufficient to develop a flap of adequate length, identify the vascular supply, and provide a sufficient arc of rotation of the pedicled flap, while preserving the temporal branch of the facial nerve. After marking,  $0.5\%$  lidocaine with epinephrine is injected within the proposed incision site as a tumescent.  
3. The incision begins above the helix of the ear. Skin hooks are utilized to retract the subcutaneous tissue laterally. The incision is extended through the temporoparietal fascia to the deep temporal fascia, which is recognizable by the glistening white fascia.  
4. The pre-auricular or modified endaural incision is continued inferior to the helix of the ear and follows the cartilage of the external auditory canal to the base of the zygomatic arch.  
5. An incision is made through the temporalis fascia at a  $45^{\circ}$  angle extending anterosuperiorly from the root of the zygoma, exposing the temporalis muscle. Subperiosteal dissection is started over the arch of the zygoma with a #9 periosteal elevator, lifting the superficial temporal fascia and protecting the facial nerve.  
6. The temporalis muscle may be divided into two flaps consisting of the anterior one-third and posterior two-thirds (see Figure 61.13 in Case Report 61.3). The anterior one-third may be passed over the zygomatic arch into the oral cavity. If needed, an osteotomy of the zygoma may be used to lengthen the pedicle and reach of the flap. The posterior two-thirds are rotated anteriorly to prevent a cosmetic defect (see Figure 61.14 in Case Report 61.3). Alternatively, an alloplastic temporal implant may be used for the same purpose.  
7. The donor site is closed in a layered fashion. To minimize postoperative hematoma and seroma, a postauricular suction drain may be placed.

closure. On examination, the patient has a large, oral-antral fistula with signs and symptoms of a sinus infection. On review of the sinus computed tomography scan (see Figure 61.11), a large bony defect was noted along the right posterior maxilla, and obstruction of the osteomeatal complex was identified. The patient underwent FESS prior to OAF closure with a temporalis muscle flap advancement (see Figures 61.11 through 61.14).

# Temporoparietal Galea Flap

# Indications

1. Large maxillary defects not amenable to closure with less invasive local flaps

# Contraindications

1. Adequate treatment achievable by less invasive means  
2. Trauma or surgery of the temporal region placing the tissues at risk of ischemia or necrosis

# Anatomy

The temporoparietal galea flap is derived from the temporoparietal tissues, which are the continuation of the subcutaneous musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) above the zygomatic arch. Superficially, the galea is adherent to the subcutaneous layer of the overlying skin. This plane must be surgically created at a level of the dermal appendages. The deep surface is easily separated from the temporalis fascia and pericranium.

The temporoparietal galea flap is  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  thick, up to  $20\mathrm{cm}$  in length (when based off the posterior branch of the superficial temporal artery and vein), and described to have up to  $180\mathrm{cm}^2$  of surface area. The superficial temporal artery divides into anterior and posterior branches between 2 and  $4\mathrm{cm}$  above the zygoma. The posterior branch curves posteriorly within a  $2\mathrm{cm}$  strip above the external auditory canal (EAC);  $10\mathrm{cm}$  above the EAC, the superficial temporal artery ascends to the subdermal plexus. Care must be taken to avoid damaging the vascular supply in flaps designed to include this area.

The venous drainage is noted to consistently lie posterior and superior to the artery and is at risk for vascular compromise. As mentioned for the temporalis muscle flap, the ability to identify the facial layers and protect the facial nerve is of greatest importance. The temporal branch of the facial nerve extends anteriorly and superiorly below a line from the tragus to a point  $2\mathrm{cm}$  lateral and  $3\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the superior orbital rim.

# Technique: Temporoparietal Galea Flap

1. The patient is prepped as described for the temporalis muscle flap.  
2. The superficial temporal artery can be found approximately  $2\mathrm{cm}$  anterior to the external auditory canal. Doppler or palpation and marking can be beneficial in the preservation of the vascular pedicle. Shaving the hair is not necessary. Sterile lubricant may be applied to part the hair and staple it down with the drapes.  
3. A pre-auricular or endaural incision is extended superiorly into a hemicoronal incision.  
4. The incision is brought to a subcutaneous depth at the level of the dermal appendages. This dissection is difficult, as a natural plane does not exist. Appropriate depth is achieved when successfully elevating and visualizing the hair follicles, but preserving the dermal plexus and subcutaneous fat with the galea. The superficial temporal vein is located rather superficially; if dissection is too deep, both the subdermal plexus and

# Case Report

Case Report 61.4. Temporoparietal Galea Flap. A 64-year-old patient presents after resection of posterior maxillary squamous cell carcinoma with a large residual

vein may be compromised, and both are essential for flap viability. However, it is inevitable to leave some hair follicles with the galea or take some subdermal fat with the skin flap at times. Generally, dissection is started posteriorly, with care to preserve the posterior branch of the superficial temporal artery.

5. The flap is designed with a  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  wide pedicle to protect the vessels, and a length is measured that will achieve the appropriate arc of rotation to reach the OAC/OAF. Once the flap has been designed, dissection is deepened to the loose areolar tissue overlying the pericranium and temporalis. The flap is easily elevated with blunt scissors along the belly of the temporalis muscle and is brought down to the level of the zygomatic arch (see Figure 61.15 in Case Report 61.4). The anterior branch of the superficial temporal artery will be encountered and require ligation. Transillumination may prove useful in identification and preservation of the pedicle. If additional length is necessary, the pedicle can be dissected inferior to the tragus at the level of the parotid gland.

6. A tunnel to the oral cavity is created by subcutaneous dissection, superficial to the SMAS until the anterior border of the masseter is identified. A right-angled hemostat works well for penetration to the oral cavity. The tunnel should be large enough to prevent strangulation, and care should be made to avoid damage to the facial nerve and Stenson's duct.  
7. The flap is gently passed into the oral cavity and sutured in place (see Figure 61.16 in Case Report 61.4), with care to prevent flap rotation, which will occlude the pedicle.  
8. Hemostasis may be achieved with electrocautery, but care must be taken not to compromise the thin remaining skin. A Penrose or suction drain may be used along with a pressure dressing superior to the base of the flap to prevent hematoma and seroma and to obliterate potential dead space. It is important if a pressure dressing is utilized to not apply pressure directly over the vascular pedicle.

oral-antral fistula. The patient was treated with fistulectomy, which resulted in a  $6 \times 4$  cm oral-antral communication. The patient underwent successful reconstruction with a temporoparietal galea flap inset to the intraoral defect (see Figures 61.15 and 61.16).

Figure 61.15. Anterior and posterior skin flaps are elevated and retracted with the temporoparietal galea flap elevated and draped across the face to demonstrate the reach of the flap. The temporalis muscle and overlying temporalis fascia remain in place.

# Postoperative Management

1. Antibiotics to target sinus and oral flora  
2. Nasal decongestants  
3. Sinus precautions

a. No nose blowing  
b. Sneeze with mouth open  
c. Avoid pressure differential between the sinus and mouth  
d. No smoking

4. Diet based on flap choice and closure method

a. Flaps with primary mucosal closure: Clear liquids, advancing to a soft diet as tolerated, then a regular diet at 7 days  
b. Flaps with secondary intention healing: Clear liquids, advancing to a full liquid diet for 3 days and then a soft diet until secondary intention healing is complete (3-4 weeks)

# Complications

1. Infection, including sinusitis  
2. Bone graft failure  
3. Partial flap necrosis  
4. Recurrent oral-antral fistula

# Key Points

1. Oral-antral communications are most frequently seen in the extraction of maxillary molars, with greatest

![](images/c3df92d1f6bdf6f6f49253b793980db2dd47469c894b868694a6992d96f5ad5d.jpg)

incidence in the first, second, and then third molars; this is particularly true in older patients due to pneumatized sinuses.

2. Local anesthesia may be used for local tissue advancement, while general anesthesia should be considered for larger surgical procedures.  
3. Critical size defect:

a. A communication of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  or less may heal well with minimal intervention and can be treated with primary closure or a buccal advancement flap.  
b. A communication greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  is at greater risk of failing primary closure.

4. Small defects are amenable to buccal advancement and palatal rotation flaps. Defects up to  $6\mathrm{cm}$  may be closed with buccal fat pad advancement. Larger defects may be more amenable to a temporalis muscle flap or temporoparietal galea flap.

5. Preoperative evaluation of osteomeatal complex patency should be considered, especially if a previous closure has failed. If the osteomeatal complex is obstructed, FESS should be pursued to obtain proper drainage prior to closure of the oral-antral communication.  
6. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be considered for any procedure involving the sinus. Bacteriology of the oral cavity and sinus often include alpha and beta hemolytic Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Proteus, and Escherichia coli.
