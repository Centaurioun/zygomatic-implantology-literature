Enucleation: The entire globe is detached from the extraocular muscles and removed.

Evisceration: Removal of the intraocular contents with preservation of the extraocular muscles, scleral shell, and surrounding orbital tissues.

# Indications

1. Primary enucleation after trauma: ocular trauma is the leading cause of blindness and the leading cause of enucleation in the United States. While the traumatized eye may initially undergo attempts to spare removal via primary closure, ophthalmologic consultation may deem the globe non-salvageable, prompting primary enucleation. Initial visual acuity of light perception or no light perception, wound length greater than  $10\mathrm{mm}$ , wounds extending posterior to the plane of rectus muscle insertion, blunt mechanism of injury, and older age have been identified as poor prognostic factors following trauma.  
2. Secondary enucleation to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia: sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare, bilateral granulomatous panuveitis triggered by an inciting antigen released following trauma or surgery to one eye, referred to as the exciting eye. Enucleation or evisceration of the injured eye is an effective prophylaxis against disease in the fellow eye, referred to as the sympathizing eye. Incidence rates range from 0.001 to  $2.0\%$  of traumatized eyes. The time frame for initiation of sympathetic ophthalmia has been reported between 5 days and 66 years, and most recommendations support removal of the traumatized eye within 10-14 days of injury to minimize the possibility of sympathetic ophthalmia.  
3. Intraocular malignancy: any intraocular malignancy that does not respond to conservative therapy may be indicated for enucleation. The most common primary intraocular malignancy in children and adults is retinoblastoma and choroidal melanoma, respectively.  
4. Blind, painful eye: while trauma is the most common cause of a blind, painful eye; ocular inflammatory or infectious diseases resulting in endophthalmitis or uveitis

that are not responsive to conservative, medical therapy may lead to a blind, painful eye requiring enucleation or evisceration.

5. Cosmesis: an atrophic, scarred, and nonfunctional eye, referred to as phthisis bulbi or microphthalmia, may present as a cosmetic concern, prompting enucleation.  
6. End-stage eye disease: diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, or a history of multiple eye surgeries may necessitate removal.

# Contraindications

1. Following the onset of signs and symptoms and diagnosis of sympathetic ophthalmia, enucleation of the exciting eye does not result in improved visual function in the sympathizing eye. In some cases, the exciting eye may become the eye with better visual acuity.  
2. Evisceration may be preferred to enucleation in patients who are anticipated to have an increased and potentially devastating amount of psychological trauma from the removal of an eye.  
3. Evisceration is contraindicated in the setting of suspected intraocular malignancy, as complete removal of the tumor with an adequate surgical margin would be better managed with enucleation.  
4. In cases of phthisis bulbi, evisceration is contraindicated, as atrophic sclera cannot hold an adequate-sized implant.  
5. When patients have tumors extending into the orbit secondarily, orbital exenteration, with removal of the entire globe, socket, and often the surrounding tissue, is preferred.  
6. Severe trauma with other orbital contents missing.  
7. Untreated current orbital infections.

# Anatomy

Tenon's capsule: A fascial sheath extending from the optic nerve to the corneal limbus, where it fuses with the bulbar conjunctiva. The capsule is separated from the sclera of the globe by periscleral lymph space, or episcleral space, which is continuous with subdural and subarachnoid spaces.

Anteriorly, Tenon's capsule is perforated by the tendons of the extraocular muscles at their insertions to the globe.

Extraocular muscles: The medial and lateral rectus muscles originate at the annulus of Zinn and travel anteriorly along the orbital walls, inserting  $5.5\mathrm{mm}$  and  $6.9\mathrm{mm}$  from the limbus, respectively. The superior and inferior rectus muscles originate at the annulus of Zinn and travel anteriorly and temporally, inserting  $7.7\mathrm{mm}$  and  $6.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the limbus, respectively. The width of the insertion of each of the rectus muscles is approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$  and the distance between the adjacent insertion borders is approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$ . The insertions can be located accurately at roughly the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions of the globe. The superior oblique muscle originates from the orbital apex just superior and nasally to the annulus of Zinn and passes anteriorly along the superomedial orbital wall. The tendon of the superior oblique muscle passes through the trochlea (located at the junction of the medial and superior orbital rim, just posterior to the orbital rim), is redirected  $54^{\circ}$  from the frontal plane, and passes posteriorly and temporally beneath the superior rectus. It inserts approximately  $5 - 7\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the superior rectus insertion. The inferior oblique muscle originates at the maxilla slightly posterior to the inferior orbital rim and just lateral to the lacrimal groove. It travels posteriorly and laterally into the orbit at an angle of  $51^{\circ}$  with the frontal plane, passing inferior to the inferior rectus. It inserts posterior to the equator of the globe on the inferior and lateral aspect of the globe, approximately  $12\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the insertion of the inferior rectus.

# Technique: Enucleation

1. Preoperative evaluation consists of chart review, informed consent, and surgical marking to verify the correct eye.  
2. General anesthesia is induced and local anesthesia with epinephrine is injected under the conjunctiva and in a retrobulbar plane to aid in hemostasis.  
3. Eyelid retraction is established and Westcott scissors are used to perform a  $360^{\circ}$  peritomy at the corneal limbus (see Figure 56.1 in Case Report 56.1).  
4. Tenon's capsule is opened in all four quadrants between the rectus muscles using Steven scissors (see Figure 56.2 in Case Report 56.2).  
5. The rectus muscles are isolated using von Graefe muscle hooks.  
6. A locking 5-0 Vicryl suture is placed through each of the rectus muscles near their insertion to prevent retraction of the muscles following transection.  
7. The rectus muscles are transected off the eye just anterior to the sutures, leaving a  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  muscle stump, which can be grasped for traction (see Figure 56.3 in Case Report 56.1).  
8. The oblique muscles are hooked, isolated, and transected near Tenon's capsule.

9. Traction sutures with 4-0 silk are placed at the muscle insertions of the medial and lateral rectus muscles.  
10. The globe is placed under traction, prolonging it out of the conjunctiva (see Figure 56.4 in Case Report 56.1).  
11. A Sewall retractor may be used to retract Tenon's capsule away from the globe, exposing the optic nerve.  
12. A large hemostat is directed along the medial rectus muscle to meet resistance at the optic nerve and the nerve is clamped approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the eye.  
13. Enucleation scissors are introduced in a similar fashion, so the optic nerve falls within the blades.  
14. The optic nerve is transected and the globe is removed from the orbit.  
15. The clamp is released and local anesthesia is achieved with  $1\%$  phenylephrine hydrochloride, bipolar cautery, and/or placement of digital pressure.  
16. An implant is selected for insertion and placed deep into Tenon's space via an introducer (see Figure 56.5 in Case Report 56.1).  
17. Each of the four rectus muscles are sutured with 5-0 Vicryl suture to the implant by passing the suture directly either through the implant material, through prefabricated tunnels, or through the use of wrapping material.  
18. The anterior Tenon's capsule is closed with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl suture (see Figure 56.6 in Case Report 56.1).  
19. The conjunctiva is closed using a running locking 7-0 plain gut suture.  
20. Bupivicaine local anesthesia is injected into the retrobulbar space for postoperative pain.

# Technique: Evisceration

1. Preoperative evaluation consists of chart review, informed consent, and surgical marking to verify the correct eye.  
2. General anesthesia is induced and local anesthesia with epinephrine is injected under the conjunctiva and in a retrobulbar plane to aid in hemostasis.  
3. Eyelid retraction is established and Westcott scissors are used to perform a  $360^{\circ}$  peritomy at the corneal limbus, dissecting a few millimeters away from the limbus (see Figure 56.7 in Case Report 56.2).  
4. A blade is used to make a stab incision through the cornea at the limbus (see Figure 56.8 in Case Report 56.2), and Wescott scissors are used to make a full-thickness cut through the cornea for  $360^{\circ}$  (see Figure 56.9 in Case Report 56.2).  
5. The cornea is removed with toothed forceps.  
6. An evisceration spoon is used to remove the intraocular contents by placing the spoon between the choroid and the sclera and sweeping along the sclera (see Figure 56.10 in Case Report 56.2).

7. Two to four scleral relaxing incisions (see Figures 56.12 and 56.13 in Case Report 56.2) are cut anterior into the limbal wound to facilitate implant placement into the eye. Radial incisions are made along the posterior scleral wall if an implant is to be placed posterior to the sclera within the muscle cone.  
8. An implant is selected for insertion and pushed into the sclera (see Figure 56.14 in Case Report 56.2).  
9. The edges of the sclera are reapproximated and closed with permanent sutures.  
10. The anterior Tenon's capsule is closed with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl suture.  
11. The conjunctiva is closed using a running locking 7-0 plain gut suture (see Figure 56.15 in Case Report 56.2).  
12. Bupivicaine local anesthesia is injected into the retrobulbar space for postoperative pain.

# Postoperative Care

1. Topical ointment and a temporary ocular conformer are placed in the conjunctival fornix at the completion of the procedure and is worn until the patient receives a prosthesis 4-8 weeks following surgery.  
2. A pressure patch is placed over the orbit and left in place for 24-48 hours.  
3. Following removal of the patch, topical antibiotic ointment is applied several times a day for 3-4 weeks.  
4. A temporary ocular conformer is inserted at the completion of the procedure and is worn until the patient receives a custom-fit prosthesis approximately 4-8 weeks following surgery, giving adequate time for resolution of edema.  
5. Polycarbonate safety glasses should be prescribed to protect the fellow eye following enucleation.

# Complications

# Intraoperative Complications

1. Removal of the wrong eye: Prevented with meticulous preoperative evaluation consisting of chart review, informed consent, and surgical marking. In cases of intraocular tumor, ophthalmoscopy or ultrasonography may be beneficial prior to surgery.  
2. Loss of extraocular muscles: Appropriately placed traction sutures provide prevention of extraocular muscle retraction into the orbit.  
3. Orbital hemorrhage: Retrobulbar infusion of local anesthesia with epinephrine will decrease likelihood of hemorrhage. Prior to transection of the optic nerve, a hemostat can be clamped on the nerve for several minutes to decrease hemorrhage following transection. In the event of intraoperative hemorrhage, topical hemostatic agents, bipolar cautery, and/or placement of digital pressure may be beneficial for control.

# Early Postoperative Complications

1. Bleeding and edema: Minimized with placement of a pressure dressing for several days following surgery. With severe hemorrhage or hematoma, exploration may be warranted.  
2. Conformer dislodgement: Conformers may become dislodged postoperatively, leading to conjunctival prolapse and scarring of the fornices.  
3. Orbital infection: Systemic antibiotics and topical antibiotics postoperatively will minimize the risk of infection. Orbital infections following placement of integrated implants may be more common. Removal of the implant is rare, but may be necessary in refractory cases.

# Late Postoperative Complications

1. Enophthalmos: Due to loss of volume following removal of the globe. Corrected with dermis fat graft followed by implantation of an alloplastic block into the extraperiorbital space.  
2. Superior sulcus deformity: Due to loss of volume following removal of the globe and subsequent relaxation of the tissues into the orbit, manifesting as a deep grove or space between the upper eyelid and orbital rim, giving the appearance of enophthalmos and ptosis. Corrected with dermis fat grafting of the superior lid or suturing the levator complex tendon to the periosteum of the superior orbital rim. The presentation of enophthalmos, deep upper eyelid sulcus, ptosis, and laxity of the lower lid is referred to as post-enucleation socket syndrome.  
3. Socket contracture: Contracture of the ocular adnexal tissue following globe removal may limit orbital volume and space for a prosthesis. Additionally, implants placed following removal of the globe are smaller than the native globe, decreasing the orbital volume. This socket contracture may cause obliteration of the fornices, resulting in significant distortions of the lid margins, making repair and support of a prosthesis difficult.  
4. Wound dehiscence with implant exposure and extrusion: For exposures less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , observation may suffice. The use of free autogenous tissue grafts, such as Muller muscles flaps or tarsal patch flaps, is recommended for larger exposures. Wrapping of implants with autogenous tissue and a multilayer closure reduce the possibility of implant exposure.

# Key Points

# Types of ocular implants

1. Non-porous or non-integrated: Contain no component for attachment of the extraocular muscles and do not permit fibrovascular ingrowth. Typically covered, or wrapped, with a material to allow fixation of the

extraocular muscles. Examples include silicone and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).

2. Porous or integrated: Porous structure allows fibrovascular ingrowth, which may reduce the risk of extrusion and allow for insertion of a coupling device for prosthesis attachment at a secondary procedure. Examples include hydroxyapatite, porous polyethylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene. Hydroxyapatite implants are usually wrapped with donor sclera or other material due to its rough surface. Porous polyethylene do not require wrapping material and the extraocular muscles may be sutured directly to the implant.

Implant sizing: In general, larger implants improve cosmesis and motility, and the largest implant possible will decrease the risk of enophthalmos and superior sulcus deformity. While most patients will accommodate a 20-mm implant, several methods for determining the correct size of the implant have been developed, including using axial measurements of the fellow eye and volume assessment via A-scan ultrasonography of the fellow eye. Proper implant sizing may be more difficult with evisceration as size is limited by the scleral cavity. However, scleral releasing incisions allow for placement of larger implants.

Wrapping: Wrapping alloplastic implants is believed to provide an additional tissue barrier to implant exposure and allow extraocular muscles attachment, improving implant motility. Commonly used wrapping materials include donor tissue such as sclera, dermis, or pericardium, autogenous tissue such as temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, or periosteum, and synthetic material such as polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh.

Prosthesis motility: The prosthesis is not directly attached to the ocular implant in either surgery; thus, conjugate eye movement will never be exact. Since evisceration retains all extraocular muscles, enucleation classically involves the four rectus muscles, hence motility should be better with evisceration. These findings regarding prosthesis motility are however very similar. An elective secondary procedure is required to place the coupling peg or post into an implant in those patients who desire improved prosthetic motility. This procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization.
