# Transcervical Styloidectomy gotten Triangles of the Neck

Fear of surgery is simply a misunderstanding of anatomy.

-Randy Malloy

When discussing the "triangles of the neck," one is most likely to reference the broader anterior and posterior cervical triangles, but three, nearly forgotten anatomical triangles have important surgical application: Lesser's triangle, Pirogov's triangle, and Beclard's triangle. Classically, these triangles were used to locate the lingual artery for ligation. If one locates the hypoglossal nerve as it crosses the posterior border of the hyoglossus muscle and go just deep in this area, the lingual artery can commonly be identified.

All three of the aforementioned triangles are contained within the larger submandibular triangle that is bound:

- Superiorly by the inferior border of the mandible  
- Anteriorly by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle  
- Posteriorly by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle  
- Inferiorly by the region of the hyoid bone where the tendinous attachment of the digastric muscle inserts  
- The floor is made up of the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles (see Figure 57.1)

# Lesser's Triangle

Prior to the beginning of the Twentieth century, this triangle was not attributed to any one person. It was thought to be merely a "lesser"-sized triangle within the submandibular triangle. Recently, this triangle has been attributed to Ladislaus Leon Lesser (1846-1925), a German surgeon. Lesser's triangle is bound:

- Superiorly by the hypoglossal nerve  
- Anteriorly-inferiorly by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and its tendinous insertion into the hyoid bone  
- Posteriorly by the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle

# Pirogov's Triangle

Named after the Russian surgeon and scientist Nikolai I. Pirogov (1810-1881), it is a small posterior extension of Lesser's triangle. Pirogov's triangle is bound:

- Superiorly by the hypoglossal nerve  
- Inferoposteriorly by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle  
- Anteriorly by the posterior border of the mylohyoid

# Beclard's Triangle

This triangle is named after the French anatomist Pierre A. Beclard (1785-1825). Beclard's triangle is bound:

- Superiorly by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle  
- Inferiorly by the greater horn of the hyoid bone  
- Posteriorly by the posterior extent of the hyoglossus muscle

The hypoglossal nerve can be seen coursing superficial to the hyoglossus muscle and deep to the mylohyoid muscle in this region (see Figure 57.1).

# Transcervical Styloidectomy

Removal of all or a portion of an elongated styloid process.

# Indications

1. Eagle's Syndrome: Pain to the jaw/ear, dysphagia, and/or foreign body sensation usually presenting after surgery/trauma in adjacent area (i.e., tonsillectomy). Symptoms made worse by yawning or turning of the head. Can also present as "stylocarotid syndrome," which includes pain, visual disturbances, and syncope caused by compression of the carotid artery.  
2. Styloid process  $>3\mathrm{cm}$  in length is considered abnormal, but typically only treated symptomatically.

# Technique

1. General anesthesia is required with the patient supine and a shoulder roll in place. Patient is prepped and draped for a submandibular approach to the elongated styloid process.  
2. Incision is made through skin and superficial cervical fascia. Identify the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia (investing fascia) and locate the submandibular

gland which is covered by this fascia (see Figure 57.3 in Case Report 57.1).

3. Elevate the submandibular gland superiorly and identify the bellies of the digastric muscle and their intermediate tendons (see Figure 57.5 in Case Report 57.1). The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve should be within the submandibular gland investing fascia, which is retracted superiorly. The calcified styloid ligament should be easily palpated.  
4. Before proceeding further, the hypoglossal nerve is located as it courses deep in this area and just superficial to the hyoglossus muscle (see Figure 57.6 in Case Report 57.1). If the lingual artery is encountered (deep to the hypoglossal nerve), it may be preserved and retracted from the surgical site. If bleeding from the lingual artery occurs, it may be ligated.  
5. The styloid process is exposed (see Figure 57.7 in Case Report 57.1). A bur or saw is used to resect the portion of the elongated styloid process planned for removal

# Case Report

Case Report 57.1. Transcervical Styloidectomy. A 54-year-old male presents one month status post anterior cervical disc fusion (ACDF) with a foreign body sensation to the lateral throat and dysphagia made worse upon turning his head (positional pain). Modified barium swallow

(see Figure 57.8 in Case Report 57.1). The edges of the resected styloid process bone are smoothed to minimize damage and irritation to adjacent anatomical structures.  
6. The submandibular approach is closed in a layered fashion after hemostasis is achieved. Drains are not indicated.

# Complications

1. Hemorrhage: Controlled with local techniques (ligated, cauterization) when encountered. Sources of intraoperative bleeding are commonly from the facial artery/vein and lingual artery.  
2. Hypoglossal nerve damage: The hypoglossal nerve should be identified early in the procedure and protected throughout the procedure to minimize damage. Damage to this nerve will result in tongue deviation to the side of the injury and eventual atrophy of the involved tongue muscles.

study was negative. CT scan revealed bilateral elongated styloid processes (see Figure 57.2a, b). The patient underwent bilateral transcervical styloidectomy after a diagnosis of Eagle syndrome was derived (see Figures 57.2 through 57.9).
