# Anterolateral Thigh (ALT) Per Free Flap

Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA

A method of reconstructing soft tissue defects to various regions of the body. The anterior lateral thigh (ALT) perforator free flap has the ability to provide either individual components or any combination of skin, fascia, and muscle to reconstruct soft tissue defects of the head and neck regions. The ALT flap can be harvested as cutaneous, fasciocutaneous, fascial, adipofacial, or musculocutaneous based on the vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) perforators, and a chimeric flap based on the ascending, transverse, and descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA) combined with the VLM, rectus femoris muscle (RFM), tensor fascia lata (TFL), and anteromedial thigh (AMT) skin paddle.

# Indications

1. Within the oral cavity, the ALT flap is an excellent option for soft tissue defects arising from oncological ablative procedures such as buccal cancers resulting in through and through defects, total glossectomy, or subtotal defects, especially when there are no osseous defects. The authors of this chapter utilize this flap for selected maxillectomies patients who are not candidates for osseous reconstruction.  
2. The ALT flap serves as an option for salvage laryngectomy post-primary chemo/radiation for laryngeal cancers.  
3. Scalp defects arising from oncological ablation, as well as traumatic defects, which are not amendable for local rotational flaps.  
4. Neck reconstruction due to acquired defects from burns, necrotizing fasciitis, and in the treatment of osteoradionecrosis when the soft tissue envelope is compromised secondary to the delayed effects of radiation.  
5. Depending on the indication of the ALT flap, the flap might be raised in various techniques and encompassing various tissues from fasciocutaneous, fascial, chimeric, and finally, as a flow-through flap.

# Contraindications

1. Hypercoagulable state, which is a contraindication for all microvascular-free tissue transfers.  
2. Unsuitable donor site, a good example would be a traumatic injury to the thigh.  
3. Morbid obesity.  
4. Medical comorbidities contraindicating general anesthesia.  
5. Variability of the vascular anatomy, pedicle, and skin perforator that may prevent viable harvesting of the ALT flap. The absence of a reliable perforator in the ALT skin design may force the reconstructive team to convert the flap from an anterolateral thigh flap into an anteromedial thigh flap.  
6. Patients with peripheral vascular disease often present with a history of claudication, as well as lower extremity compromised vascularity (history of femoral-femoral bypass or aortofemoral bypass).  
7. The ALT flap has variable flap thickness; this may be influenced by the volume of the subcutaneous fat and the technique of flap harvest (i.e., if vastus lateralis muscle is harvested).

# Anatomy

The blood supply of the ALT flap free flap is derived from the lateral circumflex femoral artery. The lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA) originates from the profanda femoris (PF), also referred to as the deep femoral artery, a branch of the femoral artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery. The LCFA gives three branches (from superior to inferior): the Ascending (A-LCFA), Transverse (T-LCFA), and a Descending branch (D-LCFA). The D-LCFA is the main vascular pedicle for the ALT flap as it provides 1-3 cutaneous branches. The D-LCFA typically travels within the intermuscular space between the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles before it eventually disappears into the vastus lateralis muscle.

skin paddle of the ALT flaps is supplied by perforators. It was once perceived that perforators took a septocutaneous path; however, newer studies have revealed that  $87\%$  of ALTs harvested have a musculocutaneous perforator, while the septocutaneous perforators accounted for only  $13\%$ . The later pattern of perforators facilitates flap harvest as it eliminates the need for meticulous intramuscular dissection. Irrespective of whether the ALTs are on the same side or both of these arterial vessels are always accompanied by two venae comitantes. Despite the variability regarding skin perforators location, perforators seem to follow a similar pattern. The midpoint in the line connecting the anterior superior iliac spine and lateral border of the patella appears to be a consistent point to locate one perforator within a  $3\mathrm{cm}$  radius circle around that midpoint.

The sensory innervation comes from the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3) and may be harvested with the ALT flap if a sensate flap is necessary. The motor innervation of the vastus lateralis muscle comes from the motor branches of the femoral nerve and the motor branches should be preserved during flap harvest.

# Surgical Technique

1. The operating table is positioned to allow two simultaneous surgical teams. The patient is positioned with a shoulder role to hyperextend the neck. In contrast, the legs are placed in a neutral position. In obese patients, the placement of a bean bag or folded cover sheets under the hip will improve visualization of critical landmarks.  
2. The donor site is confirmed and is prepared separately from the head and neck prep. The hair on the donor's thigh is clipped and a chlorhexidine Gluconate ChloraPrep® stick is utilized to complete the donor site prep. Care should be taken to prepare the thigh circumferentially, extending to the umbilicus and below the knee. The surgical site is squared off with surgical towels and a window is removed over the thigh.  
3. The anterior superior iliac spine is marked, and a line is extended inferior to the lateral border of the patella. A midpoint of this line is marked and a circle with a  $3\mathrm{cm}$  radius is marked and centered along this midpoint. The main skin perforator is usually located within this circle. The location of the perforator is confirmed with a handheld duplex Doppler and is marked with a marking pen or a non-resorbable suture (see Figure 73.4). The outline of the ALT flap is marked and centered on this perforator and guided by the defect size.  
4. Raising the flap in fasciocutaneous fashion allows the harvesting of a robust flap. The harvest is classically

started medially and is carried in the subfascial plane. Care is taken to identify any skin perforator and to refrain from sacrificing any perforators.

5. Using an electrocautery Colorado microdissection needle, the medial dissection is performed through the skin and subcutaneous fat and the fascia over the rectus femoris (RF) muscle. This subfascial dissection facilitates the identification of inter-muscular septum between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis; using an Allis clamp, the fascia is grasped and retracted laterally.  
6. By retracting the (RF) muscle medially and entering the intermuscular septum, the descending branch is exposed and the perforator is dissected back to the main pedicle. At this stage, if necessary, modifications can be made to both the skin paddle design or conversion to an anteromedial perforator flap may be undertaken.  
7. Septocutaneous perforators are easy to identify; however, this is not the case regarding intermuscular perforators. The surgeon should be aware of the numerous branching vessels to the VL. This becomes crucial if a muscle cuff is needed to obliterate any dead space within the ablative defect. The authors prefer the use of blunt-end dissecting instrument like the Schmidt Tonsil Hemostat Forceps or a curved hemostat while using micro-Adson forceps bipolar to de-roof the perforators. At this time, any branching vessels may be clipped with Ethicon LIGACLIP®.  
8. Every effort should be made to preserve the motor branches of the femoral nerve. However, sometimes a complicated interconnected relationship exists between the vascular pedicle and the motor branches, in this situation, the motor branch is cut, and the perforator with its pedicle is released, and primary motor nerve neurorrhaphy should be performed with 8.0 nylon suture. The pedicle should be dissected as proximal as possible to the LCFA maintaining the needed pedicle length and recipient vessels.  
9. Before completing the lateral dissection, if necessary, the skin paddle design may be modified to center the skin paddle over the dissected perforators and confirmed the needed skin paddle size. During the lateral dissection, care should be taken to protect the perforators with the nondominant hand. It is advised that the surgeon performing the lateral incision holds the flap with the nondominant hand while protecting the perforators. After the flap is completely dissected from the lateral side, handheld Doppler is used to confirm blood flow to the flap. The flap is tucked back into the thigh after being wrapped with a blue moist towel or lap until the completion of the ablative procedure.

10. After the vascular pedicle is ligated, the thigh donor site is closed primarily facilitated with undermining of the skin edges. The VL and RF are approximated with resorbable sutures. Typically, the fascia cannot be approximated and 1-2 suction drains with a harpoon are passed lateral to the incision. Drains are secured with non-resorbable 2.0 suture. The subcutaneous tissues are approximated with resorbable sutures and the skin is closed with skin staples. For skin paddle greater than  $8\mathrm{cm}$ , a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) from the contralateral thigh should be harvested to cover the donor site (see Figure 73.1). The STSG is harvested with a dermatome, and the STSG is perforated to evacuate underlying fluid accumulation and wound VAC can be placed or a traditional bolster dressing using Xeroform gauze.  
11. If multi-subunit reconstructions are needed, the ALT may be designed with two skin paddles, where each skin paddle is based on a perforator.

# Postoperative Management

Depending on your hospital and flap monitoring protocol, the authors have moved away from admitting flap patients to the ICU, unless the patient received a tracheostomy or require intubation for 24 hours.

The authors flap monitoring protocol includes a clinical examination of the flap every 2 hours for the first 48 hours, and then every 4 hours after 48 hours.

1. The clinical examination includes a visual inspection of the flap for:

1. Any color changes (baseline color/mottled/cyanotic)  
2. Flap trigger (soft/flaccid/tense)  
3. Capillary refill (normal 3 sec/sluggish/brisk)  
4. Temperature (warm/cold)  
5. Handheld Doppler signal (present/absent)  
6. Pinprick (done if other signs of flap compromise is present)

2. The patient is immediately started on a loading dose of aspirin of  $325\mathrm{mg}$  per rectum, followed by q8 hours of  $80\mathrm{mg}$  via the feeding tube, which decreases platelet aggregation. In addition, our flap patients receive  $5000\mathrm{U}$  of Heparin unfractionated IV after the microvascular anastomosis is completed and continues to receive a heparin prophylaxis dose of  $5000\mathrm{U}$  SC BID/day until discharge from the hospital.  
3. The patient should maintain a normotensive status while avoiding the use of vasopressors, especially in the ICU setting. A swallowing assessment is started on postoperative day (POD) #3 to determine if the patient is safe to resume po intake.  
4. Suction drains should be inspected for holding suction by striping the flexible tubing while the stopper is

closed on the suction bulb. Drains are removed if the output is  $< 25\mathrm{cc}$  for 24 hours.

5. Patients are allowed to start weight bearing after 24 hours with the guidance of physiotherapy.  
6. Every other staple is removed on POD #5 and the remainder of the staples are removed POD 7-10.

# Complications

1. Early complications such as surgical site infection, bleeding, and seroma are rare, and early identification and management are paramount. Hematomas or seromas should be aspirated, and a pressure dressing applied to the donor site. Flap patients are kept on antibiotics for five days; however, this should be extended if surgical site infection occurs and continued until infection resolution.  
2. Pseudo compartment syndrome may occur if tension closure was performed and is a condition that requires an emergent return to the operating room. The donor site should be opened and decompressed.  
3. Larger flaps  $(>25\mathrm{cm})$  may develop partial flap necrosis, which is managed with serial debridement and wound care until the final portion of flap necrosis reveals itself. Total flap necrosis can typically be avoided with early detection and maintaining stringent microvascular surgical principles.

# Key Points

1. The ALT flap can be utilized for head and neck, upper and lower extremities, and breast reconstruction, as this flap can provide a large skin paddle.  
2. The ALT flap provides a long vascular pedicle (up to  $12\mathrm{cm}$ ) that allows comfortable reach to donor vessels to allow favorable microvascular anastomosis.  
3. The diameter of the vascular pedicle is favorable to allow anastomosis while avoiding a cumbersome "size miss-match." A reported diameter more than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  before mechanical and chemical dilation of the vessels.  
4. The ALT flap allows a simultaneous two-team approach with minor donor site morbidity. The ALT donor site typically allows for primary closure (see Figure 73.6 in Case Report 73.1). Wider skin paddles require either split thickness tissue grafts (see Figure 73.1) or the donor site can be closed with a combination of both full-thickness skin graft used from the deep epithelialized portions of the ALT flap along with split-thickness skin grafts harvested from the lateral surface of the thigh.  
5. The ALT flap provides the potential to harvest a sensate flap by utilization of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
