A procedure to restore the function and esthetic form of the nasolabial complex in patients with a congenital cleft lip deformity.

# Indications

1. Congenital unilateral or bilateral cleft lip deformity. Wilhelmsen and Musgrave's rule of 10's (hemoglobin higher than  $10\mathrm{g / dL}$ , weight over 10 lbs, and age older than 10 weeks) is traditionally followed to reduce perioperative morbidity.

# Contraindications

1. Inability to tolerate general anesthesia safely.  
2. Inadequate patient and caregiver support. Care of cleft patients should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary setting where patients and their caretakers have pre- and postoperative support.

# Anatomy

1. Orbicularis oris muscle  
2. Columella  
3. Philtral column  
4. White skin roll (epidermis-vermilion junction line)  
5. Peak and trough of Cupid's bow  
6. Lip tubercle  
7. Nasal septum  
8. Anterior nasal spine

# Preoperative Treatment

In recent years, nasoalveolar molding (NAM) has increased in favor with many surgeons. NAM includes using intraoral and external devices to decrease the distance between the cleft segments. Devices used can be as simple as placing tape across the lip while bringing the segments together, or can

include orthodontic devices that are adjusted on a weekly basis. NAM should be initiated within 2 weeks of birth and no later than 6 weeks. Often, maxillary devices will include an extension that provides light outward pressure along the nasal rim to increase projection of the naris. NAM has been shown to improve esthetics preoperatively by decreasing the width of the cleft defects prior to surgery at approximately 10-12 weeks. Evidence is lacking that long-term postoperative results are improved. Results can be affected by lack of patient and caregiver compliance.

# Millard Technique

Numerous techniques have been employed since the first cleft closures were attempted. The most commonly used technique is the rotation-advancement procedure known as the Millard repair. Modifications have been made to Millard's technique since it was first described; however, the principles of the procedure remain unchanged.

# Unilateral Cheilorhinoplasty Technique

1. The patient is placed in supine position on the operating table and intubated with an oral RAE endotracheal tube.  
2. The eyes are protected, and the oral cavity and face are prepped.  
3. A sterile marking pen or methylene blue on a 30G needle tip is used to mark the trough of Cupid's bow and the midline of the lip (point 2). The peak of Cupid's bow is marked on the non-cleft side (point 1). A caliper is used to measure the distance from these two points and used to mark the proposed height of Cupid's bow on the non-cleft side adjacent to the cleft (point 4). Study of the cleft anatomy should also be used to verify appropriate placement of the height of contour.

Figure 34.1. Key landmarks identified in planning of incisions and closure of unilateral cleft lip. The above image is the patient in Case Report 34.1.

4. A mark is placed on the cleft side along the vermillion at the medial aspect where the white roll appears fully developed and the vermillion is at its greatest thickness (Point  $4'$ ).  
5. Markings are then designed to reconstruct the philtral column and nasal base. The proposed incision on the non-cleft side travels along the base of the columella (points 5-6) and curves down the proposed philtral column to the proposed height of Cupid's bow adjacent to the cleft (point 4). The cleft side uses a release along the alar base (points  $5^{\prime} - 6^{\prime}$ ), extending as far medially as well formed skin permits (point  $6^{\prime}$ ), then heads inferiorly to the proposed height of Cupid's bow on the cleft side (point  $4^{\prime}$ ).  
6. A Z-plasty is designed (points 3 and  $3^{\prime}$ ) along the vermilion to increase the width of the lip tubercle and the markings are continued down to the vestibule of the lip.  
7. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is infiltrated into the above flaps and 3-5 minutes is allowed for vasoconstrictor to take effect.  
8. Incisions are made along the proposed incision lines with a #11 scalpel blade through skin and subcutaneous tissues. Intraorally incisions are extended to the height of the vestibule and a subperiosteal dissection is performed along the anterior maxilla releasing the soft tissue over the piriform rim and around the infraorbital foramen.  
9. The orbicularis oris muscle is dissected to a length of  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  from the surrounding tissues on both sides of the cleft. The muscle is detached from its superior attachments so that the lip segments can be rotated inferiorly.  
10. The anterior portion of the nasal septum is dissected and released from the anterior nasal spine to aid in

repositioning in the midline. The ala on the cleft side is freed from the piriform rim to allow for advancement.

11. A 3-0 PDS suture is then placed through the nasalis muscles of the alar bases and tied to achieve the desired alar base width. This should be slightly over tightened as relaxation of the tissues in the postoperative period can cause over widening of the alar base.  
12. The orbicularis oris muscle is sutured together with Vicryl horizontal mattress sutures.  
13. The vermillion border is visualized on either side of the cleft and brought together over the closed muscle (points 4 and  $4^{\prime}$ ).  
14. Deep dermal 5-0 Monocryl sutures are used to approximate the flap edges to reconstruct the philtral column and nasal sills.  
15. The mucosa is closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures to recreate the labial vestibule.  
16. The skin incisions are closed with 6-0 or 5-0 fast gut sutures.  
17. Adhesive dressings are applied across the surgical site to reduce skin tension.  
18. Insertion of lubricated nostril retainers (if indicated) to aid in nostril shape. These can be sutured in place with a transcollumellar silk suture.

# Bilateral Cheilorhinoplasty Technique

1. The patient is placed in supine position on the operating table and intubated with an oral RAE endotracheal tube.  
2. The eyes are protected and the oral cavity and face are prepped.

![](images/e6a881e8f15600bd7c82903b04d7dd38ac1cfc18d7917e5b30c9ea18c17782e0.jpg)  
Figure 34.2. Key landmarks identified in planning of incisions and closure of bilateral cleft lip. (Prime numbers indicate cleft-sided landmarks to be closed to corresponding non-cleft-sided landmarks.) The above image is the patient in Case Report 34.2.

3. A marking pen is used to outline incisions along the prolabium. The midline Cupid's bow trough (point 1) is identified as far inferiorly as normal skin extends. The width of the philtral flap is variable based on patient age and anatomy but typically should be narrower than the columella at its superior extent (point 3), between 2 and  $3\mathrm{mm}$  in width. This extends inferiorly with a gradual widening to  $3 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  near the inferior extent of the philtral skin, typically the height of the flap is  $6 - 7\mathrm{mm}$  when using all allowable skin tissue and the widest portion (points 2) is  $1.5 - 2.5\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the trough of the proposed Cupid's bow. The superior extent that the widest portion of the flap is above the trough of Cupid's bow determines how acute or obtuse the final Cupid's bow will be.  
4. The cleft side incisions are designed along the alar base (point  $4'$ ) (these should not extend lateral to the alar base) extending medially to the extent of usable skin tissue (point  $3'$ ) and inferiorly to the proposed height of Cupid's bow to the most medial extent of where the white roll is well defined and the vermilion is of full thickness (point  $1'$ ). A  $3\mathrm{mm}$  release laterally along the white roll is marked (point  $2'$ ).  
5. Local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor is infiltrated into the above flaps and 3-5 minutes is allowed for vasoconstrictor to take effect.  
6. The incisions are made with an #11 blade as outlined above through skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis is achieved with judicious use of cautery.  
7. One to two millimeters of subcutaneous tissue laterally should remain attached to the flap to help with vascularity and provide additional anterior projection to the repaired philtral columns. The non-philtral portions of the prolabium are inverted to form the labial vestibule.  
8. The philtral flap is elevated in a supraperiosteal plane with care taken to preserve sufficient pedicle to ensure survival of the skin.  
9. Cleft side incisions are made and extended to the height of the vestibule, the vestibular mucosa is released laterally and a subperiosteal dissection is performed along the anterior maxilla releasing the soft tissue over the piriform rim and around the infraorbital foramen.  
10. The orbicularis oris muscle is dissected from the skin and vermilion to a depth of  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  bilaterally. If muscles are aberrantly attached to maxilla, this attachment should be removed.  
11. A 3-0 PDS suture is placed through the nasalis muscles of the alar bases and tied to the desired alar base width. This should be slightly over tightened as relaxation of the tissues in the postoperative period can cause over widening.  
12. The two aspects of the muscle are united and sutured together at the midline with 4-0 Vicryl horizontal mattress sutures.

13. Closure of the incisions is initiated by bringing together key landmarks. The vermilion is brought together at the midline (points 1 to  $1'$ ). Cupid's peaks are formed by bringing together the philtral corners to the lateral most extent of the  $3\mathrm{mm}$  releasing lip incisions along the white role (points 2 to  $2'$ ).  
14. Deep dermal 5-0 Monocryl sutures are used to approximate the flap edges to reconstruct the philtral columns and nasal sills.  
15. The mucosa is closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures to recreate the labial vestibule.  
16. The skin incisions are closed with 6-0 or 5-0 fast gut sutures.  
17. Adhesive dressings are applied to the surgical site to reduce skin tension.  
18. Insertion of lubricated nostril retainers (if indicated) to aid in nostril shape. These can be sutured in place with a transcollumellar silk suture.

# Postoperative Management

1. Placement of surgical skin glue and/or an adhesive dressing over the wound allows for protection of the sutures and helps avoid incidental trauma.  
2. No creams, lotions, or moisturizers should be applied. The nostril retainers should be cleaned with saline nasal spray.  
3. Patient can begin bottle feeding immediately after surgery, resuming the use of their special needs feeder.  
4. Parents or caretakers are asked to avoid placement of anything else in mouth for 3 weeks, pacifiers are discouraged.  
5. Avoidance of direct sunlight for 6 months postoperatively.  
6. Nostril retainers can be left in place for several months if tolerated.  
7. Patient can be admitted for observation until normal feeding is demonstrated.

# Complications

1. Infection: Preoperative antibiotics should be given prior to procedure start. The incidence of infection can be minimized through proper surgical environment and technique.  
2. Bleeding or hematoma formation: Achieving intraoperative hemostasis at all portions throughout the procedure will decrease blood loss during the procedure and minimize bleeding postoperatively.  
3. Wound dehiscence or breakdown: Due to patient's age and lack of physical coordination, this can be a concern if the patient traumatizes the surgical site postoperatively. Adhesive dressings and placing mittens over patient's hands can help mitigate this risk.

4. Devitalization of the philtral flap in bilateral clefts: Although the blood supply to the prolabium is robust, improper surgical technique and tissue handling can place philtral flap at risk of devitalization. Creating adequate thickness in tissues underlying the prolabial skin can minimize this risk.  
5. Poor cosmetic result, excessive scaring, incomplete repair of cleft: At times, revision of cleft repairs may be necessary. Revision surgeries do not commonly affect development of patient function and can often be completed when the patient is older or at the time of other staged surgeries.

# Key Points

1. Cleft lip deformity originates around the 5th week of fetal development due to lack of fusion of median nasal process and maxillary process.  
2. Cleft lip and or palate occurs in one in every 600-700 births. Isolated unilateral cleft lip and isolated bilateral cleft lip represent  $25\%$  and  $5\%$  of total cases, respectively (1 in every 2800 births). Unilateral cleft lip and palate and bilateral cleft lip and palate represent  $50\%$  and  $20\%$ , respectively (1 in every 1600 births). Left-sided unilateral cleft lip is more common than right-sided, which is more common than bilateral.  
3. Rule of 10's. The infant should be at least 10 weeks old, 10 pounds  $(4.55\mathrm{kg})$  in weight, and with a hemoglobin of at least  $10\mathrm{g / dL}$ .  
4. Excessive dissection of the orbicularis oris muscle should be avoided to minimize tension on the skin during closure.  
5. Release past the alar bases or into the alar facial sulcus should be avoided to prevent excessive scarring and unaesthetic postoperative results.  
6. Knowledge of the general and individual cleft anatomy should be employed to achieve ideal esthetic results. Each cleft has its own anatomy, and incisions may need to be modified to maximize outcomes.

# Case Reports

Case Report 34.1. Unilateral cleft lip. A 3-month-old male presents with a left unilateral cleft lip and alveolus. Preoperatively, the patient underwent taping of the upper lip to approximate the segments. Treatment involved a rotation-advancement procedure (Millard) (see Figures 34.1 and 34.3 through 34.12).

Figure 34.14. After sterile prep and draping, incision lines are determined and marked. The prealveolar segment is used to create the philtrum with the remaining skin turned inward to create the labial vestibule. Incisions on the lateral aspect are made along the alar base to the vermilion and then carried along the vermilion border to the height of the Cupid's bow.
