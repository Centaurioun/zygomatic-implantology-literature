# 43.1 Introduction

The reconstruction of ablative defects of the maxillofacial system remains one of the most difficult tasks for a surgeon to master. Due to the incredibly precise relationship of the maxillomandibular complex in establishing functional occlusion, minor discrepancies can cause a noticeable and disruptive relationship for the patient and make dental restoration difficult for their dentist. If larger discrepancies are present, these may not be possible to restore, even for a skilled maxillofacial prosthodontist. In addition, because of the complex shapes of the facial skeleton, identical premorbid restoration remains a difficult task. Accordingly, the exposed nature of the face and demand for cosmetically pleasing outcomes create considerable challenges towards obtaining satisfactory goals for both patient and physician.

Another point which must be considered is the dynamic areas of force within the maxilla and mandible. These cause stresses on not only the hardware but also the graft itself and can result in mechanical failure of the hardware or proper bony union due to micromovement. The flora of the oral cavity also pose an obstacle to success as the thin mucosal coverage and extremely dynamic musculature can cause exposure and contamination of the graft. Any of these factors can lead to failure.

Ultimately, the surgeon is tasked with a set of very specific goals in the reconstruction of the maxilla and mandible. Ideally, the reconstructed maxilla or mandible will have appropriate position and relationship with the opposing jaw, adequate height and width for restoration, reestablish continuity of the arch, and supply the contour and support for the overlying soft tissues. With these in mind, the restoration of the unique functions, including mastication, deglutition, and protection of the airway, is possible.

The original causes of the defects can offer unique challenges as well. A bony defect caused by benign neoplasms requires significantly less volume to restore than defects caused by malignant neoplasms of the same size. In contrast, defects caused by traumatic or infectious etiology bear the burden of a compromised soft tissue

bed and friability of the thin overlying mucosa. Other factors that predispose patients to infection including systemic diseases, medications, exposure to therapeutic radiation, or congenital agenesis of the structures present their own unique challenges. Though well known as a risk factor for postoperative infections, poorly controlled diabetes is found to have a statistically significant risk elevation particularly in block grafts [1]. It is well known that there is a higher complication rate in irradiated patients, up to  $81.3\%$  [2]. In fact, studies have shown complete graft loss in  $30\%$  of patients with an additional  $50\%$  showing partial graft loss after reconstruction procedures were completed [3]. These rates have dropped significantly with the use of vascularized free flaps [4].

As with every surgery, the assessment of the defect and the planning stages are most critical. Small vertical defects present significantly different challenges than large horizontal defects. Those near the inferior border also have significantly different requirements than those at the alveolus. The type of bone, cortical vs. cancellous, as well as the amount of volume desired will significantly alter the harvest site as well as approach and mode of fixation. A single improper choice may be the factor which results in failure of the graft, therefore appropriate preoperative assessment is arguably the most important part of the surgery.

# 43.2 Anatomic Considerations

Examination of the mandible shows four basic anatomic regions; condyle, ramus, body, and alveolus, each with its own specific set of demands for reconstructions. In addition to these four broadly defined regions, there are other sub-regions which can be described. The coronoid, though rarely reconstructed, can be considered as a portion of the ramus. The angle is part of both the ramus and body of the mandible. The symphysis and parasymphysis are at the anterior aspect of the body with a significant angulation change.

The condyle is critical for the mobility of the mandible, which, if improperly restored, can create problems with mastication and articulation of speech. In the pediatric population, the condyle remains a growth center of the mandible. This is a key consideration when selecting appropriate graft. The relationship to the articular disc and supporting structures of the native TMJ are outside the scope of this chapter. The lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the medial pole of the condyle and allows for lateral excursive movements along with translation of the condyle. When reconstructing this region, an inappropriately attached muscle will result in the loss of these functions which can limit mouth opening and fine occlusal control. The condyle also offers a portion of

the posterior height of the mandible. Insufficient reconstruction can result in a contralateral open bite and cosmetically unsatisfactory result on the affected side. The neocondyle must also be placed in an anatomically acceptable location, as it would otherwise preclude acceptable function.

The ramus consists of broad, thin plates of cortical bone which serve as an attachment for most muscles of mastication including the temporalis, masseter, and medial pterygoid that subsequently bears the brunt of the masticatory forces. These muscles provide an excellent blood supply and recipient bed for the nonvascular grafts. The ramus provides the majority of the posterior facial height and the angle offers a transition zone to the body and alveolus. Loss of this structure could cause malocclusion, facial contour deformity and loss of masticatory function. The inferior alveolar nerve also enters the mandible in this region and is prone to injury during not only resection but also reconstructive efforts. The coronoid, although not typically reconstructed by these authors, can cause mechanical trismus if positioned too far anterior or superior relative to the zygoma.

The body of the mandible is arguably the most complex area to restore. Depending on location, there are significant angulations which must be restored. It also carries the load anterior to the force as a third class lever and contains the inferior alveolar nerve along with its exit point. At this anatomic location, there are areas of significant muscle pull coupled with thin mucosa which increases risk of wound dehiscence. The anterior digastric, genioglossus, geniohyoid, mylohyoid, buccinators, mentalis, and tongue musculature all attach to this area of the mandible. Though the muscles do increase risk of dehiscence with use, they provide a vascular bed to allow for nonvascularized grafting. The anterior tongue musculature must be appropriately resuspended to allow for proper airway support. The inferior border of the mandible also acts as support for the facial contour as well as the anterior projection of the mandible.

The mandibular alveolus is the structural foundation for occlusion. It is completely reliant on the mandibular body for position. Consequently, significant challenges in the dental rehabilitation can arise if the body is restored too far laterally or medially. Additionally, if there is limited height or width it can make implant-based rehabilitation impossible. Although this area does not have the same muscular pull as the ramus or body, the stresses on the overlying mucosa, especially with a lack of keratinized gingiva, can cause dehiscence and compromise the graft.

The maxilla is a complex, pyramidal bone with close anatomic relationships of the opposing mandible, the orbit, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and zygomas bilaterally. The projection of the maxillary alveolus in the

anterior is critical in maintaining lip support and esthetics. The palate serves as the roof of the mouth and is the anatomic barrier between the oral and nasal cavities. If improperly restored, it can create hypernasal speech as well as nasal regurgitation upon swallowing. Both of these issues can be treated with an obturator appliance. The maxilla has a very limited soft tissue supply, consisting of the attached and unattached gingiva in the region, along with the mucosal lining of the sinuses and nasal cavity superiorly. Because of this it can make nonvascular reconstruction rather difficult. Posteriorly, the palatal musculature is attached. This muscle group functions to aid in speech, swallowing, and Eustachian tube function. The maxillary sinuses, particularly in the aging population, limit the amount of underlying bone for fixation of grafts.

# 43.3 Defects of the Mandible

Defects of the mandible, much like other bones in the body, can be unifocal, multifocal, or complete - involving the entirety of the mandible (Fig. 43.1). There can also be marginal defects in which the inferior and posterior segments are left intact. These defects are usually approached intraorally and goals of rehabilitation are restoration of height and width, though grafting may not be necessary in all cases. Segmental defects are losses of continuity in the mandible. These are typically described by location and size in centimeters with the length being measured at the inferior border. Based on this measurement, the harvest site can be appropriately planned. For example, reconstruction of a small, lateral defect can be deferred or sometimes omitted. This does carry risk of hardware failure in the long term. Anterior defects, on the other hand, are complicated by maintaining inter-ramal width as well as maintaining

position of the tongue. It is also in this area where there are the suprahyoid muscles which can cause traction at an intraoral wound margin. The complex angles and dynamic musculature in this area often makes it the most difficult to restore. Segmental defects, specifically larger or more complex defects, can be planned with reconstruction plates preoperatively either by prebending according to a model or creating a laser sintered plate to reduce plate fatigue.

# 43.4 Defects of the Maxilla

Maxillary defects are categorized into one of two subtypes; those missing bony volume/position and those that are directly adjacent to bony cavities. One of the more commonly used classifications is the Brown classification which addresses defects extending into the midface [5] (Fig. 43.2). Smaller defects involving the bony cavities, similar to oro-antral fistulas, can be managed more conservatively with soft tissue procedures only. Larger defects of this subtype can also be managed conservatively by the creation of obturators or other maxillofacial prosthetics. For consideration of bony position, specifically anterior/posterior position of the maxillary alveolus, secondary orthognathic surgery can be performed in order to provide facial harmony and appropriate masticatory forces. With alveolar defects, assessment of width, height, and relationship to the mandible must be performed for appropriate restoration and rehabilitation.

# 43.5 Limitation of Bony Reconstruction

Reconstruction of the maxilla and mandible are largely dependent on the overlying soft tissues. These tissues act as the vascular and therefore nutrient bed for the future

graft. If there is inadequate soft tissue available, the grafts can become exposed quickly and be lost to mechanical or infective causes. Because of this, the practitioner must assess the soft tissue structures first and address any defects, and ultimately optimize the soft tissue bed prior to osseous surgery. Once completed, success and reconstruction is largely dependent on the practitioner. Having a wide arsenal of donor sites offers a host of options which are only limited by the imagination of the surgeon. Additionally, paying attention to host limitations such as systemic conditions and previous surgeries that can affect graft options will put the surgeon in a better position for optimal outcomes.

# 43.6 Bone Biology

Bone is unique compared to most other tissues in the body in that healing is accomplished through regeneration and replacement rather than formation of scar tissue. Because of further research into the biochemical pathways involved in bony healing, along with improvements in fixation and surgical technique, success rates in theses surgeries have continued to improve. Bone regeneration is a product of three processes that the Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon should have intimate familiarity with: osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and osteogenesis. Osteoconduction is new bone formation along some sort of scaffold – whether that be demineralized allograft, autograft, or collagen matrix. Osteoinduction is the process by which osteogenesis is induced – taking mesenchymal cells and inducing differentiation into preosteoblasts. Osteogenesis is, simply put, the formation of new bone.

As stated earlier, the understanding of the pathways of bony healing has significantly increased in the past few decades. Of note is the discovery of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) discovered by the orthopedic

surgeon Marshall Urist in 1965 [6]. The name bone morphogenic protein was not coined for another 6 years when he published further research in the Journal of Dental Research [7]. BMP is related to the TGF-B superfamily of proteins with the exception of BMP 1. Currently, there are 20 different types of BMP identified [8] with BMP 2,4,5,6,7, and 9 shown to induce both intramembranous and endochondral ossification [9]. The most commonly used clinically are BMP 2, 4, and 7 with BMP 2 used almost exclusively in OMFS applications [10]. As with any pathway, there are multiple antagonists for regulation [11-15]. These antagonists include noggin, chordin, gremlin, dan, and cerberus that act by binding to the BMP and can then affect cartilage and skeletal creation. In addition to these, BMP 13 and Smad6 also act to affect downstream signaling pathways and antagonize bone development.

BMP 2, 4, and 7 are involved in differentiating osteoprogenitor cells into the osteoblastic lineage, ultimately becoming osteoblasts. The BMPs themselves bind to a transmembrane receptor complex and initiate intracellular responses, ultimately passing to the nucleus using Smad4. At this point, Smads operate as inducible transcriptional activators, with Smad 1 causing osteoblastic differentiation. Genetic research continues for the regulation of the myriad of pathways involved in these processes. Currently, research is being conducted examining regulation by microRNA in downregulation of these pathways [16].

# 43.7 Bone Grafting Biology

The process of biologic bone repair was initially described by Axhausen in two phases: cellular proliferation and organization [17]. During the proliferation phase, osteocompetent cells within the graft will differentiate, proliferate, and deposit new osteoid. The amount of osteoid deposition is largely dependent on the amount of viable osteocompetent cells that are transferred. As previously mentioned, the soft tissue envelope is key to cell survival, as they derive nutrition via plasmatic circulation for the first 3-5 days, followed by neovascularization and direct nourishment by capillary ingrowth [18, 19]. Organization involves the replacement of osteoid by osteoclasts derived from fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells as well as new organized bone laid down by osteoblasts. These processes are regulated by the BMPs mentioned earlier in this chapter. Typically these processes will start about 2 weeks after the procedure is performed.

Autografts can be either cortical, cancellous, or a hybrid of the two, corticocancellous. Due to the significantly larger surface area cancellous grafts revascularize quicker than either of the other types of autografts [20].

Additionally, they transfer significantly more mesenchymal stem cells to the graft site than the cortical counterpart [21]. Because of the transfer of osteocompetent cells, the graft-derived osteogenic proteins aid in osteoinduction. Much like fractures that heal by the indirect method, these areas are quickly surrounded in hematoma resulting in areas of lower oxygen tension. This ultimately results in recruitment of more mesenchymal stem cells, which begin to lay a bed of granulation tissue within 48 hours [22]. Necrotic graft is then slowly removed by macrophages concurrent with the neovascularization phase. After this occurs, osteoid is deposited along the former trabeculae by the present and newly differentiated osteoblasts which are ultimately reorganized to mature bone within 6-12 months [20]. These types of grafts gradually strengthen over time as new bone is deposited and reorganized.

Cortical grafts do not offer the same cellularity of the cancellous type. However, these grafts offer excellent stability due to the rigid structure present and can be directly fixated to the recipient site with plating systems. This rigidity also hampers the initial healing processes and results in early osteoblastic death [23]. In order to penetrate and revascularize the graft, new blood vessels must grow down the existing haversian canals [24]. Cortical bone also heals in an opposing fashion to the cancellous graft – being that it is primarily mediated by osteoclastic activity [25]. The osteoclasts follow the path of the new blood vessels and begin widening the haversian canals followed by osteoblastic deposition of osteoid in a method known as creeping substitution. This will begin at the graft host junction and proceed down the grafts axis. During this period of resorption, the donor graft can significantly weaken retaining only  $75\%$  of its original strength in some cases [20, 25]. There may remain areas of necrotic bone covered by viable bone indefinitely.

Though autografting remains the gold standard in reconstruction, there are additional options for reconstruction including allografts and xenografts. Though these other options offer an extremely favorable possibility of no donor site morbidity and shorter surgery times, outcomes of form and function remain inferior [26]. Allografts (also known as allogeneic grafts) are human cadaver-derived grafts. Because these are genetically different, they must have all antigens removed in order to decrease risk of rejection. This can be performed by boiling, deproteinizing, freeze-drying (lyophilization), or irradiating to name a few, with freeze-drying being the most popular. The other methods will also result in cell death, but in the process will cause coagulation of the associated organic products making their removal by the host cells difficult [27]. Additionally, once temperatures exceed  $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  the biologic properties of the bone matrix are destroyed [28]. These grafts are

strictly osteoconductive as they have no inherent inductive properties.

# 43.8 Bone Morphogenic Protein

BMP is another excellent choice for grafting material. In its current commonly used form, BMP is available as an implant which is placed with a type 1 absorbable collagen sponge to allow for not only a mechanical area for release of the BMP but also a slightly prolonged release. Other studies have reported additional carriers including hydroxyapatite, fibrin, or tricalcium phosphate [29-31]. More recently, biomaterial studies have been conducted evaluating hydrogels which further the release time up to 28 days while also significantly decreasing the dose of BMP implanted at the graft site [32]. This improves therapeutic outcomes by decreasing the osteoblastic toxicity present at high doses and helps significantly prolong the therapy time as the half-life of BMP2 is merely 7 min without a carrier [33, 34]. Decreasing the acute dose of BMP may reduce side effects such as severe swelling, hematomas, and also an increased risk of cancers such as osteosarcoma [35, 36].

According to the Infuse (a commercial form of BMP-2) manufacturer recommendations, BMP is directly contraindicated in patients with active malignancy, existing tumors, active infection, pregnancy, or a known history of allergy to bovine collagen or recombinant BMP-2 [37]. In addition, areas with poor study include skeletally immature patients, mandibular molar sites, or patients with previous BMP2 use. In spite of the risk factors, the protein has been extensively researched in both human and animal models for the assessment of its safety and efficacy [38-45].

For smaller intraoral techniques, BMP has been used for augmentation of the alveolar bone in order to accommodate implants. Using the collagen-soaked membrane, sinus lifts have been successfully performed with excellent results even extending to 15 years after placement and function [46-48]. BMP-2 has also been used successfully in horizontal and vertical ridge augmentation, getting results up to  $6\mathrm{mm}$  in height increase [49-51]. In fact, the data suggests that the notoriously difficult vertical ridge augmentations actually do better with BMP than do sinus lifts [52]. The applications of BMP have continued to be explored. Alveolar clefts have been treated successfully with the application of a BMP infused collagen sponge [53]. The studies have progressed to also include defects in the mandible in both animals [54] and humans [55, 56]. Currently, these authors prefer the combined approach of autograft combined with BMP for large defects of the mandible.

# 43.9 Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)

Platelet-rich plasma is a blood product originally described in the 1970s originally used to treat patients with thrombocytopenia. Through further research many more clinical applications have been found ranging from wound healing to the treatment of androgenic alopecia. By definition, PRP contains greater than  $1 \times 10^{6}$  platelets/  $\mu$ l. In practice, PRP is applied to the area of interest in order to gain the benefit of increased concentration of platelet derived growth factors [57]. Once the PRP is appropriately processed, growth factors are released from the alpha granules that include: platelet-derived growth factors, TGF-B, platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived angiogenesis factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, platelet factor-4, vascular endothelial GF, fibroblast GF (FGF), epidermal GF, matrix metalloproteinases 2, 9, and interleukin 8 [58, 59]. Release of these factors begins within 10 min following activation with approximately  $95\%$  released within 1 h [60].

Given that PRP is autologous, risk of rejection or systemic disease transmission should be minimal to nonexistent. There is concern over antigenicity from use of bovine thrombin. However, use of recombinant thrombin has reduced the risk of antigen-mediated rejection to nearly nil while improving the rate of action [61].

Techniques for preparation of PRP can be extremely variable based on the amount of the product that is desired, ranging from cell separators used in blood banks and hospitals which can process units of blood at a time to smaller centrifuges used for office based procedures. For our purposes, we will discuss the smaller devices. These are able to provide a more concentrated product in less time at a cost of producing less volume [62]. There are currently multiple devices on the market that allow multiple settings and speeds unique to this application. After venipuncture, the blood is drawn into a tube containing either citrate phosphate dextrose or anticoagulant citrate dextrose-A to prevent coagulation [60]. Techniques for processing PRP include the traditional PRP method as well as the "Buffy coat" method with the key difference being in the speed of the centrifugation [63]. This will typically take between 15 and  $20\mathrm{min}$  and yield approximately  $1.4 - 1.8\times 10^{6}$  platelets/  $\mu l$ . Following preparation, the PRP is then suspended using the platelets and native proteins of the coagulation cascade by introducing thrombin and  $10\%$  calcium chloride. It is worth noting that some studies propose that due to manipulation, pressure, or temperature changes during handling of the platelets they have

already been activated and therefore the thrombin and calcium are unnecessary [58]. This is then applied to grafts and sets in a gel-like fashion, or can be applied mixed with particulate bone grafts. However, there is a dearth of evidence that the addition of PRP provides better outcomes of graft success. In fact, some studies have shown that the initially promising in vitro results of osteoblast proliferation did not have clinical correlates in vivo [64-66]. It does, however, show increases in vascular growth, impacting the outcomes of both the soft and hard tissue healing [67].

A more recent development in the field of head and neck reconstruction is the advent of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). PRF is a substance related very closely to PRP with the advantage of less blood required and decreased cost [68]. Additionally, the creation of PRF does not require the use of pro-coagulative agents in order to initiate polymerization. Most protocols also require only a single  $10\mathrm{min}$  cycle of centrifugation. The speed of the growth factor release is also prolonged allowing for a sustained host response to the area [69]. This product can then be used with relative ease as either an additive to particulate bone or as a membrane once the fibrin clot has been further manipulated. This product does have more literature suggesting improved hard and soft tissue outcomes [70, 71], but more data needs to be collected for continued verification of the technique. Studies using sinus lifts should be closely evaluated as even injection of venous blood as a space maintainer has been shown to be effective in some case series [72-74].

# 43.10Bone Marrow Aspirate

Another therapeutic option for reconstruction is bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC). Though originally described as an orthopedic procedure, the biology and principles remain the same [75]. Frequently, BMAC is mixed with allograft for the osteoconductive properties of the allograft. Relative to other methods of autograft, BMAC has relatively low morbidity [76]. Additionally, the contraindications are relatively few and include hematologic malignancies like leukemia or myelodysplasia or severe osteoporosis as this may result in unintended perforation of the opposite cortex. The appeal of BMAC lies in the introduction of both mesenchymal stem cells as well as other osteoprogenitor cells. As these mature in the recipient bed there is increased rate of bone remodeling as well as improved results compared to allograft alone and in some cases superior to autograft [77, 78].

For the maxillary and mandibular reconstruction, several different applications have been suggested, ranging from sinus lifts and mandibular reconstruction for implants to segmental reconstruction following resection of benign lesions [79-82].

The oral surgeon will typically harvest BMAC from anterior iliac crest as there is room for a two-team approach. Other sites include the posterior iliac crest, calcaneus, distal and proximal tibia, and humerus. In order to approach the anterior iliac crest, the area is prepped and local anesthesia is applied similarly to an anterior iliac crest graft harvest. Following this, the anterior iliac crest is identified and isolated with one hand while a stab incision is made through skin using either an 11 or 15 blade. Once incision is made, the trocar is introduced and the cortex of the ilium is penetrated. The ideal entry point is made  $4 - 5\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine in order to avoid the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Once through the cortex, the trocar is advanced in a twisting motion being careful to not advance further than  $5\mathrm{cm}$  due to the fusion of the cortical plates in this region. Once the cannula and trocar are in place the trocar is removed and a syringe prepped with anticoagulant (heparin or ACD-A) is used to aspirate the marrow. The maximum volume of BMAC one can obtain from this site is approximately  $50 - 60\mathrm{ml}$ .

# 43.11Autogenous Sites

Autogenous bone grafting remains the gold standard for reconstruction of bony defects. We will discuss several types of graft in the upcoming sections (Table 43.1).

# 43.12Intraoral

Autografts obtained without a second surgical site appeal to the surgeon as they decrease additional morbidity and reduce operating time. However, the bones of the facial skeleton are limited by size, quality, and amount of cancellous bone. Intraorally, the common graft harvest sites are the ramus and symphysis, though one can harvest from the inferior border, ramus, or zygoma [83-86]. Though they can be considered, the less common graft sites pose significant possible complications such as ocular involvement, TMJ involvement, and potential for significant bleeding. For all intraoral grafts, donor site preparation is tantamount to success. In order to adequately prepare the site, the approach must be performed such that the incisions do not lie directly over the recipient bed. After the site is fully exposed, periosteal releasing incisions can be made in

order to allow for passive closure of the buccal aspect of the flap. In the posterior mandible, the lingual flap can be released by stripping the mylohyoid. This can add up to  $8\mathrm{mm}$  of additional flap laxity. Once the soft tissue has been treated, the bony site can be addressed. This is done by corticotomies throughout the area of interest. These authors endorse vertical corticotomies as well as an inferior ledge in order to provide additional resistance to movement. For all types of intraoral grafts it is extremely important to remove all sharp areas of bone to prevent dehiscence, and a minimum of two point screw fixation is necessary to resist rotational forces. These authors use a lag screw technique to prevent binding of the screw in the graft and possible fracture of the graft cortex.

Ramus graft harvests can be performed in a number of ways. For example, in the case of the edentulous patient, a crestal incision with an extension up the ascending ramus can be made. Incisions made on patients with restored teeth including crowns and implants can be made below the mucogingival junction with extension to the ascending ramus. Healthy, nonrestored teeth can have a sulcular incision with a lengthened hockey stick incision made for adequate access. Once the initial incision is performed, full-thickness dissection is performed to expose the lateral mandible. A block of cortical bone  $4\mathrm{mm}$  thick,  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in height and  $3.5\mathrm{cm}$  in length can be harvested from this region. The first osteotomy is made  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the external oblique ridge. The vertical osteotomy locations will be determined by the recipient bed size. Finally, an inferior border cut is made connecting the inferior aspects of the vertical osteotomies. All osteotomies are made monocortically in order to prevent damage to the inferior

alveolar nerve. Once these have been completed, the graft is delivered using osteotomes. Possible complications in this area include paresthesias of the associated branches of the trigeminal nerve, mandible fracture, bleeding, and site infection [87].

The symphysis graft is primarily a cortical graft but does have a minute amount of cancellous bone in close proximity and can be approached by either a vestibular or sulcular incision. The sulcular incision is not chosen if there is a thin, scalloped gingival biotype or associated implant or prosthetic restoration of the area [88]. The sulcular incision has the advantage of superior visualization of the mental neurovascular bundles as well as ease of retraction and to avoid transection of the mentalis. Once the incision is made, full-thickness reflection of both periosteum and mentalis is performed and the symphysis is exposed. The osteotomies are then made  $5\mathrm{mm}$  below the apicies of the anterior teeth and anterior to the mental foramen and  $4\mathrm{mm}$  above the inferior border of the mandible sparing the midline of the symphysis to avoid issues with contour. The osteotomies are again performed in a monocortical fashion and the graft is delivered with osteotomes or bone spreaders. Again, the size of the graft is determined by the recipient site, though the practitioner should plan harvest a slightly larger graft to account for secondary contouring of the graft. The maximum size which can be harvested is  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  in height by  $4\mathrm{cm}$  in length with a thickness of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  [89]. Meticulous hemostasis is then achieved and the donor site can be filled with allograft to prevent an iatrogenic defect. The area is then closed using horizontal mattress sutures and, much like a genioplasty, a pressure dressing is applied to the chin for 5 days postoperatively. The associated complications include

chin ptosis, paresthesias of the mental nerve, devitalization of the anterior mandibular teeth, and infection [90].

# 43.13Cranial

The cranium as a harvest site for facial reconstruction has been used since originally described by Tessier [91]. The technique was later refined by Jackson, and is known for its good stock of cortical bone with limited amounts of cancellous bone [92]. Knowing this, the cranium can prove to be an ideal site for the nasal bridge, orbital floor, or struts within the maxilla or mandible. The cranium usually develops a diploic space at 3 years of age and, for those in which it is present, accounts for less than  $50\%$  of the thickness of the adult bone [93]. The graft can be harvested as either inner table or outer table, or even using the inner table to reconstruct the outer table post-harvest. In order to minimize complications it is recommended to harvest areas with a minimum width of  $6\mathrm{mm}$ . Koenig et al. went so far as to recommend not harvesting grafts on patients less than 9 years old [94]. The patient's nondominant hemisphere should be selected for grafting. Due to the flatter morphology, the parietal bone is the ideal site to harvest from. The middle and posterior thirds of the parietal bone offer the largest amount of diploic space [95]. Contraindications of the procedure include a history of trauma, radiation or infection, presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, or metabolic bone diseases such as Paget's disease or multiple myeloma.

Depending on the size of the graft required, either a coronal or sagittal incision can be made. For maximum access, dissection in a subgaleal plane is performed followed by incision into and dissection of the pericranium (Fig. 43.3). The harvest site is then marked out to fit the recipient bed ensuring that the osteotomies are  $2\mathrm{cm}$  from the sagittal suture to avoid the sagittal sinus and arachnoid granulations. The surgeon should ideally avoid all suture lines. Once the area has been marked, osteotomies can be made with a surgical bur through the outer table (Fig. 43.4). For smaller grafts, one side should be beveled in order to allow for the introduction of a curved osteotome. For larger grafts, two or more sides should be beveled. In this way, a curved osteotome can be taken through the diploic space and avoid perforating the inner cortex. Larger areas can also be harvested in strips to allow for easier harvest (Fig. 43.5). Once the harvest is completed, hemostasis is achieved and periosteal and galeal layers are reapproximated, followed by closure of skin with whichever method the surgeon chooses.

If the internal table is harvested a formal craniotomy is performed and all bone is handled and shaped ex vivo.

The inner table is harvested and the outer table can be fixated after the dura has been thoroughly examined and any tears repaired.

# 43.14Costochondral Graft

The costochondral graft has proven to be a workhorse in the reconstruction of the ramus/condyle unit. Originally described by Gilles in 1920, the graft was then popularized by Poswillo [96, 97]. The graft itself is comprised of a thin, flexible stock of bone with a cartilaginous cap. In the pediatric patient this offers a growth center that can develop with the patient. However, this growth is unpredictable and may result in significant overgrowth or undergrowth [98, 99]. In order to limit this, Kaban et al. recommended limiting the cartilaginous cap to  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$ . This becomes difficult in the pediatric patient due to the fragility of the bone-cartilage interface, and as such a minimum of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of cartilage is recommended. Additionally, maintaining the periosteum/perichondrium at this junction will assist in stability of the cartilaginous component. In order to account for flare of the ramus, harvest of the contralateral side is usually indicated. However, many surgeons harvest from the right side to avoid harvest over the heart. Beyond reconstruction of the ramus/condyle unit, the cartilage itself can be used as a harvest site for both nasal and auricular reconstructions, and the bony portion can be used as a cortical strut to assist in cancellous reconstruction in the maxilla and mandible. Contraindications to the procedure include previous trauma or radiation as well as a history of restrictive lung disease.

In order to approach the graft an incision is designed in the inframammary crease which provides access to the fifth - seventh ribs (Fig. 43.6). Once the subcutaneous fat has been bluntly dissected from the field, the junction of the pectoralis and rectus abdominus can be

![](images/fd5d0136c9daedcd8afdef2f09287e02625a997e87485cc7de6c96422d5e823a.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 43.6 Marking of costochondral graft. Incisions are marked in the inframammary crease for improved cosmetics upon closure

visualized. Dissection is performed in the plane laterally to the midaxillary line. Further dissection is limited by curvature of the rib and the latissimus dorsi. The sixth rib is usually the inferior point of insertion of the pectoralis and selection of this rib results in the least amount of muscular stripping. Should there be a bilateral mandibular defect and more than one rib is necessary the surgeon must not harvest adjacent ribs. Once the desired rib has been identified the muscular layer can be incised and the rib grasped between the fingers of the nondominant hand in order to prevent puncture into the pleural space. The periosteum is then incised in a longitudinal fashion and is then elevated circumferentially (Fig. 43.7). Closure of this layer post operatively can result in osseous regeneration of the rib [100]. Good subperiosteal dissection will also serve to protect the neurovascular bundles at the inferior and deep portions of the rib. The Doyen retractor can be drawn from a lateral to medial direction to assist in this deep dissection. Once performed, the cartilage can be incised using a 15 blade, the rib can be retracted laterally and the remaining periosteum can be easily visualized and separated from the rib (Figs. 43.8, 43.9, 43.10, and 43.11). The lateral osteotomy can then be made using either a protected rib cutter or reciprocating saw. The wound bed is then examined to ensure no pleural tears, and all sharp osseous contours are rounded. To assist in the examination for tears, saline is pooled in the wound bed and the anesthesiologist will apply a Valsalva maneuver. If there is a tear, primary repair is attempted. Larger tears can be repaired by introducing a red rubber catheter with suction into the pleural space and suturing in either a horizontal mattress or purse-string fashion. As the drain is removed, the suture is tightened to maintain negative pressure. Closure is performed in layers starting with closure of the periosteum, followed by the fascia and muscular layers. The subdermal closure is performed and a cosmetic closure can be performed in the inframammary crease.

Postoperatively, it is critical to obtain a chest x-ray to evaluate for pneumothorax. If a small pneumothorax is visualized,  $100\%$  O2 can be administered to assist in resolution. Though they may improve on their own via communication of the alveoli and pleural space, studies have shown significantly quicker rates of resolution if the patient inhales humidified  $\mathrm{O}_2$  [101]. Larger pneumothoracies must be addressed with a chest tube.

# 43.15Iliac Crest

The Iliac crest is an extremely versatile graft for maxillary and mandibular reconstruction. The area provides a significant amount of both cortical and cancellous bone and can be used as either a cortical, cancellous, or corticocancellous block for reconstruction. Both anterior and posterior ilium can be used as donor sites and will be discussed separately.

# 43.15.1 Anterior Iliac Crest

Though originally described for use during World War 1, use of the Anterior Iliac Crest Graft (AICG) in facial reconstruction was adopted after a series of mandibular bone grafts was performed by Chubb in 1920 [102]. From this site, up to  $50~\mathrm{cc}$  of noncompressed bone can be harvested. The area was previously considered the gold standard for bone grafting prior to the advent of free tissue transfer and remains extremely popular due to the ease of harvest and ability to utilize a two-team approach. Indications for the AICG include mandibular defects less than  $5\mathrm{cm}$ , interpositional grafting in orthognathics, reconstruction following removal of benign neoplasms, and reconstruction of atrophic jaws prior to implant therapy. Contraindications for the procedure include patients with ipsilateral hernia repairs due to weakening of the abdominal wall, ipsilateral total joint replacement, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, previous

trauma or infection, or chronic steroid use [103]. Complications of the procedure include gait disturbance, fracture of the anterior iliac spine, postoperative ileus, hematoma, seroma, and postoperative paresthesias [104-107]. Most commonly, the iliohypogatric nerve is affected as it runs above the iliac tubercle.

In preparation for harvest of the AICG, a hip roll is placed under the side of harvest in order to elevate the hip anteriorly and allow medial reflection of the abdominal pannus for patients with a larger body habitus. Once the patient is positioned, the anatomic landmarks of the anterior superior iliac spine and iliac tubercle are palpated and the skin is retracted medially and superiorly (Fig. 43.12). This will allow for a more laterally placed incision, decreasing the possibility for irritation at the belt line. An incision of up to  $6\mathrm{cm}$  is then marked ensuring that the incision remains  $2\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine. The incision is taken down to the subcutaneous fat and further dissection can be performed with electrocautery to the Scarpa's fascia. Once through these layers, the external oblique muscles can be identified medially and tensor fascia lata laterally. Incision can be made along the iliac crest at this point through the periosteum. Dissection can be performed either laterally or medially depending on the size or type of graft required. For the medial approach, subperiosteal dissection is performed elevating the iliacus and the iliac crest and can be safely performed to a depth of  $7\mathrm{cm}$ . However, minimal soft tissue dissection is associated with improved postoperative pain, decreased risk of traction injury as well as decreased risk of postoperative ileus [108]. Once the medial aspect of the ilium is exposed, osteotomies can be performed using a reciprocating saw making sure to remain at least  $2\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine in order to minimize risk of spinous process fracture. A posterior osteotomy

Fig. 43.12 Marking of the AICG. Note the anterior marking of the iliac spine and the posterior marking of the iliac tubercle

is made a maximum of  $5\mathrm{cm}$  posteriorly and an inferior osteotomy is made limited by the fusion of the medial and lateral cortical plates (Fig. 43.13). A  $5\mathrm{cm} \times 5\mathrm{cm}$  block can be harvested from this site (Fig. 43.14). Once the osteotomies are made, osteotomes can be used to gently deliver the block of bone, and additional cancellous bone can be harvested using either bone gouges or curettes. The medial approach is typically favored as there is minimal disruption of the tensor fascia lata and therefore the least risk of gait disturbances. Even with this method, there have been reports of long-term gait disturbances up to  $13\%$  [109]. A lateral approach or full-thickness harvest can also be utilized, though this can lead to palpable defects of the ilium. Once the graft has been harvested, it can be stored in normal saline. Hemostasis can be achieved by burnishing the harvest

![](images/f7043737465605603d51ecdf385d78b6e30a46ea8637a295e2a665fa53b94ea6.jpg)

site, or applying local hemostatic agents like fibrillar collagen. Drains are not required but can be utilized in this location. If a negative pressure drain is placed it should not be placed below the periosteum. Layered closure is performed along the periosteum, muscular, subcutaneous, and cutaneous layers. A compression dressing made of gauze and foam tape can be used to prevent postoperative seroma formation. The graft itself is fixated either directly to a reconstruction plate or to the adjacent bone as an onlay graft (Figs. 43.15 and 43.16).

The approach remains the same for the pediatric patient. However, there is a cartilaginous cap that serves as a point for future ossification. This can be incised with a 10 blade and cancellous bone can be easily accessed using bone curettes. Closure of the cap is performed with strong resorbable suture such as 2-0 vicryl.

# 43.15.2Posterior Iliac Crest

The posterior iliac crest graft (PICG) is another excellent option for the harvest of large volumes of cortical and cancellous bone. The surgeon may obtain a  $5\mathrm{cm}\times 5\mathrm{cm}$  block of corticocancellous bone from this area and up to  $100~\mathrm{cc}$  of noncompressed cancellous bone, enough to potentially reconstruct a  $10\mathrm{cm}$  defect [110]. The procedure itself has few contraindications apart from the similar systemic contraindications present with all distant nonvascularized graft harvest sites. However, a major consideration is the patient positioning for the procedure as this graft is harvested in a prone position. This can add a significant time to surgery which inherently carries its own potential risks including displacing the endotracheal tube or pressure injuries to the eyes, nose, or genitals. The procedure has a similar complication profile to the AICG approach, but offers few reported hematomas, less postoperative pain and minimal gait disturbance [105, 111]. Another consideration

is limiting activities such as stair climbing and bicycling to allow for reattachment of the gluteus maximus following surgery.

Like any procedure, the practitioner must be well versed in the local anatomy. At the posterosuperior iliac crest is the attachment of the gluteus maximus. Inferior to this is the insertion of the gluteus medius and superimmediately to this is the attachment of the thoracolumbar fascia of the latissimus dorsi. Superolaterally located, over the lateral aspect of the iliac crest, is the superior cluneal nerve which arises from the dorsal rami of L1, L2, and L3. This innervates the posteromedial buttocks. Inferiomedially located is the middle cluneal nerve which arises from the dorsal rami of S1, S2, and S3. This innervates the medial buttocks. The gluteus maximus and surgical site are between these two areas. Should either be violated, the patient will only experience cutaneous paresthesia. The sciatic notch is of most significance in this area but it is  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the dissection area and should not be encountered (Fig. 43.17).

Fig.43.17 Preoperative marking of the PICG

The patient is prepared by placing them prone in a jackknife position, approximately 120-degree flexion. This is done to allow the adipose tissue to fall passively away from the harvest sites. Once this is done, the area is appropriately prepped and the posterosuperior iliac spine is palpated and marked along with the spinous processes of the vertebra. One may consider placement of an antimicrobial adhesive dressing such as Ioban to isolate the area from the glueal cleft. Once marking has been performed, a  $5 - 6\mathrm{cm}$  incision can be made along the posterosuperior iliac crest. Dissection is continued through the subcutaneous fatty layer and the thoracolumbar fascia. The fascia is incised and subperiosteal dissection is performed with a Cobb elevator. Incision along the crest can help prevent violation of the gluteal muscles. During dissection it is important to remain  $1\mathrm{cm}$  away from the posterosuperior iliac spine to avoid disruption of the sacroiliac ligament. Once an adequate sized site is exposed the graft can be harvested by a similar technique to the AICG using reciprocating and oscillating saws along with osteotomes (Fig. 43.18). Additional cancellous bone can be harvested using curettes and in doing so can assist in tamponade of the interosseous vasculature (Fig. 43.19). To assist in hemostasis, microfibrillar collagen can be placed and compressed in the osseous bed. Once hemostasis is verified, closure is performed in layers of the periosteum/ thoracolumbar fascia, subcutaneous layers and skin. A suction drain may be placed after closure of periosteum depending on the extent of hemostasis. Similar to the anterior approach, a compression dressing can be used to minimize postoperative seroma/hematoma formation. The graft itself is largely used in large defects of the mandible, and in doing so is often performed jointly with the use of BMP (Figs. 43.20 and 43.21).

For both the anterior and posterior approaches, if immediate gait disturbances are noted, a physical ther

apy consult is warranted to minimize fall risk upon discharge. Physical therapy is not routinely consulted but should be considered for any patient with any previous gait instability or mobility issues.

# 43.16Tibial Plateau

The metaphysis of the tibia is another often used graft site that gained popularity through the orthopedic literature by O'Keefe et al. [112]. This area provides a large volume of cancellous bone typically reported between  $25\mathrm{ml}$  and  $40\mathrm{ml}$  of uncompressed bone [113]. The area can be used for any maxillofacial application for cancellous bone and has been used very successfully for sinus lifting and maxillary augmentation prior to implant therapy [114]. Though relatively few long term complications arise from this area, the procedure is not typically used in growing patients due to the presence of a growth plate. That said, the area has been used successfully in children in order to obtain volume to reconstruct alveolar clefts [115, 116]. Again, there are relatively few contraindications besides the aforementioned systemic factors, but previous orthopedic trauma/procedures in this area limit its use. The surgeon must also consider the patient's profession and hobbies as extremely physically active patients such as runners or weight lifters who provide frequent extreme load to this area may not serve as ideal candidates.

There are both lateral and medial approaches to the tibial plateau, both of which will be discussed. For the lateral approach, after appropriately preparing the site, Gerdy's tubercle is palpated and marked along with the patella, fibula, and tibial plateau (Fig. 43.22). Tourniquets are routinely used in fracture repair of this area and may assist in limiting blood loss but are not

![](images/0f0d1197fd189608c64895bc5f5bc3a064477391ac405e0c2f16432b1e540f86.jpg)

required. If one is placed it must not remain more than  $2\mathrm{h}$ . After infiltration of local anesthesia a  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  longitudinal incision is made over Gerdy's tubercle and subcutaneous fat is swept aside to show the iliotibial tract. In order to limit postoperative pain or discomfort incision is made parallel to the fibers of this tract. Subperiosteal dissection is performed and the tibia is visualized (Fig. 43.23). An osteotomy is made through the cortex using a surgical bur, trephine or osteotome and mallet, though this may cause the most trauma. This small area of cortex may be used as an onlay graft or morsellized in conjunction with the cancellous bone. Once the medullary space is encountered graft may be harvested using curettes (Fig. 43.24). Of note, the surgeon should harvest medially and distally rather than superiorly to avoid undermining of the tibial plateau or violation of the joint itself.

The medial approach has the advantage of avoiding the iliotibial tract at a cost of slightly more difficult access due to patient positioning. The patella and tibial plateau are palpated and marked. Following this, a vertical line through the patella and tibial tuberosity is marked followed by a line perpendicular to this through the tibial tuberosity. Once completed, an oblique skin incision can be made centered at a point  $15\mathrm{mm}$  superior

Fig. 43.24 Tibial graft post-harvest. Note considerable amount of cancellous graft

and medial to the intersection of these lines [113]. As with the lateral approach, there are no vital structures present between skin and bone. The dissection is performed, a bony window is removed in a similar fashion and the bone is harvested. A similar amount of bone can be harvested from this approach. One key potential disadvantage is wound breakdown and infection due to lack of the iliotibial tract for layered closure [117, 118].

For either approach, replacement of the dead space is not necessary or replacement of the cortical window. For closure of the lateral approach, it is key to have excellent approximation of the iliotibial tract prior to closure of dermal and cutaneous layers. The medial approach, as mentioned previously, does not have this consideration.

The patient should be prevented from participating in intense physical exercise for 6 weeks and any prolonged severe pain in the area should immediately raise suspicion of a tibial plateau fracture for which an orthopedic consult should be obtained. Again, physical therapy can be consulted for patients with a history of gait abnormality and the patient should be on a weight bearing as tolerated restriction. Again, due to the corticocancellous nature of the graft and large volume, it can be used effectively for both maxillary and mandibular reconstruction (Figs. 43.25 and 43.26).

# 43.17Hyperbaric Oxygen

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been a treatment option for patients with chronic, nonhealing wounds for years. The technology itself is centuries old and was used originally as compressed air therapy without much understanding of the mechanism of action [119]. After manipulation of different devices and gasses it was used in 1917 for treatment of decompression sickness by the

German inventors Bernhard and Heinrich Drager [120]. It was elevated to the status of a cure-all and continued to be used even in spa settings. This reached a peak in the 1920s when Dr. Orville J. Cunningham began creating HBO centers throughout the country, the largest of which was in Cleveland, OH [121]. This center was five stories tall with 12 rooms per floor replete with a smoker's lounge and reached pressures of 3 atm. Though he treated a litany of diseases from diabetes to cancer, Cunningham was unable to prove the existence of an anaerobic organism which he theorized was the cause of all of these and was subsequently shut down by the American Medical Association. The center was dismantled in 1937.

The use of HBO in the maxillofacial skeleton was popularized after the work of Marx in 1983 suggesting

that osteoradionecrosis was a result of tissue hypoxia, hypocellularity, and hypovascularity [122]. However, this theory has been replaced by the fibroatrophic theory, the discussion of which is outside the scope of this chapter. Currently, a treatment consists of breathing  $100\% \mathrm{O}_2$  in a chamber pressurized to 2.4 atm for  $90\mathrm{min}$ . Although a number of different protocols exist, the common regimen for osteoradionecrosis treatment is 20 dives preoperatively and 10-20 dives postoperatively. During one of these dives, the PaO2 can exceed  $2000\mathrm{mmHg}$  and tissue oxygen tension can approach  $400\mathrm{mmHg}$  [123]. Such dramatic changes in the local environment can stimulate collagen formation and fibroblast proliferation [124]. Both collagen and fibroblasts require oxygen tensions above  $40\mathrm{mmHg}$  in order to appropriately stimulate production and activity [125].

Though, at the surface, it does appear fairly straightforward that use of this modality would be a useful and obvious choice in following surgery where there is questionable recovery, there have been multiple studies which question the validity of HBO. In fact, a 2004 study by Annane et al. showed no improvement of the patients in either pain control or amount of exposed bone and the treatment arm was shut down by the safety monitoring board [126]. Additionally, a 2010 meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference between those patients who have and have not received adjunctive HBO to prevent osteoradionecrosis [127]. The cost of therapy is an often overlooked hurdle for the patient. Uninsured patients may be shown a price range of  $100-$ 1000 per treatment, not including travel and time off work [128].

Complications of HBO therapy include pneumothorax and otitis related to barotrauma, reversible myopia related to conformational changes of the lens, seizures, and less-severe issues such as claustrophobia, ear pain, or sinus pain. Case reports of rapid tumor progression after hyperbaric oxygen therapy are in the literature but there has yet to be a clear link established [129].

# Conclusion

- Reconstruction of Mandible

Mandibular reconstruction can be performed at multiple different times during treatment. It can be performed as an immediate reconstruction, delayed as to ensure no recurrence or to allow an adequate soft tissue bed to form, or as part of the treatment for patients with developmental atrophy or agenesis. Prior to any surgery, during the planning phase, the planned or present defect is measured and the appropriate donor site is identified for harvest. The assessment and planning can be determined from the techniques mentioned previously in this chapter. A common rule of thumb in

the reconstructive literature has been to trend toward vascularized bone grafts such as the free fibular flap for defects over  $6\mathrm{cm}$ , originating in 1983 in a paper by Weiland et al. [130]. These claims were further bolstered in the decades to come by the often referenced works of Pogrel and Foster, though Pogrel originally used  $9\mathrm{cm}$  as his results comparison [4, 131]. This school of thought is being challenged, however, with works of surgeons such as Akinbami et al. and Nandra et al. who, through literature review and retrospective study, have found grafts over  $6\mathrm{cm}$  to be highly successful [132, 133].

After the grafting technique and site of harvest has been determined the soft tissue must again be reassessed. Should there be a paucity of tissue available to act as a nutrient bed for the graft, the choices significantly narrow and sometimes direct the surgeon to the vascularized reconstruction. It is also possible to augment the tissue bed by use of locoregional flaps, distant pedicled flaps or a free flap. The surgeon may also choose to use space maintainers for delayed reconstruction in order to prevent contraction of the wound bed during the healing phase. A study by Ferretti et al. performed delayed reconstruction and had minimal postoperative complications when reconstructing benign or traumatic defects of the mandible [134]. However, this can cause thinning of the mucosal surfaces and risk intraoral dehiscence. Distraction osteogenesis can be considered as well but the patient must be carefully selected as they are subject to strict routine maintenance of their hardware and hygiene.

- Reconstruction of Maxilla

Reconstruction of the maxilla, much like the mandible, is dependent on the goals of therapy. As mentioned previously, due to the limited amount of soft tissue present in the maxilla, a composite vascularized flap is often necessary for reconstruction. For patients who are averse to more surgery, a tooth-borne or implant-borne obturator can offer acceptable function and cosmetics.
