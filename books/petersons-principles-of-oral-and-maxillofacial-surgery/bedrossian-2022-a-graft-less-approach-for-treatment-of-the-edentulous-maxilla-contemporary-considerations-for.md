# Learning Aims

I. Understanding of the biomechanical principles for establishing posterior maxillary support using the zygoma implant is imperative.  
II. Surgical treatment planning of the edentulous maxillae for zygoma implant using the "zones" of the maxilla as well as the ZAGA classification allows the implant team to understand the position of the residual boney volume.  
III. Appreciation of the prosthetic needs for reestablishing the proper vertical dimension of occlusion and the proper teeth position for esthetic facial drape as well as proper speech by the patient is imperative.

# 13.1 Introduction

After loss of teeth, the maxilla alveolar bone begins to resorb due to the lack of internal loading which was possible prior to the removal of the teeth by the transfer of occlusal forces through the teeth. To halt the resorption pattern of the maxillary alveolar ridge, placement of implants to re-introduce internal loading of the alveolar bone by a fixed, implant-supported maxillary prosthesis is possible. In order to achieve this goal, distribution of implants along the arch length is required.

The edentulous maxilla presents with unique anatomic make-up which limits the placement of axial implants in the posterior maxillae to allow posterior support for a full arch fixed prosthesis. With the superior, palatal, and posterior resorption pattern of the edentulous maxilla, the nasal floor in the premaxillary region and the maxillary sinuses posteriorly often limit the available boney volume for the placement of axial implants to support a fixed cross-arch splinted prosthesis. In the resorbed maxillae, not only the placement of implants is difficult, but the ability to reconstruct the missing hard and soft tissues by the final prosthesis also presents a clinical challenge and is confusing for the implant team.

To allow the fabrication of a fixed, implant-supported prosthesis, various grafting protocols with either immediate or delayed implant placement have been reported in the literature. P-I Branemark and others have described various grafting procedures to reconstruct the boney volume in the edentulous maxilla [1-5] re-establishing the missing hard and soft tissues. To place implants for posterior support in the maxillae, in 1996, the "Sinus Lift Consensus Conference" reported a survival of implants with sinus lift procedures as having a  $90\%$  success rate [6]. Grafting of the maxillae

with delayed implant placement and delayed loading as reported by Keller and Tolman had  $87 - 95\%$  implant and prosthetic success rate, respectively [7, 8]. Other grafting procedures including the use of autogenous onlay grafts at times in combination with Le Fort I procedures have also been reported by Rasmusson [9]. Their study described grafting with delayed implant placement as well as grafting with simultaneous implant placement with a success rate of  $80\%$  and  $77\%$ , respectively. Others have also reported on various grafting techniques to create posterior maxillary boney volume for the placement of implants and the reconstruction of patients with severe maxillary atrophy or large pneumatized maxillary sinuses [2-5]. However, extended treatment time and the morbidity associated with the various stages of the treatment generally limit the number of patients who accept treatment. Patients' reluctance to embrace these grafting procedures is also due to their inability to wear a functional provisional during the healing phase and the various steps involved in the reconstruction of the edentulous maxillae using grafting protocols.

To avoid grafting protocols, tilted implants in the bicuspid region of the posterior maxillae to avoid extensive bone grafting procedures have been described in the literature [10-12]. To allow tilting of implants in the posterior maxillae, the presence of adequate alveolar boney volume is necessary in the bicuspid region.

However, for patients who are lacking alveolar bone volume in the bicuspid and the molar regions, treatment options without bone grafting protocols were once again limited and not possible.

The zygoma implant was designed to establish posterior support in the resorbed maxillae when large pneumatized sinuses or significant resorption of the alveolar bone in the bicuspid and the molar regions was present. The platform of the zygoma implant engages the resorbed maxillary alveolar crest, and its apex engages a "remote" bone volume, the os zygomaticus. This implant allows for a unique method to stabilize a posterior maxillary implant in resorbed maxillae. The zygoma implant is considered for patients with edentulous maxillae in order to avoid bone grafting procedures.

# Key Points

I. The edentulous maxillae resorb superiorly, medially, and posteriorly.  
II. Maxillary sinuses and nasal passages limit the boney volume for the placement of axial implants.  
III. Remote boney volume allows for implant anchorage in the bicuspid-molar region of resorbed maxillae.

# 13.2 Patient Selection

In planning patients with the zygoma implant, a "Systematic Preoperative Evaluation Protocol" needs to be considered before the surgical treatment is initiated. As with all implant plantings, the treatment begins with the "end in mind" [13, 14]. The preoperative evaluation protocol presented takes into consideration the design of the final prosthesis as well as the available alveolar bone in the zones of the maxilla. The zygomatic implant is considered for patients who have bone only in the premaxilla as well as patients who are completely lacking alveolar bony volume.

The "Systematic Preoperative Evaluation Protocol" as described by Bedrossian et al. [15] begins with the clinician identifying whether the patient is missing only their clinical crowns, a "tooth-only defect" (Fig. 13.1), or missing clinical crowns as well as hard and soft tissues of the maxillary alveolar bone, a "composite defect" (Fig. 13.2). A patient with a "tooth-only" defect is reconstructed using a "white prosthesis" (Fig. 13.3). A patient with a "composite defect" is reconstructed with a hybrid prosthesis which replaces the missing clinical crowns as well as the missing soft and hard tissues by pink acrylic or pink porcelain (Fig. 13.4). A hybrid prosthesis may have an internal bar or can be fabricated without an internal bar: the zirconia hybrid prosthesis.

If a hybrid prosthesis is considered, esthetic and phonetics play a major role in a satisfactory final outcome. For an esthetic outcome of the final prosthesis, it is critical to determine the "transition line" preoperatively. The "transition line" is defined as the junction between the hybrid prosthesis and the soft tissues of the residual edentulous maxillary crestal soft tissues. For an esthetic outcome, in maximum animation, the transition line is evaluated. The transition line should always be

apical to the extreme "smile line." If the transition line is coronal to the exaugurated smile line (Fig. 13.5) although the prosthesis may be functional, the esthetics will not be acceptable by patients (Fig. 13.6). It is important for the restorative team, including the laboratory technician, to understand that proper phonetics, specially the palatal sounds, "Ts, Ds, and Ss," are a result of an intimate contact between the intaglio surface of the hybrid prosthesis and the premaxillary soft tissues [16, 17], (Fig. 13.7).

The preoperative evaluation protocol takes into consideration the design of the final prosthesis as well as the available alveolar bone in the different zones of the maxilla.

The four components of the "Systematic Preoperative Evaluation Protocol" include:

1. Determining the presence or the lack of a composite defect

![](images/e4cbac8ae5a705f021aa19a436632086c615e967d100df3e43b0f80a8ad7d96a.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 13.6 Exposed transition line; coronal to the smile line

2. Identifying the type of final prosthesis  
3. Determining the transition line  
4. Evaluating the zones of the maxilla

Determining the presence or the lack of a composite defect: The clinician identifies whether the patient is missing clinical crowns only, a "tooth-only defect," or the patient has a "composite defect." A "composite defect" is defined as a patient who is missing the clinical crowns as well as soft and hard tissue volumes.

Fig. 13.8 Zones of the maxilla; presence of bone only in the premaxilla

Identifying the type of final prosthesis: For the toothonly defect patient, a "white prosthesis" replacing the clinical crowns restores the patient's missing dentition. For patients with a composite defect, the hybrid prosthesis replaces the missing clinical crowns as well as the lost soft and hard tissues by the pink acrylic or pink porcelain. If a hybrid prosthesis is considered, it is critical to determine the transition line preoperatively for an esthetic outcome of the final prosthesis.

Determining the transition line: The "transition line" is defined as the junction between the hybrid prosthesis and the soft tissues of the residual edentulous crestal. In maximum animation, for an esthetic outcome, the transition line should always be apical to the extreme "smile line."

Evaluating the zones of the maxilla: The maxilla is divided into three zones: zone 1, the premaxilla; zone 2, the premolar region; and zone 3, the molar region (Fig. 13.8). The presence of bone in zone 1 in conjunction with the lack of bone is zones 2 and 3 lends to planning the placement of two to four axial implants in the premaxilla as well as a single zygoma implant in each posterior quadrant. In cases where zones 1, 2, and 3 are missing (Fig. 13.9), the placement of two zygoma implants in each zygoma bone allows for adequate support for a fixed prosthesis, the "quad-zygoma concept."

# 13.2.1 Screw Access Canals: The "Black and Red Dotted Lines"

The dental arch form is "static." The edentulous crestal arch form of the maxillae is "dynamic." In a nonresorbed maxilla, a black dotted line drawn over the edentulous crest maps the position of the implants which are placed in the middle of the alveolar crest along the arch length. In turn, for a screw-retained fixed prosthesis, the screw access holes are drawn by a red dot

ted line which crosses the cingulum in the anterior teeth and the central fossa of the posterior teeth.

In the non-resorbed edentulous maxillae, the black dotted line over the alveolar crest is superimposed by the red dotted lines of the teeth along the arch form. Therefore, the screw access canal of the prosthesis is located at the cingulum of the anterior teeth and the central fossa of the posterior teeth (Fig. 13.10a). However, in the resorbed maxillae, it is important for the implant team to appreciate that the black dotted line is medial to the red dotted line and the screw access holes are through the "pink portion" of the prosthesis (Fig. 13.10b). It is critical for the surgeons and the restorative clinicians to understand the relationship of the "black and red dotted lines." Recently, publications discuss modifications of the Branemark surgical protocol and claim a more "prosthetically driven" approach. Clinicians who understand the principles described in this section of this chapter should be able to discriminate the inaccurate claims of these publications.

# Key Points

I. Treatment planning begins with determining the type of final prosthesis needed.  
II. Identification of tooth-only or the presence of a composite defect is critical.  
III. The transition line must be apical to the extreme smile line.  
IV. For proper phonetics, the prosthesis must be in intimate contact with the premaxillary soft tissues.  
V. Surgical planning involves the identification of the available "zones" of the maxillae.  
VI. The prosthetic arch form is static, and the boney arch form is dynamic; it moves posteriorly in the anterior maxilla and medially in the posterior maxilla with advancement of alveolar resorption.

# 13.3 Radiographic Evaluation

# 13.3.1 Zones of the Maxilla

The panorex is critical in the initial evaluation of the patient [1, 9, 18, 19]. Further radiographic evaluation requires 3-D computerized tomography. The presence of alveolar bone in the premaxilla, zone 1, and the lack of bone in the bicuspid and the molar regions, zones 2 and 3, respectively, are the indications for considering the zygomatic concept [20].

As described by Nkenke et al. in 2003 [21], frontal and axial three-dimensional slices allow further evaluation of the maxillary sinus, the naso-ethmoidal complex, the bony osteo-meatal complex, as well as the contour of the lateral maxillary walls (Figs. 13.11 and 13.12). The width of the residual maxillary alveolar bone and

the width and height of the body of the zygoma bone can also be visualized in frontal reformatted sections.

The presence of sinus pathologic conditions, including, but not limited to, thickening of the Schneiderian membrane and air fluid levels, may also be ruled out (Fig. 13.13).

Using three-dimensional radiographic studies also allows for the evaluation of the contour of the lateral maxillary sinus walls using the ZAGA classification concept [20].

# 13.3.2 Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA)

The trajectory of an implant is described as the "beginning point" of the osteotomy, the implant platform, and the "end point" of the osteotomy, the position of the implant's apex. There is one trajectory to the final position of the zygoma implant placed for posterior maxillary support. If the contour of the lateral maxillary sinus wall is not significantly concave, the implant is "quad

cortically” stabilized between the alveolar crest and the zygoma bone (Fig. 13.14). To clarify and demystify the confusion as to the various techniques reported in the literature for the placement of the zygoma implants, it is critical for the clinician to understand why at times the mid-partion of the zygoma implant may be outside the maxillary sinus as well as why at times the implant platform may not have circumferential boney support.

To better understand the trajectory of the zygoma implant as it relates to:

(a) The lateral maxillary sinus wall contour  
(b) The residual maxillary alveolar crest

Aparicio in 2011 described the Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA) classification. In this anatomic description, the lateral maxillary sinus wall is described as "straight" or "concave." If the lateral maxillary sinus wall is straight or convex, the mid-partition of the zygoma implant will be inside the maxillary sinus, and bone surrounds the implant platform. However, if the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus is concave, a portion or the entire mid-partition of the zygoma implant may be "outside" the maxillary sinus. The classification described by Aparicio begins with ZAGA 0 (straight lateral maxillary wall with the mid-partition of the zygoma implant inside the sinus) to ZAGA 4, which is the most extreme resorption of the maxillary sinus with a significant concavity of the lateral maxillary sinus wall placing the mid-partition of the zygoma implant outside of the sinus in conjunction with no bone support at the implant platform due to severe medial resorption pattern of the maxillary alveolus (Fig. 13.15). This preoperative radiographic evaluation protocol is essential for understanding the position of the intended zygoma implant. The presence or the lack of bone support at the alveolar ridge as well as whether the implant will travel completely within the maxillary sinus or be partially or completely outside of the maxillary sinus is a result of the patient's anatomy and not because of a

"alternative technique" to the original Branemark technique. It is important to study the illustrations of the ZAGA classification. The clinician is encouraged to superimpose the ZAGA 0 to ZAGA 4 illustrations to better understand that the implant trajectory is the same and the only variables are the degree of the concavity of the lateral maxillary sinus wall and the extent of the maxillary alveolar resorption medially.

# Key Points

I. Panoramic evaluation to identify the available zones of the maxilla.  
II. Three-dimensional radiography to evaluate the maxillary sinus, the osteo-mental complex, and the zygoma bone.  
III. Understanding the trajectory of the zygoma implant.  
IV. Three-dimensional radiography to identify the ZAGA classification of the existing maxillary boney contours.

# 13.4 Preoperative Considerations

Patients planned for reconstruction with the zygoma concept are premedicated with  $2\mathrm{g}$  of amoxicillin or  $600\mathrm{mg}$  of clindamycin if they are penicillin allergic  $1\textrm{h}$  before the surgical procedure. The surgical procedure is usually performed in the office setting under IV sedation [15] with appropriate monitors for sedation. The proper administration of sufficient local anesthesia is critical in the management of these patients under IV sedation. The various infiltrations and nerve blocks include infiltration of the maxillary vestibule and infra-orbital and greater palatine blocks. Extraoral blocks are recommended by bilateral transcutaneous infiltration of the temporal areas over the zygomatic body. Bilateral inferior alveolar nerve blocks may not be intuitive but are considered to allow retraction of the lower jaw during the surgery without undue stimulation of the sedated

patient. The patient is draped per routine sterile protocol before the beginning of the surgical procedure.

# Key Points

I. Premedication of patients is recommended.  
II. Sterile surgical protocol should be observed.  
III. Inferior alveolar blocks allow for manipulation of the mandible as needed during the procedure without undo arousal of the patient under IV sedation.

# 13.5 Biomechanical Considerations

# 13.5.1 Primary Load-Bearing Bone Under Function

Zygoma implant surgery is an advanced procedure requiring extensive knowledge of the prosthetic as well as the surgical biomechanical principles. To understand the stresses applied to the zygoma implant under functional loads, review and the applications of the principles described in the contemporary literature are essential.

In 2007, Ujigawa and colleagues [22] in an elegant finite element analysis (FEA) described the weight-bearing bones associated with the use of the zygoma implant. They reported that the zygoma bone, and not the maxilla alveolus, was primarily responsible for the support of the simulated occlusal loads. However, in 2013 and 2015, Freedman et al. [23, 24] corrected the observation in the Ujigawa study. Freedman explained that the highlighted area over the lateral cortex of the zygoma bone which was reported as the load-bearing area in the Ujigawa study was in fact the origin of the masseter muscle which was highlighted under activation and therefore did not represent the primary load bearing of the zygoma bone when the zygoma implant is loaded by the attached fixed prosthesis. Freedman et al. reported that the maxillary crest plays a major role in the distribution of the occlusal loads and the preserva

Fig. 13.16 Significant increase in stress with the lack of boney support at the implant platform

tion and the anchoring of the implant platform in the maxillary crest (  $\bullet$  Fig. 13.16).

The distribution of functional loads transferred to the osseointegrated implant has been described in the literature. Under load, the crestal bone, the implant platform, and the first  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of the implant bear the majority of the forces (Fig. 13.17) as reported by Franck Renouard et al. [25]. This is also true for the load-bearing areas of the zygoma implants as fractures of the zygoma implants (Fig. 13.18) are seen  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the zygoma implant platform [26]. To this date, the authors are not aware of the zygoma implant fracturing in its mid-portion. To better understand the distribution of forces in the zygoma implant under load, it is appropriate to review Freedman's FEA.

In the Freedman study, two models were created. The first model had the zygomatic implants placed in the skull supported by the zygoma and the maxillary alveolar bone with rigid cross-arch stabilization by a fixed bridge. The second model duplicated the first model; however, the area of the maxillary alveolar bone

supporting the platform of the zygoma implant was removed. Occlusal and lateral forces were applied to both models, and the maximum von Mises stresses were recorded. In the model lacking alveolar support, higher maximum stresses were noted. Occlusal stresses were higher than lateral stresses in the model with no alveolar support. The zygoma bone demonstrated low stresses in both models. Therefore, the authors concluded that the maxillary alveolar bone support is beneficial in the distribution of forces for zygomatic implants.

In their 2013 and 2015 studies, Freedman et al. concluded that "Maxillary alveolar bone support is beneficial in the distribution of forces for zygomatic implants placed in an extra-sinus position."

The presence of bone around the implant platform also allows for the adaptation of the overlying soft tissues. The ability to have a circumferential boney support at the zygoma implant platform is recommended when possible.

When using the zygoma implant for posterior support of a fixed maxillary prosthesis, Ujigawa and Freedman also highlight the importance of cross-arch splinting zygoma implants with other stable implants in the premaxilla to allow for a more favorable force distribution under function. In delayed loading cases, at stage II surgery, once the zygoma implants are exposed, cross-arch splinting is accomplished by using the same "conversion protocol" as in immediate load cases.

# Key Points

I. The maxillary alveolus is the primary boney support for the zygoma implant under function.  
II. Under load, the crestal bone and the first  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of implants bear the majority of the load.  
III. Zygoma implants under load must be cross-arch splinted. This is especially true in ZAGA 4 case where no crestal bone is available.  
IV. Circumferential bone at the implant platform allows for the proper adaptation of the periabutment soft tissues.

# 13.6 Surgical Protocol

The placement of zygoma implants is an advanced surgical procedure. Proper training and understanding the anatomy as well as the physiology in the maxillofacial region is critical for the prevention as well as the treatment of potential complications. The protocol described in this section describes the steps for the Branemark zygoma implant.

The zygomatic implant engages the limited crestal alveolar bone of the residual maxillary crest in the first molar-second bicuspid region to stabilize the platform of the implant and the os zygomaticus to stabilize the apical portion of the implant. Over the last two decades, the use of the zygomatic implant has been studied internationally, with reported success rate between  $94\%$  and  $100\%$  [13-18].

Brænemark in 2004 reported on the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of  $94\%$  following the two-stage, delayed loading protocol [27]. In 2010, Bedrossian et al. reported on the 7-year prospective follow-up of patients treated using the immediate load protocol with a CSR of  $97.2\%$  [28]. Aparicio et al. in 2014 reported on a 10-year prospective study using the immediate load protocol with a similar  $97.71\%$  CSR [29].

The surgical procedure begins by making a crestal incision across the edentulous maxillary arch. Bilateral releasing incisions are made over the maxillary tuberosity, similar to the hockey stick incisions for removal of maxillary wisdom teeth exposing the maxilla. Preparing the trajectory of the osteotomy for placement of the zygomatic implant is a critical step. There is only one trajectory of the zygoma implant as described by PI Branemark [30-32].

It is recommended that the path of the implant from the premolar area to the base of the zygoma be directly visualized whenever possible. Direct visualization of the base of the zygomatic body has also been advocated for clinicians who have used computer-assisted treatment planning and surgical templates for placement of the zygomatic implant [32].

Having a clear view of the path of the instruments needed in establishing the osteotomy and visualizing the path of the implant during its insertion prevents disorientation and potential complications associated with placement of the zygomatic implant. Generally, three potential trajectories of the implant are possible. The proper axis/trajectory is a path extending from the bicuspid region through the maxillary sinus, entering the base of the zygoma bone, traveling through the zygoma bone, and exiting through the lateral cortex of the zygoma bone. If the entry point in the zygomatic body is more anterior to the described trajectory, potential for penetration into the orbit exists. However, if the entry

point into the zygoma bone is posterior to the described trajectory, the potential for entering the pterygomaxillary space, leading to soft tissue enveloping and the subsequent lack of osseointegration of the implant, as well as the potential for unexpected hemorrhage exists

Note: The "black dotted line" superimposed on the lateral-posterior corner of the maxillary sinus wall is the guide for the paralleling of the drills during the preparation of the osteotomy.

In cases where the anatomy of the lateral maxillary sinus wall and the residual maxillary alveolar bone is consistent with AZGA 0-3, the surgeon identifies the "black dotted line" after exposure of the lateral maxilla and marks it with a sterile pencil. The "black dotted line" is used as the reference point for establishing the sinus opening. A rectangular opening is outlined on the laterla maxillary wall with the posterio wall of the opening paralleling the "black dotted line".

The Schneiderian membrane may be removed or reflected away from the inside of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. The osteotomy is initiated by the use of a round bur (Fig. 13.21), which enters the maxillary sinus through the crestal osteotomy. Its path is directly visualized through the boney window established through the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. To confirm the proper trajectory of the round drill, the shaft of the round drill should parallel the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus opening which in turn parallels the "black dotted" line. The round drill creates a small indentation in the base of the zygoma bone to prevent the  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  drill from chattering. At this point, the round drill is removed, and the  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  drill enters the floor of the sinus. It travels through the maxillary sinus, enters the zygoma bone via the roof of the maxillary sinus, and eventually exits at the frontozygomatic notch. It is important to appreciate that the shaft of the  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  drill is also parallel to the posterior wall of the opening into the maxillary sinus (Fig. 13.22). A  $2.9 - 3.5\mathrm{mm}$  pilot drill is used next to create a shallow osteotomy within the zygoma bone which stabilizes the  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  final drill used to complete the osteotomy at both the maxillary crest and the body of the zygoma.

Before insertion of the implant and at all times during preparation of the osteotomy, the entire surgical paths of the drills and the implant should be directly visualized.

Once the implant has been fully seated, its proper trajectory is confirmed by the distal portion of the zygomatic implant body being immediately adjacent and in intimate contact with the posterior wall of the lateral maxillary wall with its platform generally in the second bicuspid or the mesial half of the first maxillary molar (Fig. 13.23).

To facilitate implant placement, the pre-mounted implant carrier allows for easy handling of the implant with the straight zygomatic handpiece. To ensure proper orientation of the angulated implant head, the premounted fixture carrier screw head is used as a guide. Once the zygoma implant is placed to the proper depth, a screw driver is inserted into the head of the fixture mount screw. The shaft of this screw driver must be at right angles to the edentulous ridge to ensure proper orientation of the implant platform (Fig. 13.24).

Irrigation of the sinus prior to the placement of the implant is critical to remove any gross debris. After the placement of the implant and before removal of the retractor from the frontozygomatic notch, irrigation of the apical portion of the implant is necessary to prevent

Upon the complete seating of the implant, the fixture mount is removed. The clinicians have two options. The first is to place cover screws if delayed loading is considered. However, if immediate loading is considered, appropriate screw-retained abutments are placed with appropriate torque. Temporary titanium cylinders are used to connect and convert the denture to a fixed immediate load prosthesis (Fig. 13.25).

The criteria for the immediate loading of the premaxillary implants and the zygoma implants include insertion torque of  $35 - 40\mathrm{Nm}$  a minimum of  $40\mathrm{Nm}$  and with a minimum of two premaxillary implants [28]. Four premaxillary implants may be considered if they can be distributed evenly within zone 1. In cases

of severe resorption, where no bone is available in zone 1, four zygomatic implants, the "quad-zygoma concept," can be adopted allowing distribution of implants around the arch length.

$\square$  Fig. 13.26 Dehiscence of the buccal soft tissues over the extra-sinus implant position

If the so-called "extra-maxillary" approach is used in cases of ZAGA 0, 1, 2, and 3, where the residual maxillary crestal bone can be engaged to support the zygoma implant platform, the removal of the crestal bone at the maxillary alveolus will potentially affect the even distribution of the functional forces as described by Freedman in 2015 and is discouraged. However, in cases of ZAGA 4, the severe medial resorption pattern of the maxillary alveolus does not allow for placing the implant platform within the residual alveolus, and therefore the implant will have bicortical stabilization within the zygoma bone only. Understanding the ZAGA classification and identifying the patient's lateral maxillary sinus wall contour clarify whether the implant platform will be supported by the residual maxillary alveolus and the mid-partion of the implant travel through the maxillary sinus or the mid-body of the implant be extra-sinus with no maxillary alveolar support at its platform.

Note: The surgeon must appreciate that in cases where a significant concavity is present with the implant platform not having anchorage at the crest of the maxillary bone, the presence of the implant directly beneath the vestibular depth may lead to erosion of the mucosa and exposure of the implant shaft (Fig. 13.26). A limited number of case reports have been published for the management of these exposures [33, 34]. In extreme cases, such as ZAGA 3 and ZAGA 4, or in cases of total or partial maxillectomy, the zygoma implant will be immediately below the soft tissues of the vestibule, and the occurrence of soft tissue dehiscence cannot be prevented. A comprehensive discussion of this potential postoperative outcome must be had between the implant team and the patient. In all other cases, attempts should be made to place the midportion within the sinus following the Brænemark protocol. The inclusion of the buccal fat pad graft either at the time of the initial surgery or as a "preventative" measure

![](images/96fc665709715fed02419d22af84830ec3f249591c684ea6ce04900f63e2d2bd.jpg)

against soft tissue dehiscence only adds unnecessary morbidity for the patients. Therefore, it is the recommendation by the authors to continue the ad modum Brænemark technique as described earlier in order to minimize the long-term response of the soft tissues if the patient's lateral maxillary wall contour allows.

# 13.6.1 "Rescue Concept"

In cases where previous grafting procedures have failed or initial stabilization of a tilted implant was not achieved, Bedrossian in 2011 introduced the "Rescue Concept" using the zygoma implant as part of a decision-making algorithm. This concept allows for continuity of care of the patient without major interruption in their treatment [35].

In cases of a failed zygoma implant, the "Rescue Concept" involves the removal of the failed implant with immediate placement of a new zygoma implant within the same zygoma bone. The clinician must appreciate that there are two positions within the zygoma bone for the placement of zygoma implants: the "top" position, for the placement of the anterior implant in a quad-zygoma case, and the "bottom" position which is the location where the apex of the zygoma implant is placed when used for posterior support (Fig. 13.27). The preoperative planning for immediate replacement of a failed implant includes the visualization of the frontal view of a three-dimensional radiograph to ensure that adequate zygoma bony volume is present in the "top" position, above the apex of the failed implant (Fig. 13.28). Close attention to the position of the lateral cortex of the orbit and the intended "top" position of the zygoma implant is crucial.

The surgical procedure involves the removal of the failed zygoma implant. The new zygoma implant trajectory is established by entering the same osteotomy site

Fig. 13.28 Preoperative planning for the immediate replacement of a failed zygoma implant

of the failed zygoma implant but with the apex of the osteotomy directed toward the "top" zygoma implant position. Once the implant is positioned with adequate insertion torque, a new abutment is placed, and a new temporary titanium cylinder and the new implant position are incorporated into the provisional prosthesis and allowed to osseointegrated for 6 months (  $\square$  Fig. 13.29).

Note: Systematic reviews by Chrcanovic et al. and Goito et al. [36, 37] have increased the use of the zygoma implant in the reconstruction of the severely resorbed maxillae. Chrcanovic et al. reported a  $96.7\%$  success rate over a 12-year follow-up period. Goito et al. in turn reported a  $97.86\%$  success rate following 1541 zygoma implants.

# Key Points

I. Proper training for the placement of the zygoma implant as well as a comprehensive anatomy and physiology of the maxillofacial region is a must.  
II. Preoperative understanding of the patient's lateral maxillary wall contour and their ZAGA classification is recommended.  
III. Direct visualization of the path of the drills and the implant is critical for preventing complications.  
IV. Cross-arch splinting of the zygoma implants once exposed in the oral cavity is critical.

# 13.6.2 Prosthetic Conversion Technique

Conversion of the patient's existing full denture or the conversion of the newly fabricated immediate denture is undertaken immediately following the placement of the implants with proper torque values [32]. The preoperative denture should be at the proper vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) and proper tooth position [38, 39]. Implants are placed with  $40\mathrm{Ncm}$  insertion torque. Screw-retained abutments of appropriate height are now connected to the implants and torqued to  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  (Fig. 13.30). The heights of the abutments are chosen so that after suturing of the soft tissues,  $0.5 - 1\mathrm{mm}$  of the abutment is above the soft tissue line.

The patient's denture is adjusted to allow passive seating over the abutments.

Registration paste is placed in the intaglio surface of the denture as it is seated in the mouth, ensuring proper occlusion with the opposing dentition and proper midline orientation. The positions of the abutments are imprinted into the blue mouse as it sets (Fig. 13.31). An acrylic bur is used to transfer the abutment positions through the registration material and the denture acrylic. Temporary titanium cylinders are used to lute

the prosthesis to the abutments (Fig. 13.32). Once the luting agent has cured, the denture is removed from the patient's mouth by unscrewing the retaining screws of the temporary titanium cylinders. The voids on the tissue surface of the denture base, around the temporary titanium cylinders, are filled with the luting agent as needed. The palate and the denture flanges are removed with re-contouring of the acrylic on the intaglio surface of the prosthesis in attempt to remove all concavities, which may trap food.

The patient's occlusion is checked; if the provisional is opposing a full denture, bilateral balanced occlusion is recommended [40]. If the provisional is opposing natural dentition, group function or mutually protected occlusion with a shallow anterior guidance is widely adopted [41-43]. Maximum intercuspation, MIP, or habitual occlusion allows for even distribution of occlusal forces regardless of the occlusal scheme [41, 44, 45].

Cantilevers (if present) should be out of occlusion [45, 46]. If cantilevers are present in a full-arch fixed implant prosthesis, they should be in infra-occlusion (100 microns) to reduce fatigue and technical failure of

![](images/14c67145d0a2df31cfdf0ff0c35b72285c2c54868ed0d631e3d4298e87f47dba.jpg)

the prosthesis [47, 48]. For the mandible, cantilevers less than  $15\mathrm{mm}$  demonstrated significantly better survival rate [49]. For the maxillae, less than  $10 - 12\mathrm{mm}$  cantilever was recommended due to unfavorable bone quality and unfavorable force direction compared with the mandible [50-52]. However, avoiding cantilevers is highly recommended.

Hobo and Taylor advocate anteriorly placed working contacts to reduce and avoid posterior overloading [42, 51]. However, Wie [53] reported that canine guidance increased the potential for screw loosening and failure due to concentration of stresses in the canine area. Once the clinician is satisfied with the occlusal scheme, the prosthesis is removed from the mouth, polished, and replaced back over the abutments with tightening of the retaining screws to  $15\mathrm{Ncm}$  (hand tightened). Teflon tape is placed over each retaining screw of the temporary titanium cylinders to protect the screw heads from the flowable composite used material of choice to cover the retaining screw access hole of the completed provisional bridge (Fig. 13.33).

# Key Points

I. Passive seating of the denture over the abutments allows for the accurate registering of the abutment positions to the intaglio surface of the denture.  
II. Temporary titanium cylinders connect the denture to the abutments.  
III. Acrylic material is added to fill voids and adapt the intaglio surface of the provisional prosthesis to the patient's soft tissues.  
IV. Bilateral group function is the occlusal scheme for the provisional prosthesis.

# 13.6.3 Postoperative Care

Education of the patients is extremely important as to the limitations of masticatory load applied to the newly placed implants and the all acrylic provisional. Patients are asked to maintain a soft diet. Incising of food is discouraged for the first 6 months during the osseointegration phase. Routing brushing and rinsing of the oral cavity are advised, and the use of rotary brushes and mechanical irrigation devices is discouraged. Postoperative medications include oral antibiotics for 1 week and an analgesic of choice, as needed. All patients are asked to use  $2\%$  chlorhexidine rinse  $20\mathrm{min}$  before sleeping every night. Decongestants are not usually prescribed. Blowing of the nose for the first 4 weeks is strongly discouraged; humidifiers may be used by the patient if clearing of the nasal passages is needed. A 1-week follow-up, appointment is made to ensure proper occlusion, wound healing, and stability of the prosthesis. Patients are instructed to immediately contact the implant team if loosing of the provisional or the final prosthesis is felt. If screw loosening is encountered, occlusion is checked, eliminating hyper-occlusion and interference. Patients are seen as needed over the next 6 months. Bruxism on occasion will result in the fracture of the provisional prosthesis. As determined by the implant team, the use of night guards made for the provisional prosthesis and the continual use of a new night guard made after the fabrication of the definitive prosthesis may aid in the management of the excessive forces generated in patients who demonstrate or have history of parafunctional habits.

# Key Points

I. Education of the patient is critical during the postoperative period.  
II. Prophylactic sinus medications are not given as a routine.  
III. Immediate reporting of a loose prosthesis is communicated to the patients.

IV. Occlusal guards may be fabricated for the provisional prosthesis as well as the final prosthesis if parafunctional habits exist.

# 13.6.4 Discussion

It is important for surgeons to recognize that there is a single trajectory of the zygoma implant as described by the ad modum Brænemark technique. It is also important to recognize that Aparicio has described the relationship of the zygoma implant to the varying anatomy of the lateral maxillary sinus wall contours. The surgeon must understand that the trajectory of the zygoma implant does not change regardless of the anatomic contour of the lateral walls of the maxillary sinus, being ZAGA 0 or ZAGA 4.

The zygoma implant is recommended when there is less than  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  in zones 2 and 3. Under function and in time, the minimal crestal bone may resorb. However, it is prudent to follow the ad modum Branemark technique to allow initial stabilization of the implant as well as better force distribution as described by Freedman and co-workers.

The zygoma implant is an advanced surgical procedure. Proper training is absolutely required. The understanding the resorption pattern of the edentulous maxillae is crucial by the implant team for a predictable esthetic and functional outcome. The zygoma implants must at all times be cross-arch splinted. Pragmatic follow-up protocols are needed for the long-term survival of the implants and the prosthesis. The maintenance appointments should individually determine whether the prosthetic screws or the abutment screws are tight or loose. If loose, re-tightening with the appropriate torque and evaluation for the presence of occlusal interferences or parafunctional habits must be done. Patient's eating habits should be discussed, and discontinuing of eating hard foods or other habits which may overload the prosthesis is discussed extensively with the patient.

Treatment with the zygoma implant is a very predictable concept. Complete knowledge of the prosthetic as well as the surgical protocols in this group of patients is essential for a long-term predictable outcome. Comprehensive education of the patient's condition as well as the limitations of the treatment must be discussed preoperatively. The importance of postoperative follow-up appointments as described above is critical as it plays a major role in the long-term prevention of complications and, therefore, the success of the treatment.

# Key Notes

I. Zygoma surgery is an advanced procedure needing proper training.  
II. The resorption pattern of the edentulous maxillae must be well understood by the implant team for an esthetic and a functional outcome.
