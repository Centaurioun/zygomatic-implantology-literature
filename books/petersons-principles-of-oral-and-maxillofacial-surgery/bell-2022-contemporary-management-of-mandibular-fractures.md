# 20.1 Introduction

Mandible fractures are one of the most common fractures managed by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Although varying in their location, and/or severity, they invariably involve the teeth and the occlusion. Therefore, formal training in dentistry is extremely helpful for achieving favorable treatment outcomes. Although closed treatment of less complex mandibular injuries continues to play an important role in the treatment paradigm, technological advances in the reduction, stabilization, and fixation of even the most complex of mandibular fractures have resulted in unparalleled predictability with which patients are returned to form and function. This chapter will focus on the contemporary management of patients with mandibular trauma, provide the reader with a literature-based guide to clinical decision-making, and, when possible illustrate the author's approach to the trauma patient with facial injuries.

# 20.2 World War and Influential Surgeons of Maxillofacial Trauma Surgery

At the time of this writing, a PubMed query for reconstruction of the mandible yielded more than 6000 scientific articles. Indeed, the medical literature has collected articles detailing advances in mandibular reconstruction for centuries with the earliest known writings on mandibular fractures appearing in the Edwin Smith Papyrus in 1650 B.C. [1]. Hippocrates later described manual reduction of mandibular fractures using dental fixation and bandaging [2]. Salicetti is the first surgeon to recognize the importance of maxillomandibular fixation in his textbook, Cyrurgia, published in 1476 [3]. Barton [4] described a systemic method of bandaging mandibular

fractures in 1819, a technique that was utilized extensively through the nineteenth century. It was not until Gilmer reintroduced the concept of interdental wire fixation in the United States, however, in 1887, that the basic principles of reduction, stabilization, and fixation that we know of today as the foundation for mandibular fracture repair was introduced [5].

Perhaps during no other time period has the treatment of maxillofacial injuries been so advanced than that of during World War I and II [6-13]. In Germany, as early as August 1914, a hospital of 225 beds was opened at Dusseldorf for the specific treatment of wounds of the face and jaws, and by April 1915 similar institutions had been established in other parts of the German empire [14]. August Lidemann, at Dusseldorf, Martin Wassmund in Berlin, and Hans Pichler in Vienna led three important German schools that grew out of the war experience and influenced maxillofacial surgery to this day.

On the allied side, Charles Valadier, a French American dentist, was stationed in Abbeville and later at a field hospital in Boulogne. Valadier established a jaw fracture unit at the 83rd general hospital at Wimereux. Valadier was joined in July 1916, by Captain H. Lawson-Whale, an otolaryngologist, and later by Captain Frederick John Clemenison, another otolaryngologist who assisted Valadier in many of the surgical aspects of the facial fracture management [14].

Varazad Kazanjian, an Armenian-American dentist who came to the Western Front with the Harvard-based American Expeditionary Forces in 1917 made numerous contributions to mandibular fracture repair. By combining dental splints with transosseous wires and plaster head caps, he was able to achieve bony union in cases that previously were thought to be untreatable and brought a new level of predictability to mandibular fracture management. His innovative approach, skill, and dedication to the treatment of soldiers with maxillofacial injuries lead to his nickname the "miracle man of the western front" [14].

In 1915 Harold Gillies, a New Zealand-born otolaryngologist, established the first comprehensive maxillofacial unit at Cambridge Hospital in Aldershot, England. Valadier's unit in France became a staging ground for Gillies unit in England. The Aldershot Center soon became inadequate, and Gillies was transferred to Queens Hospital in Sidcup, England. Gillies was joined by Dr. Kelsey Fry, an Oral Surgeon, who proposed to Gillies, "I'll take the hard tissues, and you take the soft" [14]. This arrangement of shared responsibility leads to countless innovations, which were chronicled in Gillies classic textbook published in 1920, Plastic Surgery of the Face [6], and Fry's The Dental Treatment of Maxillo-facial Injuries [13]. A generation of surgeons subsequently made a pilgrimage to Great Britain to learn from Gillies, arguably the most influential maxillofacial surgeon of the twentieth century [15-18].

It is difficult to obtain a true snapshot of the epidemiology of mandibular trauma, as the literature is filled with institutional reviews that vary in their demographics, geography, economy, and setting (civilian vs. military) [19-32]. There are clearly trends in the incidence of facial injuries, depending upon whether a country is developing or already developed. There has been an increase in injuries from motor vehicle collisions in developing countries related to the increases in volume of traffic, rural to urban drift of population, poor road

The presence of safe roads, strict safety laws for vehicles (construction, airbags, driver assist, etc.), and strict safety laws for driving (speed limits, seat belt laws, stiff penalties for driving with alcohol, etc.) are primarily responsible for the decrease in injuries in developed countries

conditions, increased import of second-hand vehicles, driving under the influence of alcohol, noncompliance with seat belt or crash helmet use, and the lack of airbags [33]. Conversely, the incidence of facial injuries has greatly decreased over the past 30 years in most developed countries, and the resulting etiologies in the United States have shifted from road traffic accidents to interpersonal violence [26, 27]. The presence of safe roads, strict safety laws for vehicles (construction, airbags, driver assist, etc.), and strict safety laws for driving (speed limits, seat belt laws, stiff penalties for driving with alcohol, etc.) are primarily responsible for the decrease in injuries in developed countries [34].  $\square$  Figure 20.1 depicts a common contributing factor in low- and middle-income countries, the lack of helmet laws. Mandibular fractures continue to be a common occurrence at trauma centers. There is great variability in the distribution of etiologies based upon numerous factors, but assaults, followed by motor vehicle collisions, are collectively the most common causes of facial injury at urban US trauma centers (  $\square$  Fig. 20.2a). Other relatively common causes include sports injuries; industrial or workplace accidents; and falls (  $\square$  Fig. 20.2b). It should be noted that the etiological patterns shift among age groups and genders with sports injuries predominating in younger males (less than 60) while falls in older women (over 60) are a major contributor [34]. Mandibular fractures associated with midfacial fractures are more frequently caused by motor vehicle collisions, whereas isolated mandibular fractures may be more often seen in assaults [31].

Facial fractures, in general, are a major contributor to ED visits around the United States and, predictably, contribute to a significant amount of healthcare dollars spent. It is estimated that total ED charges annually exceed one billion USD. When looking simply at the repair of mandible fractures, it has been estimated to be approximately 35,804 USD per patient [35].

# 20.3 Classification

Ivy and Curtis [36] provided a practical classification for mandibular injury in 1926 that describes the pattern of fractures as occurring in the symphysis, parasymphysis, body, angle, ramus, neck of the condyle, and corrinoid process. In their review of mandibular fractures, Afrooz et al. [28] reported that males with mandibular fractures outnumbered females by a ratio of 4 to 1 and right and left-sided fractures had equal distribution. The anatomic order of frequency of mandibular fractures was the body  $(18.1\%)$ , angle  $(16.2\%)$ , sub-condylar and condyle  $(27.14\%)$ , symphysis  $(19.2\%)$ , ramus  $(11.3\%)$ , alveolar  $(4.5\%)$ , and coronoid  $(3.3\%)$  (Fig. 20.3).

While this simple description of fractures is useful for communication, it is neither helpful in therapeutic decision-making nor scientific evaluation due to the differences in fracture pattern and severity caused by vari

ables such as kinetic energy and etiology. A number of authors have attempted to subclassify patterns of mandibular injury while accounting for such variables [37-48]. There are a number of shortcomings in the existing classification systems, including a lack of scoring for a combined fracture; an inability to classify multiple separate osseous regions with isolated fractures; and an inability to classify severe fracture patterns resulting from high velocity or gunshot injuries. In an effort to overcome some of these limitations, Buitrago-Tellez et al. [49] proposed a comprehensive classification system based upon imaging analysis (Fig. 20.4). This AO/ASIF scheme defined three fracture types (A, B, C), three groups within each type (example A1, A2, A3), and three subgroups within each group (example A1.1, A1.2, A1.3) with increasing severity from A1.1 (lowest) to C3.3 (highest). The mandible was divided into two vertical units (I and V) and two lateral horizontal units (II and IV) and one central unit (III) comprising the symphyseal and parasymphyseal region. Type A fractures are non-displaced, type B are displaced, and type C are multi fragmentary/defect injuries.

# 20.4 Biomechanics

The mandible develops zones of tensile and compressive force during normal function. The location of these zones is dependent upon the direction, location and magnitude of force, stress, or load applied. An understanding of biomechanics is not only necessary for predicting patterns of injury but also for evaluating the effectiveness of fixation techniques.

Current theory regarding mandibular biomechanics was largely derived from a series of experimental studies performed in the 1960s by Huelke and colleagues

Fig. 20.5 Drawing illustrating force applied to the symphysis of the mandible, resulting in a compressive strain along the buccal aspect and tensile strain along the lingual surface. A fracture will occur on the lingual side of the mandible which then propagates to  
the buccal side. The contralateral condyle is pushed into the glenoid fossa and fractured by compressive forces. (From: Chacon and Larsen [141])

[50-55]. They applied forces of varying magnitudes to dried skulls and, using a stress and strain model, observed the resultant tensile and compressive forces. They found that, with the exception of the mandibular condylar region, experimentally produced fractures were in areas of tensile strain, rather than in areas of compression. Condylar head injuries, on the other hand, tended to be produced by a load parallel to the ramus, due to compression. For example, when a force is applied to the parasymphysis region of the mandible, a compressive strain develops along the buccal aspect, and tensile strain occurs along the lingual surface. A fracture will occur on the lingual side of the mandible which then propagates to the buccal side (Fig. 20.5). The contralateral condyle is pushed into the glenoid fossa and fractured by compressive forces.

Traditionally, muscle attachment and their counteracting forces have been thought to play the most important role in determining the pattern, direction, and degree of displacement for mandibular fractures. The concept of a patient having a "favorable" or "unfavorable" fracture was developed, based upon the direction of a fracture line as viewed on radiographs in the hori

zontal or vertical plane (Fig. 20.6). A horizontally favorable fracture line resists the upward displacing forces, such as the pull of the masseter and temporalis muscles on the proximal fragment when viewed in the horizontal plane. A vertically favorable fracture line resists the medial pull of the medial pterygoid on the proximal fragment when viewed in the vertical plane. Anteriorly, the combined action of the suprahyoid musculature on bilateral fractures can result in downward rotation of the distal segment (e.g., "bucket-handle fracture"), displacement of the tongue musculature posteriorly, and cause potential airway obstruction (Fig. 20.7).

Despite long-term acceptance, it is clear that the concept of "favorableness" is oversimplified. For example, it does not incorporate the effect of varying locations of occlusal load. While tension occurs along the upper margin (and compression at the lower margin) of a body fracture when the incisors are loaded, conditions may change dynamically as the bite target moves posteriorly approaching the fracture location [56]. Thus, in some instances, compression can occur at the superior border and tension at the inferior border of the fracture

Note: resultant zone of compression (C) at the inferior border and zone of tension (T) at the superior border, the knowledge of which is critical for understanding appropriate areas of osteosynthesis in the stabilization and fixation of mandibular angle/body fractures. (From: Rudderman et al. [56])

(  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 20.8a). Similarly, in an isolated fracture at the mandibular symphysis, an incisor load acts as a pivot point around which the mandible rotates. The masseteric sling will produce rotation around the anteroposterior axis causing separation at the lower border of the fractured mandible (tension) that is greater than that of the superior border (compression) (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 20.8b).

The presence or absence of posterior teeth was, for many years, thought to contribute further to fracture patterns [57-59]. It turns out, however, that this may only be true for the impacted third molar. Recent evidence suggests that there is no correlation between posterior occlusion and the incidence or pattern of mandibular fracture, except when impacted third molars were present, when the incidence fractures of the angle were significantly more common [41, 60].

# 20.5 Treatment: Historical Perspectives

# 20.5.1 The Splint Age, 1866-1918

Closed treatment of mandibular fractures using dental splints without intermaxillary fixation was the mainstay of treatment at the beginning of the twentieth century (Fig. 20.14). The Gunning vulcanite dental splint was commonly in use since its introduction during the American Civil War; however, these were contraindicated in fractures posterior to the teeth and often resulted in open bite malocclusions [61]. Simon Hullihen,

considered by some the father of American Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, described in the late nineteenth century a continuous dental splint, which he had constructed for a case of resection of the alveolus, which he then used for the treatment of interdental fractures in the body of the mandible. This could be made of metal, vulcanite, celluloid, or hard rubber and was molded over a plaster or metal reproduction of the dentures. GV Black, the father of modern dentistry, is credited with using a vulcanite splint, combined with circumferential wiring of the bone (transmandibular wiring) to immobilize an edentulous mandible [62]. Other splints used for the treatment of maxillofacial injuries were described that were constructed over dyes made from the casts of lower teeth, using metals such as silver or aluminum. The making of splints, however, generally took several days, and this often resulted in unfavorable outcomes for patients, such as nonunion or malunion. This resulted in a reevaluation of dental splint fixation as a way of managing mandibular fractures.

border and compression (C) at the superior border. This action may be heightened in cases of symphyseal fracture with bilateral condylar fractures, as the action of the lateral and medial pterygoid pulls the ramus segments in and down, causing splay at the inferior border. (From: Rudderman et al. [56])

# 20.5.2The Wire Age, 1918-1968

Dr. Thomas Gilmer, of Chicago, was in 1881, the first modern surgeon to advocate what we now consider intermaxillary fixation for the treatment of complex maxillo-mandibular fractures [5]. He did this through fixation using dental bands or wires fastened directly to the necks of teeth. The German surgeon, Sauer, shortly afterwards described the use of heavy round arch wire that was applied to the mandibular teeth only without absolute fixation in 1889 [63].

These same principles were embodied in the development of orthodontic clamp bands that were devised by Loher in Germany and Angle in America and later used by Schroder, Hauptmeyer, and others in orthodontic treatment [64].

Following Gilmer's early description, Robert Ivy, an American Army oral and maxillofacial surgeon modified a technique described by Colonel Robert Oliver [65] as well as Eby [66] in 1918. Ivy employed a 24-gauge wire

![](images/10afbd3c8e6eebf779f1f36f490a9ef1540b07882784d7ce9810eb06c5140d94.jpg)

Fig. 20.9 "Ivy loops". a Interdental wire fixation as the method of providing intermaxillary fixation as described by Ivy; b clinical appearance

inserted between the premolars of the teeth and connecting upper and lower eyelets with a third tie wire twisted tightly to allow for complete immobilization of the lower jaw (Fig. 20.9a, b) [64]. This technique of using "Ivy loops" was often augmented with an alternative method based upon German innovation during the same period. The German technique involved a silver half-round arch wire that was molded to conform to the vestibular surfaces of teeth and then attached to the latter with wire ligatures and was a precursor to the contemporary method of intermaxillary fixation popularized by John Erich (Fig. 20.10a, b) [67]. A multiple loop wiring technique was later devised by Colonel Roy A. Stout of the dental core in the US Army (Fig. 20.10c) [68]. A heavier form of continuous wiring was developed by Risdon of Toronto, Canada (Fig. 20.10d) [69].

By the end of World War II, more than  $90\%$  of all fractures of the mandible, regardless of their position, were successfully treated utilizing closed methods and interdental wire fixation. In certain cases, however, Ivy and many others recommended additional methods for the treatment of what were known as "special cases." These included a fracture in the molar or premolar region with a long edentulous posterior fragment; fractures in the molar or premolar region with teeth in the posterior fragment but no opposing teeth in the upper jaw; fractures of the edentulous or almost edentulous mandible; fractures of the mandible with an edentulous upper jaw; comminuted fractures at the symphysis with loss of incisor teeth and bone; or fractures of the mandible complicated by fractures of the maxilla [64]. In these instances, wire was occasionally passed through a hole in the angle of the mandible via a transcervical approach and fixated to a plaster of paris head cap in order to stabilize the proximal mandibular segment. This was often combined with vulcanite splints and bite splints placed in the posterior mandibular arch as advocated by Kazanjian [70].

The control of edentulous fragments was always difficult. Eventually, the splints, wires, and head caps used in World War I were replaced by external pin fixation. This

method, introduced by Roger Anderson, an orthopedic surgeon, for fractures of the long bones, applied the use of Kirshner pins and a semiadjustable traction bar attached to locking units, as a precursor to the well-known Joe Hall Morris fixation appliance. By the middle of the twentieth century, external pin fixation became commonly used for comminuted mandibular fractures (Fig. 20.11).

Open reduction and internal fixation were considered hazardous for the first half of the twentieth century. Even Robert Ivy, in his classic textbook on fractures of the jaws published in 1945 stated, "Sometimes, in a case of difficult reduction, the surgeon may be tempted to wire or plate the fragments, forgetting or ignoring the fact that nearly all mandibular fractures are compound into the mouth and are constantly bathed in the oral secretions. Infection occurs around the wire or the metal plate, inviting osteomyelitis with sequestrum formation and great delay in union. The only justification for wiring or plating of the fragments is one of those rare cases of fractures in an edentulous person where the oral mucous membranes have not been broken and where there is consequently a chance of maintaining asepsis. Even here a wire or plate usually gives insufficient stability" [64]. Thus dogmatic beliefs such as these were held through the majority of the twentieth century, and it would take a group of European orthopedic surgeons to change them.

# 20.5.3 The Metal Plate Age and the Evolution of Modern Systems of Internal Fixation, 1968-Present

# 20.5.3.1Rigid Internal Fixation and the AO/ ASIF: "The German School"

Modern systems of fixation that are today routinely used for the management of mandibular fractures have their origins in orthopedic surgery [71]. Hansmann, in 1886, was the first to develop and present a procedure for the

open reduction and fixation of long bone fracture using a plate and screw system [72]. While various surgeons in Europe utilized the principles of plate and screw fixation for fractures of the long bones beginning in the late nineteenth century, it was not until the mid-twentieth century that Martin Allgower, Maurice Muller, Robert Schneider, and Hans Willenegger founded the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association to the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) in Switzerland and introduced the idea of axial compression into a surgical routine for limb fractures [73, 74].

Luhr applied these principles of open reduction and internal fixation using "compression osteosynthesis" to the mandible in 1968 [75-80]. These early plates were made of vitallium and contained eccentric holes and self-cutting screws with a conical head. Originally these heavy plates were shaped to fit around the inferior border of the mandible and were placed in bicortical fashion to avoid the roots of teeth and the inferior alveolar nerve. When plates were placed at the band of compression alone, a diastasis was often created leading surgeons to combine the use of "compression band plates"

Fig. 20.11 Contemporary "Joe Hall Morris" external fixator for the mandible (Synthes, Paoli, PA)

placed at the inferior border with arch bars fixed to the teeth along the line of tension. The concept of tension banding, which was adapted from Pauwels' work on extremity fractures, was later applied to the mandible along the alveolar ridge where tensile stresses could be neutralized [81, 82].

Vitallium was difficult to bend and was eventually replaced by stainless steel, which was in turn replaced with titanium. In 1969, the AO/ASIF introduced a dynamic compression plate "DCP" for limb surgery (Fig. 20.12). The concept of dynamic compression was then applied to the craniomaxillofacial skeleton by Spiessl in a series of publications beginning in 1969 [83-86]. These plates were fixated to the lower border of the mandible using bicortical screws, and a superior border plate was secured to the area of the alveolar ridge using monocortical screws to neutralize the tensile stresses (Fig. 20.13).

The DCP plates were later modified by Niederdellmann and Schilli by creating two additional holes that were angled at  $45^{\circ}$  to exert compression along the band of tension [87, 88]. These so-called "eccentric dynamic compression plates" (EDCP) led to compression at the alveolar ridge, the site of where the tensile stresses occur.

Compression osteosynthesis was examined in a histological animal study by Reuther [89] in 1980, where he found ossification patterns similar to primary fracture healing. By the 1970s, however, it was apparent that compression was not always advisable for patients with comminuted fractures, infected fractures, or segmental mandibular defects. This led to the development of large "reconstruction plates" which allowed more rigidity between the plate and bone fragments. Referred to as "load-bearing plates," Prein et al. [90] first applied these

reconstruction plates to bridge the gaps of complex or comminuted fractures in 1976.

In 1980, the first commercially available mandibular reconstruction plate system made of titanium was introduced by Raveh [91-95]. Termed the THORP system (titanium coated hollow screw and reconstruction plates system), the head of the actual screw was hollow and contained threads into which a smaller screw was inserted. This allowed the screw to be compressed into the plate, leading to stability independent of contact between the plate and the screw. By providing rigid, load-bearing fixation, the concept of an "internal external fixator" was born, and the era of large bridging plates used to span segmental defects of the mandible was founded.

While these large reconstruction plates were effective for bridging continuity defects of the mandible, their size and rigidity were again impediments to their use for routine or even comminuted fractures of the mandible. Thus, a similar but smaller reconstruction plate was developed in the mid-1990s by the AO/ASIF, called the UniLOCK 2.4 (universal locking plate). In this system the locking mechanism between the plate and screws was obtained by placing threads on the screw itself (Fig. 20.14c), which then locked into the inner thread of the plate (Fig. 20.14a).

Contemporary mandibular reconstruction plates use variations of the UniLOCK system over the older THORP system and are widely accepted for providing load-bearing fixation of the mandible [96, 97]. The concept of utilizing threaded screws to lock into plate mechanisms has also been applied to miniplate fixation (Fig. 20.14b).

The technique of utilizing dynamic compression plating in the mandible has, however, undergone a period of reevaluation. There appears to be no significant advantage of compression plating in the mandible, and in fact it may contribute to the development of diastasis if not utilized properly. Many maxillofacial surgeons, including this author, have abandoned the use of compression plating altogether, in favor of titanium miniplate fixation and/or the use of locking plates and screws.  $\square$  Figure 20.14d demonstrates a contemporary fixation tray including both compression plating and locking plating in various sizes and screw options (locking and non-locking screws). Note the fixation hole difference between the compression plating and "fracture" plating.

The AO/ASIF principles using rigid internal fixation as applied to the bands of compression and tension have withstood the test of time. They have, however, been complimented by a parallel school of mandibular fracture fixation based on miniplate osteosynthesis.

# 20.5.3.2 Functional Fixation, Michelet and Champy: "The French School"

Shortly after Luhr and Spiessl developed and popularized the concept of compression osteosynthesis in German-speaking European countries, French surgeons began to develop their own techniques using miniplates applied along ideal lines of osteosynthesis, applying monocortical screws to avoid injury to tooth roots (Fig. 20.15a, b). Michelet [98] first applied vitallium miniplates to a series of mandibular fractures in the early 1970s and reported favorable clinical outcomes. Figure 20.15b demonstrates a miniplate tray capable of receiving 2.0 and  $2.3\mathrm{mm}$  monocortical screws.

Champy later modified Michelet's technique and went a step further by providing a biomechanical basis for treatment [99-105]. A series of experimental studies, performed in the mid-1970s defined the ideal lines of osteosynthesis as the line of maximum tensile stress from the oblique ridge along the base of the alveolus to the mental foramen. Champy hypothesized that a single mini plate, placed at the ideal line of osteosynthesis, designed to cope with the tensile stresses, should be adequate to stabilize mandibular fractures and achieve predictable union (Fig. 20.16f). Early clinical studies were performed using stainless steel miniplates, but these were later changed to titanium.

# 20.6 Diagnosis

Diagnosis of the patient with facial fractures consists of the assessment of the occlusion, palpation of the facial contours, bimanual manipulation of the mandible to assess for fracture mobility, assessment of symmetry

and deviation upon mouth opening, maximal incisal opening, and evaluation of the dentition for avulsion of teeth and/or dentoalveolar fractures. In addition, a comprehensive cranial nerve evaluation should be performed, with particular emphasis placed on the evaluation of neurosensory disturbance in the distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve/mental nerve. The presence or absence of altered sensation in the distribution of the inferior alveolar/mental nerve should be documented.

The radiographic evaluation of a patient with suspected facial injury/mandibular fracture should consist of imaging in at least two planes. In the past, evaluation of the mandible with plain films in four views, known as a mandible series (right and left oblique, reverse Townes and Posterior-Anterior (PA) mandible view), was advocated (Fig. 20.17a-d) Today, a panoramic radiograph (Fig. 20.17e) should be obtained whenever possible, which allows accurate assessment of the involvement and condition of teeth and their relationship to the adjacent fractures. A panoramic radiograph alone (Fig. 20.17h-j), however, is not adequate, and this must be combined with a reverse Townes and/or PA view to achieve a second dimensional image to allow a more complete evaluation of the mandibular condyles (Fig. 20.17c). Alternatively, or in addition to these films, a CT scan will provide the most complete injury assessment and three-dimensional view of the fractures,

particularly in cases of high energy or severe comminution (Fig. 20.17f, g). In the author's practice, all patients will obtain at least a panoramic radiograph plus or minus a CT scan. Additionally, many institutions offer three-dimensional reconstructions, if ordered. For high-energy injuries, in particular, this option can be invaluable for treatment planning. If the CT scan is not available or not obtained, a reverse Townes view is also added to the panoramic radiograph. In more rural or resource-poor settings, a panoramic x-ray is often not available, and CT scan access can be limited. For these reasons, it is important to consider the use of a mandible series for the diagnosis of mandible fractures.

# 20.7 Perioperative Management

Displaced fractures that extend through the tooth-bearing region of the mandibular arch often benefit from temporary stabilization of the fracture prior to open reduction and internal fixation. The so-called bridle wires can be placed in the emergency department at the time of admission and will aid in hemorrhage control and airway stabilization (Fig. 20.18a). If utilized, bridle wires should be placed through the second tooth on either side of the fracture to prevent avulsion of mobile tooth or teeth fragments. The patient is placed on a full liquid diet and scheduled for treatment expedi

tiously. An additional option for simplistic and rapid maxillomandibular fixation is the use of embrasure wires (  $\square$  Fig. 20.18b, c).

The administration of antibiotics is controversial [106-111]. Although the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is multifactorial and beyond the scope of this chapter, responsible antibiotic stewardship is advised when treating all facial fractures. While

there is general agreement that perioperative antibiotics are beneficial, the optimal timing of administration relative to surgery remains enigmatic. The effectiveness of preoperative antibiotics seems to vary depending upon length of time to operative treatment, and it has not convincingly been shown to reduce surgical site infections (SSI). There is conflicting evidence for the use of postoperative antibiotics, but current literature does not

support this practice either [107]. Recent prospective randomized clinical trials were unable to show a benefit to the postoperative administration of antibiotics in patients who underwent ORIF of mandibular fractures [109, 110].

Despite a penicillin derivative historically being used, current guidelines recommend the use of intravenous (IV) cefazolin with or without metronidazole (Fig. 20.19) as the perioperative antibiotic of choice, unless an allergy is present [112]. An alternative in the

pared to no antibiotic at all; therefore, it's routine use should be cautioned [113]. The author also prescribes chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse prior to and after surgery until all wounds/incisions are closed.

# 20.8 Operative Management

# Key Points

- Goals of treatment are to (1) restore form and function and (2) achieve osseous union predictably.  
- Principles of successful fracture treatment include accurate reduction, stabilization, and fixation of displaced bony segments.  
The majority of mandibular fractures can be successfully managed via transoral approaches with and without interdental wire fixation.

The primary goals of treating mandibular fractures are (1) to restore the patient to form and function by returning the patient to the pre-injury occlusion and achieving anatomic reduction when possible and (2) to achieve osseous union predictably. The appropriate technique to achieve these goals varies based upon the location of the fracture, the energy of the fracture, and whether or not there is load sharing potential. The use of interdental fixation (arch bars, interdental/embrasure wires, IMF screws, or hybrid arch bars), the approach (open or closed; transoral or transcervical), hardware selection (load-bearing or load sharing), management of teeth in the line of fracture (to keep or to remove), and postoperative rehabilitation (period of intermaxillary fixation versus immediate function) also depends upon the surgeon's preference or training, location of fracture, and the presence or absence of concomitant fractures.

# 20.9 Closed Treatment with Maxillomandibular Fixation vs. Open Reduction and Internal Fixation

The decision to treat a patient with a mandibular fracture by closed reduction using maxillo-mandibular fixation (MMF) or by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) remains modestly controversial. Few studies have compared the outcomes of the two treatment modalities, and some authors have suggested that MMF offers considerable cost-savings over ORIF [114, 115]. Publication of the first prospective randomized controlled clinical trial studying conventional maxillomandibular fixation vs. open reduction and internal fixation to treat mandibular fractures was published in 2008 and again ushered in a controversy regarding the most predictable and cost-effective method of treatment of the mandibular fracture. In this study by Shetty et al. [114], a total of 336 patients were randomly assigned to receive either maxillomandibular fixation or open reduction internal fixation and followed prospectively for

12 months. The study failed to show a clear overall benefit of ORIF of moderately displaced fractures over MMF. A major limitation of the study, however, was that participating clinicians overruled the randomized treatment assignment in a substantial number of cases, and many patients were lost to follow-up. Other investigators, such as Hoffman et al. [115], Thaller et al. [116], and Dodson and Pfeffle [117], have argued the ORIF may in fact be the more cost-effective approach for treating mandible fractures if the costs of treating potential complications are considered. Experience dictates that MMF is certainly reliable, safe, and cost-effective for some patients (Fig. 20.20a, b). There is no doubt, however, that ORIF remains an important treatment option in complex injuries. Compelling data describing predictors of successful MMF use are lacking; however, patient compliance predictors should play a role in the decision-making process. Gender, illicit drug use, and geographical distance from the provider have all been associated with reduced compliance and a higher rate of complications such as infection and wound break down. Thus, determination of the best treatment method should be made after careful assessment of the various clinical variables and informed consent of the patient.

# 20.10 Interdental Wire Fixation as an Aid to Open Reduction and Internal Fixation

The use of interdental wire ligatures or arch bars for intraoperative MMF has been a time-honored and reliable technique to aid in the reduction and stabilization of mandibular fractures prior to the application of plate fixation. The problem with this technique, however, is that it is time-consuming and there is a significant risk of skin puncture, possibly resulting in disease transmission to the surgeon (Fig. 20.20a, b) [118]. Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) screws were introduced as an alternative to interdental wire fixation in order to decrease the risk of disease transmission (Fig. 20.21a, b) [119]. Pigadas et al. [120] published the results of a prospective randomized clinical trial on cross infection control in maxillofacial trauma surgery and found IMF screws to be a safer alternative to wiring methods with a significant reduction in glove perforation rates and decrease in operative time. Recently, "hybrid" arch bars have been introduced as an alternative to IMF screws when cross arch stabilization is indicated (Fig. 20.21c-e). This option continues to reduce the use of wires, while allowing for a similar interdental stabilization as conventional Erich arch bars. In this author's experience, their placement is also quicker than conventional arch bars. There is limited available data in the literature to support the use of one technique as opposed to the

other; however, considerations such as cost, damage to teeth, and OR time can be variables in the decision-making algorithm.

Other authors have attempted to minimize these risks and improve operating room efficiency even more by omitting wire/arch bar MMF altogether, in favor of manual reduction of the fractures alone [121-125]. While this approach does not appear to have gained much traction among North American oral and maxillofacial surgeons, there is recent evidence to suggest that many experienced surgeons from other countries and other surgical specialties do not, in fact, routinely use arch bars or interdental wire fixation to aid in the reduction, stabilization, and fixation of mandibular fractures [121, 125]. In general, Erich arch bars, IMF screws, "hybrid" arch bars, interdental "Stout" wires, and manual reduction alone all have efficacy for achieving favorable bony union in the ORIF of selected mandible fractures [125].

There is no question that Erich arch bars are preferable for the treatment of comminuted fractures and those mandibular fractures with concomitant midfacial fractures, but the advent of hybrid arch bars has reduced the indications substantially. Additionally, there are many isolated mandibular fractures that are minimally displaced or favorably displaced for which the application of arch bars (conventional or hybrid), with their associated risk of skin puncture and added operative time, and cost may not be warranted. In these cases, the use of interdental wire fixation or manual reduction alone may be considered. The author now makes extensive use of IMF screws and uses them in most cases of isolated, non-comminuted, and dentate fractures.

# 20.11Surgical Approach

Most fractures of the mandible today are treated by means of open reduction and internal fixation. The principles of reduction, stabilization, and fixation, in

that order, should be followed when considering surgical treatment. The vast majority of mandibular fractures may be approached utilizing intraoral incisions (Fig. 20.22a-c). However, comminuted fractures of the mandibular ramus, gunshot wounds, and atrophic mandibular fractures are relatively common indications for the use of transcervical or transfacial incisions (Fig. 20.22d, e). Mandibular condyle fractures are reviewed in Chap. 21.

# 20.12 Hardware Selection

# 20.12.1Principles of Rigid Internal Fixation

A fixation system will provide either absolute (rigid) stability or functional stability. Rigid stability occurs when no movement whatsoever occurs across the fracture gap. Rigid stability is an ideal therapeutic principle, and probably no fixation system is able to provide absolute stability in all dimensions in a system as dynamic as the mandible. Functional stability occurs when movement is possible across the fracture gap but is balanced by external forces and remains within the limits that allow for the fracture to progress to union. While excessive mobility at a fracture site will lead to bone resorption and fibrous tissue ingrowth, known as a fibrous union, absolute rigidity is often inadequate to achieve bony union. When mobility is present, any internal device will promote bone resorption and infection.

Modern internal fixation systems provide functional stability in one of two ways:

1. Load sharing stability is provided by a fixation system in conjunction with stabilizing forces provided by anatomic abutment of non-comminuted fracture segments (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig.20.23a).  
2. Load-bearing stability is functional stability that is provided solely by the fixation system (Fig. 20.23b).

In contemporary fracture plate modules, load-bearing fixation is provided by locking reconstruction plates, generally 2.3, 2.4 mm, and 2.7 mm in diameter and up to 3 mm in thickness, whereas load-bearing fixation is generally 2.0 mm in diameter. These principles of rigid internal fixation, as espoused by the AO/ASIF and championed in the craniomaxillofacial skeleton by Spiessl, Schilli, and Prein, have been the gold standard by which all other methods of craniomaxillofacial fixation have been compared [86].

In contrast to the concepts of stability popularized by the AO/ASIF, Michelet and Champy advocated "semirigid fixation," based upon ideal lines of osteosynthesis (Figs. 20.13 and 20.23c). These lines are based upon the concept that only tensile stresses are harmful to fracture healing. Thus, fractures located proximal to the first premolar may be safely stabilized with a single miniplate placed in the mid-body position  $(2.0\mathrm{mm})$ . Fractures anterior to the first premolar should be stabilized with two plates (a tension band and compression band) separated by  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  and generally placed on either side of the mental nerve. An arch bar, conventional or hybrid, can also serve as a tension band.

As noted above, the application of adequate fixation is important for the successful treatment of mandibular fractures. Rigid internal fixation is a term that has been applied to the application of hardware to prevent movement across the fracture line when normal functional forces are applied. Rigid fixation permits primary bone healing without callus formation and immediate return to full function. Examples of this type of fixation include large commercially available locking and nonlocking reconstruction bone plates, the application of multiple plates at a fracture site, or lag screw fixation

# ( Fig. 20.24c-e).

It turns out that functionally stable fixation is all that is necessary for the successful healing of most fractures.

Micromotion occurs in this paradigm that permits healing of the fracture by secondary bone healing, with the formation of a callus and no need for intermaxillary fixation. An example of nonrigid fixation is the use of a single miniplate at the angle of the mandible as described by Champy [99]. Thus, functionally stable fixation may also result in osseous healing and achieve the predictable results that are required in contemporary centers (Fig. 20.23c).

As discussed earlier, fixation requirements are considered by the ability of the host bone to share some of the functional loads. Load-bearing fixation is of sufficient strength to resist the functional masticatory forces during the healing phase, and the host bone fracture sites share none or little of the functional load. In contrast, load-sharing fixation refers to a scheme whereby the functional load is shared between the hardware and the bone along the fracture site. The indications for providing load-bearing fixation are those fractures with comminuted segments, atrophic mandibular fractures, and fractures with avulsed or missing segments, known as a continuity defect. Commercially available plates and screws that provide load-bearing fixation are generally  $2.3\mathrm{mm}$  or  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  locking reconstruction plates; however, up to  $3.0\mathrm{mm}$  is available. Load-sharing fixation is indicated in cases where no comminution or bone defects are present and when intact bone cortices are opposed to one another after fracture reduction (bone to bone contact). The majority of mandibular fractures can be adequately treated with load-sharing fixation.

# 20.13Teeth in the Line of Fracture

The management of teeth in the line of fracture has been a source of controversy in the literature for decades (Fig. 20.23d) [126]. Various authors have attempted to

use specific criteria such as tooth mobility, interference with fracture reduction, pulpal pathology, and location of the fracture to determine whether or not the tooth should be removed [126-133]. The preponderance of evidence suggests that teeth in the line of fracture (including third molars) may be retained providing that they do not interfere with favorable reduction, stabilization, and fixation of the fracture and are not grossly mobile or infected. Although there are no universally agreed upon criteria, this author retains all teeth in the line of fracture unless they are grossly mobile, infected, or inhibiting fracture reduction (Figs. 20.23c and 20.25a, b). This approach has yielded a complication rate similar to other reported

complication rates, regardless of the presence or absence of teeth in the line of fracture [125].

# 20.13.1Isolated Mandibular Symphysis, Parasymphysis, and Body Fractures

Non-comminuted fractures within the tooth-bearing region of the mandible are readily approached via a transoral, vestibular incision. Care is taken to avoid injury to the branches of the mental nerve during the surgical approach, and typically the mental nerve is

tem. Contemporary fixation systems involve a 2.3 or  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  locking reconstruction plate at the inferior border combined with secondary fixation of comminuted segments at the superior border

mobilized by incising the periosteal envelope and exposing the fascicles so that the nerve may be retracted and protected during reduction, stabilization, and fixation of the fracture.

With the patient in the intermaxillary fixation utilizing arch bars, interdental wires, IMF screws, or stabilized by manual reduction, a bone reduction forceps is applied to reduce the osseous segments in cases of linear fracture. Medial pressure is applied to the angles of the mandible in cases of comminution or when the mandibular condyles are also involved, to prevent facial widening. The plate is slightly overbent, and care is taken to ensure that no diastasis exists buccally or linguually. Holes are drilled through the outer cortex to engage the reduction forceps and the bone is compressed tightly. Evaluation of the occlusion for the presence of crossbite, mandibular angle flaring, and accurate positioning of occlusal wear facettes is important at this point in the procedure. Preexisting anterior open bites can be chal

lenging to assess, but typically the lack of wear facettes and the presence of mamelons in the incisor teeth will indicate that indeed perhaps no anterior occlusion was present. It should not, however, be assumed that patients with few wear facettes have an anterior open bite. Once reduced and stabilized with a reduction forceps, rigid internal fixation is applied. Both the bands of tension and compression must be stabilized. If an arch bar is utilized (hybrid or Erich), this can act as a tension band and a single  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  or  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  locking or non-locking titanium plate placed at the inferior border of the mandible will generally adequately stabilize these fractures at the symphysis, parasymphysis, or body (Fig. 20.26b). If arch bars are not utilized, however, additional fixation must be applied to the tension band as well (Fig. 20.26c, d). The tension band plate should be placed first to prevent splaying of the teeth along the fracture segment and should be placed in monocortical fashion to avoid injury to tooth roots. The inferior, com

It is the author's preference to provide two points of fixation at both the tension band (2.0 mm plates and screws placed in monocortical fashion) and the inferior border, compression band (2.0 mm plates and screws placed in bicortical fashion) (Fig. 20.26e).

# 20.13.2 Use of Bone Reduction Forceps

Careful attention should be paid to cases of bilateral mandibular fractures involving the symphysis or parasymphysis. Lateral muscular forces will cause widening of the mandible by splaying the angles outwards and creating a defect on the lingual aspect of the anteriormost fracture. Reduction of these fractures involves applying manual medial forces at the angles, stabilizing the anterior fracture with a reduction forcep, and overbending the plates that are used to provide rigid fixation

at the symphysis or parasymphysis (Fig. 20.27). The use of a locking reconstruction plate for this purpose is recommended. This technique will avoid the distraction of the occlusion whilst allowing for imperfections in the bending. In addition, both condyles should be treated with open reduction and internal fixation to avoid lateral displacement and resultant facial widening. Failure to adequately account for the lateral muscular forces will result in a gap along the lingual cortex and facial/ mandibular widening. This discrepancy will then be cumulative, as the upper facial skeleton is built upon a widened mandible. In a series of photos demonstrated in Fig. 20.27d-o, this phenomenon was unfortunately evident. As seen in Fig. 20.27X, the patient presented with a grossly over-widened facial appearance from an outside institution. The immediate postoperative CT scan demonstrated the placement of hardware without meticulous consideration of the mandibular reduction. Without precise reduction of the bony segments, the resultant widened facial skeleton was a predictable, yet

unfortunate outcome. A CT scan appropriate for a virtual surgical planning session was obtained, and CAD/ CAM virtual modeling session was performed to correct for the widened facial 3rds. A stereolithic model was then printed, and a new reconstruction plate was fashioned in the manner described previously. The virtual surgical plan was then executed on the patient, the mandibular widening was corrected with the new reconstruction plate, and the remainder of the midface was appropriately reduced to the new mandibular position. The patients' postoperative photos demonstrate significant correction of the widened middle and lower facial thirds.

The primary anatomic concerns for fractures in the body and symphysis region of the mandible are related to the presence of the inferior alveolar nerve canal and the presence of tooth roots. If bicortical screws are utilized, they must be placed below the inferior alveolar nerve canal when positioned posterior to the mental foramen. At any point along the mandibular arch, care must be taken to avoid screw placement into the roots of teeth. In the author's experience, if this does occur, it is usually of little consequence and can be managed with observation. There is clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that permanent damage to the pulp and supporting tissues is a rare occurrence when screws abrade or even enter root substance [134-138]. The need for postoperative endodontic therapy is extremely rare.

For symphysis fractures, the lag screw technique provides rigid load-bearing fixation as previously described and is an option that should not be overlooked. Goyal et al. [139] compared this technique to a more conventional two-plate option and found that it was an excellent means of achieving rapid fixation with a low

complications rate profile. Other authors have supported the reduced operative time this option provides as well (Fig. 20.26). Although the indications are not as diverse as other options, it can be an excellent option for symphysis fractures.

# 20.13.3 Mandibular Angle Fractures

The ideal treatment of mandibular angle fractures has been controversial. Fractures of the mandibular angle, often complicated by the presence of a third molar, have been shown to have the highest rate of postoperative complications of all mandibular fractures [133, 140, 141] (Fig. 20.28).

Numerous techniques have been utilized to treat mandibular angle fractures. The options for treatment of mandibular angle fractures include the placement of one miniplate along the superior border (Fig. 20.29), miniplates along the superior and inferior border, placement of a compression plate along the inferior border, placement of a reconstruction plate along the inferior border, placement of a ladder plate, and placement of a lag screw. Approaches also vary between trans-oral, trans-buccal (via a trochar), transcutaneous/transcervical, or a combination of the three.

Edward Ellis has probably done more than anyone in the world for describing outcomes for the treatment of mandibular angle fractures (Fig. 20.30). In a series of clinical papers beginning in 1993, he described complication rates of  $0 - 32\%$  depending upon the technique utilized [142-152]. The highest complication rate and most significant type of complications occurred when two dynamic compression plates were utilized  $(32\%)$

[147]. In contrast to the traditional AO/ASIF technique that involves a transbuccal trocar and longer operating times, a single, non-compression miniplate placed in Champy style via a transoral approach yielded a complication rate of only  $2.5\%$  [141, 142, 148]. A landmark study published by Ellis in 2010 reinforced these findings

when evaluating surgical approaches over a 12-year period.

Complication rates are often difficult to interpret, as the definition of a complication is variable. Bell and Wilson [125] described a complication rate of  $32\%$  in a series of 162 angle fracture patients. However, this

number is misleading because virtually all patients had a favorable outcome with a successful bony union and a return to premorbid occlusion. All but two patients had their complications managed on an outpatient basis, under local anesthesia or IV sedation, and almost always after bony union had been achieved. The majority of complications consisted of hardware removal, which is a limitation inherent in the Champy technique itself. The removal of the Champy plate, however, is a simple and straightforward procedure that can be done under local anesthesia in the office setting, akin to the removal of arch bars. The severity of complications in this study was actually similar to previous publications by Ellis et al. [142, 143, 149] Ellis and Walker reviewed 81 patients treated in a similar fashion with a Champy style and noted favorable results. Sixteen percent experienced complications requiring a second surgical intervention. However, most of the complications were minor and could be treated in the office [142].

The AO/ASIF advocated compression plating at the inferior border, occasionally with an additional miniplate at the superior border as a matter of routine in the early years of rigid internal fixation. Over time, however, most experienced surgeons have come to adopt the use of miniplate fixation and abandoned the larger compression plates for noncomminuted fractures. Functionally

stable osteosynthesis whereby a single non-compression miniplate is placed along the superior border of the external oblique ridge has gained widespread acceptance. Described by Michelet et al. [98] and validated by Champy et al. [99-105], three decades of experience have shown that this method results in predictable clinical outcomes with or without the use of postoperative maxillomandibular fixation and that it meets the biomechanical principles set forth by the Association For The Study Of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) [141].

A recent study by Gear et al. [124] evaluated various treatment modalities for mandibular angle fractures that were used by experienced surgeons. They found that more than half of these experienced surgeons utilized single miniplate fixation as advocated by Champy or a single miniplate plus arch bars. Only  $10\%$  used two miniplate fixation and even fewer used locking screw and/or compression plating.

Some authors advocate for the use of a "box" or "ladder" plate technique, which is similar to the more classic two-plate technique. In 2014 Al-Moraissi and Ellis [152] published on this approach and concluded that the ladder plate technique performed better than conventional miniplates. However, their results supported the continued use of the Champy style plate. In addition, they reinforced the simplicity of Champy plate

removal, whereas the removal of a ladder plate can be quite cumbersome in this author's experience. In fact, the author's approach to most mandibular angle fractures has evolved from one that applied AO/ASIF principles of compression plating to the inferior border combined with superior border plating placed via a transbuccal trocar, to that described by Champy of a single superior border plate placed transorally [124]. For the majority of noncomminuted isolated fractures of the mandibular angle, a single  $2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$  miniplate is placed at the superior border [28].

It is important to clarify the nomenclature of plating systems. The term,  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  miniplate is used to describe the diameter of the screw/plate recipient area and does not signify plate thickness. Miniplates are commonly  $0.6 - 1.0\mathrm{cm}$  in thickness, whereas reconstruction plates range in thickness from  $1.0\mathrm{mm}$  to  $3.0\mathrm{mm}$ . In this author's experience, this is often a source of confusion among learners.

# 20.13.4Bilateral Mandible Fractures

Bilateral mandibular fractures are common and alter the fixation requirements necessary to achieve stability in the postoperative period [151]. The second fracture changes the complexity of the force vectors that act across the fractured fragments, and therefore fixation requirements are altered. In general, load-bearing rigid internal fixation utilizing a locking reconstruction plate or two miniplates should be applied on at least one of the fractures (Fig. 20.31). This is typically done on the tooth-bearing fracture rather than the angle or the condyle due to ease of access (Fig. 20.32).

# 20.13.5Comminuted Mandibular Fractures

A comminuted fracture is that which is disrupted and multiple lines within the same region of the mandible. They are less common than linear fractures but can

occur at any location depending upon the trajectory of the kinetic energy applied. Comminuted fractures require load-bearing fixation because the surrounding bony fragments are incapable of sharing any of the functional loads transmitted during healing (Fig. 20.33). A 2.3 or 2.4 locking reconstruction plate using three or four screws on either side of the comminuted area typically provides load-bearing fixation. Once the major proximal and distal segments are stabilized with a locking reconstruction plate, the remaining segments may be stabilized to one another using multiple miniplates. In cases of severe comminution, it is often helpful to stabilize the smaller fractures with miniplates first and then apply the locking reconstruction plate to the remaining construct in order to provide load-bearing support.

The routine use of virtual surgical planning, stereolithographic models, and patient-specific implants has greatly enhanced the accurate treatment of complex injuries [153-157]. In most instances of severe comminution, a virtual reconstruction of fracture segments can be performed, and a corresponding model can be printed for clinical use. A locking reconstruction plate can be fashioned from the stereolithic model and placed to fit the mandible in situ (Fig. 20.33). Furthermore, 3D dimensional CAD/CAM-printed custom plates can be milled or printed to create patient-specific implants. After the virtual reduction is performed using CAD/ CAM software, a precise, custom reconstruction plate can be introduced to the routine workflow. This technique can be indispensable for comminuted segments such as gunshot wounds (Fig. 20.33). Gunshot would victims often present with dozens of fractured segments, and it can be impossible to piece all of them together with accuracy. Time permitting and with improvements in workflow, custom printed, or milled reconstruction plates can be fabricated following VSP based reduction of segments. The improvement in technology and access has allowed for the fabrication of custom plates in as little as 7 days at our institution. Figure 20.34 illustrates the workflow for a GSW, designed for staged bone grafting. An infinite number

# 20.13.6Edentulous Atrophic Mandibular Fractures

Fractures of the atrophic edentulous mandible have plagued surgeons for years. The attached muscular forces often cause significant displacement, and patients

are unable to wear dentures, and associated pain and masticatory dysfunction quickly render these patients oral cripples. Furthermore, fracture healing potential is impaired because there is little endosteal or periosteal blood supply, and there is a severely diminished surface area that allows no load sharing capacity.

Various treatment modalities have been used in the management of edentulous atrophic mandibular fractures [157-170]. For many years, closed reduction using Gunning-type splints with circummandibular wires plus

or minus intermaxillary fixation was the standard of care (Fig. 20.36). Unfortunately, this technique suffered from a high degree of unpredictability, malunion, and nonunion and is no longer recommended. Obwegeser and Sailer [158] popularized a technique in the 1970s of using split rib grafts fixed with circumdibular wires to stabilize the fractures. Marciani and Hill [160] advocated skeletal pin fixation as a method of minimizing periosteal stripping (Fig. 20.37). Neither of these techniques, however, yielded consistent results.

Luhr et al. [163] later described favorable results in a large series of patients with atrophic edentulous mandible fractures using compression plating for fracture stabilization. These experiences lead to the development of specialized instrumentation and locking reconstruction plates for the purpose of providing load-bearing fixation to edentulous atrophic mandibles (Fig. 20.38a). Ellis and Price [166], Tiwana et al. [167], and Van Sickels and Cunningham [168] have each reported excellent results using locking reconstruction plates placed at various locations on the atrophic mandible and have provided a sound rationale for management. Contemporary treatment of atrophic edentulous mandibular fractures is performed via a submental incision with skeletonization of the entire mandible (Figs. 20.39, 20.40, and 20.41).

Care is taken to minimize dissection on the lingual surface. The fractured segments are then reduced and temporarily stabilized with miniplates. Miniplates can be placed on the inferior surface of the mandible so as to avoid interference with the placement of the reconstruction plate and assist in stabilizing the segments. Following anatomic reduction and temporary stabilization, load-bearing rigid internal fixation is applied utilizing a  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  or  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  locking reconstruction plate. At least 3-4 screws should be placed on either end of the proximal and distal segments. The authors generally prefer a single load-bearing plate that extends from angle to angle.

Controversy still exists with regard to the efficacy or necessity of simultaneous bone grafting. The theoretical advantage of primary bone grafting the severely atrophic mandible (less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$ ) is that a corticocancellous bone graft would augment the osteogenic potential of the atrophic bone and enhance healing. Rh-BMP-2 may also be used for this purpose as an off-label technique with or without an allogeneic bone graft [169]. Bone grafts can also be used to provide additional bone stock in preparation for dental implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation. Clinical experience in the nonfracture patient suggests that if bone grafting for this purpose is contemplated; then the implants should be placed between 4 and 6 months after grafting [170]. Failure to provide functional support to the bone graft within this timeframe will result in rapid bone resorption and complete loss of the graft [171].

A 2007 Cochrane database review on the management of fractured edentulous atrophic mandibles demonstrated inadequate evidence for the effectiveness of a single approach [172]. Treatment decisions should therefore be based on the clinician's training and experience. The author utilizes a 2.3 or  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$  locking reconstruction plate for Luhr Class I and Class II edentulous atrophic mandibles and the  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  locking reconstruction plate for Luhr Class III (severely atrophic) mandibles. In the case of the severely atrophic patient, consideration to primary bone grafting is made depending on the patient's desire or ability to afford dental implants. Utilization of CAD/CAM virtual surgical planning options can also be considered in the patient who presents with a stable airway (Fig. 20.41).

# 20.13.7 Pediatric Mandibular Fractures

Less than  $5\%$  of all facial fractures occur in children [173]. Of these, approximately  $32\%$  involve the mandible and less than  $1\%$  occur in children under age 5 [173, 174]. The discrepancy between children and adults is partially due to the greater elasticity of the pediatric mandible and the presence of developing tooth buds.

This fact generally accounts for the fracture patterns seen in children, who often present with minimally displaced fractures in the form of a "greenstick."

The healing potential of pediatric mandibular fractures is advantaged due to a rich endosteal blood supply. Therefore, non-displaced fractures of the mandible in very young children (less than 5 years old) can often be treated with observation and a non-chew diet. Fractures in older children who are in the mixed dentition or permanent dentition are typically managed in a manner similar to adults. Children under 5 years of age, however, represent a separate subset of pediatric mandibular fractures and are the subject of this section.

It is unusual for a very young child to present with an operative mandibular fracture [175]. Most fractures of the primary dentition are non-displaced and can be managed nonsurgically. Displaced fractures of the dentate mandible in children under age 5 do occur, however, and when present should be surgically treated.

The surgical management of pediatric mandibular fractures has evolved significantly over the last two decades [176-179]. Various techniques have been advocated to repair displaced fractures of the dentate mandible of very young children [178], including intermaxillary fixation using interdental wires or arch bars, lingual splints (Fig. 20.42) [179], or open reduction and internal fixation utilizing both titanium (Fig. 20.43) [181] as well as resorbable plates and screws which are hydrolyzed and degrade over time (Fig. 20.44) [182, 183]. The ideal method depends upon the patient's age, fracture pattern, degree of displacement, concomitant injuries, and surgeon training and/or experience [180]. A number of experienced surgeons have described favorable results using modern craniofacial techniques and various combinations of open and closed treatment [177, 181, 182-185].

Contrary to popular opinion, it is not particularly difficult to apply interdental wire fixation or even Erich

arch bars to primary teeth. Care must be taken to avoid tooth avulsion in the late primary or mixed dentition phase. The advantage of utilizing interdental wire fixation is that it helps to establish a stable platform on which to apply internal fixation or intermaxillary fixation if indicated. The problem with the latter is that many small children cannot be expected to thrive in intermaxillary fixation; thus, lingual splints do have efficacy in the early primary dentition (age 1-3).

It is the author's preference to perform open reduction and internal fixation for even the youngest of patients with significantly displaced mandibular fractures. Since titanium has the potential to cause growth retardation and may become encased in bone in a very short period of time, it should be removed within 3-4 months after surgery or resorbable fixation should be used [183]. Care must be taken to apply the fixation to the inferior-most aspect of the mandible, so as to avoid the developing tooth buds. It should also be noted that resorbable fixations systems are intended for non-load-bearing areas (midface) and are considered off-label use in load-bearing areas such as the mandible.

# 20.14Intraoperative Imaging and Virtual Surgical Planning

The chapter would not be complete without a discussion on the technological aids that have become mainstays in our practice since the last edition of this book was published. Advanced imaging modalities such as intraoperative CT scanning and three-dimensional C-arm [186, 187], surgical navigation [153, 154], and virtual surgical planning (VSP) [155, 156, 188, 189] have evolved into

tools available to treat complex facial fractures. Computer-aided CMF surgery can be divided into three main categories: (1) intraoperative CT/MRI imaging, (2) surgical navigation, and (3) computer-aided presurgical planning/virtual surgical planning (VSP).

# 20.15Intraoperative 3D Imaging

Two modalities that are commonly available for intraoperative imaging are the intraoperative CT scanner (Fig. 20.27) and the 3D C-arm. This technology can be indispensable for confirming hardware position and verifying key landmarks that would otherwise be inaccessible due to location. Access to this technology can assist in surgical decision-making including CT-directed revisions that would otherwise go unobserved. Both options provide high-quality, three-dimensional images that can be obtained under general anesthesia with the patient on the OR table. Although not universally available at all institutions, most institutions have one or the other.

# 20.16Intraoperative Navigation/Surgical Navigation (SN)

Intraoperative navigation has emerged as a tool available to the OMS by allowing real-time visualization of bony landmarks via comparison to preoperative CT scan. Preoperative CAD/CAM surgical planning can be combined with SN to execute a preoperative surgical plan with precision. After a CAD/CAM modeling session, virtual data is imported to a navigation system collected from a preoperative modeling session, which can then be used to provide guidance for precise reduction, placement of hardware, and identification of crucial structures. Intraoperative navigation can be used with or without preoperative planning.

# 20.17Virtual Surgical Planning

Three-dimensional surgical planning has made significant advances over the last 10 years. Originating from CAD/CAM technology utilized by radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons, the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery has developed numerous applications of the technology. From preoperative surgical planning to custom milled reconstruction plates, the role of VSP continues to expand. The emergence of widely available software and advances in 3D printing has allowed for

more immediate access to stereolithic models and hence more applications for the trauma surgeon.

The case discussed in Fig. 20.27 illustrates nearly all aspects of the technological surgical workflow. Difficulty achieving appropriate facial width continues to elude even experienced maxillofacial surgeons. The precision achieved via CAD/CAM modeling in

Fig. 20.27 allowed for correction of the facial thirds that began at the level of the mandible. The "preoperative" CT scan demonstrates how the initial fixation failed to properly address the widened mandible, leading to a grossly widened facial appearance. Preoperative VSP was implemented to precisely reduce the fractured segments within a three-dimensional construct, successfully reducing the patient's skeletal facial width. A stereolithic model was then printed and plates were adapted to the stereolithic model. The patient was then taken to the OR, and the pre-contoured plates were applied to the patient. With the use of the pre-contoured plates, the virtual reductions were translated to the patient, and correction of the facial widening was accomplished successfully.

Figure 20.34 demonstrates the variability in plate design for the trauma patient. This patient is a victim of a gunshot wound (small caliber) to Zone III of the neck. Despite minimal soft tissue loss, the mandibular injury resulted in a continuity defect (Fig. 20.33b-h). The defect was then treated with CAD/CAM modeling, and a 3D printed plate with a customized crib for bone grafting was manufactured. The technology facilitated a customized solution in an otherwise challenging case. The authors routinely utilize VSP and guide stents and custom printed titanium plates to aid in the primary reconstruction of composite tissue injuries involving free flap reconstruction in the primary setting (Fig. 20.35) [97].

As the utilization of intraoperative CT scanning (Figs. 20.27 and 20.45) is becoming more widely

available, the authors have found applications of this technology for comminuted mandible fractures and condyle fractures with severe degrees of displacement (Fig. 20.45). Although not universally available at all institutions, three-dimensional C-arms can be found as an alternative to the O-arm. The instruments are widely used by neurosurgeons, so the oral and maxillofacial surgeon can also derive applications, when available. The author chooses the second option despite having access to both. 3D C-arm offers more flexible patient positioning, quicker image access, and reduced radiation when compared to CT scanning [186].

Figure 20.45b, c demonstrates the images generated from a C-arm, which aided in case completion. A final CT scan was obtained for long-term follow-up (Fig. 20.45d). The imaging allows for critical evaluation of the lingual plate, while avoiding additional dissection for exposure and direct visualization.

# 20.18Complications

Complications in the treatment of mandibular fractures occur regularly and, even in the most experienced of hands, should be expected. The most common complications include infection, malunion, nonunion, tooth injury, and the need for hardware removal. Adherence to proper surgical techniques and the principles of reduction, stabilization, and fixation with adequately rigid plates and screws generally minimizes risk, even in high-risk populations.

# 20.18.1Infection

Infection is the most common complication in patients undergoing treatment of mandibular fractures, occurring between  $1\%$  and  $32\%$  of the time [140-152]. Numerous risk factors have been associated with postoperative infection, including substance abuse, smoking, or patient noncompliance with postoperative regimens [190] and a significant delay in treatment [191]. Definitive treatment within 3-5 days after trauma has been shown to be optimal in terms of minimizing the rate of infection [191]. Other risk factors include high-velocity injuries and severe comminution, gross contamination, and high-velocity ballistic injury [192].

Most infections related to mandibular fractures are polymicrobial, with both aerobes and anaerobes routinely cultured. The most common organisms are Staphylococcus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Bacteroides, as well as Gram-negative organisms. Penicillin G (with or without Flagyl) depending on gram stain or clindamycin has traditionally been the

drugs of choice [193]. Culture and sensitivity data available in the literature demonstrate findings of Streptococci spcs, Staphylococcus, Eikenella, and Bacteroides. Current evidence-based practices support the use of ampicillin/sulbactam IV or cefazolin plus metronidazole. Controversy exists primarily in the "penicillin" allergic population. The overuse of clindamycin has increased the resistance, and several recent studies have documented worse outcomes in patients receiving clindamycin as compared to no antibiotics at all. Additionally, the veracity of penicillin allergies in many patients is debatable. Considerations for allergy testing should be made for infections in the setting of a penicillin allergy, if available, but in particular more recalcitrant infections. Additionally, sensitivity data is often useful to narrow the spectrum in the selection of antibiotics to minimize incorrect usage.

Successful management of the infection requires adequate drainage, removal of the source, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. If the cause of the infection is

related to loose hardware and there is a favorable bony union, the removal of the loose hardware is all that is necessary. On the other hand, if inadequate stability of the fractured segments is apparent, the previously placed fixation should be removed and replaced with more rigid fixation, usually in the form of a locking reconstruction plate. Although careful patient selection is necessary, immediate bone grafting of infected mandibular fractures can be used in conjunction with rigid internal fixation and appropriate intraoperative debridement can be an effective treatment modality, which allows a single surgical procedure and successful bony union [194].

Figure 20.46 demonstrates that despite proper treatment, risk factors such as smoking, illicit drug use, and homelessness and adversely affect outcome, leading to mandibular discontinuity. Beginning with a routine mandibular parasymphisis fracture and ending with a free fibula reconstruction of the body of the mandible, unexpected hardware failures continue to plague experienced surgeons despite appropriate antibiotic use and proper use of internal fixation.

# 20.18.2Malunion

Malunion occurs typically because the injury complex was particularly complicated, the patient was noncompliant with postoperative instructions, and/or the surgeon-violated basic principles of reduction, stabilization, and fixation. The exception to this rule is with regard to closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures, where malunion is an inherent risk to the procedure itself and malocclusion results in a significant number of patients, even those who are compliant and in whom the procedure was carried out expertly. When malunion occurs, osteotomies are generally indicated to correct the occlusion and restore facial symmetry/projection. A description of mandibular osteotomies for posttraumatic malocclusion is beyond the scope of this chapter.

# 20.18.3Nonunion

Nonunion of mandibular fractures is an uncommon sequelae of treatment but may occur even in the most experienced hands. High-velocity injuries resulting in severe comminution, inadequate or improperly placed fixation, and poor patient compliance are common etiologies. Treatment typically involves reoperation with debridement of soft tissue and nonviable bone, followed by stabilization and application of rigid internal fixation with a locking reconstruction plate and immediate bone grafting if necessary. Complex cases of nonunion may benefit from the use of 3D printed, custom reconstruction plates to reduce intraoperative time and minimize the difficulty in the OR.  $\square$  Figure 20.47 demonstrates series from a patient who experienced a nonunion. Initial attempts to correct this were complicated by plate

# Conclusions

Technical advances in maxillofacial fracture repair have turned what used to be one of the great challenges in trauma surgery (i.e., treatment of a mandibular fracture) to a matter of routine. The vast majority of patients with mandibular fractures can go on to bony union and return to premorbid form and function very

predictably by applying the principles of reduction, stabilization, and fixation with modern titanium plates and screws. Both open and closed techniques have a role to play in mandibular fracture treatment and will result in predictable outcomes as long as the surgeon respects the physiologic and biomechanical properties of the patient's mandible and the fixation material. The introduction of VSP and incorporation of custom plating have taken even the most challenging of cases to optimal outcomes in less time. As this technology becomes more widely available, so will the applications of such in the treatment of mandible fractures.
