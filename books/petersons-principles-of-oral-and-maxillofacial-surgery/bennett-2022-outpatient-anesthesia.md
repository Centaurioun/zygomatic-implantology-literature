# Learning Aims

- Sedation and anesthesia are a continuum ranging from minimal sedation to general anesthesia.  
A comprehensive preoperative assessment includes not only a review of the patient's medical and surgical history but also several other key aspects.  
Provision of anesthesia for pediatric and/or geriatric patients has unique challenges often requiring specific treatment considerations and modifications.  
Selection, use, and understanding of appropriate monitors throughout the perioperative period are critical.  
Prevention, identification, and appropriate management of perioperative complications are paramount especially for issues impacting normal respiratory function.

# 4.1 Introduction

Anesthesia is an integral component of office-based oral and maxillofacial surgery. Regarding office-based dental

surgery, it is what helps distinguish the oral and maxillofacial surgeon from the general dentist. The goal is to provide anxiolysis, amnesia, sedation, and/or hypnosis to establish a comfortable and cooperative patient who is otherwise homeostatically stable, especially with regard to maintaining adequate cardiovascular and respiratory function. This chapter will review the various principles of anesthesia.

# 4.2 Level of Sedation

Sedation and analgesia include a continuum of states of consciousness ranging from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) to general anesthesia. The definitions of the levels of sedation as defined and adopted by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) are presented below in Table 4.1 [1]. These levels of sedation are not dependent on the route of drug administration, nor the specific anesthetic agent or combination of agents administered.

- Minimal Sedation: Also known as anxiolysis. A drug-induced state during which the patient responds normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired. Ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.  
- Moderate Sedation/Analgesia (Conscious Sedation): A drug-induced depression of consciousness during which the patient responds purposefully to verbal command, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are necessary to maintain a patent airway. Spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.  
Deep Sedation/Analgesia: A drug-induced depression of consciousness during which the patient cannot be easily aroused but responds purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. Independent ventilatory function may be impaired. The patient may require assistance to maintain a patent airway. Spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.  
- General Anesthesia: A drug-induced loss of consciousness during which the patient is not arousable, even to painful stimuli. The ability to maintain independent ventilatory function is often impaired. Assistance is often required in maintaining a patent airway. Positive pressure ventilation may be required due to depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.

# 4.3 Goals of Sedation

# Important

When considering an anesthetic plan, it must be customized to the patient to achieve certain goals. These include:

1. Provide an optimal environment for completion of the surgical procedure.  
2. Minimize patient anxiety and optimize patient comfort.  
3. Control the patient's behavior and movement and optimize patient cooperation.  
4. Optimize analgesia and minimize patient discomfort and pain.  
5. Maximize the potential for amnesia.  
6. Optimize patient safety, while maintaining respiratory and hemodynamic stability.

One must consider the patient, the specific surgical procedure, the anesthetic/surgical team, and the operating suite to determine the depth or level of sedation required to achieve these goals.

# 4.3.1 Patient Safety

Patient safety is the foundation of good care and is defined by the National Patient Safety Foundation as "the avoidance, prevention and amelioration of adverse outcomes or injuries stemming from the process of healthcare." Medical errors resulting in adverse outcomes permeate through all aspects of patient care and can occur when taking the medical history, making a diagnosis, performing the anesthesia or surgical procedure, or during periods of transition or transference of care (e.g., discharge). As healthcare is potentially hazardous, it is prudent that an office develops and implements a continuous risk management and quality improvement plan to reduce any potential errors.

James Reason described a paradigm for analyzing patient safety and the occurrence of system failures which is depicted as a stack of "Swiss cheese" slices. Each cheese slice depicts a stage in patient care which can provide a safeguard against harm. However, each stage of patient care has inherent weaknesses which can result in errors. The holes within each slice of cheese represent active failures or latent conditions which can result in harm. When the holes within the stack of cheese are all aligned, patient harm occurs. Alternatively, if the cheese slices are rotated such that they do not fully align, patient harm is either avoided or the severity of harm is minimized.

Checklists and timeouts are components of a system to minimize risk and optimize outcome. A checklist is a list of "to do" or "to be considered" items. A timeout is a period of interdisciplinary discussion which facilitates communication, minimizes misunderstandings, and ensures that everybody comprehends the intended plan. Together they are a simple standardized process, the goals of which are to ensure correct patient, correct procedure, correct surgical site, the correct imaging is viewable, allergies are identified, appropriate anesthetic and surgical instrumentation and emergency equipment are available and functional, appropriate implantable devices are available, instrument and dispensable supplies (e.g., gauze) counts are correct before and after a procedure, and specimens are logged. Implementing a risk minimization plan which incorporates checklists and timeouts establishes team cohesiveness and a consistency of care which has been demonstrated to reduce complications.

Checklists and cognitive aids are also important during an adverse event. The stress associated with an

adverse event may impair an individual's ability to retrieve rarely used knowledge and team functionality. Checklists and cognitive aids facilitate recall and "best practice." Checklists may be used as either "do confirm" or "read-do." When used as a "read-do" checklist, the practitioner carries out the task as they follow the checklist. In selected situations the practitioner may perform a task from memory and experience, pausing to review the (do confirm) checklist to confirm that everything was done correctly.

# 4.4 Patient Assessment

The oral and maxillofacial surgery office is presented with a diverse patient population. In a prospective outcome study, Perrot et al. provided some characteristics of this diverse population [2]. An overwhelming number of patients were classified as ASA 1  $(72.2\%)$  with the remainder being ASA 2  $(24.5\%)$ , ASA 3  $(3.1\%)$ , and ASA 4 or 5  $(0.1\%)$ . The mean ages (years) of the patients were  $35.2 \pm 20.7$  and  $28.0 \pm 16$ , who received conscious sedation or deep sedation/general anesthesia, respectively. This represents a relatively healthy population and is consistent with what one would anticipate as a significant percentage of the typical oral and maxillofacial surgeon's practice is the extraction of impacted third molars. However, this study did demonstrate that greater than  $25\%$  of the patients were ASA 2 or higher. The percentage of ASA 3 patients is relatively low because of the large number of patients managed in the outpatient office with ambulatory anesthesia and therefore does not reflect the absolute number of patients with significant medical conditions for whom care is actually provided.

The oral and maxillofacial surgeon must complete a comprehensive preprocedural history and physical examination to identify the various issues that could potentially modify the anesthetic plan. Components of this form include age, airway assessment, last menstrual cycle/pregnant, weight/height/BMI, substances, NPO status, medical history, medications, h/o prior anesthetics (self or family), and adverse events.

A medical checklist completed by the patient, a medical staff member, or the practitioner provides a foundation from which a medical history can begin, but by itself it is incomplete. This must be supplemented with a review of systems which confirms the diagnosis, defines the severity of a known illness, and/or identifies signs and symptoms suggestive of a previously unrecognized or defined illness. The practitioner must also ensure that they have a complete and accurate list of medications that the patient is taking. A medication list may provide further insight about the severity of a patient's condi

tion. A medication for which there is no corresponding medical ailment may provide insight into a comorbidity that was not previously identified. A good practitioner listens and observes their patient from which much can be learned. Dr. Francis Weld Peabody from Harvard Medical School in 1925 summarized this point when he stated that "the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient."

Failure to diagnose or misdiagnosis can cause serious harm. There are various ways in which diagnostic errors may occur. It is important to recognize the patient with a low health literacy whose confusion may contribute to inaccurate responses. Practitioners may be anchored on a diagnosis made by other practitioners without fully listening to the patient. This momentum facilitates a misdiagnosis. Representative errors can be made because a patient or a patient's condition fits a prototype or stereotype. Cognitive errors may result because the practitioner focuses on the most likely diagnosis and ignores the "zebra" in the room (i.e., "when you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras"). The purpose of a differential diagnosis is that sometimes it is the "zebra." It is critical to approach every patient as a unique situation as failure to know who your patient is can result in an ominous event.

This chapter cannot discuss fully the multitude of diseases that our patients may have; however, aspects that are pertinent to the items listed above will be reviewed.

# 4.4.1 Airway Assessment

Airway assessment is critical when determining an anesthetic plan. The most common mechanism of patient injury under anesthesia is secondary to airway compromise, with studies reporting that almost half of these events result in permanent brain injury or death. There does not appear to be a significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (usually due to inadequate oxygenation/ventilation) between monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia. To avoid such patient injuries, it is essential to evaluate the patient's airway and identify the patient with a potentially difficult airway. There are several ways to determine the presence of a difficult airway, including both a history and physical examination. A patient's history should inquire as to difficulties with airway management during previous anesthetics, presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and previous surgeries on the airway. The physical examination focuses on several potentially contributing anatomic abnormalities which have been shown to correlate well with increasing difficulty with intubation:

- Increasing score on modified Mallampati test - based on the ability to visualize the uvula and facial pillars with the mouth open wide, tongue maximally protruded, neck extended forward into the sniffing position, and the patient pronates (Fig. 4.1).  
Decreased hyomental distance  $^{\ast} <   3$  cm.  
Decreased thyromental distance* - a measurement from the mandibular menton to the prominence of the thyroid cartilage, with the neck fully extended. The distance should be at least  $6\mathrm{cm}$  or approximately three ordinary fingerbreadths. A short thyromental distance equates with an anterior larynx that is at a more acute angle and results in less space for the tongue to be compressed into by the laryngoscope blade.

Interincisal opening*  $< 3$  cm (reduced TMJ mobility, trismus, scarring, fibrosis,  $\approx 3$  fingerbreadths).  
Thyrohyoid distance*  $\approx$  2 fingerbreadths.  
Mandibular retrognathia.  
Short neck.  
- Neck circumference  $> {17}\mathrm{\;{cm}}$  .  
Enlarged tonsils (grades 3-4).  
- Limited neck flexion or head extension (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis).  
- Prominent upper incisors.  
Abnormal oropharyngeal/neck masses.  
- Congenital, developmental, or acquired facial deformities (e.g., craniofacial syndromes, burns to the head and neck).  
3-3-2 rule (interincisal distance, hyomental distance, thyrohyoid distance).

Used independently, none of these tests are sufficient to consistently predict the difficulty of airway intubation. However, when combining several different tests (i.e., Mallampati and thyromental distance), the sensitivity and positive predictive value of ease of intubation improves significantly. The typical office-based oral and maxillofacial surgery patient is non-intubated, and therefore, the ability to ventilate the patient is considered far more practical and concerning. The incidence of being unable to ventilate a patient has been reported as high as  $5\%$  of the general adult population. Five independent predictors have been associated with impossible mask ventilation: neck radiation changes, male sex, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati 3 or 4, and presence of a beard. Certain features such as obesity, snoring, and lack of teeth were reported to potentially increase the difficulty of mask ventilation but could be overcome using various maneuvers and were not found to be predictors of impossible mask ventilation [3].

The non-intubated patient during intraoral surgery is always potentially at risk due to the proximity of the surgical site (oral cavity), resulting in airway obstruction from multiple contributing factors (mandibular position, head-neck flexion-extension, tongue position). It is only with the consideration of the above historical and physical examination criteria that an overall anesthetic plan may be determined, taking into consideration the ease of potential airway embarrassment with a given level of anesthesia. Once all contributing criteria have been evaluated, the surgeon may decide to manage the patient with significant findings either with a minimal sedation in the office or plan on using advanced airway techniques (either a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or intubation) either in the office or hospital setting. If the potential for a difficult airway is recognized, then the appropriate preparations can be made to increase the likelihood of a good outcome.

# 4.4.2 Airway Preparation

Respiratory compromise remains the primary adverse event associated with anesthetic care. Preparation to manage this potential event is critical and entails the office has available and is familiar with the age-appropriate respiratory instrumentation and pharmacology presented in  $\square$  Table 4.2.

The traditional bag valve mask stocked in most offices is a self-inflating bag. The advantage of this device is that it is not dependent on the use of supplemental air/oxygen or maintaining an absolute tight seal between mask and patient for the bag to inflate and the patient be ventilated. The disadvantage of a self-inflating bag is that the operator has neither the ability to feel the patient's respiratory efforts nor the ability to appreciate airway resistance or lung compliance, which may facilitate diagnosis or assessment of how well the intervention is proceeding. Ventilating with a Mapleson breathing system, which is dependent on supplemental air/oxygen flow as well as establishment of an absolute complete seal between mask and patient, mimics that of a traditional anesthetic circuit and provides the practitioner a better sense of the patient's current respiratory efforts and status. The Mapleson breathing system, however, requires a greater skill set which may impede all office staff from being tasked to ventilate the patient in the event of an emergent situation. As each bag valve mask has its advantages and disadvantages, having the office equipped with both may provide necessary redundancy.

Supraglottic airways are a component of the ASA difficult airway algorithm and are indicated when mask ventilation is difficult or impossible prior to intubation. The iGel® is a supraglottic airway made from a gel-like elastomer. The non-inflatable cuff forms an anatomic seal with the pharyngeal structures that has a low likelihood of rotation or displacement resulting in

obstruction. The device has an integrated bite block and allows potential venting of gastric contents. The structure of the iGel® prohibits its regular intraoperative use as the preferred supraglottic airway for dentoalveolar surgery, but it has advantages which make it the preferred supraglottic airway for emergency airway management.

In the event that intubation is necessary, the office should be equipped to perform both direct and indirect laryngoscopy. Each has its advantages, and if the situation presents itself that intubation is necessary, it is inexcusable that the office is not equipped with equipment that is considered standard of care for anesthesia providers. We recommend a video laryngoscope with a dedicated video display. Lambert et al. demonstrated that the skill set to use a video laryngoscope can be readily acquired.

# 4.4.3 Smoking

Approximately one-quarter of the American adult population smoke cigarettes [4]. Cigarette smoking is associated with increased perioperative morbidity, likely secondary to its association with ischemic heart disease and COPD. Other influencing factors on both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are the effects of cigarette's constituents, namely, nicotine and carbon monoxide. Cigarette smoking increases airway irritability, mostly through mucous hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a result, laryngospasm and airway obstruction are more common. A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch can result from an increased closing capacity, secondary to small airway narrowing. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve undergoes a leftward shift, resulting in less oxygen released to the peripheral tissues. In addition, the blood carbon monoxide level increases, increasing the carboxyhemoglobin levels  $(1 - 10\%)$ , resulting in a lower oxyhemoglobin concentration. The net effect is decreased peripheral oxygen delivery.

Schwilk et al., in a large survey, compared specific respiratory events such as reintubation, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, aspiration, hypoventilation, and hypoxemia during anesthesia in smokers and nonsmokers [5]. The incidence was found to be  $5.5\%$  in smokers, compared with  $3.3\%$  in nonsmokers. They calculated the relative risk of these events occurring during anesthesia and found that the risk in all smokers was 1.8 times greater than in nonsmokers; in young smokers, it was 2.3 times, and in obese smokers, it was 6.3 times the normal. It was noted that smokers have a significantly high risk of having bronchospasms during anesthesia. This risk was higher in female smokers, and the risk was 25.7

times normal in young smokers with chronic bronchitis. The incidence of adverse respiratory events, such as oxygen desaturation and bronchospasm, has also been shown to occur to pediatric patients as a result of passive or secondhand smoking. The adverse events are related to the cumulative number of cigarettes to which the child is exposed [6].

Patients are usually counseled to stop smoking during the perioperative period. To achieve the greatest benefit from this counseling, the period of smoking cessation should be at least 6-8 weeks. The benefit from abrupt cessation before surgery is related to the half-life of nicotine and carboxyhemoglobin, which are  $2\mathrm{h}$  and  $4\mathrm{h}$ , respectively. The elimination of nicotine and carboxyhemoglobin decreases adrenergic stimulation, minimizing adverse cardiovascular effects and increasing both the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood and the amount of oxygen released to the peripheral tissues resulting in increased tissue oxygenation, respectively. Overnight abstinence of smoking is beneficial, however, as the half-life of both nicotine and carboxyhemoglobin can be prolonged during sleep; a 24-h "cigarette smoke-free" period is preferable.

There has been controversy over smoking cessation beyond the initial  $24\mathrm{h}$  and a 6- to 8-week period. This controversy focuses on a paradoxical effect in which there is a transient increase in airway secretions and airway irritability associated with smoking cessation. Warner et al. reported pulmonary complications such as purulent sputum, atelectasis, and pleural effusion in those that had stopped smoking for 8 weeks or more prior to surgery to be only  $14.5\%$ , compared with  $57.9\%$  in those who stopped smoking less than 8 weeks before surgery, which is a four-time higher incidence of complications in those who stopped less than 8 weeks from surgery [5, 7]. Mitchell et al. reported the incidence of postoperative purulent sputum to be  $25\%$  more for those who stopped smoking 8 weeks before surgery and  $50\%$  more in those who stopped smoking less than 8 weeks before surgery than in nonsmokers [8]. Warner et al. found that, if patients stopped smoking for 6 months or more prior to surgery, the incidence was the same as that in nonsmokers [7]. Bluman et al. found that risks were seven times higher in those that reduced smoking near the time of surgery than for those who smoked continuously up to the time of surgery [9]. These results indicate that smoking cessation the day prior to surgery is beneficial, but cessation between this immediate 24-h period and 8 weeks before surgery may not be beneficial with regard to postoperative pulmonary morbidity.

The polycyclic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke are potent inducers of liver enzymes. Smoking cessation decreases these metabolic enzymes, potentially increasing blood levels of drugs that interact with the

cytochrome P-450 pathway. Warfarin (Coumadin®) is one drug that is metabolized by the affected enzymes, which may result in increased postoperative bleeding. Interestingly, postoperative nausea and vomiting are less in smokers. This may be attributed to the induction of liver enzymes. These enzymes may be responsible for the metabolization and excretion of various chemicals that may affect postoperative nausea and vomiting.

# 4.4.4 Obesity

Obesity warrants further comment because its incidence is rapidly increasing in the United States with an incidence in children and adolescents that exceeds  $15\%$  and in adults that is up to  $40\%$ . Clinically, obesity is associated with several diseases, including type II diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Physiologically, the metabolic rate is proportional to body weight, resulting in an increased  $\mathrm{O}_2$  demand and increased  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  production and alveolar ventilation. Anatomically, obesity is associated with restrictive lung disease, secondary to (1) decreased chest wall compliance (which increases the work of breathing) and (2) decreased lung volumes of which the cephalad displacement of the diaphragm contributes. This is exacerbated by reclining the patient. The obese patient's functional residual capacity (FRC) may fall below the closing capacity leading to alveolar collapse and a resultant ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Obesity is associated with relative hypoxemia and occasionally hypercapnia.

Several considerations are necessary when determining the anesthetic plan for the obese patient. The obese patient is up to four times more likely to develop intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications. Airway maintenance may be more difficult. There is a decrease in cervical and mandibular range of motion and an excess of lateral pharyngeal fat, and the airway is more likely to collapse. Intraoperatively, a relatively high  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  may be needed, while limiting respiratory depressant use. It is controversial if obesity is associated with increased difficulty in intubation. Recent literature has negated the concept of increased gastric content and decreased pH in the obese patient; however, difficult airway management may increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Establishing venous access to administer intravenous drugs may also be more difficult. When administering intravenous agents there is an

increased volume of distribution of lipid-soluble drugs. Understanding the alteration in the pharmacokinetics in obesity is critical as it will impact the dosage administered and the duration of the effect on the patient. For midazolam and fentanyl, the loading dose is determined by the total body weight, and the maintenance dose is determined by the patient's ideal body weight. Recovery from the drug is also affected. Because of the increased volume of distribution, the terminal elimination half-life of the drug is greater. For midazolam, this can result in an elimination half-life that is up to three times longer in the obese patient compared to the ideal body weight patient. A propofol (sedative) infusion may be a good choice for the obese patient, as it has been shown not to accumulate [10]. The loading dose has been reported to be calculated based on ideal body weight plus 0.4 times total body weight with a maintenance infusion based on total body weight. Ketamine is another agent which has become popular in office-based anesthesia. The administration of this agent is based on ideal body weight.

There is a higher incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the obese patient. It is estimated that OSA is undiagnosed in  $80\%$  of patients who have the condition. There are various assessment tools that may aid the practitioner in identifying the patient with obstructive sleep apnea. The STOP-Bang scoring model consists of a combination of four subjective and four objective data points presented in Table 4.3 [11].

Table 4.3 STOP-Bang  

<table><tr><td>Snoring</td><td>Do you snore loudly?</td></tr><tr><td>Tired</td><td>Do you feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during daytime?</td></tr><tr><td>Observed</td><td>Has anybody observed you stop breathing during your sleep?</td></tr><tr><td>Blood Pressure</td><td>Do you have or have you been treated for high blood pressure?</td></tr><tr><td>BMI</td><td>&gt;35 kg/m2</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>&gt;50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Neck circumfer-ence</td><td>&gt;40 cm</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr></table>

This easily completed survey is reported to have a sensitivity of  $83.6\%$  for identifying mild OSA,  $100\%$  sensitivity for identifying severe OSA, and a negative predictive value of  $90\%$ . Identifying the patient with obstructive sleep apnea is critical as it can be associated with adverse complications which may extend into the postoperative period. The ASA guidelines suggest that the "OSA patient be monitored for a median of three hours longer than their non-OSA counterparts before discharge from the facility." Further discussion is warranted. A recent publication sought to identify patients who would be at risk for postoperative problems. These authors screened patients preoperatively using various parameters including neck circumference and snoring for sleep apnea. Critical to the management of the patients was a postoperative observation period of  $90\mathrm{min}$  (three 30-min intervals) in which the patient was monitored for apnea, bradypnea, desaturations, and pain-sedation mismatch. If the patient had any of these findings in at least two of the three 30-min intervals, they had an incidence of postoperative problems over the next  $48\mathrm{h}$  up to  $33\%$ . If the patient was without any adverse events in only one or none of the 30-min intervals, the incidence of a postoperative problem over the next  $48\mathrm{h}$  was as low as  $1\%$  for the patient with a low sleep apnea score and up to  $2\%$  for the patient with a high sleep apnea score [12].

# 4.4.5 Nil Per Os (NPO)

The basic premise of preoperative fasting is to minimize the volume and the acidity of the residual gastric volume which if regurgitated and aspirated during anesthesia can result in laryngospasm, airway obstruction, and/or pulmonary aspiration. Establishing parameters that minimize the risk of particulate gastric contents as well as decrease the quantity and acidity  $(\mathrm{pH} < 2.5)$  of residual gastric fluids can decrease the incidence of this morbidity.

A basic knowledge of gastric emptying times facilitates an understanding of these modifications. Gastric emptying for solid food is variable. A surgeon should be aware that approximately  $50\%$  of the contents of an ingested solid meal will have remained in the stomach after  $2\mathrm{h}$ . A 6- to 8-h fast from solids is recommended to allow gastric emptying and minimize the risk of particulate aspiration. Eight hours remains the recommended minimum interval for "fatty" foods. Alternatively, gastric emptying time for clear liquids is approximately  $10 - 15\mathrm{min}$ . After a 1-h fast of clear liquids, approximately  $80\%$  of the consumed liquid is usually absorbed from the stomach. Numerous studies have shown that consumption of unlimited volumes of clear liquids by patients up to  $2\mathrm{h}$  prior to surgery does not significantly

increase the quantity of gastric volume or gastric acidity [13, 14]. Guidelines have thus been established for healthy patients that allow unlimited amounts of clear liquids to be consumed up to  $2 - 3\mathrm{h}$  prior to surgery. This recommendation avoids the need for an extended fast. While beneficial in the adult the ability to allow fluids up to  $2 - 3\mathrm{h}$  prior to the anesthetic is very beneficial in the pediatric patient because it can minimize patient irritability and discomfort and can decrease the incidence of hypotension secondary to dehydration. For the pediatric patient, it still may be simplest to state that the patient should have nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight and to schedule the procedure as the first case in the morning. Patients who are scheduled in the afternoon may have a light breakfast at least  $6\mathrm{h}$  prior to the surgery.

A preoperative evaluation assessing for comorbidities may result in a modification of the general guidelines of  $2\mathrm{h}$  NPO for clear liquids and  $6\mathrm{h}$  NPO for a "light meal." There are numerous situations that may delay gastric emptying: high sympathetic tone because of pain and anxiety, opioid use, cigarette smoking, cannabinoids, and functional dyspepsia.

# 4.4.5.1 Emergency Treatment: Full Stomach

Patients may present to the office or emergency room requiring urgent care. The injury or the patient's ability to cooperate may be such that the necessary treatment cannot be completed on the patient while he or she is awake and non-medicated, even though the patient is not NPO. The duration between the last food ingestion and the injury is the critical time period that is important in assessing a patient's risk of gastric aspiration. Each patient and situation must be assessed individually. If sedation or general anesthesia is required, patient management may necessitate the placement of an endotracheal tube to minimize the risk of gastric aspiration.

The following interventions may minimize the risk of aspiration and/or the ensuing injury that may result from gastric aspiration: rapid sequence induction, sustained cricoid pressure until completion of the intubation, an  $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  antagonist to decrease gastric acidity, a clear antacid such as sodium citrate to decrease gastric acidity, and metoclopramide to promote gastric emptying and increase the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter.

# 4.4.6 Pregnancy Testing

Because of the severity of the potential consequences of anesthetizing a pregnant patient, it is important to reliably detect a pregnancy. An accurate and reliable history in the educated patient can be an effective tool to identify this possibility [15]. Typically this entails asking

female patients about their last menstrual cycle and whether they are pregnant or could be pregnant. The inquiry must be made to all females of child bearing age as the incidence of pregnancy detected by routine universal testing in the ambulatory surgical adolescent between 12 and 21 years of age has been reported to be approximately  $0.5\%$  [16]. Assessment must be tactfully done when working with an adolescent as patients in this age group may not provide an accurate history, especially in the presence of their family.

Routine pregnancy testing is done in some hospitals but is generally not the standard of care in oral and maxillofacial practices. If routine testing is implemented, there is the potential for a false-positive test result, which may have significant emotional consequences. The issue remains controversial.

# 4.4.7 Substances

Substance abuse is a problem affecting all ages. In 2016, 48.5 million persons in the United States, or  $18.0\%$  of persons aged 12 years and older, admitted to illicit drug use, including prescription opioids. The prevalence of illicit drug use in 2016 included  $13.9\%$  for marijuana,  $0.4\%$  for heroin,  $1.9\%$  for cocaine, and  $0.5\%$  for methamphetamine, while  $4.3\%$  of patients abused prescription pain relievers. An adequate history taking prior to anesthesia regarding substance use and abuse is therefore mandatory with all patients. This history allows for a safer selection of anesthetic agents and improved management of any perioperative complications.

# 4.4.7.1 Opioids

Opioid abuse is a global epidemic. In 2015, in the United States, 76,425 nonfatal opioid overdoses requiring hospitalization were reported, while 42,249 overdose deaths were associated with prescription or illicit opioid use, with illicit fentanyl responsible for 19,413 deaths. The oral and maxillofacial surgeon must be cognizant of the potential for opioid abuse amongst their patients. When prescribing opioids for postoperative analgesia, approximately  $21 - 29\%$  of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse, and approximately  $80\%$  of people who use heroin first misused prescription opioids [17, 18]. Schroeder et al. found that when prescribed following third molar removal, opioid prescriptions in opioid-naive adolescents and young adults, compared with age- and sex-matched controls, were associated with a statistically significant  $6.8\%$  absolute risk increase in persistent opioid use and a  $5.4\%$  increase in the subsequent diagnosis of opioid abuse [19].

# 4.4.7.2 Anesthesia for Addicted Patients [20]

When considering the anesthetic management of an opioid-dependent patient, the anesthetic plan depends upon the planned procedure and clinical presentation [21]. Opioids and non-opioids should likely be included in a comprehensive analgesic plan, with the choice of anesthesia being unlikely to influence the addiction. The surgeon-anesthetist should attempt to maintain appropriate plasma level of opioids in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms, which can present as tachycardia, hypertension, and profuse perspiration, both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Remifentanil infusion is associated with development of tolerance and of hyperalgesia in the opioid-addicted patient [22].

Postoperatively, similar strategies should be continued with an emphasis on maintaining substitution to stabilize dependence and prevent withdrawal, supplemented by an approach to analgesia that meets the needs of the procedure and the patient. The emergence phase should be stress-free and so antidotes such as naloxone and flumazenil should not be given otherwise indicated. A strategy involving co-analgesics is critical in the treatment of opioid- addicted patients. A wide variety of drugs have been considered, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen, clonidine, ketamine, and tricyclic antidepressants. The anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin can play a key role in both perioperative pain treatment and the prevention of chronic persistent pain. Both substances have an analgesic and anxiolytic effect, which can be useful [23]. Benzodiazepines should be avoided wherever possible because of their high potential for addiction.

# 4.4.7.3 Marijuana

Marijuana is the most commonly used non-alcohol illicit drug. Approximately  $56\%$  of current illicit drug users consumed only marijuana,  $20\%$  used marijuana and another illicit drug, and the remaining  $24\%$  used an illicit drug but not marijuana in the past month. Patients who use marijuana may present with anxiety, panic attacks, and sympathetic discharge. Although marijuana may affect many different systems, its effects on the respiratory, cardiac, and central nervous systems are the most important [24]. Smoked marijuana produces the same damage to the respiratory mucosa as that produced by tobacco [25]. Potential upper airway irritability, edema and obstruction, chronic cough, bronchitis, emphysema, and bronchospasm are all to be expected in a regular marijuana smoker [26]. Cases of laryngosparms within  $36\mathrm{h}$  of its use have been reported [27]. A  $\beta_{2}$ -adrenergic agonist such as albuterol may be considered to treat this increased airway reactivity.

Acute marijuana use in low doses is associated with tachycardia and hypertension, which can last for up to  $3\mathrm{h}$ , and is associated with a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking marijuana has been reported. This adverse effect may be due to the increased heart rate as well as the induced dysrhythmias [28, 29]. Myocardial depression can occur, and the threshold for sympathomimetic-induced dysrhythmias is lowered. Bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension are usually found with chronic use and high doses [25]. Supraventricular or ventricular ectopic activity has been reported with marijuana use, together with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.

Marijuana is mainly metabolized by the liver and several drug interactions are possible with its specific enzymatic activities [CYP3A4 - fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine; CYP2C9 - warfarin, clopidogrel, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)]. Varying clinical effects are possible with these drug interactions, including both increases and decreases in hepatic metabolism. Marijuana increases the sedative effects of alcohol, hypnotics, or benzodiazepines while potentiating opioid-induced respiratory depression.

# 4.4.7.4 Alcohol

Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused substance (including teenagers). Most alcohol use by US teenagers is in the form of binge drinking. Most long-term systemic effects of chronic alcohol abuse, including hepatic injury, pancytopenia, and the neurotoxic effects (seizures, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), are not present in the pre-adult abuser. Nonetheless, laboratory examinations may reveal elevation of  $\gamma$ -glutamyltransferase (GGT), which is usually the first liver enzyme to increase as a result of heavy ethanol ingestion. Hepatic damage owing to alcohol frequently results in an aspartate transaminase-to-alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio  $>1$ . A mean corpuscular volume  $>100$  is a strong confirmatory evidence of alcoholism. Aspiration risk is significantly increased in the chronic alcoholic as alcohol stimulates gastric acid secretion and delays gastric emptying time. In addition, the alcoholic patient may consume alcohol the morning of the procedure to quell the signs of withdrawal, thus negating the NPO status. Cardiovascular changes associated with chronic alcohol abuse result in alcoholic cardiomyopathy, with resultant tachycardia and unexplained atrial or ventricular ectopy. Alcohol abuse influences the choice of anesthetic agents used in an outpatient setting. Tolerance to anesthetic agents appears to develop in the chronic alcoholic. Altered liver function results in an increased toxicity with anesthetic agents that undergo hepatic metabolism. Prolonged activity and increased serum levels of both succinylcholine and

local anesthetic agents are the result of decreased activity of plasma cholinesterase. Nondepolarizing paralytics are also prolonged in chronic alcohol abuse secondary to an increased level of acetylcholine. Intravenous agents should also include a benzodiazepine that compensates for the lack of  $\gamma$ -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic stimulation.

# 4.4.7.5 Amphetamine

Amphetamine, a racemic mixture of  $\beta$ -phenylisopropylamine, is an indirect sympathomimetic drug. It is a powerful CNS stimulant with peripheral  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ -actions. The CNS mechanism of amphetamine appears dependent on the local release of biogenic amines such as norepinephrine from storage sites in nerve terminals. Acute amphetamine use dramatically increases anesthetic requirement and has been implicated in a case of severe intraoperative intracranial hypertension [30, 31]. Chronic amphetamine use is associated with a markedly diminished anesthetic requirement [32]. This results from chronic stimulation of adrenergic nerve terminals in the peripheral nervous system and CNS that depletes CNS catecholamines. Refractory hypotension can result both intra- and postoperatively, requiring prompt pharmacologic intervention. There can be a diminished pressor response to ephedrine after chronic amphetamine use. This is due to catecholamine depletion in central and peripheral adrenergic neurons.

# 4.4.7.6 Cocaine

Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the leaves of a South American shrub. The drug is snorted (intranasal), injected (intravenous), or smoked (inhaled). Its administration provides an intense euphoria. The medical effects from cocaine result from both acute intoxication and chronic use. CNS stimulation, hypervigilance, anxiety, and agitation are common in the acutely intoxicated individual. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, and ischemia. Ischemic myocardial injury may occur, even in the young patient. These effects result from the inhibition of neural reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and tryptophan; increased adrenergic activity; and blockade of the sodium conduction channels. Chronic cocaine abuse has been associated with ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial depression, and cardiomyopathy. Long-term use may also lead to contraction band necrosis. This phenomenon is associated with hypermetabolic conditions, such as cocaine abuse, hyperthyroidism, and pheochromocytoma resulting from continuous catecholamine concentration elevation. This condition predisposes the patient to dysrhythmias [33]. Patients may also manifest neurologic effects. A decrease in seizure threshold has been demonstrated in young adults. Ischemic cerebral vascu

lar accidents may result from the hypertensive crisis potentiated by the cerebral vasoconstriction resulting from the increased serotonin levels. Respiratory complications associated with intranasal administration include sneezing, sniffing, and acute rhinitis. Pulmonary complications associated with inhalational administration include cocaine-induced asthma, chronic cough, pulmonary edema, and pneumopericardium. Acute intoxication may result in hypoxia owing to pulmonary vasculature vasoconstriction. High levels of cocaine may persist for  $6\mathrm{h}$  after nasal administration. Elective anesthetic management should be deferred for at least  $24\mathrm{h}$  after the patient has last used cocaine. Electrocardiographic monitoring is recommended in all patients owing to the potential for silent ischemia and arrhythmias. Anesthetic management may include control of preoperative anxiety with benzodiazepines. Consideration should be given to avoid adrenergic stimulants such as ketamine and epinephrine-containing local anesthetics.

# 4.4.7.7 "Ecstasy"

Ecstasy-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) – is a stimulant that has psychedelic effects that can last for 4–6 h and is usually taken orally in pill form. The psychological effects of MDMA include confusion, depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, drug craving, and paranoia. Adverse physical effects include muscle tension, involuntary teeth clenching, nausea, blurred vision, feeling faint, tremors, rapid eye movement, and sweating or chills. There is also an added risk involved with MDMA ingestion by people with circulatory problems or heart disease because of MDMA's ability to increase heart rate and blood pressure. The principle constituent of ecstasy (MDMA) can produce robust deleterious effects on serotonergic functioning in animals, including serotonin depletion and the degeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals [34]. Although MDMA has been characterized as a hallucinogenic amphetamine because of its structural similarity to mescaline and amphetamine, it rarely induces hallucinatory experiences, nor is it as potent a psychostimulant as amphetamine. Whether neurotoxicity also occurs in humans is unknown, but emerging evidence indicates that repeated ecstasy exposure results in performance decrements in neurocognitive function, which may be a manifestation of neurotoxicity.

Most ecstasy tablets contain MDMA; other commonly identified ingredients include ketamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, amphetamine, dextromethorphan, and combinations of these drugs. Some tablets contain inert ingredients, whereas others contain phencyclidine hydrochloride (PCP).

Perioperative management may involve addressing several complications, the most common being syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and hyperthermia. Other less common but well-known potential complications include tachycardia, agitation, and nausea and vomiting. Monitoring for the stigmata of hyponatremia and hyperthermia supplements a well-performed preoperative history to determine which patients are at risk.

# 4.4.7.8 Inhalational Substances

Inhalation substance abuse is a problem usually associated with young patients including preteens. The 1997 Monitoring the Future nationwide survey reported that inhalant use is most common in the eighth grade, in which  $5.6\%$  of students used inhalants on a past-month basis and  $11.8\%$  on a past-year basis [35]. They may present with photophobia, eye irritation, diplopia, tinnitus, sneezing, anorexia, chest pain, and dysrhythmia. Before administering anesthesia, one must take into consideration hepatic, renal, bone marrow, and other organ pathology caused by halogenated and impure chemicals.

# 4.4.7.9 Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)

LSD, also known as "acid," is odorless and colorless, has a slightly bitter taste, and is usually taken by mouth. Often LSD is added to absorbent paper such as blotter paper and divided into small decorated squares, with each square representing one dose. The effects of LSD are unpredictable. They depend on the amount taken; the user's personality, mood, and expectations; and the surroundings in which the drug is used. Usually the user feels the first effects of the drug  $30 - 90\mathrm{min}$  after taking it. Physical manifestations include mydriasis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, anorexia, and tremors. Extreme emotional variability may occur, with extreme delusions and visual hallucinations. LSD effects are prolonged, typically lasting for  $>12\mathrm{h}$ . "Flashbacks" with auditory and visual hallucinations may recur suddenly without reuse of the drug and may occur within a few days or more than a year after LSD use. Flashbacks usually occur in people who have used hallucinogens chronically or who have an underlying personality problem. However, otherwise healthy people who use LSD may also experience flashbacks. Long-term effects of chronic LSD include psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, severe depression). It is difficult to determine the extent and mechanism of the LSD involvement in these illnesses. Perioperative anesthetic practice involves recognition of the potential psychiatric effects of LSD on patients and avoidance of potentially aggravating agents.

# 4.4.7.10 PCP

PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that originally was synthesized for intravenous use. Because of its postoperative emergence reactions (i.e., hallucinations, prolonged abnormal level of consciousness, agitation), it fell out of favor, and its use as an anesthetic in humans was discontinued in 1963. PCP subsequently emerged as an oral drug of abuse. PCP is a commonly abused street drug that is sold under many different names and in various forms. It may be sold on the street in tablet or capsule form, as a powder, or as a solution. The PCP content in each form differs widely, commonly from  $10\%$  to  $30\%$ . "Angel dust," the powdered form of PCP, generally has a higher PCP content, occasionally reaching  $100\%$ . Angel dust may be sniffed, smoked, ingested, or injected intravenously. Percutaneous absorption also has been reported to occur in individuals handling PCP (e.g., law enforcement officers). Smoking remains the desired method of use; the substance commonly is sprinkled onto dried leaf material (e.g., marijuana, tobacco, oregano, mint) and then smoked. Perioperative anesthetic considerations include its sympathomimetic effects, like its congener, ketamine, with the potential for tachycardia, tachyarrhythmias, and a true hypertensive emergency. Maintaining normotension and avoiding sympathomimetics, which may exacerbate PCP's effects, are the standard for anesthetic management.

# 4.5 Patient Assessment: Understanding the Changes with Age

The purpose of a preoperative evaluation is to compile information about the patient to establish the most optimal treatment plan. One needs to assess the psychological and behavioral development of the patient, obtain a medical history that identifies both acute and chronic disease processes, and determine the patient's preparation for surgery (e.g., cardiovascular status), while performing an appropriate physical examination dictated largely by the patient's medical history and age.

# 4.5.1 The Pediatric Patient

The anesthetic management of the pediatric patient presents the oral and maxillofacial surgeon with unique and different challenges from those with an adult patient. The surgeon must be aware of anatomic and physiologic differences, different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of most medications, and the unique psychological development of the child and his or her corresponding ability to cope with the stress of the surgical experience. As the child matures, changes in

these parameters occur; therefore, an understanding of the growth and maturation of the pediatric patient dictates the selection of the anesthetic technique and medications used in the patient's management.

# 4.5.2 Anatomic Considerations in the Pediatric Patient

# 4.5.2.1 Pediatric Respiratory System

Much of the uniqueness regarding anesthetic management of children in oral and maxillofacial surgery is focused on anesthesia delivered during intraoral procedures in which the patient is not intubated. Intraoral surgery in the anesthetized non-intubated patient presents a formidable and unique challenge. The foremost concern is that the surgical site – the oral cavity – is in close proximity to the pharynx, thereby rendering the patient susceptible to airway obstruction and irritation. These factors can result in a significant degree of hypoxia [36]. Such effects can be exacerbated by a decreased minute ventilation and airway tone secondary to sedative medication used during the anesthetic administration.

There are anatomic differences unique to the pediatric upper airway that increase the risk of airway obstruction. In the young child the tongue is large relative to the size of the oral cavity. It is positioned higher in the oral cavity impinging on the soft palate secondary to the rostrally positioned larynx. Lymphoid hypertrophy with enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids between the ages of 4 and 10 years can also contribute to upper airway obstruction.

The lower airway, consisting of the trachea, bronchi, and alveoli, also differs between pediatric and adult patients. The trachea and bronchi are conduits in which gas is transported from the environment to the alveoli. The pediatric airway diameter is relatively smaller than that of the adult. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the lumen to the fourth power, there is an increased resistance. Narrowing of the airway secondary to secretions or edema will have a more profound adverse effect on airway exchange. The pediatric trachea is also more compliant. The increased compliancy makes the airway susceptible to collapse secondary to increased negative inspiratory pressure. This is significant because of the potential for airway obstruction in the non-intubated patient. When patients become obstructed, they attempt to overcome the obstruction by increasing the respiratory effort. In the child an attempt to compensate for upper airway obstruction with increasing respiratory effort can cause collapse of the trachea and bronchial passages, which may paradoxically worsen the obstruction. The frightened child may

already be at risk for airway collapse since crying tends to increase negative inspiratory pressure.

Anatomic differences between pediatric and adult patients diminish the efficacy of ventilation. In the child each rib is angled more horizontally relative to the vertebral column; adults' ribs have a caudal slant. Additionally, the accessory muscles are less developed in the child. This results in a less effective thoracic expansion and a greater dependence on diaphragmatic breathing. Upper airway obstruction in the young child occurring with sedation can result in a paradoxical chest wall movement, characterized by an inward movement of the chest opposing the expansile downward movement of the diaphragm. Greater energy is required, which can lead to fatigue and subsequent hypoxia.

Exchange of gas takes place within the alveoli. Closing volume, which is the volume of the lung at which dependent airways begin to close, is greater in the pediatric patient. The increased closing volume in the pediatric patient results in increased dead space ventilation. Thus, more energy must be expended to adequately ventilate the alveoli. The alveoli are also both smaller and fewer in number in the pediatric patient than in the adult. The alveoli increase in number until around 8 years of life and continue to increase in size until full adult growth is reached. The number of alveoli may increase more than tenfold from infancy to adulthood, with a resultant increase in surface area that can be as great as 60-fold [37].

Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of gas in the lung after a normal expiration and is related to the surface area of the lung. The pediatric patient has a diminished FRC expressed on a basis of weight [38]. This is illustrated by a minute ventilation to FRC ratio of approximately 5:1 in a 3-year-old and 8:1 in a 5-year-old compared to approximately 2:1 in an adult. FRC decreases further in the sedated patient. The FRC provides a pulmonary oxygen reserve. Because children have a higher metabolic demand and greater oxygen consumption, the decreased FRC results in a more rapid desaturation of hemoglobin during periods of respiratory depression. One model comparing the child to the adult concluded that an apneic period of  $41\mathrm{~s}$  in the pediatric patient would result in an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of  $85\%$ , compared with an apneic period of  $84\mathrm{~s}$  in the adult [39].

# Endotracheal Intubation

There are also anatomic differences between the pediatric and adult airways that influence intubation. A large tongue, rostral larynx, and long and narrow epiglottis make laryngoscopy and visualization of the glottic opening more difficult in the pediatric patient. Adenoidal hypertrophy can also result in hemorrhage or obstruc

tion of an endotracheal tube, particularly during nasal intubation.

The narrowest part of the trachea in the pediatric patient is the cricoid cartilage, in contrast with the glottis in the adult. It is not until the age of approximately 10-12 years that the pediatric airway matures to that of the adult. In the pediatric patient care must be taken when placing and securing an endotracheal tube to prevent impingement of the tip of the tube on the narrow subglottic region. Such impingement of the endotracheal tube on the tracheal mucosa can result in edema and tracheal narrowing causing increased airway resistance post-extubation. Uncuffed tubes are used by most anesthesiologists for patients less than 8-10 years of age. The arguments against cuffed tubes are that they increase the risk of airway mucosal injury and that an appropriately sized uncuffed endotracheal tube can provide an adequate seal at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Formulas exist for calculating the appropriate size of endotracheal tube ([age (year)/4] +4) and the appropriate length of endotracheal insertion ([age (year)/2 + 12]) [40]. However,  $28\%$  of the time the initially selected uncuffed endotracheal tube does not provide an adequate seal, and re-intubation may be necessary. An additional benefit in using the uncuffed tube is that a larger tube may be inserted, which causes less airway resistance and less breathing work. The argument for a cuffed endotracheal tube is that the fit can be adjusted, and it can protect against aspiration. Ensuring that the cuff pressure does not exceed  $25\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ , which is believed to be the mucosal capillary pressure, can minimize injury to the mucosa. When using an uncuffed tube, an air leak of  $25\mathrm{cmH_2O}$  should be allowed.

The trachea is also shorter in the pediatric patient. It is not uncommon that head position is frequently changed during an oral and maxillofacial surgery procedure; this can cause the tube to become displaced out of the trachea or pass further into the trachea and impinge on the mucosa overlying the cricoid cartilage. Flexion of the head generally results in caudal movement of the endotracheal tube, while extension of the head causes cephalad movement. Change in head position, use of an endotracheal tube that is too large, and patient age between 1 and 4 years are three factors contributing to the reported  $1\%$  incidence of postintubation croup [41].

Certain congenital anomalies are well recognized for their altered anatomy. Some of the most commonly encountered disorders are Crouzon syndrome (hypoplastic maxilla - obligate mouth breather), Goldenhar's syndrome (micrognathia, vertebral anomalies), hemifacial microsomia (hypoplasia of mandibular condyle and ramus), Möbius sequence (micrognathia and limited mandibular movement), Pierre Robin's anomalad (micrognathia, glossosptosis), and Treacher Collins

syndrome (mandibular hypoplasia). These craniofacial anomalies may complicate ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. For example, maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia may increase the difficulty in achieving a satisfactory mask fit. Anatomic differences in the nasal cavity may impair nasal ventilation. This can potentiate respiratory obstruction during an intraoral procedure in which a pharyngeal curtain is placed and the patient is dependent on nasal respiration. The tongue may be displaced posteriorly by either maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia, increasing the potential for obstruction.

# Upper Respiratory Infection

It is not uncommon for children to present for surgery with a runny nose. Reports of children presenting to surgery with or having recently had such symptoms state incidences as high as  $22.3\%$  and  $45.8\%$ , respectively [42]. Rhinitis is not a contraindication to general anesthesia. Alternatively, a child with a severe upper respiratory infection (URI; symptoms include a productive cough, fever, and mucopurulent discharge) should not be anesthetized. However, it is unclear whether a child with a mild URI or a child recovering from a URI should be anesthetized; therefore, it is important to differentiate between the diagnosis of rhinitis and an infective process.

Pathophysiologic changes in the pulmonary system secondary to a URI include increased nasal and lower airway secretions, increased airway edema and inflammation, and increased airway tachykinins. These pathophysiologic changes can result in laryngospasm, bronchospasm, severe coughing, airway hyperactivity, breath holding, diminished diffusion capacity, increased closing volumes, atelectasis, and postintubation croup. The elevated hyperactivity with associated bronchoconstriction and the increased closing volume compounded by a greater oxygen uptake (secondary to the inflammatory response of the infection) and a decreased FRC (which normally occurs with general anesthesia) increase the risk of hypoxemia [43]. Oxygen desaturation can occur both intraoperatively and postoperatively; the latter indicates the need for continued postoperative monitoring. URIs have also been demonstrated to cause respiratory muscle weakness that can persist for up to 12 days [44]. The pathophysiologic changes that contribute to these adverse respiratory events can persist for 4-6 weeks after the URI.

Traditional office-based ambulatory anesthesia in oral and maxillofacial surgery is dependent on spontaneous ventilation in the non-intubated patient. This is significant since the incidence of adverse respiratory events is less in a patient anesthetized with a face mask or laryngeal mask airway than in those with an endo

tracheal tube. However, surgery involving the airway has been shown to increase the risk of adverse respiratory events. Although intraoral surgery is not truly airway surgery, it encroaches on the airway and can cause airway irritability. The non-intubated patient undergoing oral or maxillofacial surgery is also susceptible to periods of hypoventilation and apnea, which cannot be corrected without interrupting the surgery. Kinouchi and colleagues demonstrated that a patient with an active or recent URI requires approximately  $30\%$  less apneic time to desaturate than does a healthy patient [45].

In conclusion, the patient who presents for elective surgery with allergic rhinitis or a mild URI that is not of acute onset may be anesthetized in the office without an endotracheal tube. If the patient has a significant URI, the procedure should be rescheduled. Traditional guidelines suggest that the procedure should be rescheduled for 4-6 weeks later if the patient is to be intubated, but because many children have several URIs per year, trying to reschedule the surgery for a date when the child is without symptoms may be difficult [46]. Considering the above, a delay of 2 weeks is probably acceptable before performing a short office-based minor dentoalveolar procedure in which the patient is not intubated.

# 4.5.2.2 Pediatric Cardiovascular System

The pediatric cardiovascular system has some significant differences compared with that of the adult. Each relevant physiologic difference is outlined below.

# Cardiac Output

Perfusion is dependent on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Cardiac output is dependent on heart rate and stroke volume. The pediatric heart has less compliance than that of the adult, with minimal ability to alter stroke volume. Thus, pediatric cardiac output is largely dependent on heart rate (Table 4.4).

Table 4.4 Means and Ranges of Normal Cardiovascular Function  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Function</td><td colspan="3">AGE (YR)</td></tr><tr><td>2-6</td><td>7-13</td><td>14-18</td></tr><tr><td>Heart rate (bpm)</td><td>100 (80-120)</td><td>90 (70-110)</td><td>80 (55-95)</td></tr><tr><td>Systemic arterial pressure (mmHg)</td><td>75-115/50-75</td><td>95-125/60-80</td><td>105-140/65-85</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiac output (mL/kg/min)</td><td>150-170</td><td>100-140</td><td>90-115</td></tr></table>

# Neural Innervation

The myocardium is innervated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, with the parasympathetic nervous system having a greater influence in the pediatric patient than in the adult. In one retrospective study the incidence of bradycardia during anesthesia was reported to be age related. The incidence of bradycardia was approximately threefold less in the 3- to 4-year-old compared with the 2- to 3-year-old [47].

# Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is the product of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. The pediatric patient has less ability to alter peripheral vascular resistance; therefore, blood pressure is largely dependent on cardiac output. A bradycardia with resultant decreased cardiac output thus results in a decrease in blood pressure since the child cannot compensate by increasing peripheral vascular resistance.

# Important

These fundamental concepts clearly illustrate the increased potential risks associated with sedating the pediatric patient:

The airway is more susceptible to obstruction, and the patient has less ventilatory reserve; these result in a more rapid oxygen desaturation (and hypoxia causes bradycardia).  
The pediatric patient has increased parasympathetic innervation, resulting in a more rapid onset of bradycardia (which may be influenced indirectly by respiratory impairment or directly by the sedative drugs).  
There is less cardiovascular compensatory ability, which results in hemodynamic instability.

# 4.5.2.3 Psychological Assessment

The perioperative period can be very stressful for a child. The child is confronted with an unfamiliar environment, unfamiliar people, apprehension about the unknown, and loss of control. The child fears separation from the parents, the threat of needles, the perception of impending pain, and the fear of mutilation. Younger children frequently cannot verbalize these concerns. Behavioral manifestations of perioperative anxiety may include hyperventilation, trembling, crying, agitation, and/or physical resistance. Children  $< 6$  years of age frequently cannot comprehend the need for or benefits of the surgical procedure. Children  $>6$  years of age or those who have better-developed social skills (e.g., acquired from daycare programs) may be more capable of understanding the situation and expressing their concerns. If possible, an older child should be allowed to participate in

determining the anesthetic treatment and should be exposed to the various induction techniques: intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and inhalation.

Adolescents may be more capable of comprehending the planned surgery and anesthetic management. However, they are not adults. They have the ability to demonstrate myriad behaviors and rapid mood changes. A paradoxical reaction to sedation in which the adolescent appears to become agitated after the administration of anxiolytic medication may necessitate a deeper level of anesthesia than what may have originally been planned. Another concern in the adolescent patient is the use of illicit substances. This has reached epidemic proportions with an estimated  $10.8\%$  of 12- to 17-year-old youths reported to be current illicit drug users in 2001 [48].

The presence of parents during the administration of the sedative agent may reduce the stress of the procedure and improve the child's cooperation. Conversely, a parent's anxiety may be sensed by the child, further exacerbating the child's own level of anxiety. Clear, simple, and succinct explanations appropriate for the age of the child may minimize adverse behavior.

# 4.5.3 The Geriatric Patient

The number of elderly patients is increasing as defined by chronologic age. From a chronologic perspective, older adults have been classified as young to old (65-74 years), mid to old (75-84 years) and the oldest to old (85 years and above) [49]. This grouping is supposed to indicate increased risk amongst the oldest to old. It is founded on the principle that intrinsic biologic or physiologic aging results in a progressive impairment of function that occurs essentially in every organ system with age. This impairment results in diminished reserves. The diminished reserves may not be manifested under normal circumstances. However, under stressful conditions, which may occur during surgery and anesthesia, the diminished reserves may prevent a compensatory response. Therefore, chronologic age may suggest an increased vulnerability.

Chronologic age as a determinant of anesthetic risk, however, is limited as many older healthy patients may do better than a younger counterpart who is in poor health with chronic disease. This heterogeneity amongst individuals is because chronologic age does not take into consideration that many individuals have comorbidities. With age, individuals develop chronic disease and various health habits (e.g., smoking). There are certain diseases that become more prevalent with age. These chronic diseases and extrinsic factors also contribute to diminished reserves in older adults. Each component of

the aging process is not independent of the other. Physiologic aging may hasten the progression of the chronic disease and the chronic disease may hasten the physiologic aging. The presence and number of coexisting diseases, and their severity, are better predictors of adverse outcome rather than age alone [50, 51].

Surgical morbidity and mortality in the geriatric patient also varies widely depending on surgical procedure. Emergency surgery, major vascular surgery, and surgery with significant blood loss or fluid shifts are associated with increased risk. Office-based dentoalveolar surgery is categorized as low risk by the current guidelines for the cardiovascular evaluation of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [52].

# 4.5.3.1 Cardiovascular

The surgeon must be cognizant of both alterations in anatomy and physiologic function, as well as the pathogenic age-related diseases that affect the cardiovascular system [53]. There is a higher prevalence of pathogenic age-related cardiovascular diseases in the geriatric patient such as coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarct, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation). Of these, a history of congestive heart failure is associated with the highest incidence of perioperative complications. The surgeon must appreciate the physiologic changes associated with each disease and the impact that it may have on anesthetic management. For example, tachycardia, which increases the work of the heart and decreases oxygen delivery, may be secondary to anxiety (inadequate anxiolysis) or an adverse drug effect (e.g., epinephrine in the local anesthesia or a sympathomimetic effect of ketamine). Selected drugs may require modified doses or be contraindicated because of underlying diseases. Pathogenic age-related diseases will be discussed in more detail in the  $\triangleright$  Chap. 2.

This section will focus on changes associated with aging. With aging, there is a decrease in the distensibility of the aorta and systemic arteries. The reduced vascular elasticity results in an increase in systolic blood pressure, increase in afterload, and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is a decline in autonomic function and the patient has a diminished heart rate response. There is also a diminished ability to increase ejection fraction in response to stress. This is partially secondary to the ventricular filling being more dependent on atrial contribution. The decrease in compliance of the capacitance vessels, a contracted intravascular volume, and diminished autonomic function can contribute to intraoperative blood pressure lability. Decreased cardiac output also contributes to a decrease in the delivery of drug. Clinically this results in a slower onset of the drug's effect and a slower redistribution.

# 4.5.3.2 Pulmonary

Pathogenic age-related diseases or habits also affect the respiratory system of the geriatric patient. Common comorbid conditions which are more prevalent in the geriatric patient include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking, and Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease has several clinical manifestations. One component is an impaired cough reflex and dysphagia, which increases the risk of aspiration. Functional changes of the respiratory system with aging include the conducting airways, the pulmonary mechanics, the lung parenchyma, gas exchange, and control of ventilation.

The functional changes of the respiratory system have several potential implications on the anesthetic management of the geriatric patient. The geriatric patient has decreased pharyngeal muscular support and the integrity of the upper airway from the nose to the trachea is predisposed to obstruction. Opening and/or maintaining the airway, which is frequently achieved with neck extension, can be limited due to cervical arthritis. The geriatric patient is at increased risk for aspiration. Several factors contribute to this. There is an increased incidence of regurgitation secondary to a depressed lower esophageal sphincter tone and diminished gastric emptying time [54]. The protective laryngeal reflexes are diminished requiring a greater stimulation to trigger a response, and the patient has a decreased cough reflex [55]. A decreased number and activity of respiratory cilia additionally compromise the ability to maintain airway protection [56].

As the patient ages there are changes in chest wall mechanics. Calcified articulations of the costal cartilage, sternum, rib, and vertebrae result in a progressive decrease in compliance. There is also a narrowing of the intervertebral disc space and vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis which both decrease chest wall compliance and flatten the diaphragm. Muscle contraction is less efficient with a flattened diaphragm. This is compounded by a decrease in respiratory muscle strength with age, which is further reduced with malnutrition. When comparing the healthy geriatric and young adult male patient, the diaphragm strength is reduced by about  $25\%$  [57]. The effect is up to a  $30\%$  increase in an effort to expand the lungs in a 60-year-old compared to a 20-year-old [58].

Structural changes occur in the alveolus to impede efficient gas exchange. The alveolar surface area decreases  $15\%$  by age 70 [59]. Changes in the elastic recoil forces in the lung parenchyma result in an increase in closing volume which produces air trapping and  $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{Q}$  mismatches. The net effect is a progressive decrease in arterial oxygen with age.

Ventilation is controlled centrally in the brain stem and peripherally within the carotid and aortic bodies.

Physiologic changes occur with aging that decrease their sensitivity and responsiveness. The geriatric patient has an impaired response to hypoxia and hypercarbia. This decreased sensitivity is associated with irregular breathing patterns and apneic spells, which may occur even during sleep. Exaggerated responses may occur with anesthetic agents [60].

# 4.5.3.3 Urinary and Hepatic System

The renal and hepatic systems have functional decline in the geriatric patient. These changes in turn impact the bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects of the anesthetic drugs.

Many drugs are bound to plasma proteins produced by the liver. For example, acidic drugs such as diazepam are highly bound to plasma proteins (e.g., albumin). An alteration in plasma protein concentrations results in a change of the percentage of bound versus free drug. Structural changes may occur in the proteins that reduce their efficiency to bind drugs. An increase in the amount of free drug may result in an increase in pharmacologic effect. This initial effect may be offset by the increased amount of free drug in the plasma which is available to be cleared.

The liver is also involved in the metabolism of drugs. The hepatic metabolism of drugs is classified as phase 1 or phase 2. Phase 1 drug metabolism is achieved by oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis reactions. It occurs within the liver utilizing what is referred to as the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. Phase 2 drug metabolism is achieved by conjugation and acetylation reactions. Phase 1 drug metabolism has been reported to decline with age; however, this is controversial, and some studies have shown no alteration in the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system [61]. The dysfunction however, may be more related to comorbidities, such as tobacco, alcohol, sedentary, or environmental factors. These factors may contribute to the variability of hepatic metabolism in the elderly patient rather than parenchymal changes in the liver. Phase 2 drug metabolism is felt to be unaltered with age.

Clearance of drugs is also affected by hepatic blood flow. This is dependent on the ability of the liver to remove a drug. Drugs that are removed rapidly by the liver or those which are classified as having a high extraction ratio are removed by the liver at a rate comparable to hepatic blood flow. Drugs that are removed slowly by the liver or those which are classified as having a low extraction ratio have their removal influenced more by intrinsic factors within the liver. With aging there is a decline in liver blood flow, such that by the age of 65 years the reduction in hepatic blood flow approximates  $40\%$  of what it is in an individual 25 years of age [62]. Disease states that alter hepatic blood flow, such as

congestive heart failure, will also affect hepatic drug clearance. Therefore, drugs which have a high hepatic extraction ratio will have a reduction in clearance and those with a low hepatic extraction ratio will not have a decrease in clearance secondary to a decrease in hepatic blood flow. Drugs common to office-based anesthetic practice which have a high extraction ratio include fentanyl, meperidine, ketamine, and propofol, those which have an intermediate hepatic extraction ratio include morphine and triazolam, and those which have a low extraction hepatic extraction ratio include diazepam.

There is about a  $1 - 2\%$  decline in blood flow to the kidney per year of age and a significant loss of functional nephrons. By the age of 70 years, a patient may have a  $50\%$  reduction in renal function [63]. Several drugs have active metabolites that are eliminated by the kidneys. These drugs may have prolonged duration in the elderly.

# 4.6 Anesthetic Concepts

# 4.6.1 Monitoring

Monitoring is defined as a continuous observation of data to evaluate physiologic function. The rationale for such is to permit prompt recognition of a deprivation from normal so that corrective therapy can be implemented before morbidity ensues. Various professional organizations have established guidelines for anesthetic monitoring. Standard parameters which are monitored during office-based anesthesia in the oral and maxillofacial surgeon's office include respiratory and cardiovascular function and depth of sedation.

# 4.6.1.1 Respiratory Monitoring

The role of respiratory monitoring is to maintain arterial oxygenation and adequacy of ventilation. Arterial oxygenation monitoring is not readily available, so instead arterial oxygenation is inferred by monitoring oxyhemoglobin saturation using pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry is highly accurate and provides a continuous account of peripheral arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation. The device is capable of rapidly detecting changes in oxyhemoglobin saturation. While the device will rapidly detect changes, there are limitations to its rapidity in detecting clinical changes. Most anesthesiologists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons place the oximetry probe on the finger. The circulation of blood from the pulmonary system to the finger where the probe is located takes a finite time. This circulatory time results in an approximately 25-35-s delay in the monitor alerting the anesthetic team to the physiologic changes that may have occurred within the central circulation. The

delay is longer in patients who have slower circulation, such as the geriatric patient.

The relationship between oxyhemoglobin saturation and  $\mathrm{PaO}_2$  also limits the efficacy of pulse oximetry. The following will provide insight into this limitation. Administration of supplemental oxygen is recommended for minimal, moderate, and deep sedation and general anesthesia. For office-based oral and maxillofacial surgery, oxygen is delivered by either a nasal cannula or nasal hood. An oxygen  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  of 0.4 in a patient with a  $5\%$  shunt should result in a  $\mathrm{PaO}_2$  content of approximately  $180 - 200~\mathrm{mm / Hg}$ . The pulse oximeter monitor will register an oxygen saturation of  $100\%$  for this  $\mathrm{PaO}_2$  content. Anesthetic agents depress respiratory drive and can cause upper airway obstruction resulting in a potential for impaired ventilatory exchange. Because of the horizontal plateau of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, the pulse oximeter will not detect the initial drop in arterial oxygen content until the  $\mathrm{PaO}_2$  sustains a significant decrease from approximately  $180 - 200\mathrm{mmHg}$  to approximately  $100\mathrm{mmHg}$ . This point should not negate the importance and benefit that pulse oximetry provides but serve to emphasize that it is not the sole component of respiratory monitoring that is critical for the care of the patient.

Ventilatory monitoring is the other component of respiratory monitoring. Monitoring of ventilations can be accomplished with observation, auscultation of breath sounds (typically with a pretracheal stethoscope), plethysmography, and/or capnography. While each of these has their benefit, it is the author's opinion that the combination of auscultation and capnography should be routine instrumentation. The pretracheal stethoscope consists of a weighted stethoscope bell, conducting tubing, and a customized mono-aural earpiece. A wireless modification of the stethoscope allows more than one person to monitor the volume-controlled breath sounds, providing amplification when necessary. The wireless technology also allows the breath sounds to be broadcast on a speaker which permits all involved in the surgery to be cognizant and participate in monitoring the patient's breathing. Auscultation of breath sounds allows the practitioner to monitor respiratory rate and the character of the air exchange (e.g., differentiating between normal unobstructed air exchange, partial obstruction, bronchospasm) while simultaneously assessing for the presence of foreign debris (e.g., blood, secretions, or irrigation fluids) in the airway.

Capnographic monitoring consists of capnography and capnometry. End-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sampling can be achieved in a non-intubated patient (open system) using a nasal cannula (in which one prong delivers oxygen and the other prong samples end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) or inserting a sampling tube into a nasal hood (which is used to

administer an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture). Capnometry is the numerical measurement of end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . In the open system there is moderate potential for dilution of the gases resulting in an artifactual decrease in end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  values. Alternatively, elevated end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  values should be noted, and appropriate action taken based on the practitioner's interpretation. In the open system capnography provides a visual representation of the patient's ventilatory pattern. This graphic display provides the respiratory rate and a depiction of various respiratory patterns, which may suggest unobstructed ventilations, partial airway obstruction, hypoventilation, bronchospasm, and/or apnea.

Ventilatory monitoring is critical because changes in ventilation are the most likely contributing factor to a decrease in  $\mathrm{PaO}_2$ . Most commonly it is anticipated that the patient's ventilation will be decreased and that with the administration of supplemental oxygen the patient will maintain an adequate  $\mathrm{PaO}_2$  and oxygen saturation. However, ventilatory monitoring provides the practitioner with the information so that the anesthetic team can identify changes in ventilatory pattern (either rate or air exchange) and determine if any action is required. In prior publications and unpublished data (Dembo and Bennett), it was suggested that the use of ventilatory monitoring would have prevented anesthetic morbidity and mortality. Capnography provides a "real-time" assessment of ventilation, permitting the astute clinician to immediately identify developing situations of impaired ventilation and potentially intervene prior to any noted decrease in pulse oximetry measurements.

# 4.6.2 Fluids

Fluid administration provides the ability to correct the preexisting fluid deficit, to replace ongoing fluid losses, and to compensate for perioperative fluid shifts between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. Expansion of the intravascular compartment of the extracellular space may also be beneficial, in that it will compensate for the vasodilatory effects of many anesthetic agents. In minor surgery, there is minimal concern about fluid loss or fluid shift, both of which can be associated with major surgery. Nevertheless, there exists a preexisting fluid deficit secondary to the preoperative fasting guidelines. Variations in these fasting guidelines now allow clear fluid intake up to  $2 - 3\mathrm{h}$  before surgery. However, for the morning-scheduled patient, many surgeons and anesthesiologists still adhere to a restricted intake after midnight. The typical  $70\mathrm{kg}$  adult patient may thus have a fluid deficit of between 1 and 2 liters, which is a volume deficit primarily consisting of free water as well as of a small quantity of sodium, potassium, and chloride electrolytes.

In the ambulatory setting, intravenous access is frequently established just before the commencement of minor surgery. Any of the various crystalloid solutions (e.g., dextrose and water  $\left[\mathrm{D}_{5} \mathrm{~W}\right]$ ,  $\mathrm{D}_{5} / 0.45 \% \mathrm{NS}$ ,  $\mathrm{D}_{5} / 0.9 \% \mathrm{NS}$ ,  $0.45 \% \mathrm{NS}$ , and  $0.9 \% \mathrm{NS}$ ) could be used for the healthy ambulatory patient scheduled for minor surgery. However, it is important for the surgeon-anesthetist to understand the concept of fluid compartmentalization so that the solution most appropriate for infusion can be selected. Total body water exists in two major compartments, intracellular and extracellular. The intracellular compartment represents approximately two-thirds of the total body water, and the extracellular compartment represents approximately one-third of the total body water. The extracellular compartment is further subdivided into intravascular (one fourth) and extravascular fluid (three fourths) compartments. Amongst all these compartments there is a constant redistribution of free water that is dictated by ionic and osmotic pressure. The primary extracellular electrolytes are sodium and chloride. These electrolytes are not freely diffusible between compartments. Any alteration in the concentration of these electrolytes in a specific compartment will result in a compensatory shift of free water.

One possible physiologic choice for replacement of the fluid deficit is  $0.45\%$  saline solution. Infused over a 24-h period, this would provide the daily sodium requirement  $(1 - 2\mathrm{mEq / kg / d})$ . The advantage of an isotonic solution (e.g.,  $0.9\%$  NaCl) is the preferential distribution of the fluid within the extracellular space. This fluid will remain within the intravascular space for the first  $15 - 30\mathrm{min}$  before equilibration within the extracellular compartment. This provides the advantage of countering the vasodilatation secondary to anesthetic agents.  $\mathrm{D}_5 / \mathrm{W}$ , a hypotonic solution, is rapidly redistributed and leaves the intravascular space. It thus does not provide a physiologic benefit comparable to that of the saline solutions. In addition, the normal hormonal response to surgery produces an increase in blood glucose. The infusion of a dextrose solution may intensify this hyperglycemia, which may worsen neurologic injury in the face of hypoxemia [64, 65]. The potential for such problems is unlikely in office dentoalveolar anesthesia. Since many patients who have had dentoalveolar surgery may have a diminished intake for several hours postoperatively, the inclusion of dextrose in the infusion fluid cannot be considered inappropriate. However, the dextrose should be combined with a solution such as  $0.45\%$  or  $0.9\%$  saline.

Dentoalveolar surgery is considered a minor surgery. Intravenous access is often used solely as a route for drug administration, and the infusion may be limited to a low rate to maintain patency of the intravenous catheter. Despite the fluid deficit discussed previously, such a

patient typically has a stable intraoperative course. However, attention to perioperative fluid rehydration may decrease postoperative morbidity and improve the "quality" of recovery after office-based anesthesia in the non-intubated patient, with less residual sedation, headaches, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea and vomiting [66]. Common practice is to utilize a faster infusion rate initially, particularly when titrating induction medications, then slow the rate considerably during the maintenance phase of the anesthetic to prevent accidental fluid overload. The infusion rate is increased at the end of the procedure to adequately "fluid resuscitate" the patient as they move into the emergence and recovery phases. This type of approach provides several benefits, such as easier titration for induction, minimizing fluid excess risks, smoother recovery from anesthesia, and reducing the risk of bladder distention.

It is important to understand some potential complications associated with fluid administration. Rapid and excessive administration of a hypotonic solution (e.g.,  $\mathrm{D}_5 / \mathrm{W}$ ) to a pediatric patient can result in cerebral edema and death. This can be avoided by administering an isotonic solution. Intravenous access provides the route to administer fluids and anesthetic drugs; but it also provides access to administer many emergency drugs. When emergency access is desired, it is most critical for IV access to be in place. Attention to some minor points will optimize the outcome if such an emergency would occur. Intravenous access should be established with a catheter which is firmly secured. Once intravenous access is established, there should be no rush to remove it once the surgery is completed, with the IV being easily discontinued immediately prior to discharge.

# 4.6.3 Patient Positioning

The positioning of the patient has potentially significant physiologic consequences when under anesthesia. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air present in the lungs at the end of passive expiration. FRC is the sum of expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and residual volume (RV) and measures approximately  $2400\mathrm{ml}$  in a  $70\mathrm{kg}$ , average-sized male. The FRC acts as an oxygen reserve in the event of impaired ventilation. In the erect patient, the thoracic expansion during inspiration is dependent upon the movement of the rib cage, the diaphragm, and the abdomen. Conversely, in the supine position, the diaphragmatic contraction is lessened due to the pressure of the abdominal contents, as well as decreasing ability of the abdomen to expand during inspiratory efforts. This decreases the FRC by  $\sim 0.5\mathrm{L}$ . Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of head-up positioning of varying degrees on minimizing

oxygen desaturation after preoxygenation and induction of anesthesia [67, 68]. In addition to nonerect patient positioning, several other factors decrease FRC including obesity, pregnancy, restrictive pulmonary disease, and short stature.

Most oral and maxillofacial surgeons utilize, in an office-based setting, a seated patient positioning of approximately  $35 - 60^{\circ}$ . This maximizes surgical access and ergonomic positioning for the staff and physiologically minimizes the decrease in FRC.

# 4.7 Sedative Techniques: Considerations Based on Age

# 4.7.1 Sedative Techniques in the Pediatric Patient

It is generally agreed that managing the anxious, uncomfortable, and uncooperative pediatric patient is one of the more difficult anesthetic tasks. The primary goals in the management of the pediatric patient include reducing anxiety, establishing cooperation, ensuring comfort, establishing amnesia and analgesia, and ensuring hemodynamic stability. Although the goals of sedation are similar for both the child and the adult, reducing anxiety in the adult may enhance cooperation, whereas in the child it may not. To achieve a satisfactory result and facilitate completion of the planned surgical procedure, the child may require a greater depth of sedation.

Sedation should be accomplished in as nonthreatening a manner as possible. Because some children may be intensely afraid of needles, establishing intravenous access may not be possible. The surgeon must be familiar with alternative techniques that allow for a safe satisfactory induction and recovery from anesthesia. Each case must be considered individually to select both the most appropriate drug and the route of administration. The surgeon must take into consideration the following factors in developing the anesthetic plan: (1) the age of the patient, (2) the level of anxiety and ability to cooperate with medical/dental staff, (3) the medical history of the patient, (4) the patient's prior surgical or anesthetic experience, (5) the infringement of the procedure on the airway, and (6) the duration of procedure. The selected technique should ideally be painless, accepted by the patient and parents, rapid in onset, appropriate in duration with rapid recovery, have minimal side effects, and have a broad margin of safety. If drug administration is associated with pain or adverse memories, the benefit of the sedation may be decreased. The anesthetic must also

provide an environment in which the procedure can be completed. In certain clinical situations a moderate degree of movement may be acceptable, whereas in other situations no movement is acceptable. Also, the induction agent may establish a depth such that the treatment may be completed, but in other cases the goal of the induction agent may be to establish sufficient sedation to allow intravenous access and maintenance of anesthesia with intravenous agents. Lastly, and of extreme importance, one is cautioned not to sedate a young child who will be transported in a car seat prior to arrival in the office. The respiratory depressant effect of the medication combined with the positioning of the unattended child in the car can easily result in unrecognized upper airway obstruction or respiratory impairment, with resultant death or significant neurologic impairment [69].

# 4.7.1.1 Routes of Administration

Sedative medication may be administered by many routes, including oral, intranasal, transmucosal, rectal, intramuscular, inhalational, and intravenous. The advantage of the intravenous route is that it permits ease of titration, resulting in the most rapid onset, rapid offset, and predictable effect. The disadvantage is that it entails establishing intravenous access. A percentage of children do not cooperate enough to allow an intravenous catheter to be inserted. Many children report the needle puncture from either intravenous placement or intramuscular injection as the worst part of their care.

Even with a cooperative or an anesthetized child, gaining peripheral intravenous access can present a challenge. Concurrent use of nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalational sedation can help substantially for many pediatric patients. Proper knowledge of venous anatomy with a controlled organized approach gives the best chance for success. Commonly accepted sites for venous cannulation include the dorsum of the hand, volar aspect of the wrist, antecubital fossa, and greater saphenous vein. Even when an alternative route (e.g., inhalation or intramuscular) is used to induce the anesthetic, it is recommended that intravenous access is established forthwith, even for very rapid surgical procedures. This can be achieved once the child is sedated. Even if the procedure can be accomplished without the administration of an intravenous agent, an established intravenous line can be used to administer intravenous agents if needed to augment the initial anesthetic agent or to prolong the duration of the anesthesia. The line can additionally be used to administer other medications required to manage adverse events.

In an emergent situation, if the traditional peripheral cannulation technique is not successful, the clinician has two possible access sites that allow for a high degree of predictability. These sites are the femoral vein and intraosseous access, which are associated with a higher incidence of morbidity. The femoral vein usually requires a 20-gauge or 22-gauge angiocatheter. The intraosseous needle is recommended primarily for children  $< 6$  years of age because they still have red bone marrow (Fig. 4.2). In this technique a bone marrow needle or a no. 14 through 18 Cook intraosseous infusion needle is percutaneously inserted into the flat portion of the proximal tibia. Entry is made in the tibial

plateau  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  below the knee joint and  $2\mathrm{cm}$  medial to the tibial tuberosity. The special bone marrow-stiletted needle is inserted with a rotary motion into the bone until the cavity is reached. The depth of the needle insertion should be planned. If it is advanced too far, the needle penetrates the posterior cortex and does not allow infusion. The needle should be firmly set in the bone. Often bone marrow may be aspirated to confirm the placement. A syringe or intravenous line can be attached; if it runs easily, placement is confirmed. Slight extravasation around the placement site should not prevent the use of the needle. The catheter can serve as a conduit for all intravenous fluids and drugs.

Fig. 4.2 Intraosseous infusions

The inhalational induction of anesthesia with a potent anesthetic agent also provides rapid onset, rapid offset, and a predictable effect. The advantage of this technique, similar to the intravenous route, is the option to use short-acting agents titrated to effect, enabling the anesthetic state to be rapidly terminated at the end of the procedure.

The traditional inhalation induction is accomplished by administering oxygen or a mixture of oxygen (minimum concentration of  $30\%$ ) and nitrous oxide using a full face mask. Induction can be achieved using one of two techniques. The potent vapor agent can be increased gradually every few breaths until the induction is complete. Alternatively, the patient may be immediately administered a high concentration of the potent inhalational agent. A modification of the latter technique is to ask the patient to exhale completely and then take a deep inspiration of the vapor agent and hold his or her breath. Induction will be achieved with a single breath, and spontaneous ventilation will resume once a state of general anesthesia is achieved. For brief procedures (e.g., extraction of a deciduous tooth), once general anesthesia is achieved, the face mask can be removed, the procedure performed, the face mask reapplied, and the patient allowed to awaken breathing  $100\%$  oxygen. Some clinicians advocate maintaining general anesthesia by continuing the administration of the potent vapor agent via a traditional nasal hood. This can result in the delivery of a diluted concentration of anesthetic agent to the alveoli, resulting in a lightening of the patient's anesthetic depth. Such an occurrence would necessitate the interruption of the procedure to replace the full face mask to increase the alveolar concentration of the inhalational agent. Although the continued administration of the vapor agent via a nasal hood is not contraindicated, it may result in excessive environmental pollution, even with a scavenger device that is a component of the nasal hood. A circuit that scavenges the vapor agent must also be used with the face mask. To avoid these potential problems, especially for longer procedures, the establishment of intravenous access is strongly recommended. The vasodilatory effects of the potent agent may optimize conditions for establishing intravenous access. Once access is set, anesthetic depth can be maintained with intravenous anesthetic agents.

There are a few disadvantages to inhalation induction. The vapor agent has a scent that may be objectionable to some. Applying a scent (e.g., scented lip gloss) selected by the child to the face mask may alter the odor of the agent. The odor may also be minimized if the child breathes through the mouth as opposed to the nose. In addition, inhalation induction is also dependent on the child accepting the face mask. Techniques such as asking the child to inflate a balloon may be employed to distract the child. Any need for mild restraint should be explained to the parent and may be used to facilitate

induction in the younger child. However, in older children or extremely uncooperative children, the technique is dependent on the child's acceptance of the face mask. If excessive physical restraint is necessary, an alternative technique should be considered.

The intramuscular route of administration approximates the rapidity and predictability of onset of intravenous administration. Its primary disadvantage is the discomfort associated with the injection. However, for the uncooperative child, it may be the least traumatic method of inducing anesthesia. Four anatomic regions are used for intramuscular administration of drugs: the deltoid muscle, the vastus lateralis muscle, the ventrogluteal area, and the superior lateral aspect of the gluteus maximus muscle. These sites have been identified because they have minimal numbers of nerves and large blood vessels, as well as adequate bulk to accommodate the volume of the injected medication. The rapidity of onset of the drug is dependent upon the perfusion of the muscle. Absorption and onset are also affected by the ionization of the drug and the vehicle in which it is dissolved.

Oral administration is considered by many to be the least-threatening induction technique. Children are generally familiar with and readily accepting of oral medications. Oral administration also is generally well accepted by the mentally impaired or autistic patient. However, oral techniques have limitations. In one study of children between the age of 20 and 48 months, one-third of the children required that the medication be administered into the back of their throat with a needle-free syringe [70]. Although frequently used as a sole sedative agent by many surgeons, an oral sedative agent can be used as a premedicant prior to establishing intravenous access or inducing general anesthesia by a different route (e.g., inhalation or intramuscular). The limited volume of fluid administered with the oral medication is not associated with an increased risk for aspiration pneumonitis.

The primary disadvantages of oral sedation are the slow onset, variable response, and prolonged recovery. Injecting a sedative agent into the back of the throat with a needle-free syringe (when the child does not otherwise accept the medication) has also been associated with adverse consequences. It has been theorized that the drug intended for orogastric administration can be inadvertently aspirated by the crying child. Bronchial absorption can result in an excessive plasma level of drug.

The intranasal route was initially proposed for pediatric sedation because it was felt to avoid first-pass degradation, be rapid in onset, and be less traumatic than the other routes that possessed these same benefits. Medications administered intranasally do result in a rapid rise in the plasma level of a drug. This occurs because the nasal cavity, which functions to warm and

cleansse nasal respirations, has a relatively extensive surface area with a thin nasal mucosa and an abundance of capillaries that facilitate the absorption of drug. The nasal mucosa also provides a direct connection to the central nervous system (CNS) through the cribriform plate. Medication may be absorbed through the cribriform plate directly into the CNS through the capillary beds or the olfactory neurons, or directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. Rhinitis or a URI may impair the absorption of a drug via this route.

The intranasal route, although initially felt to be less traumatic than alternative routes, is frequently not well accepted by children. The volume of medication used frequently results in a portion passing into the pharynx and being swallowed. Therefore, the unpleasant taste of the medication is not avoided, and the drug is subject to first-pass hepatic degradation. Midazolam is the most commonly intranasally administered medication, but the acidic pH can be quite irritating to the nasal mucosa.

Transmucosal absorption has also been considered. The oral epithelium is thin with a rich vascular supply. The minimum epidermal barrier and the vascular supply provide an environment that promotes relatively rapid absorption of drugs. Oral transmucosal administration of a drug also has the advantage of avoiding hepatic first-pass degradation. Transmucosal administration requires cooperation of the patient to keep the drug in contact with the oral mucosa. The medication may be administered as a solution placed sublingually or as a lozenge. At the present time the only available lozenge that has an acceptable flavor and is commercially available is fentanyl citrate. Other sedative medications are bitter. Palatability can be improved by mixing these medications with a flavored solution that increases their volume; thus, the solution will be bitter, or the volume will be excessive, neither of which is advantageous for the transmucosal administration of a liquid/solution. Many, if not most, pediatric patients expectorate the medication or prematurely swallow the liquid medication that is placed within the oral cavity as opposed to keeping it there.

Rectal drug administration has been used for the administration of antiemetics, antipyretics, and analgesics to both adults and pediatric patients. Many sedative drugs that are usually administered IV, IM, or orally can be administered rectally. Rectal administration may also be used in the management of emergencies. For example, rectal administration of diazepam is an acceptable route for the treatment of seizures.

The rectum is a flat organ that is usually empty. Its blood supply is derived from the inferior rectal arteries and is drained via the superior, middle, and inferior rectal veins. The superior rectal vein drains into the hepatic-portal circulation via the inferior mesenteric vein. The middle and inferior rectal veins drain into the internal iliac vein. The internal iliac vein drains into the vena

cava, thus bypassing the hepatic-portal circulation and avoiding first-pass metabolism by the liver.

The absorption of a drug that is administered per rectum is affected by several factors. The variable absorption of the drug may be partially influenced by the venous drainage of the rectum. Therefore, some individuals feel that absorption and subsequent peak plasma level of medication are dependent on the location of deposition of drug within the rectum. However, there are significant anastomoses between the three rectal veins, and peak drug blood level has not clearly been shown to be dependent on the location of agent deposition within the rectum. Solutions are absorbed more rapidly than are suppositories. A more dilute solution with greater volume provides more rapid onset and prolonged duration. Stool within the rectal vault as well as expulsion of an unmeasurable quantity of drug results in delayed or decreased absorption. Alteration in the integrity of the mucosa or the presence of hemorrhoids results in greater absorption. If a child is uncooperative, he or she may tightly close the anal sphincter during any aspect of the administration process. Excessive force both in placing and removing the catheter may result in a laceration of the mucosa and cause a greater absorption of drug.

# 4.7.1.2 Pharmacologic Agents for the Pediatric Patient

The objective in selecting a pharmacologic agent is to choose an agent that establishes an appropriate environment to complete the surgical procedure. The effects sought in the pediatric patient include anxiolysis, amnesia, analgesia, immobilization, sedation, and hypnosis. There are numerous agents that are currently used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons and other practitioners. In this section we discuss what we feel to be the most appropriate anesthetic agents and the routes by which they should be delivered.

# Ketamine

Ketamine is a pharmacologic agent that induces a distinct anesthetic state that resembles catalepsy. The patient appears awake but is noncommunicative. Nonpurposeful movements may occur but are not disruptive. The eyes are commonly open with a blank stare and intact corneal and light reflexes [71]. A lateral nystagmus is also very characteristic. Ketamine also produces amnesia and analgesia. The clinical effect created by ketamine results from a dissociation between the thalamoneocortical and limbic systems, which disrupts the brain from interpreting visual, auditory, and painful stimuli [72]. The analgesic effect, which occurs at subanesthesia plasma levels, is partially mediated by ketamine binding to the  $\mu$ -opioid and NMDA receptors. This is significant because the effect persists into the postoperative period and may decrease the need for

postoperative analgesia [73]. Ketamine is also unique in its effects on the respiratory system. In clinical doses commonly used in oral and maxillofacial surgery, ketamine usually preserves upper airway musculature tone, spontaneous respirations, and FRC. This minimizes the incidence of upper airway obstruction and hypopneas/ apneas and maintains the pulmonary oxygen reserve [74, 75]. In contrast, most other anesthetics contribute to a decrease in muscular tone, respirations, and FRC. In addition to maintaining upper airway muscular tone, ketamine tends to better maintain the pharyngeal and laryngeal airway reflexes. This allows the patient to maintain the ability to swallow and cough, which minimizes the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Ketamine has also been shown to relax bronchial smooth muscle and cause bronchial dilatation. It has been used in the management of wheezing during anesthesia [76]. Despite these benefits the practitioner must respect the inherent dangers associated with the anesthetic management of a patient. Respiratory depression characterized by a decrease in respiratory rate and tidal volume can occur with ketamine. Respiratory arrest has been reported in a 4-year-old child following the intramuscular administration of ketamine  $4\mathrm{mg / kg}$  [77]. However, respiratory depression is not common, and the occurrence of apnea is more likely to occur in infants or with the rapid intravenous infusion of an induction dose greater than  $2\mathrm{mg}/$  kg. Slow intravenous infusion over  $30 - 60~s$  of doses between  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  and  $1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  should minimize the incidence of significant respiratory depression. Aspiration of gastric contents can also occur despite the fact that ketamine better preserves the protective airway reflexes allowing a patient the ability to swallow and cough [78, 79]. The protective reflexes, although less impaired than with other drugs, are diminished. We feel that a patient who is considered not to have an empty stomach should not be sedated and disagree with those who feel that preservation of the airway reflexes justifies sedating such patients even with ketamine [80]. The preservation of the laryngeal reflexes is a protective mechanism; this may also contribute to airway complications. Ketamine produces an increase in salivary and tracheobronchial secretions, and the preservation of the laryngeal reflexes may predispose the patient to laryngospasm. Ketamine has both direct and indirect effects on the cardiovasculature. The direct myocardial depressant effects are generally not seen in the healthy patient anesthetized in the office. The indirect effects, which are a result of a sympathetic stimulation, produce an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. The former may be more common in the pediatric patient. These effects are well tolerated in the healthy pediatric patient. These hemodynamic changes may be reduced when ketamine is combined with an anesthetic agent that tends to blunt sympathetic stimulation (e.g., benzodiazepines, propofol). A disadvantage of ketamine is its stimulation of dreams and

hallucinations described as "out of body" experiences, sensations of floating, and delirium [81]. Although the incidence is less in children  $< 16$  years of age, the incidence may be as high as  $10\%$  [82, 83]. Ketamine is also contraindicated in patients who may have a globe or intracranial injury as ketamine increases both intraocular and intracranial pressures. Ketamine can be administered IV, IM, orally, intranasally, and rectally. We discuss only the intravenous, intramuscular, and oral administrations of ketamine. The advantage of intramuscular administration is that it does not require patient cooperation. The mild distress associated with the injection is brief as the drug has a rapid onset, within  $3 - 5\mathrm{min}$ . Dosing recommendations up to  $10\mathrm{mg / kg}$  IM have been described in various papers and texts. The larger dose clearly produces a general anesthetic state. For office-based or emergency-department procedures performed by oral and maxillofacial surgeons, however, a dose of  $3 - 4\mathrm{mg / kg}$  IM should provide effective dissociation. One investigation prospectively assessed pediatric patients requiring sedation for minor procedures in an emergency department and found that a  $4\mathrm{mg / kg}$  dose provided effective sedation and immobilization for  $86.1\%$  of the children. A satisfactory quality of sedation was achieved with adjunctive local anesthesia for  $97.2\%$  of these patients, although  $3.7\%$  required mild restraint despite adequate sedation and an absent withdrawal response to pain. Only  $2.8\%$  of the patients required a repeat dose secondary to inadequate sedation [84]. Local anesthesia is an important component of any sedative technique used by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Although this study demonstrated that it is not always required, incorporation of local anesthesia into the anesthetic plan minimizes the amount of other anesthetic agents required. The working time achieved from a  $4\mathrm{mg / kg}$  dose of ketamine was  $15 - 30\mathrm{min}$ . A disadvantage of intramuscular ketamine is that recovery is variable and can be quite long. Although the mean recovery time in the above study was  $82\mathrm{min}$ , recovery from injection to discharge at times took up to  $3\mathrm{h}$ . Benzodiazepines can be administered concomitantly with ketamine. The purpose for coadministering a benzodiazepine is to reduce the amount of ketamine administered, reduce the incidence of ketamine-induced hallucinations, attenuate the cardiovascular effects of ketamine, and provide additional amnesia [85]. Coadministration of a benzodiazepine with ketamine may prolong recovery [86]. Midazolam produces a better reduction in unpleasant dreams than does diazepam [87]. The favorable pharmacokinetics of midazolam compared with diazepam also provide a more rapid recovery. In a prospective investigation, ketamine  $3\mathrm{mg / kg}$  with midazolam  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  was administered to pediatric patients requiring sedation for minor surgical procedures in the emergency department [88]. Although  $30\%$  of the patients who received this regimen manifested "intermittent crying,"

only  $14\%$  required additional medication to establish a satisfactory anesthetic state to allow completion of the planned treatment. Recovery for this regimen was at times prolonged. The level of sedation and immobilization is dependent on the planned procedure. Although the intent is to provide an atraumatic experience for the child, a mildly dissociative sedative and analgesic state compared with a deeper dissociative anesthetic state may be acceptable for a brief dentoalveolar procedure. The intent is to modify the patient's perception of the procedure. In this situation the patient is not profoundly sedated, and the practitioner must tolerate some movement and possibly some vocalization. Ketamine  $2 - 3\mathrm{mg}/$  kg IM should provide this desirable sedative depth. The lower dose of  $2\mathrm{mg / kg}$  is advantageous in that recovery from injection to discharge approximates  $60~\mathrm{min}$ . For many children the low intramuscular dose of ketamine provides a depth of sedation that allows the placement of an intravenous line. If necessary, the depth of sedation can then be modified using intravenous medications. Incremental doses of ketamine  $5 - 10\mathrm{mgIV}$  can be administered to the sedated patient, with onset occurring within  $30 - 60~s$ . The duration of sedation is  $10 - 15\mathrm{min}$ . Although we have found that ketamine  $2\mathrm{mg}/$  kg generally facilitates intravenous placement, one study reported that  $31\%$  of the children resisted intravenous placement with a dose of  $3\mathrm{mg / kg}$  [89]. For the patient who remains combative and for whom intravenous access cannot be established, an additional dose of ketamine  $1 - 2\mathrm{mg / kg}$  IM can be administered. If the child allows placement of an intravenous catheter (without any premedicant), a dose of ketamine  $0.5 - 1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  IV administered over  $30 - 60~s$  will establish dissociation. An anticholinergic agent (e.g., glycopyrrolate or atropine) is frequently coadministered with ketamine to decrease hypersalivation. Tachycardia and postoperative psychotomimetic effects are problems associated with ketamine. Atropine, when combined with ketamine, produces a significantly higher heart rate compared with the effect of glycopyrrolate. As a tertiary amine, atropine crosses the blood-brain barrier and can, itself, produce postoperative delirium. A higher incidence of adverse emergence phenomenon, however, was not identified in studies comparing glycopyrrolate with atropine [90, 91]. Both drugs can be mixed in the same syringe with ketamine for an intramuscular injection. The peak effect of intramuscular glycopyrrolate occurs within  $30\mathrm{min}$ , at which time the procedure is frequently completed, and the patient is in the recovery phase of treatment. If an intravenous line is to be established after the onset of sedation, glycopyrrolate can be administered IV with a peak effect in approximately  $1\mathrm{min}$ . The dose of atropine is  $0.01 - 0.02\mathrm{mg / kg}$ , with a minimum dose of  $0.1\mathrm{mg}$  and a maximum dose of  $0.6\mathrm{mg}$ . Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent as atropine. The dose is the same for both drugs, regardless of the route of administration. Ketamine can

also be administered orally [92]. Bioavailability is approximately  $17\%$  following oral administration compared with  $93\%$  after intramuscular administration [93, 94]. Onset of sedation occurs in approximately  $20\mathrm{min}$ . Although doses reported have ranged from 3 to  $10\mathrm{mg/kg}$ , a more consistent effect is achieved with doses  $>6\mathrm{mg/kg}$ . In one investigation oral ketamine  $6\mathrm{mg/kg}$  was administered for sedating anxious pediatric dental patients with a mean duration of sedation of  $36\mathrm{min}$  [95]. The quality of sedation was reported as good for  $65\%$  of the patients, and  $100\%$  of the treatment was completed. Mean recovery time was  $56\mathrm{min}$  with one child sleeping for  $3\mathrm{h}$ . Creating a state of deep sedation is dependent on using larger doses of medications. Ketamine  $10\mathrm{mg/kgPO}$  was used as a premedicant in the management of pediatric patients undergoing invasive oncologic procedures. Approximately  $50\%$  of the patients were unresponsive at  $60\mathrm{min}$ . This dose was ineffective in  $<10\%$  of the patients [96]. Recovery, however, generally took  $2-4\mathrm{h}$ , with  $20\%$  of the patients being deeply sedated at  $120\mathrm{min}$  post-administration. Several authors have shown that the anxiolytic and sedative properties of midazolam  $0.5\mathrm{mg/kg}$  result in a more clinically effective sedation than does ketamine at  $5\mathrm{or}6\mathrm{mg/kg}$  [97, 98]. The combination of oral midazolam and ketamine has also been described. This drug combination may provide effective sedation when oral midazolam has been ineffective. One study that demonstrated a greater efficacy with this combination used ketamine  $4\mathrm{mg/kg}$  with midazolam  $0.4\mathrm{mg/kg}$  [99]. The reported dosing regimens have varied from ketamine  $4-10\mathrm{mg/kg}$  with midazolam  $0.25-0.5\mathrm{mg/kg}$ . Situations may occur in the management of a mentally impaired, autistic, or older child in whom an intravenous line or an intramuscular injection cannot be administered without harm to the patient or the healthcare provider, and who will not accept a face mask. Oral ketamine alone or combined with oral midazolam can be used to establish a cataleptic state, facilitating treatment of the combative patient [100, 101]. It may be helpful to solicit assistance from the patient's caregiver or parent, as these individuals may be aware of strategies to ensure that the full oral dose is taken. Atropine or glycopyrrolate can be orally administered with ketamine; however, the time to peak decrease in salivation is  $2\mathrm{h}$  [102]. Regardless of the route of administration, ketamine can establish a clinical effect described as a "chemical straight jacket." The catatonic state created by ketamine is different from that with other general anesthetic agents; ketamine, when used at the doses discussed above, may not be considered to be a true general anesthetic. However, the anesthetic depth created by ketamine is not consistent with conscious/ moderate sedation, and airway problems can occur. Therefore, appropriate anesthetic standards for deep sedation or general anesthesia must be followed.

# Midazolam

Midazolam is a water-soluble short-acting benzodiazepine. As a class of agents, the benzodiazepines provide anxiolysis, sedation, and amnesia. Midazolam can be administered IV, IM, orally, sublingually, intranasally, or rectally. Because of its water solubility, intramuscular injection of midazolam is pain-free, and absorption is predictable. Unlike ketamine, however, as a single agent there is no unique anesthetic benefit to the intramuscular administration of midazolam. Intranasal administration of midazolam was popular in the past. It was once the most common intranasally administered medication. However, because of an acidic pH, it produces irritation to the nasal mucosa. The medication if administered slowly is discomforting and if administered rapidly passes through the nose into the nasopharynx and is swallowed. In a study that compared oral to intranasal administration of midazolam, children were found to be less tolerant of the intranasal administration [103]. Oral midazolam is probably the most widely used premedicant in children. The recommended dose of midazolam is  $0.5 - 1.0\mathrm{mg / kg}$  to a maximum of  $20\mathrm{mg}$ . Midazolam  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  achieves anxiolysis in  $70 - 80\%$  of patients. The anesthetic depth may be potentiated by the administration of nitrous oxide. The combined administration of  $40\%$  nitrous oxide with midazolam  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  has produced deep sedation in  $12\%$  of patients [104]. Unlike ketamine, midazolam causes loss of airway muscle tone. Although airway obstruction is not common with doses of  $0.5 - 1.0\mathrm{mg / kg}$ , airway obstruction has been reported after  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  oral midazolam [105]. The incidence of airway obstruction may increase with the administration of nitrous oxide. In one study the combined administration of  $50\%$  nitrous oxide and  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  oral midazolam resulted in a  $56\%$  incidence of upper airway obstruction in children with enlarged tonsils [106]. With maintenance of airway patency, however, oral midazolam doses of  $0.5 - 0.75\mathrm{mg / kg}$  generally do not result in a change in oxygen saturation, heart rate, or blood pressure [107]. The onset of effect of oral midazolam is within  $20\mathrm{min}$ , and the duration of sedation is  $20 - 40\mathrm{min}$ . Patients can generally be discharged within  $60 - 90\mathrm{min}$  from the time at which the medication is administered. Midazolam is metabolized by the cytochrome oxidase system. Oral midazolam is subject to hepatic first-pass metabolism. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors, azole antifungal medications, fluvoxamine maleate, and grapefruit juice alter this cytochrome oxidase system and result in a higher and a more sustained midazolam plasma level [108, 109]. Higher doses of oral midazolam  $(0.75 - 1.0\mathrm{mg / kg})$  are associated with a greater incidence of side effects. These include loss of head control, blurred vision, and/or dysphoria. A paradoxical reaction may also occur in which the patient

becomes more excited as opposed to sedated. This is more common in children and adolescents [110].

# Induction Agents

Methohexital and propofol are rapid-onset short-acting agents that are effective for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. These are the primary anesthetic agents for general anesthesia in oral and maxillofacial surgery performed in an office. The pharmacology of these agents is discussed in  $\triangleright$  Chap. 3, "Pharmacology of Outpatient Anesthesia Medications." There are some important points to make relative to their use in the pediatric patient.

Methohexital is an ultrashort-acting oxybarbiturate. It can be administered rectally, IM, and IV. The advantage to the rectal administration of methohexital is that the drug is administered in the presence of the parents, and, thus, the child is asleep prior to parental separation. Rectal administration, however, can be distressing, as discussed above. Methohexital can also be administered intramuscularly. Administration is quite painful, and there is no advantage to its use in office-based anesthesia compared with other available intramuscular agents. Neither rectal nor intramuscular administration is generally employed in ambulatory oral and maxillofacial surgery offices. Most frequently methohexital is administered IV. Interestingly, despite years of safe administration in this environment, the manufacturer's package insert states that the use of methohexital in the pediatric patient is not adequately studied and thus not recommended.

Propofol is an alkylphenol. Its characteristics include rapid onset and short duration of clinical effect, similar to methohexital. Its high clearance rate and minimal tendency for drug accumulation make it a more ideal anesthetic agent for ambulatory surgery in both adult and pediatric patients. In one study comparing propofol to methohexital for anesthesia in pediatric patients undergoing procedures in a dental chair, propofol was associated with a  $9\%$  incidence of ventricular arrhythmias compared with a  $32\%$  incidence associated with methohexital [111]. Clinical trials and case series have demonstrated propofol's efficacy in pediatric patients [112-118]. The proprietary formulation of propofol (Dipivan®) is licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children  $>3$  years of age in the surgical setting. Transient pain at the site of injection is reported in approximately  $10 - 20\%$  of patients given propofol. In the pediatric patient this discomfort may result in gradations of movement which may require restraint of the patient until induction is fully achieved. Propofol may also cause hypotension and bradycardia. The incidence is reported to be higher in the pediatric patient  $(17\%)$  compared with that in the adult patient  $(3 - 10\%)$ . This

usually is not detected in the adult oral and maxillofacial surgery patient when a relatively low initial dose  $(< 1\mathrm{mg}/$  kg) is typically used to achieve deep sedation or general anesthesia. Pediatric patients frequently need to be more profoundly anesthetized. This requires the administration of a greater dose of propofol, which may result in a higher occurrence of hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression in pediatric oral and maxillofacial surgery patients. Propofol may also cause excitatory movement or myoclonus, the incidence of which is greater in the pediatric patient (  $17\%$  vs.  $3 - 10\%$  ).The greatest potential concern with the use of propofol in the pediatric patient is that cases of fatal metabolic acidosis and cardiac failure, termed propofol infusion syndrome, have been reported in over a dozen children [119-123]. These incidents have all been associated with prolonged intubation and propofol infusions. A review by the FDA concluded that propofol had not been shown to have a direct link to any pediatric deaths [124]. Although the causal relationship between propofol and metabolic acidosis remains unproven, clinicians should be aware of the risk for this reaction in children and limit the dose and duration of propofol therapy accordingly.

# Inhalational Agents

The origin of anesthesia is rooted within dentistry. The first anesthetic was nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide has anxiolytic, analgesic, amnestic, and sedative effects [125, 126]. Although not a potent anesthetic agent, nitrous oxide possesses a wide margin of safety and has few (if any) residual side effects. Another advantage of nitrous oxide is its low solubility. An anesthetic agent that has low solubility has rapid equilibration between the alveoli and the blood, and the blood and the brain. This results in both rapid onset and anesthetic emergence. Also, nitrous oxide may be combined with other anesthetic agents. A deep sedative or general anesthetic state may be established with the coadministration of nitrous oxide and an oral or parenteral agent. This may result in respiratory impairment.

Although nitrous oxide may potentiate the effect of another agent, the discontinuance of it can, likewise, reverse the anesthetic depth and promote a more rapid emergence [104, 127, 128]. Although nitrous oxide lacks sufficient potency to solely induce general anesthesia, sevoflurane, desflurane, and isoflurane have sufficient potency to induce and maintain general anesthesia (Table 4.5). The primary benefit of an inhalational agent is for mask induction, and of the potent inhalational agents, only halothane and sevoflurane are nonpungent. These agents can be administered to an awake patient with minimal respiratory complications (e.g., coughing, breath holding, laryngospasm), whereas desflurane and isoflurane tend to irritate the airway if used for mask induction [129-131].

The blood and tissue solubility of an inhalational agent is also important. These properties influence the speed of induction and emergence from anesthesia. Agents that have a low solubility in blood have a more rapid induction and shorter emergence time. The blood-gas solubility coefficients of desflurane, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, isoflurane, and halothane are 0.42, 0.47, 0.6, 1.4, and 2.3, respectively. These figures imply a more rapid onset and emergence for desflurane, sevoflurane, and nitrous oxide. Halothane is discussed below, included simply for historical context, as it is no longer available in the United States. It must be noted however that it may still be in use elsewhere in the world.

Since all anesthetic agents affect the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, it is important to understand these effects. All potent inhalational agents depress minute ventilation in a dose-dependent manner, with a resulting increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood  $\mathrm{(PaCO_2)}$ . Clinically the practitioner will observe a decrease in tidal volume and a slight increase in respiratory rate. Although acceptable respiratory parameters can be maintained during spontaneous ventilations, of the two agents used for mask induction, halothane produces less respiratory depression than does sevoflurane [132]. Not all respiratory effects are detrimental. All inhalational agents are beneficial in that they produce bronchial dilatation and are advantageous in the management of the patient with bronchospastic disease. All potent inhalational agents have myocardial depressant effects. The cardiovascular depressant effects are greatest with halothane use, which can result in hypotension and bradycardia. However, of greater significance is the ability of halothane to sensitize the heart to catecholamines with resultant dysrhythmias. One study reported that  $48\%$  of pediatric patients anesthetized with halothane had arrhythmias compared with  $16\%$  of those induced with  $8\%$  sevoflurane. Patients who had an incremental induction of sevoflurane had even fewer arrhythmias. Furthermore, of the arrhythmias associated with halothane,  $40\%$  were ventricular

arrhythmias (consisting of ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, and couplets); with sevoflurane, only  $1\%$  were ventricular arrhythmias (consisting of single ventricular ectopic beats) [133]. The occurrence of these arrhythmias may also be associated with the administration of local anesthetics containing epinephrine. Halothane is the only inhalational agent that is associated with arrhythmias with clinical doses of epinephrine. A limit of  $1\mu \mathrm{g / kg}$  of epinephrine in patients receiving halothane is recommended [134-136].

Use of inhalational agents is advantageous in the oral and maxillofacial surgeon's office because they provide a general anesthetic state without intravenous access. Therefore, only agents that are pleasant and nonirritating to the airway can be used. Halothane had traditionally been the agent used by both anesthesiologists in the operating room and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in their offices. Sevoflurane appears to have the characteristics that most approximate the ideal inhalational agent, in that it is of sufficient potency, is nonpurgent, has a low blood and tissue solubility, and has limited cardiorespiratory effects. Sevoflurane has replaced halothane in the operating rooms.

There are several variations in mask induction techniques. First, the inhalational agent may be administered with a combination of nitrous oxide and oxygen or  $100\%$  oxygen. The combination of nitrous oxide with the potent vapor agent decreases the percentage of vapor agent required to achieve an anesthetic depth. The decrease in minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for halothane is significantly clinically greater for halothane than for sevoflurane. This most likely is related to the difference in solubility of the two potent inhalational agents. Another variation in mask induction pertains to the concentration of inhalational agent administered. The practitioner may administer an incrementally increasing concentration of an agent (e.g., increasing an agent by  $0.5 - 1\%$  after a few breaths) or a high initial concentration of an agent (e.g., sevoflurane  $8\%$ ). Although one would expect that sevoflurane would have a more rapid speed of induction, the differences between sevoflurane and halothane have not been consistently demonstrated [131, 137]. The difference in speed of induction appears to be less distinguishable when a high concentration of halothane is used.

Similar to speed of induction, anesthetic emergence is dependent on several variables. Agents that have a low blood solubility coefficient should have a shorter emergence time. Several studies have shown that desflurane, which has the lowest blood solubility coefficient, has a very rapid anesthetic emergence (5-7 min), and halothane, which has the highest blood solubility coefficient, has a more prolonged recovery (10-21 min) [138-142]. Sevoflurane has been shown, although not consistently,

to have a more rapid anesthetic emergence for intermediate- and long-duration anesthetics compared with halothane. However, typically the required state of anesthesia for a pediatric oral and maxillofacial procedure in the office is brief, lasting  $< 10$  min. Recovery from anesthesia is also dependent on the duration of the anesthesia. Clinical studies comparing sevoflurane and halothane for pediatric dental extractions lasting between 4 and  $6\mathrm{min}$  have not demonstrated a more rapid recovery with sevoflurane [143]. In one study, in which children were subject to a 4-min anesthesia, time to eye opening was  $102\mathrm{s}$  with halothane and  $167\mathrm{s}$  with sevoflurane [144].

The last factor that needs to be considered both in comparing sevoflurane and halothane and in selecting an anesthetic agent for the office is the toxicity of each drug. Halothane is metabolized in the liver to a trifluoroacetylated product, which binds liver proteins promoting an immunologic response that can result in hepatic injury [145, 146]. The incidence, which may be as high as 1 in 6000 cases of anesthesia in adults, is significantly lower in the pediatric population. Sevoflurane, although not associated with liver toxicity, has been associated with the potential for renal toxicity [147, 148]. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism, which produces inorganic fluoride. However, the rapid elimination of sevoflurane minimizes the renal fluoride exposure, which probably accounts for the lack of clinical renal dysfunction, despite some reports of serum fluoride levels  $>50~\mu \mathrm{mol}$ . Renal injury has also been associated with the formation of compound A, which is a product of the reaction between sevoflurane and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorbents. Most of the data, however, suggest that compound A does not induce renal toxicity in humans.

# Other Medications

Chloral hydrate is an alcohol-based sedative. It produces a sleep from which one is easily roused, in which the cardiorespiratory effects are consistent with those that occur with natural sleep. The onset of chloral hydrate is slow (30–60 min), its duration is variable (2–5 h), and it lacks the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines. The sedative effect of chloral hydrate does not produce as favorable a work environment as the anxiolytic effect of a benzodiazepine [70]. Another disadvantage of chloral hydrate is that it is a gastric irritant and is associated with nausea and vomiting.

Antihistamines are commonly used in medicine and dentistry for their antipruritic and antiemetic effects. When used for these conditions, sedation is frequently an unwanted side effect. However, the sedative effects can be used to advantage, and antihistamines such as promethazine and hydroxyzine are frequently combined with other drugs such as chloral hydrate and meperidine

to potentiate the sedative effect of the primary anesthetic agent and to provide antiemetic effects. The sedative effects of antihistamines may last between 3 and  $6\mathrm{h}$  and when used alone do not provide anxiolysis.

The oral transmucosal administration of a sedative medication is appealing. Fentanyl citrate is available as a lozenge on a stick. The recommended dose is between 10 and  $20~\mu \mathrm{g / kg}$ . Bioavailability is between  $33\%$  in children and  $50\%$  in adults [149].

The difference in bioavailability results from the amount of drug that is swallowed and the amount of drug that is absorbed through the oral mucosa. The drug provides both analgesia and sedation. Onset of analgesia precedes the onset of sedation. Analgesia also lasts for  $2 - 3\mathrm{h}$ , providing some postoperative pain control. Adverse side effects associated with the fentanyl lozenge include a high incidence of nausea and vomiting and pruritus. The major adverse effect associated with the use of fentanyl citrate is a higher incidence of respiratory depression than that seen with other sedative medications. The respiratory depression associated with the fentanyl lozenge may last beyond the sedative effect [150].

# 4.8 Pharmacology of Intravenous Drugs in the Geriatric Patient

Pharmacokinetics is defined as what the patient does to the drug.  
Pharmacodynamics is defined as what the drug does to the patient.

Various changes in the elderly will impact the pharmacology of anesthetic agents. Drugs which are taken orally may have increased bioavailability because of a reduced hepatic first-pass effect. The distribution of drugs is modified secondary to a change in body composition consisting of a reduction in intracellular water and a gain in adipose tissue. The gain in adipose tissue results in a reservoir for lipid-soluble drugs. For lipid-soluble drugs the volume of distribution is increased resulting in a lower plasma concentration and delayed elimination. For less lipid-soluble drugs, the volume of distribution is decreased resulting in a higher-than-expected initial plasma drug concentration and a greater pharmacologic effect. A smaller volume of distribution will also result in a quicker decrease in plasma concentration. Additionally, most anesthetic agents are bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein concentration, changes in anesthetic drug binding, and competition

with other pharmacologic agents tend to increase the unbound fraction of drugs which most frequently results in increased pharmacologic effect. Pharmacodynamic changes also contribute to the elderly patient requiring lower doses of anesthetic agents.

The elderly patient has an increased sensitivity to propofol with the geriatric patient having a higher incidence of apnea and hypotension. A more profound effect may also result in too rapid administration because of a lack of appreciation for the slow onset secondary to the slower circulation time. Other common drugs, such as midazolam, fentanyl, and ketamine, have prolonged durations.

# 4.9 Perioperative Complications

# 4.9.1 Airway Distress

Disruptions in normal respiratory function are perhaps the most common complications likely to occur during the perioperative period. In addition to the specific respiratory complications discussed in greater detail below, the two most important complications associated with sedation and/or general anesthesia are drug-induced respiratory depression and loss of airway patency due to soft tissue obstruction [151]. Apnea or hypopnea during the perioperative period results primarily from pharmacologically driven depression of the central and/or peripheral centers that regulate respiratory drive. Most anesthetic agents, such as opioids, sedatives, and potent inhalational agents, are all known to negatively impact respiratory drive in a dose-dependent manner, with synergistic or additive actions occurring with the concurrent use of multiple drugs. Apnea or hypopnea is readily identified by directly assessing the patient for the presence or absence of chest rise, or indirectly by the customary anesthesia monitors specifically utilized to assess ventilation and oxygenation. It must be appreciated that capnography and pretracheal/precordial auscultation are explicitly ventilatory monitors, while pulse oximetry is a poor ventilatory, yet an excellent oxygenation monitor. The combination of capnography and pretracheal/precordial auscultation provides useful redundancy for monitoring ventilatory status especially during intraoral surgical procedures in a nonintubated patient. Initial management of apnea or symptomatic hypopnea must include the use of positive pressure to appropriately ventilate the patient, thereby preventing hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Reversal agents may be indicated, depending on the likely offending agent, with the prototypical agent being naloxone (Narcan®) for opioid-induced respiratory depression.

Decreased airway musculature tone often coupled with posterior displacement of the tongue leads to collapse of the upper airway soft tissues, loss of airway patency, and subsequent impairment of ventilation and oxygenation. Soft tissue obstruction of the airway is independent of the presence or absence of respiratory drive. Patients who are obstructed but still attempting to breathe often demonstrate a paradoxical breathing pattern or "rocking boat" motion of their chest and abdomen. Management is centered around immediately reestablishing airway patency to permit airflow and gas exchange. Triple airway maneuvers (head tilt-chin lift), anterior retraction of the tongue, anterior translation of the patient's mandible, and application of airway adjuncts such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airways are frontline treatment options typically well tolerated by patients. However, more advanced airway management interventions such as the use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or even endotracheal intubation may be required depending on the situation and degree of severity of obstruction.

# 4.9.2 Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm is defined as the acute spasm or constriction of the bronchial smooth muscle lining of the lower airways leading to obstruction.

The classic triad of pathophysiologic features found in asthmatic patients includes bronchoconstriction, increased mucous production, and inflammation of the airways. There are a multitude of causes related to perioperative bronchospasm including allergic reactions, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and smoking. Inadvertent stimulation of the primed, hyperreactive airway in susceptible patients can prompt immediate constriction of the bronchial smooth muscles, leading to increased airway resistance and potential difficulties with ventilation and oxygenation. Bronchospasm following induction is a relatively rare complication, with an estimated incidence of 1.7 per 1000; however, the potential for significant morbidity and mortality can be quite substantial [152]. The degree of bronchospasm can vary considerably, with noted diagnostic features suggestive of a bronchospasm including elevated peak airway pressures, an obstructive "shark-fin" pattern on the capnograph tracing, wheezing during exhalation, and diminished or absent breath sounds.

Prevention of perioperative bronchospasm centers around identification of risk factors during the preoperative assessment, such as poorly controlled or undiag-

nosed reactive airway disease, smoking, concurrent illness, or abnormal breath sounds during auscultation of the lungs. Preoperative use of short-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol, may be indicated depending on the severity of underlying respiratory disease or preoperative presentation. Further investigation is warranted in those patients deemed at higher risk prior to undergoing sedation or anesthesia. Development of an anesthetic plan that maximizes anxiolysis and analgesia while reducing potential stimulation of the airways is ideal if possible. Consideration of specific anesthetic agents that tend to cause bronchodilation or minimize noxious stimulation includes the use of propofol, ketamine, sevoflurane, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Light depth of anesthesia is a common cause of intraoperative bronchospasm, so deeper planes of anesthesia may be ideal.

Management of perioperative bronchospasm depends heavily on the severity of the presentation. Partial or incomplete bronchospasm may respond well to the use of inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilators assuming the medications can adequately reach the adrenergic receptors within the lungs. Use of an airway adapter or a nebulizer improves the effectiveness of albuterol when administered perioperatively. Intubated patients may require substantially higher number of doses or "puffs" as the medication tends to collect within the endotracheal tube where it is ineffective. Alternative routes may be indicated for more severe instances of bronchospasm, specifically IV or IM. Adrenergic agonists, such as ephedrine and epinephrine, can be utilized, with the dose dependent on the specific agent and route. Ephedrine  $5 - 10\mathrm{mg}$  IV may be useful for minor to moderate bronchospasm, with epinephrine  $5 - 10\mathrm{mcg}$  IV being useful for more substantial bronchospasms, although tachycardia should be expected [153]. Epinephrine  $300 - 500\mathrm{mcg}$  IM/SQ may be warranted for prolonged bronchodilation action. Additional options such as terbutaline or glucocorticoids may be effective although the delayed effects from corticosteroid use must be appreciated.

# 4.9.3 Pulmonary Aspiration

Acute perioperative aspiration is defined as the passage of liquid or solid materials into the lower respiratory track.

Acute perioperative aspiration is rather rare with an estimated incidence of 1 in every 900-10,000 anesthetics, depending on the presence of specific risk factors

[154]. The risk of intraoperative pulmonary aspiration is directly related to patient and anesthetic factors, such as obesity, delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux disease, full stomach, and the use of non-intubated deep sedation/general anesthesia techniques. Factors of the aspirated contents associated with increased morbidity and mortality include decreased pH, increased volume, and the presence of particulate matter.

Preventive strategies include selective use of an intubated anesthetic technique, adherence to NPO guidelines, prokinetics and medications to normalize gastric acidity, rapid sequence inductions, and extubating patients after return of airway reflexes. Immediate management of pulmonary aspiration begins with recognition of liquid or solid material, usually originating from the stomach, being present within the airway. Additionally, the patient may demonstrate persistent hypoxemia, bronchospasm, peak airway pressures, and abnormal breath sounds all consistent with obstruction of the airway. Immediate evacuation of the offending debris from the airway, coupled with assessment of adequate ventilation and oxygenation, and increased  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  are essential. Strong consideration must be given for emergent securing of the airway, use of bronchodilators, and activation of emergency medical services for patients demonstrating respiratory distress. Substantial pulmonary aspiration most commonly leads to pneumonitis, aspiration pneumonia, and adult respiratory distress syndrome, which may require prolonged care in a hospital setting.

# 4.9.4 Laryngospasm

Intraoral surgery in the anesthetized non-intubated patient renders the patient susceptible to airway obstruction and airway irritation. Such irritation can result in laryngospasm, which is the apposition of the supraglottic folds, the false vocal cords, and the true vocal cords. The laryngospasm may be sustained and may become progressively worse as the supraglottic tissues fold over the vocal cords during forceful inspiratory efforts. The incidence of laryngospasm is 8.7 per 1000 patients in the total population and 17.4 per 1000 in patients  $< 9$  years of age [155].

The treatment of laryngospasm depends on whether the airway obstruction is complete or incomplete. The single diagnostic feature that distinguishes complete from incomplete airway obstruction is simply the absence or presence of sound. If there are inspiratory or expiratory squeaks, sounds, grunts, or whistles, then chances are the child has incomplete airway obstruction. Airway obstruction of either type requires initial treatment with a patency-preserving maneuver such as the jaw-thrust/chin-lift maneuver.

Because incomplete airway obstruction may rapidly become complete, signs and symptoms of obstruction (e.g., tracheal tug, paradoxical respiration) should be treated aggressively. The first maneuver is to apply gentle continuous positive airway pressure with  $100\% \mathrm{O}_2$  by facemask. An effective technique to deliver gentle positive pressure is to "flutter the bag." In this technique the reservoir bag is very rapidly squeezed and released in a staccato rhythm, similar to what one would see with an atrial flutter of the heart. In essence, one performs a manual high-frequency oscillatory ventilation with this technique. If the patient improves, anesthesia and normal ventilation may be resumed. Overuse of the high-pressure flush valve to fill the breathing circuit and anesthetic bag may dilute potent anesthetic gases (if being used) and lead to a lighter plane of anesthesia. In addition, high pressure applied to the airway may force gas down the esophagus and into the stomach, reducing ventilation even more. Positive airway pressure cannot "break" laryngospasm in the presence of complete airway obstruction and may, in fact, worsen laryngospasm by forcing supraglottic tissues downward to occlude the glottic opening.

For the laryngospasm that is refractory to continuous positive airway pressure, a neuromuscular blocking agent should be administered. The ideal agent should have rapid onset. For the non-intubated patient, rapid recovery is also desirable. Succinylcholine is the only neuromuscular blocking agent that provides these effects.

# 4.9.4.1 Succinylcholine

If intravenous access is available, succinylcholine  $0.5 - 1.0\mathrm{mg / kg}$  is administered. If intravenous access is not available, succinylcholine  $(4\mathrm{mg / kg})$  may be administered intralingually or intramuscularly [156]. Succinylcholine may cause bradycardia secondary to its muscarinic effect. When administering succinylcholine to a child who is hypoxemic, atropine  $0.02\mathrm{mg / kg}$  should precede its delivery to prevent a bradycardia secondary due to the muscarinic effect of succinylcholine. The administration of atropine should also be considered prior to a repeat dosing of succinylcholine in the adult patient to prevent bradycardia.

There are several potential complications associated with the use of succinylcholine. These include myalgias, malignant hyperthermia, masseter muscle rigidity, and hyperkalemic cardiac arrest in patients with undiagnosed myopathies. In some children the administration of succinylcholine can result in masseter muscle spasm. Masseter muscle spasm may indicate a susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, but it can also be isolated and not progress to malignant hyperthermia. The anesthetic

team needs to differentiate between an isolated spasm and a prodromal sign of an impending emergency to make a decision regarding the continuation of the anesthetic and surgical course. In a tertiary environment with appropriate monitoring, the anesthesia may be continued with observation for the development of other systemic signs reflective of the hypermetabolic state of malignant hyperthermia. Tachycardia is usually the earliest sign, whereas end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  is the most sensitive sign of malignant hyperthermia [157, 158].

Another potential life-threatening complication following the administration of succinylcholine is hyperkalemic cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemic cardiac arrest follows the administration of succinylcholine in patients with undiagnosed myopathies; succinylcholine induces rhabdomyolysis, which causes hyperkalemia leading to bradycardia/asystolic rhythm. Several case reports have appeared in the literature emphasizing this potential risk in the pediatric patient, which exists because Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies may go undiagnosed until the ages of 6 and 12 years, respectively [159, 160].

Alternative neuromuscular agents have been developed that can provide rapid onset and should be used for elective situations. Rocuronium may be used when succinylcholine is contraindicated. Its onset is rapid, however, with a considerably longer duration. The administration of lidocaine topically to the vocal cords may also be effective. Succinylcholine remains the most ideal drug for the management of laryngospasm and emergent tracheal intubation and is the essential drug for managing laryngospasm in the oral and maxillofacial surgery office.

# 4.9.5 Nausea and Vomiting

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a cause of morbidity in pediatric patients. Even mild PONV is associated with delayed discharge, decreased parental satisfaction, and increased use of resources. More severe complications associated with PONV include dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, or hypoxemia secondary to airway obstruction or aspiration. The incidence is variable depending on the age of the patient, the sex of the patient (there is a greater incidence in females  $>13$  years old), the anesthetic agents used (opioids, volatile agents), and the surgical procedure. Fortunately, severe or intractable PONV is less common, occurring in  $1 - 3\%$  of patients [161].

Anesthetic drug selection can have an effect on the incidence of PONV. Preoperative midazolam has been associated with reduced PONV [162]. Sub-sedative doses of propofol also provide antiemetic effects. This

contrasts with methohexital, which is associated with a higher incidence of PONV than with propofol. Premedication with opioid analgesics increases the risk of PONV. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in doses of  $5 - 20~\mu \mathrm{g / kg}$  is associated with PONV in almost all patients [150]. As discussed above, ketamine is an excellent agent for pediatric sedation. An unfortunate adverse effect associated with ketamine is a reported incidence of PONV that is as high as  $50\%$ . Nitrous oxide also has emetic effects. However, concentrations  $< 40\%$  are less likely to cause PONV.

Vomiting is a complicated response mediated by the emetic center located in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla. This center receives input from several areas within the CNS, including the chemoreceptor trigger zone, vestibular apparatus, cerebellum, higher cortical and brainstem centers, and solitary tract nucleus. These structures are rich in dopaminergic, muscarinic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and opioid receptors. Blockade of these receptors is the mechanism of the antiemetic action of drugs. Currently, there are no drugs known that act directly on the emetic center. Routine administration of antiemetic agents to all patients undergoing surgery is not justifiable as the majority do not experience PONV or have, at most, one or two episodes.

# 4.9.5.1 Phenothiazines

The phenothiazines are believed to exert their antiemetic effects primarily by antagonism of central dopaminergic receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Low doses of chlorpromazine, promethazine, and perphenazine are effective in preventing and controlling PONV. These drugs are frequently combined with opioids (when administered orally by pediatric dentists) to decrease the emetic effect of the opioid. All phenothiazines are capable of producing extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation, which may complicate postoperative care. The degree of sedation varies between phenothiazines, with little sedation produced by perphenazine compared with the other phenothiazines.

# 4.9.5.2 Benzamides

The benzamide derivative metoclopramide has antiemetic and prokinetic effects and is the most effective antiemetic of this class. Its antiemetic effects are mediated by antagonism of central dopaminergic receptors, and at high doses it also antagonizes serotonin-3 receptors. In the gastrointestinal tract metoclopramide has significant dopaminergic and cholinergic actions and increases motility from the distal esophagus to the ileocecal valve. High doses of metoclopramide are well tolerated by adults, but children are prone to dystonic

reactions. For this reason, metoclopramide is combined frequently with diphenhydramine to decrease this incidence (in the pediatric patient). Although metoclopramide has been used successfully to reduce the incidence of PONV in high-risk children, it is not as effective as droperidol or the newer serotonin antagonists [163].

# 4.9.5.3 Histamine Antagonists

The histamine receptor antagonists are weakly antiemetic drugs with profound sedative effects, which make them less suitable for use in postoperative patients. They are frequently combined with other anesthetic agents (for pediatric patients) in an oral cocktail for their sedative and antiemetic effects. These drugs may be useful for controlling emesis resulting from vestibular stimulation, as occurs in patients with motion sickness or after middle ear surgery. They also counteract the extrapyramidal effects of the more efficacious dopamine receptor antagonists.

# 4.9.5.4 Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists

The vestibular apparatus and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius are rich in muscarinic and histaminic receptors. Muscarinic receptor antagonism is effective in preventing emesis related to vestibular stimulation, which may be the mechanism of morphine-induced PONV. In adults the use of glycopyrrolate, a drug that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, has been associated with three times the need for rescue antiemetic therapy compared with atropine [164]. Transdermal scopolamine has been used successfully to reduce PONV receiving morphine but is associated with a significant increase in sedation and dry mouth [165]. Other potential side effects include dysphoria, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, and visual disturbances.

# 4.9.5.5 Serotonin Receptor Antagonists

Serotonin antagonists were discovered serendipitously when compounds structurally related to metoclopramide were found to have significant antiemetic effects but lacked dopamine receptor affinity. These drugs produce pure antagonism of the serotonin-3 receptor. Ondansetron was the first drug of this class to become available for clinical use in 1991. Since that time granisetron and dolasetron have been introduced. This class of pure serotonin-3 receptor antagonists is not associated with the side effects of dopamine, muscarinic, or histamine receptor antagonists. The most serious side effects of ondansetron are rare hypersensitivity reactions. Gastric emptying and small bowel transit time

were not affected by ondansetron. Asymptomatic brief prolongation of the P-R interval and the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram have been reported in adults, but rapid intravenous infusion of ondansetron in children was not associated with changes in heart rate, arterial pressure, or oxyhemoglobin saturation [166]. Psychomotor and respiratory functions were unaffected by ondansetron. Prophylactic ondansetron IV or orally reduced the incidence of PONV in patients after a variety of surgical procedures [167].

# 4.9.5.6 Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) exert antiemetic properties by a mechanism as yet unknown. These drugs have been used successfully in the postoperative setting to help prevent PONV. Intravenous dexamethasone has an antiemetic effect using suggested doses ranging from 4 to  $8\mathrm{mg}$  in adults and from 0.1 to  $0.15\mathrm{mg/kg}$  in pediatric patients [168, 169]. This class of drugs is better used in combination with another antiemetic than as the sole agent to prevent PONV. Additionally, the onset of the antiemetic effects can be quite prolonged so early administration, often immediately following induction, is generally recommended.

# 4.10 Postoperative Recovery and Discharge

The concept of office-based surgery is dependent on short surgery with a focus on rapid recovery. While concepts are similar for the non-intubated versus the patient with advanced airway intervention (e.g., LMA or intubation), this section will focus on the non-intubated patient. Recovery is a period of transition from administration of the last anesthetic agent and/or termination of surgery to discharge. The first stage in this transition is when the patient emerges from sedation and opens their eyes and responds to voice. Anesthetic monitoring during this time interval is a continuum from the perioperative period. The following parameters are assessed: ability to maintain independent airway patency, adequate ventilations, adequate oxygenation, and hemodynamic stability. At an appropriate time, the supplemental oxygen delivery should be discontinued, and the patient observed for the ability to maintain adequate oxygenation without supplemental oxygen. Intravenous access should be maintained and suction (with a Yankauer tip) should be readily available.

The surgeon should develop a process that can be used to assess the patient prior to discharge. Objective data for such a process should be established. The modi

fied Aldrete scoring system uses the following parameters: activity level, respiration, blood pressure, level of consciousness, and oxygen saturation [170]. These values should be within acceptable parameters when compared to the patient's baseline. Another parameter common amongst healthcare facilities is to wait a minimum time interval from the last anesthetic drug prior to discharge.

Inadequate pain and/or nausea and vomiting are factors which may delay discharge. Good local anesthesia (with a long-acting local anesthetic agent, if appropriate) is critical and is beneficial in managing postoperative pain as well as minimizing sympathetic stimulation, which can adversely affect hemodynamic stability and contribute to nausea and vomiting. Ensuring adequate intake is unnecessary in the typical healthy patient. However, attention to replacing the fluid deficit with intravenous fluids during the perioperative period is beneficial considering the patient may have impaired postoperative oral consumption. Ensuring that the medically compromised patient (e.g., diabetic) can take and maintain oral fluids has benefit.

# 4.11 Postoperative Analgesia

Postoperative analgesia is a constant challenge for the OMFS, requiring the development of a thoughtful, organized approach in order to provide the patient with the best possible perioperative experience. Several risk factors are associated with a patient's subjective perception of increased postoperative pain (Table 4.6). Recognizing these risks allows the surgeon to organize and educate the patient regarding an appropriate analgesic plan.

Evans et al. found that the evidence favors multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of two or more analgesics with different modes of action through the same or different mode of delivery [171]. An opioid prescribing protocol with procedure-specific guidelines has been shown to helpful in decreasing opioid prescriptions after third molar extraction. Recent studies suggest an acute postoperative pain opioid prescribing protocol leads to reduced opioid use postoperatively (fewer prescriptions, more prescribing consistency, and reduced overall opioid use) [172, 173]. A suggested protocol is presented in Fig. 4.3.

# 4.12 Special Considerations

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons treat a diverse group of patients. This section reviews the clinical presentation and anesthetic management of some patients with special considerations.

# 4.12.1 Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined as a persistent severe pattern of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms compared with other children at a comparable developmental level. Three subtypes of ADHD are identified: a predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type, a predominantly inattentive type, and a combined type. It is estimated to affect up to  $5\%$  of children. Medical therapy frequently includes psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, or pemoline. Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed drug for ADHD. In addition to its use in the management of ADHD,  $1 - 2\%$  of the US high-school population without a diagnosed medical condition is reported to abuse this drug [176]. These drugs increase the bioavailability of neurotransmitters. The drugs tend to cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Adverse effects are similar to that of other sympathomimetic agents. CNS effects include restlessness, dizziness, tremor, hyperactive reflexes, weakness, insomnia, delirium, and psychosis. Cardiovascular effects may include headaches, palpitations, arrhythmias, hypertension followed by hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Perioperative management of a patient on a psychostimulant (such as methylphenidate) includes recognizing signs and symptoms suggestive of inappropriate use. If there is a suggestion regarding overdose of the medication, the surgery should be postponed. However, when the medication is used appropriately, it is generally well tolerated. If there are no indications of adverse events, the medication should be continued throughout the perioperative period. The anesthetic management of these patients is dependent on the level of cooperation of the patient. Preoperative sedatives may be used. Many of these individuals allow the placement of an intravenous catheter. However, for the patient in whom intravenous access

cannot be established, ketamine (with or without midazolam) administered orally or IM is effective and not contraindicated owing to the chronic use of a psychostimulant.

# 4.12.2 Autism

Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first 3 years of life. The result of a neurologic disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, autism is the third most common developmental disability in the United States and occurs in approximately 2-4 per 10,000 live births [177]. Autism is four times more prevalent in boys than in girls and knows no racial, ethnic, or social boundaries. Family income, lifestyle, and educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's occurrence. Autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. The disorder makes it difficult for them to communicate with others and relate to the outside world [178, 179]. In some cases aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. Persons with autism may exhibit repeated body movements (hand flapping, rocking), unusual responses to people, or attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routines. Children with autistic disorders may include a subgroup of individuals with associated psychiatric symptoms, including aggression, self-abusive behavior, and violent tantrums and oftentimes necessitate the use of psychiatric medications; antipsychotics are the most prevalently prescribed medications in this group [180]. The autistic patient may also be prescribed medications similar to those prescribed for ADHD. Management of these patients in the oral and maxillofacial surgery setting requires respect for the autistic child's need for ritualistic behavior, which may result in tantrum-like rages with any disruptions of routine. Providing a calm environment with minimal stimulation and consideration of all associated pharmacologic influences aids in the management of these patients. Premedication with a benzodiazepine may be beneficial. However, establishing an intravenous access still may not be possible, and an alternative technique may be required. A mask induction with a potent vapor agent or intramuscular ketamine may be considered; however, the individual may be too physically strong and combative for these techniques. An alternative that should be considered (even in the non-combative individual) is oral administration of a premedicant of ketamine or ketamine and midazolam [100]. Alterations in management must be carried over into the postoperative period, in which many patients

with behavioral or mental impairments are more agitated. Restraint may be necessary to prevent premature removal of the intravenous line, wound disturbance, or self-injury.

# 4.12.3 Cerebral Palsy

Cerebral palsy is a group of neurologic disorders that are characterized by impaired control of movement. The clinical manifestations are variable and are dependent on the site and extent of injury. There are four classifications: spastic, athetoid, ataxic, and mixed. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form and affects up to  $80\%$  of the patients. Patients with spastic cerebral palsy present with muscle hypertonicity, hyperreflexia, muscle contractures, muscle rigidity, and muscle weakness. The pattern of dysfunction can be further classified into monoplegia (one limb), diplegia (both arms or both legs), hemiplegia (unilateral), triplegia (three limbs), and quadriplegia (all limbs). The severity of the contractures may result in spinal deformities such as scoliosis. Athetoid or dyskinetic cerebral palsy is characterized by choreiform, tremor, dystonia, and hypotonia. The involuntary movements seen with athetoid cerebral palsy often increase with emotional stress. Ataxic cerebral palsy is characterized by poor coordination and jerky movements.

Associated medical conditions include mental retardation, speech abnormalities, seizures, drooling, dysphagia, and gastroesophageal reflux [181]. Mental impairment is most common in patients with spastic cerebral palsy. It is important to recognize that  $>50\%$  of patients with cerebral palsy do not demonstrate mental impairment. Dysarthria or speech abnormalities secondary to a lack of coordination in muscle movement of the mouth can be seen in athetoid cerebral palsy. This muscle abnormality should not be confused with mental impairment. Seizures are seen in up to  $35\%$  of patients with spastic cerebral palsy. The lack of muscle coordination contributes to drooling and dysphagia. The inability to handle the secretions and the incompetent pharyngeal swallow reflex increase the risk of laryngospasm. Individuals with impaired neurologic function may also have an increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux. Several factors must be taken into consideration in treating these patients. The spasticity and lack of coordination can contribute to a hyperactive gag reflex. Anxiety can aggravate the involuntary movements. Nitrous oxide sedation may be effective in reducing these responses [182]. Severe contractures may make positioning the patient difficult. Contractures, which may result in scoliosis, can result in a restrictive lung disorder. The patient's hypotonia may necessitate stabiliza

tion of the head (even for the non-sedated patient). If the patient is to be sedated, muscle weakness may predispose the patient to impaired respirations. This may be compounded by medications prescribed to control the spasticity or seizure disorder. Conscious sedation may be contraindicated because of the inability to handle oral secretions and the risk of gastroesophageal reflux. It may be necessary to protect the airway with the placement of an endotracheal tube. In the event that the airway requires emergent intubation, the use of succinylcholine is not contraindicated [183].

It is important for the surgeon to remember that physical disabilities are not always associated with mental impairments. The healthcare provider must avoid treating these patients as if they were mentally impaired because of their inability to communicate normally.

# 4.12.4 Down Syndrome

Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is a common chromosomal disorder occurring at a rate of 1.5 per 1000 live births and is usually characterized by mild to moderate mental retardation, cardiovascular abnormalities, and craniofacial abnormalities. Craniofacial abnormalities that have an impact on the anesthetic management of these patients include macroglossia, micrognathia, and a short neck, putting these patients at increased risk for airway obstruction during sedation. Enlargement of the lymphoid tissue may also place these patients at risk for upper airway obstruction. In addition, these patients have generalized joint laxity that may be associated with subluxation of the temporomandibular joint during airway manipulation. Intubation is usually not difficult, but subglottic stenosis, which is present in up to  $25\%$  of Down syndrome individuals, may necessitate a smaller diameter endotracheal tube. Atlantoaxial instability occurs in approximately  $20\%$  of patients with Down syndrome, and airway maneuvers, such as neck positioning during anesthesia for airway opening or intubation, may induce a serious cervical injury (C1-2 subluxation). This cervical spine instability is a contraindication for routine treatment until both the patient and the treatment risks are fully evaluated. Sequelae to neurologic injury are usually characterized by significant symptoms or declining neurologic function without other neurologic disorder. Specific symptoms may include a positive Babinski sign, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, neck discomfort, and gait abnormalities. Down syndrome is associated with congenital heart disease in approximately  $40\%$  of its patients, and consideration of these abnormalities (endocardial cushion defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial

septal defect) in conjunction with their primary care physician is mandatory prior to proceeding with a surgical procedure.

# 4.12.5 Muscular Dystrophy

Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases of genetic origin, characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle function. There are nine types of muscular dystrophies, the most common and dramatic being Duchenne's disease (pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy). Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 2 and 5 years, often with the patient becoming wheelchair-bound by age 12 years. Death usually occurs between ages 15 and 25 years, usually secondary to pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Becker's muscular dystrophy is the next most common form of muscular dystrophy. Its manifestations are similar, although milder, to those of Duchenne's disease. Its onset is later, and the progression of the disease is slower. Time to onset of disease, being wheelchair-bound, and death are 12, 30, and 42 years, respectively [184]. The anesthetic management of these patients is complicated by muscle weakness contributing to poor respiratory function. Atrophy of the paraspinal muscles also leads to kyphoscoliosis (restrictive lung disease), which further restricts respiratory function. Pulmonary function tests should be considered as part of the preoperative assessment. Patients with functional vital capacities  $< 35\%$  of normal are at increased risk. Muscle weakness also contributes to obtunded laryngeal reflexes and an inability to clear tracheobronchial secretions. Patients are at increased risk for aspiration secondary to the obtunded laryngeal reflexes and delayed gastric emptying. Patients with muscular dystrophy may also have cardiovascular disorders. These include degenerative cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, and mitral valve prolapse. It is frequently difficult to assess cardiovascular function in these patients because they are usually wheelchair-bound and not sufficiently stressed. However, cardiac compromise must be considered, especially in an older individual. Anesthetic considerations must take into consideration the potential for underlying respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Succinylcholine is contraindicated because it can cause rhabdomyolysis with a resultant hyperkalemia. Although all patients may have

a slight increase in extracellular potassium after the administration of succinylcholine, the increase in a patient with muscular dystrophy can cause hyperkalemic cardiac arrest. The avoidance of succinylcholine and volatile inhalational agents is also recommended because of the association of Duchenne's disease with increased malignant hyperthermia. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be used; however, a prolonged recovery time is seen in patients with muscular dystrophy. The response to reversal agents is also variable. Additionally, patients are susceptible to an unexplained late respiratory depression. Ambulatory surgery may be unadvisable, but at a minimum requires prolonged observation prior to discharge [185].

# 4.13 Quality Assurance Protocols for Office-Based Anesthesia

To ensure safe, consistent, and predictable delivery of outpatient anesthesia care, the OMFS must implement quality assurance protocols so that the anesthetic team is fully prepared, well-rehearsed, and capable of appropriately handling in-office anesthetic emergencies. Busy schedules and time constraints further stress the office environment, requiring the surgeon and their team to balance clinical demands with the implementation of a culture of patient-centered safety. Since deficiencies in outcomes are associated more often with system deficiencies, rather than individual team-member limitations, the OMFS must implement appropriate systems and protocols to avoid the possible alignment of these deficiencies, as seen in the aforementioned Swiss cheese model (Fig. 4.4).

Fig. 4.4 Reason's Swiss cheese model

Office-based anesthesia quality assurance involves the implementation of an Emergency Preparedness Plan. As reported by Robert et al., this plan involves several key components, including (1) the development of well-designed checklists, with task delegation and delineation for each team member (see  $\square$  Table 4.7); (2) the incorporation of various cognitive/memory aids in the procedures and protocols for the management of medical and anesthetic emergencies (  $\square$  Fig. 4.5); and (3) conducting regularly scheduled emergency simulations to prepare and rehearse the office for potential emergencies [186]. Simulation of medical and anesthetic emergencies is a controlled rehearsal of a potential event. It allows for the anesthetic team to run through the treatment algorithms, team-member roles (  $\square$  Table 4.7), and coordination of activities while treating simulated emergencies in

a safe, controlled environment. Efficient management of emergency scenarios requires regular practice and skills assessment. For example, several studies have shown that ACLS skills rapidly decline, with only  $14\%$  of healthcare professionals remaining competent at 12 months from their most recent ACLS course [187]. Studies have shown that a properly implemented simulation curriculum for emergency management produces statistically significant improvements in confidence and communication in emergency situations [188]. In addition, to have the best outcomes possible, the simulation must include both educational and assessment/feedback of the simulated event. The assessment is critical, allowing clinician feedback and team input, in order to identify areas for improvement. The goals of simulation are delineated in  $\triangleright$  Box 4.1 [189].

# Summary

Ambulatory anesthesia in the patient can be safely achieved in the oral and maxillofacial surgery office. The oral and maxillofacial surgeon has an array of techniques that are available but must make selections that are appropriate for the patient, the planned surgical procedure, and the specific office.
