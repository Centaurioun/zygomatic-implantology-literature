# Learning Aims

- Understand the methods needed for treatment plan restoration of missing teeth using adjunctive techniques.  
- Understand the science supporting grafting methods.  
- Understand the methods and need for navigation for implant placement.

# Conclusion

The patient presents with a need for restoration of a single tooth or all of their teeth. This often includes implants to support the restoration. It is critical for the surgeon and restorative team members to plan appropriately, resulting in an esthetic, functional, and long-lasting solution. The implants must be placed in an ideal location with attention to depth of placement, angulation and emergence of the implants, and placement into a sound tissue bed. Diagnosis and treatment planning are keys to success when utilizing dental implants for patient care.

# 11.1 Introduction

Clinical Problem The patient presents with a need for restoration of a single tooth or all of their teeth. This often includes implants to support the restoration. It is critical for the surgeon and restorative team members to plan appropriately, resulting in an esthetic, functional, and long-lasting solution. The implants must be placed in an ideal location with attention to depth of placement, angulation and emergence of the implants, and placement into a sound tissue bed. Diagnosis and treatment planning are keys to success when utilizing dental implants for patient care.

# 11.2 Diagnosis and Treatment Planning

At the initial interview, the patient is asked what they are being seen for, their desires, and goals for the treatment to be rendered. They may ask for a functional restoration, removal of painful teeth, replacement of a single tooth, replacement of a fractured bridge, or replacement of all of their teeth. The clinician then decides on what imaging is required. A cone beam scan is taken with or without fiducials for navigation. A reduction in the potential total radiation dose results from taking the initial scan with the fiducials in place for possible implant placement using dynamic navigation.

An intraoral scan (IOS) may be taken to aid in virtual teeth placement and planning. The .stl file of the

IOS can be superimposed on the cone beam scan to allow for placement of virtual teeth in occlusion.

Photographs are taken to include teeth at rest and smile, lateral lip position, and standard intraoral views. Depending on the complexity of the case, a plan may be developed at the first visit or presented at a second visit after consultation with the team members.

At the first visit, the examination should include the following:

1. General status of the dentition. Which teeth are missing, which teeth are in need of removal, malposition of teeth, and other pertinent oral health findings.  
2. The gingiva is noted to be at an ideal position, receded, hypertrophic, inflamed, with exudate, and its thickness - thin or thick.  
3. The width and vertical height of the alveolar ridge is evaluated either adequate or deficient.

# 11.2.1 Radiographic Imaging

The cone beam scan is a standard method of evaluating the implant patient. Typical incidental findings that may be relevant to surgery include a narrow airway, prominent angles consistent with bruxism, septal deviations, sinus membrane thickening, sinus obliteration including ethmoid or even the sphenoid sinus, and carotid vessel calcifications. The status of the condyles is important to note as it is relevant for reestablishment of proper vertical dimension and vertical stability. The mandibular plane angle can alert the clinician to an overclosed patient with loss of vertical dimension.

# 11.2.2 Specific Evaluation of the Potential Implant Sites

# 11.2.2.1 Posterior Mandible

1. The location of the inferior alveolar canal – is it low adjacent to the inferior border of the mandible or within the middle portion close to the crest?  
2. The slope of the buccal and lingual cortices.  
3. The relationship of the crestal residual bone to the opposing ridge.  
4. The location of the canal in regard to the apex of a tooth to be removed.

The cone beam evaluation will help the surgeon plan for short implants (Fig. 11.1) with probable splinting, implants of longer length that can be treated as single units, or the need for onlay augmentation using interpositional osteotomies (Fig. 11.2) or particulate grafts with scaffolds [1].

Patient is 5 years without recurrence, desiring a fixed replacement of teeth. b Cross-section from cone beam scan shows  $8.8\mathrm{mm}$  of bone superior to the inferior alveolar canal. c

If the vertical height is sufficient yet the ridge is narrow, an augmentation procedure can be performed. This can include particulate grafting via a tunnel approach (Fig. 11.3), an open approach with onlay grafting, or a ridge splitting method [1].

# 11.2.2.2 Anterior Mandible

1. The width of the alveolar crest, the slope of the lingual and buccal cortices, and the height of the anterior mandible  
2. In dentate cases, the relationship of the residual bone in the incisor region to the bone levels on adjacent incisors  
3. The relationship of the alveolar crest to the opposing arch - class I, II, or III

4. The presence of anterior teeth with loss of posterior teeth resulting in anterior maxillary resorption  
5. The presence of keratinized attached gingiva on the crest where implant components will emerge

In the case where implants will be placed to support a full-arch prosthesis, it is critical to estimate the location of the planned teeth to the ridge. If necessary, ridge reduction may be necessary to provide space for the prosthesis parts. The required vertical space includes  $3\mathrm{mm}$  gingival height abutments,  $5 - 7\mathrm{mm}$  framework height, and  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  acrylic thickness to retain teeth. In some patients, attention is necessary to avoid emergence of the retaining screws too far labially or linguually.

# 11.2.2.3 Posterior Maxilla

1. Determination of the vertical bone height in the furcation region when a molar is to be removed  
2. Determination of the vertical bone height after the tooth has been removed  
3. The status of the sinus membrane - normal, minimally thickened, sinus disease present  
4. The integrity of buccal cortical bone  
5. The presence of apical pathology and infection  
6. The shape of the sinus - narrow or shallow

When a molar is to be removed, there may be adequate bone for immediate implant placement (Fig. 11.4), or less than  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of bone present, especially within the furcation. The roots are removed and an osteotomy performed, connecting the three root sockets. This interdental bone is then superiorly repositioned and a graft placed to achieve at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of bone height [2, 3].

If the teeth have been removed and the bone has healed, the amount of bone present is measured on the cone beam cross-sections. If there is  $5\mathrm{mm}$  or more bone present, then the ridge can be heightened using a crestal approach.

If there is significant sinus pathology present, it should be resolved prior to implant placement or grafting. If bone is lost on the facial aspect, it will need to be restored with grafting. A narrow sinus is more favorable for crestal approaches for augmentation compared to a shallow sinus [4].

# 11.2.2.4 Anterior Maxilla

1. The location of the facial gingival margin must be determined to be adequate or apical to the ideal.  
2. The thickness of the gingiva needs to be recorded.  
3. The horizontal position of the alveolar ridge needs to be determined as sufficient or deficient.  
4. The vertical position of the alveolar bone needs to be determined as sufficient or deficient.  
5. The position of the remaining teeth needs to be assessed for midline position, flaring, proportional spacing for ideal crown dimensions, and the bone levels on the remaining teeth for papilla support.  
6. The presence of the incisive canal in relation to the planned position of teeth needs to be assessed.  
7. The presence of cystic lesions needs to be determined prior to implant placement.

If the gingiva is apical to ideal, then the patient must be informed that an ideal gingival esthetic result may not occur. The patient may need vertical bone augmentation procedures performed to move the gingiva coronally. The thickness of the gingiva plays an important role in establishing the esthetic frame of the crown. A thick gingiva is stippled and pink, with less translucence than thin

gingiva. Thin gingiva is smooth, more red than pink, and prone to recession following resorption of the underlying bone (Figs. 11.5 and 11.6). Thin gingiva should be converted to thick gingiva by soft tissue grafting.

If the patient has horizontal bone deficiency, an augmentation procedure should be included in the treatment plan. When the ridge width is augmented, often there will be a small increase in the vertical height due to material placement as well as thickening of the gingiva from surgical scarring (Fig. 11.7). In some patients, this will decrease the need for a vertical augmentation procedure when the vertical discrepancy is less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ . If there is a vertical deficiency, this can be corrected but often masked by prosthetic materials.

The ridge form should mimic the convex ridge shape similar to the emergence of a tooth root. The presence of the anterior tooth root forms the convex ridge shape. The labial bone covering the root is very thin and prone to resorption after the tooth root has been removed. Thus, the strategy for optimizing this site includes the use of a material that will simulate the root and labial bone shape without significant long-term ridge resorption.

# 11.3 Implants in Regional Sites

# 11.3.1 The Single Tooth in the Esthetic Zone

# 11.3.1.1 Establishing the Goals

Each patient must be individually assessed to determine their expectations. If they have an esthetic tooth which needs replacement, it is natural for them to desire the same level of esthetics that they had prior to tooth removal. If they have gingival recession, swelling, or an obvious pathological condition, the patient may still expect an ideal result. It is the responsibility of the clinician to accurately predict the final result and communicate this with the patient.

If there is excessive gingiva recession, it will be very difficult to obtain an ideal gingival facial margin at the conclusion of the therapy. These patients may require orthodontic eruption of the tooth prior to its removal, hard and soft tissue grafting, osteotomies to coronally move the bone, and prosthesis modifications that included simulated gingiva.

Photographs are critical to document the initial findings prior to treatment. Photographs should include the following:

1. Lips relaxed and slightly opened, showing incisor show at rest  
2. The exposure of the incisor on an animated smile

3. Frontal, lateral, and occlusal views with appropriate retraction and mirrors as needed  
4. A lateral view with the lips open, showing the angulation of the anterior teeth and ridge

Often the implant patient is treated with special attention to the smile line. Patients with high smile lines need appropriate steps taken to achieve a natural appearance of the implant crowns, emerging from natural gingiva. Low smile patients have less need for a normal gingival level; however, many patients with low smile lines still desire a natural appearance of their restorations.

# 11.3.1.2 Determination of Bone Height and Width

The cone beam scan is the most efficient method to determine bone height and width (Fig. 11.8). The scan is taken and a spline is drawn on the axial view through the pulp chambers of the teeth. Cross-sectional views are made perpendicular to the spline curve. The width and height of the ridge can be seen and measured. The 3D view is used to visualize bone morphology, identify a concavity, and see how the bone morphology relates to the adjacent teeth. When the tooth is present,

the overlying labial bone may be seen or may appear absent. It is important to note that in some scans, the labial bone in a cross-section image may not be seen if the bone is less than  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  thick.

# 11.3.1.3 Relating the Cone Beam to Clinical Situation

If a tooth is present, it can be used as a reference for implant placement. If the tooth is not present, the cone beam scan can have virtual placement of teeth. After identifying the ideal locations of the incisor edge and the facial gingival margin, virtual implants can be placed in ideal locations. The digital method eliminates many of the lab procedures, which many dentists do not enjoy or have to pay extra for when setups are done by a laboratory technician. Surgical guides are fabricated to accurately place implants based on preoperative planning.

The digital process results in time-efficient planning. When navigation is then utilized, the patient benefits from less invasive surgery and accurate implant placement. Dynamic or static navigation guidance will result in more accurate implant placement compared to free-hand approaches [5-7] (Figs. 11.9 and 11.10).

# 11.3.1.4 Thin Gingiva and Its Conversion to Thick Gingiva

Thin gingiva recedes after minimal surgical intervention. If bone loss occurs after surgery, thin gingiva will move apically with the bone level, resulting in a nonesthetic situation. A thickened gingiva will recede less when bone resorbs and can be manipulated with provisional crown forms to result in esthetic crowns of appropriate length [8-12].

The clinical examination reveals the presence of thin gingiva. If the tissue is glossy and lacks stippling, it is usually thin. If the tissue is red and mobile, it is usually thin. If you can see a periodontal probe through the overlying gingiva, it is thin. To convert thin to thick tissue, a soft tissue graft or perhaps a soft tissue substitute material can be placed under the thin gingiva over the bone to augment the gingival thickness. The resultant thick tissue provides excellent long-term maintenance and health around implants [13].

# 11.3.1.5 When to Use Soft Tissue Grafts

A connective tissue (ct) graft is used to convert thin to thick tissue. It is usually a subepithelial connective tissue graft placed under thin facial gingiva [9, 10]. In animal studies, the cells within the connective graft may not survive. However, there is significant scar formation when the cells within the connective graft do not survive, creating a denser tissue than prior to the graft. A sham pro

cedure can also result in thicker tissue, but when a ct graft was placed, the sites had slightly thicker, more predictable conversion [14].

A common clinical situation for the use of a ct graft is when removing an anterior tooth which has lost labial bone and has thin overlying tissue, where gingival recession must be avoided. The patient with a high smile line and thin gingiva will have gingival recession if the tooth is removed and the thin gingiva is left without conversion. For these situations, the tooth is removed, the socket grafted with allograft or low-temperature dried xenograft, and a ct graft placed under the facial gingiva to convert thin to thick tissue. After the bone has formed, the implant can be placed flapless if the thickness of the tissue is adequate or with small incisions for addition of a non-resorbable graft as needed.

# 11.3.1.6 Labial Bone Loss in the Esthetic Zone

Labial bone loss may result in gingival recession, pocket formation with exudate, gingival inflammation, and tooth mobility. Labial bone loss is confirmed by examining the patient and the cone beam scan. Labial bone loss is often accompanied by thin gingiva. In order to achieve proper implant placement and esthetic results, the ridge contour must be reestablished by augmenting and reconstructing the lost bone with conversion of the thin gingiva to the thick gingiva. The reconstruction should allow the

implant to be placed in an ideal location without invading the incisive canals space. The reestablishment of a convex ridge contour should be stable over time.

Labial bone defects may be a small U-shaped defect or a large defect with minimal adjacent cortical bone. Thin labial bone is prone to resorb after a tooth has been removed. Thus, the clinical need for a graft material is to provide bone for implant integration, as well as

restoring ridge contour. The use of a graft using xenograft as the ridge contour material, combined with allograft within the socket which will turn over to form bone for implant integration, may be an optimal combination. When resorbable materials are used to restore ridge contour, such as allografts, autografts, or low-temperature dried xenografts, the graft should be overbulked, anticipating width resorption over time.

# 11.3.1.7 Specific Algorithms for Treatment

1. Lack of labial bone and thin gingiva at the time of removal of a tooth in the esthetic zone:

An incision is made in the sulcus. Conservative tissue reflection is made to the junction of the tooth and bone. The tooth is removed. A subperiosteal tunnel is created approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$  long in the apical direction, bordering on the adjacent teeth. A piece of foil from the suture pack is trimmed to match the desired dimensions of the graft. Using the template for guidance, a subepithelial connective tissue graft is harvested from the palate. An incision is made a few mm from the palatal aspect of the teeth in the molar to canine region. A submucosa dissection is made using a 15 blade just under the palatal gingiva, leaving a thickness of subepithelial tissue deep. After the mucosa is incised and dissected to form a pocket, the blade is used to incise through periosteum outlining the graft, which is removed. The palatal incision is

sutured to the undisturbed palatal tissue adjacent to the maxillary teeth [15].

A resorbable suture is passed from the vestibule, through the tunnel on the labial of the extraction site, through the connective tissue (ct) graft, and back through the tunnel, exiting in the vestibule. The ct graft is placed into the tunnel and the suture is tied, securing it in position. Allograft is placed into the socket and covered with the ct graft. Sutures are placed to secure the graft. This procedure provides bone for the implant placement and thickens the gingiva for long-term success of the esthetics of the gingival contour.

The abutment for all esthetics restorations should ideally be concave to form thick sulcular gingiva for long-term success. The soft tissue graft combined with the allograft is often all that is necessary. Occasionally adding sintered xenograft at the time of implant placement can further augment the gingival profile [16].

2. Thin bone on the labial after tooth removal and implant placement: If the tooth site in the anterior maxilla, for example, has intact facial bone, even if thin, with lack of purulent exudate, the tooth can be removed and an implant placed. Often the implant is smaller in diameter than the tooth, and since it is placed along the palatal aspect of the socket, there is usually a space between the implant and the intact labial bone. The gap between the implant and intact thin labial bone is grafted, usually with xenograft (Fig. 11.7). Low- and high-temperature xenograft can be used. Allograft used for gap grafting may be more prone to resorption over time. When the thin labial bone resorbs, the underlying xenograft is resistant to resorption and is usually embedded with scar tissue, which acts to "thicken" the overlying gingiva.  
3. Gingival recession with the need for  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of coronal movement of the gingival margin (  $\square$  Fig. 11.7): The patient presents with recession on the tooth to be removed. There is a loss of labial bone covered with thin tissue, which is the classic scenario for recession accompanied by bone loss. There are several options. The tooth can be extruded, which allows the gingiva to move coronally. After the extruded tooth is held in

place until the soft tissue stabilizes, the tooth can be removed and the implant placed. Xenograft can be used to fill a gap and to augment the crestal area. A second option is to make a sulcular incision with release of a flap. This can be accomplished by using vertical releasing incisions or sulcular incisions extending the flap two teeth from the extraction site. The tooth is removed, and the socket is grafted with allograft with contour augmentation using a xenograft. After 4 months for bone healing, the implant is placed with another small flap. The flap is relaxed and is advanced to cover a healing abutment. If sutured without tension, the advanced tissue can remain intact over the implant, resulting in coronal advancement of the facial gingival margin (troy patient).

4. Immediate placement of implant at the time of tooth removal: The patient presents with a tooth in need of removal. There are no signs of active infection. There is cone beam scan evidence of at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of bone available after the tooth is removed (Fig. 11.11). A viable option is to remove the tooth with preservation of the bone between the root sockets, followed by careful implant site preparation to preserve and compact bone for implant placement and stability.

# 11.3.2 Grafting Material Characteristics

1. When grafting a tooth socket, the graft should maintain the space of the extraction site. By maintaining the space within the socket with the graft material, bone can repopulate the graft and thus recreate bone volume similar to pre-extraction size. The graft should have osteoconductive features.  
2. Bone formed within the graft should allow stable placement of the implant within a reasonable period of time such as 3-5 months, depending on the size of graft and the size of defect.  
3. The rate of bone formation over time should be taken into consideration to plan the sequencing of therapies, such as implant placement, additional contour grafting, and pontic and site development.  
4. The material should be relatively inexpensive, should be readily available, and should not transfer pathologic conditions.

# 11.3.2.1 Xenograft

Bovine-, porcine-, or equine-derived bones are xenografts.

Clinical situations requiring bone augmentation include but are not limited to the following:

1. Restoration of bone volume after tooth removal  
2. Vertical height restoration for placement of implants in the posterior maxilla by grafting the inferior aspect of the sinus floor  
3. Restoration of bone width for a narrow alveolar ridge (  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 11.10)

The method of processing does change the material's behavior. Allograft bone material used for grafting is bone from humans, which is cleaned and dried through lyophilization, at cold temperature. Its crystallinity is low and will resorb over time.

Xenograft bone material is provided to the clinician as a sterile product in different lot sizes and different particle sizes. The size of the particle ranges in general from less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  or greater than  $1\mathrm{mm}$ .

The method for processing xenograft bone can affect its resorption characteristics as well as its osteoconductivity. The processing method should result in a graft that promotes uneventful healing and osteoconductivity for bone formation. An overall general characteristic is that the resultant graft must be anorganic. All remnants of the donor animal must be removed to minimize antigenic responses.

Variables effecting healing and bone formation include the pore size within the xenograft particles, the grain size of the mineral phase, surface morphology, and the crystallinity of the material [17].

Donor bovine, equine, or porcine animals are euthanized and their long bones collected. The bone is cut into small pieces and dried. The cortical and the marrow bone are often separated to provide either cortical or cancellous graft material. The bone is "degreased" by copious washes in solvents that remove the lipids, proteins, and collagen on the bone. The bone is washed copiously and the final anorganic process involves heat treatment [18]. As the crystallinity and density of the processed xenograft increases due to the processing method, the resorption of the material will be slower [19].

Different manufacturers have their own specific protocols for bone preparation. The heat drying process may involve room temperature, temperatures between 250 and  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  [17, 18], or temperatures ranging from 900 to  $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . At these temperatures, the resultant bone is a calcium phosphate material with a lower crystallinity compared to synthetic calcium phosphates sintered at high temperatures under pressure [19]. When the final heat treatment is at a higher temperature, the calcium phosphate crystals in the xenograft have a high crystallinity and hence slow resorption [20-23].

Lower-temperature heated xenografts will have a faster resorption rate in situ compared to xenografts heated at higher temperatures [24]. This may be important to consider when choosing a xenograft for a specific clinical indication.

# 11.3.2.2 Surface Characteristics

The ability of bone to form on a material and intermingle with the graft can be termed "osteoconductivity." It may be important for the surface morphology of a graft material to be similar to native bone. A comparison of osteoconductivity and grain size was performed on a xenograft from the same source yet processed differently. The graft, heat processed at  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , had greater osteoconductivity compared to a graft specimen that was heat processed at  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The grain size of the surface at  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  was similar to native bone. The grain size of the material heat processed at  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  had a larger grain size. The authors propose that when the grain size of the processed xenograft is similar to native bone, then bone formation osteoconductivity will be enhanced, compared to when processed at a higher temperature with grain size enlargement [17].

Pore size will have an effect on bone tissue formation. Pores greater than  $50~\mathrm{um}$  favor osteogenesis because of vascularization with cell recruitment. Interconnecting pores may be beneficial for bone formation within graft material [18, 24].

Removal of organic materials may be achieved in a two-stage process with heating at  $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , followed by sintering above  $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The incorporation of bone

within the particles treated by two heat treatments was confirmed in a sinus graft study by Nevins et al. [25]. The specific methods of processing will affect surface morphology of a material. The material referenced [25, 26] maintained surface characteristics of native bone even though treated at high temperatures [25, 26].

The clinician should choose a xenograft whose characteristics match the clinical need. If resorption is desired such as within a socket, use a xenograft dried at a relatively low temperature. If the xenograft is to be used in the sinus where space maintenance is critical and a slow resorption rate is useful, use a xenograft that will resorb but slowly due to moderate heat treatment. If ridge contour is needed, choose a xenograft that has been heat treated at higher temperatures with maintenance of grain size and surface topography, resulting in very slow resorption.

The xenografts that are available have different processing protocols that can affect the material's behavior in situ. The surface morphology of these materials is not well documented in the literature. The grain size and the true pore size of these materials, with documentation of its effect on bone conductivity, are not readily available to the clinician. Randomized clinical or even large case series comparing these variables are not available. Clinicians should ask the manufacturers to provide this information so they can choose a material for grafting based on its biologic profile rather than marketing information.

# 11.4 Restoration of Bone Volume After Tooth Removal

Within the socket, use a low-temperature processed xenograft or allograft. For ridge contour, consider an onlay with a higher-temperature processed xenograft. For the gap, use either a low- or high-temperature xenograft.

# 11.4.1 Vertical Height Restoration for Placement of Implants in the Posterior Maxilla by Grafting the Inferior Aspect of the Sinus Floor

All xenografts work in the sinus. There is evidence that the higher-temperature xenografts may have less resorption over time, but the clinical data does not show a clinical difference. Often the bone around the roots of a maxillary molar preserves bone in that specific area. There may be less bone within the area of the furcation. When there is less than  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of bone in the furcation

area, the furcation bone can be isolated with osteotomies and gently elevated by tapping into the sinus, thus augmenting the vertical bone available for implant placement (Fig. 11.12).

# 11.4.2 Restoration of Bone Width for a Narrow Alveolar Ridge

The low-temperature processed xenografts have a tendency for resorption between time of placement and implant placement. High-temperature processed xenografts may be preferred for this application due to their low rate of resorption characteristics.

Sintering is removal of organic material by heating the graft under pressure. This increases the crystallinity of the graft material, resulting in a very slow resorption rate. Clinically, a sintered material is non-resorbable. Xenograft is used to preserve ridge form and to augment the thin ridge [27, 28]. The relatively inert nature of this material delays revascularization and subsequent bone formation compared to more natural materials, such as autogenous bone.

# 11.5 Grafting the Extraction Site

# 11.5.1 Mineralized Bone Allograft

Human mineralized bone in particulate form can preserve a significant portion of an extraction site's bone bulk and volume in preparation for the placement of implants. The advantages of an allograft are (1) the graft material is readily available without the need for a second surgical harvest site and (2) the material is osteoconductive. Over time, the allograft resorbs and, it is hoped, replaced with bone [29, 30].

Human mineralized bone is available as particulate cortical or cancellous bone. The recommended particle size ranges from 250 to 750 microns. Particles smaller than  $250~\mu \mathrm{m}$  tend to flow with blood out of the site. Particles larger than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  tend to have sharp edges since they are not round and can be shed through the mucosa.

Allografts are prepared by bone banks. Human long bone is collected under sterile conditions. The bone is cut into pieces with separation of the cancellous and cortical bone. The bone is processed using detergents to remove blood, lipids, cells, and marrow components, leaving the mineral phase of the bone. The bone is copiously washed with water, sieved to size, lyophilized, and stored in sterile containers. Allografts are not heated to avoid denaturation of osteoinductive proteins with the graft material [31, 32].

When placed in an extraction site, mineralized bone graft material is still present at 4 months [33]. However, the bone forming around the mineralized bone particles usually is sufficiently mineralized to allow immediate provisionalization, with adequate primary stability after placement of the implant in the extraction site grafted with a mineralized allograft.

One goal of grafting of the extraction site is retention and preservation of the original ridge form and maintenance of the crestal bone after the implants have been restored. In one study in which no membrane was used at the time of extraction site grafting, the grafted sites felt "bone hard" at 4 months and appeared to be filled with bone [33]. However, long-term studies are not confirming maintenance of ridge contour in the anterior maxilla when the thin labial bundle bone resorbs naturally after tooth removal [34, 35]. When the labial bone is not present or minimally present, allograft may resorb, resulting in a flat ridge rather than a ridge with convex form. In these situations, an onlay of low- or high-temperature dried xenograft is recommended.

A successful technique to cover a grafted site, such as premolars, canines, incisors, and the maxillary palatal root sites, uses the additional use of a fast-resorbing collagen material to retain the graft and promote epitheli-

alization over the graft. In these sites, it is often preferred to avoid a large flap to avoid displacement of the esthetic band of keratinized gingiva and to avoid vascular compromise to the thin facial bone. The graft can be covered with a fast-resorbing hemostatic collagen material that resorbs in less than 7 days [16]. In mandible molar sites and for coverage of the buccal root sites for maxillary molars, coverage with advancement of the gingiva is recommended with the periosteum used to retain the graft in the extraction socket. Membranes can be used depending on clinician preference; however, membranes may require additional dissection and removal with a second surgical intervention and can add another material which can become infected.

# 11.6 Concave Bone Deformities: Tunneling Versus Open Approaches

The narrow ridge in the anterior maxilla often requires horizontal augmentation for ideal implant placement (Figs. 11.8, 11.9, and 11.10).

In order to augment bone, the bone surface must become exposed to the graft material in order for the

graft to become stabilized with osseous tissue ingrowth. Exposure of the bone can be accomplished with open approaches that include crestal or vestibular incisions with full-thickness flap reflection for direct visualization of the crest and facial bone. The augmentation is accomplished and often requires membrane or other scaffold placement to hold the graft in the desired position. The inner aspect of the elevated flap may require relaxing incisions to allow for a tension-free closure. The incisions, closed under minimal tension, will heal as long as there is no pressure on the incision line, swelling does not open the incision, the graft becomes vascularized, and the scaffold/membrane does not become exposed during the healing period [36-38].

# 11.6.1 Treatment of Concave Congenitally Missing Lateral Incisors

The patient presents for replacement of congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisors. Implants can only be placed after the patient has stopped growing. It is absolutely contraindicated to place implants into the alveolar bone in isolated tooth sites prior to growth completion. In the patient still growing, provisional pontics bonded to adjacent teeth are esthetic and functional and maintain space from prior orthodontic treatment.

A cone beam scan is used to access bone width. Periapical radiographs are used to assess root parallelism. Often there is a concave bone defect in the lateral incisor sites that requires augmentation prior to implant placement. In many of these patients, the gingiva may be thin, requiring a secondary ct graft after or during implant placement.

Open approach: This approach uses a crestal incision combined with either sulcular incisions around the adjacent teeth or vertical relaxing incisions. If a vertical relaxing incision is used, it is advised to locate it away from the graft. The flap is reflected full thickness to the piriform rim.

The graft is then placed. A block of bone harvested from the ramus can be used but if mostly cortical may be prone to late resorption. Another option is the use of a slow-resorbing foil (Sonic weld, KLS Martin, Jacksonville Florida). Resorbable tacks are placed, and the resorbable foil is "welded" to the tacks, spanning the defect. Bone graft material of clinician choice is placed. It is the author's choice to use a high-temperature xenograft. The graft can be hydrated using the patient's serum if desired. Six months after, the graft implants are placed. It is always preferred to avoid lifting a flap on the labial to eliminate graft displacement, which may be adherent to the flap.

The closed approach is discussed in the following discussion.

# 11.6.2 The Tunnel Approach

Prior to implant utilization, edentulous patients were augmented to provide improved denture retention. When an edentulous jaw was augmented using open approaches, complications did occur and included incision breakdown and loss of the graft, or resorption of a solid piece of graft material. This led clinicians to use a closed or tunnel approach to maintain the peripheral attachments of the tissue, maintain graft position, maintain crestal tissue continuity to avoid incision dehiscence, and lower the overall morbidity for the patient. The history of ridge augmentation for the edentulous patient provides support for utilizing tunneling procedures for ridge augmentation for the implant patient [39]. Augmentation of the ridge with particulate materials requires maintenance of the peripheral tissue attachments within the tunnel (Figs. 11.8, 11.9, and 11.10) and careful attention to placing the graft under periosteum directly on the bone surface [40-43].

Particulate grafting using an open approach can result in excellent results, as long as the clinician performing the procedure has been appropriately trained for this technique-sensitive approach [44-47].

For horizontal ridge augmentation for implant placement and positioning, augmentation can include an open procedure to expose the bone, with placement of blocks or particles of bone and/or other graft materials, with an assortment of membranes or meshes. These procedures exposed the bone after full-thickness tissue reflection with appropriate tissue release for tension-free closures. Patients do have swelling and discomfort after extensive tissue manipulation, which was necessary using an open approach. However, the open approach does increase the complication rate secondary to incision dehiscence and graft exposure. This has historically been the lesson when augmenting edentulous patients using an open approach.

When augmenting the narrow posterior mandibular ridge, a tunnel approach has been shown to provide for maintenance of graft positioning and minimize tissue trauma. Patient morbidity is low, incision dehiscence rate is low, and the success is similar to successful open procedures [48-50]. Patients had more postoperative visits, an increase in antibiotic usage, swelling, and discomfort and a larger dehiscence rate when an open approach was compared to a closed approach [50].

Vertical incisions with no horizontal crestal component allow for adequate access to the bone in the anterior and posterior regions of the maxilla and mandible.

Maintenance of the crestal tissue allows for preservation of ridge anatomy without movement of the attached tissue from the crest. One vertical incision in the lateral aspect of the maxilla followed by development of a tunnel can provide access for sinus augmentation procedures as well as lateral augmentation using autogenous bone to shape the graft. Khoury's method is an example for the use of a subperiosteal tunnel to gain access to atrophic bone for augmentation [51-57]. This method has been confirmed to be successful with minimal complications [58-60].

In the anterior maxilla, augmentation of concave regions of bone provides the ridge for ideal esthetic implant restoration. These concave regions can be isolated to the crest or apical near the piriform rim or include the ridge from the crest to the piriform rim. A vertical midline incision in the frenum to the anterior nasal spine can be used to gain access to the concave bone defect. The periosteum is incised on either side of the anterior nasal spine. A subperiosteal dissection is accomplished through the midline incision to create a tunnel, which can extend from canine to canine teeth regions. The tunnel is formed maintaining soft tissue attachments to allow for stable graft position maintenance with minimal migration. When developing the tunnel close to the junction of the attached and unattached mucosa, great care is taken to avoid perforation of the gingiva. Instruments with gentle curves and shape may be needed to allow for complication-free elevation of tissue. This procedure has been well described by Zadeh [61-63].

Why the vertical midline incision rather than a horizontal incision? When a horizontal incision heals, scar contracture can create changes in lip position at rest or during animation. The vertical midline incision within the frenum allows for an esthetic result with minimal scar formation (Figs. 11.8 and 11.9).

# 11.6.3 Surgical Technique

The tunnel approach for the anterior maxilla is created through a vertical incision usually in the midline, in the unattached mucosa. There are no crestal incisions. A cone beam scan is useful to ascertain where the graft is needed regarding the crestal or apical regions. The crestal bone width may be adequate with concave alveolar form in the apical region. Another clinical situation is a narrow crestal portion as well as a concave alveolar form.

Local anesthesia is infiltrated. A hydropic dissection with the local anesthetic is useful at the junction of the attached and unattached gingiva. Palatal anesthesia may not be necessary.

A 15 blade is used to make a vertical incision in the midline, often bisecting the frenum. Sharp dissection is performed to incise the periosteum over the anterior nasal spine. The incision is inferiorly extended to the junction of the attached and unattached gingiva if necessary. The attached gingiva adjacent to the free gingival margin of the central incisor should not be incised.

A small, smooth tipped periosteal elevator is used to elevate the periosteum from the bone. The tunnel is developed with a guidance of a finger over the mucosa, allowing the clinician to feel where the tunnel's margins are being developed. After the distal and superior aspects of the tunnel have been completed, the clinician very carefully elevates the gingiva at the junction of the unattached and attached gingiva as necessary for a smooth transition along the ridge. For some patients, curved or angled instruments are needed to allow for controlled elevation.

After the tunnel is completed, it is checked to confirm adequate superior tissue elevation. This is critical to avoid trapping periosteum between the graft and the bone. A syringe is used to deliver the graft. The opening of the syringe is beveled using a blade. The bevel can be placed against the bone to deliver the graft under the periosteum.

The graft is delivered and firmly compacted over the concave portion of the ridge. The incision is closed with resorbable suture. Antibiotics are administered for 1 week (Fig. 11.8).

Vertical incisions can be made in the canine regions as well to provide access to the posterior thin ridge and the anterior ridge through a common incision. With the appropriate incision length, access to the premolar region will allow simultaneous sinus graft procedures as well as lateral or vertical augmentation [51-57]. Soft tissue grafts can also be placed with or without hard tissue grafting [61-63]. This approach is very versatile.

# 11.7 The Mandibular First Molar

This is the most common tooth to have an implant placed. The approach for other teeth is similar, so attention to detail in this chapter will focus on this extraction site (Fig. 11.11).

The patient is examined and a cone beam scan is obtained, typically with a patient tracking array clip at the time of scanning. This scan decreases the need for additional scanning if a one-stage procedure is needed. The tooth site is evaluated for the presence of active purulence, apical lesions, osteolysis, the level of the buccal cortical bone, and the location of the inferior alveolar canal in relation to the tooth roots. In this author's practice,  $15\%$  of mandibular first had immediate implant place

ment at the time of tooth removal (non-published data). The majority of molars to be removed had the need for reestablishment of bone quality and quantity for ideal implant positioning and optimal restorative care.

# 11.7.1 Grafting the Molar Site

After local anesthesia, a sulcular incision is made combined with vertical release incisions. A flap is elevated to expose the interface of the tooth and bone and to allow for a periosteal release for primary closure of the site, which is performed prior to tooth removal to allow for hemostasis. The tooth is removed preserving as much bone as possible, usually using the periotome tips on the piezosurgery unit or a drill to section and remove roots with minimal bone removal. Curettage is performed to remove granulation tissue taking care to avoid entry into the nerve canal. Allograft is placed into the socket and the flap is advanced to be sutured to the lingual tissue. The keratinized gingiva is banked to the lingual and will be repositioned to the labial when the implant is placed after bone healing has occurred.

Typically after 3 months, a new cone beam scan is taken with the patient tracking array in place, allowing for navigated implant placement 3-4 weeks later. At the time of implant placement, an incision is made at the junction of the keratinized banked tissue and the lingual tissue, allowing for its relocation to the labial.

# 11.7.2 Immediate Implant Placement in the Mandibular Molar Site

Preoperative evaluation includes a cone beam scan to determine the presence of intact buccal and lingual bone, the location of the inferior alveolar canal, the size of the molar roots, and the presence or absence of osteolysis. After local anesthesia is administered, which includes an inferior alveolar nerve block, this author uses a sulcular incision with vertical releasing incisions, followed by a full-thickness flap reflection. The tooth is then removed with preservation of the bone. This may necessitate the use of a periotome-like tip on the piezosurgery device or the use of a thin fissure bur to allow for elevation of the roots from the sockets with preservation of the interseptal bone.

The patient tracking array is then placed, and under dynamic navigation guidance, the entry site is created using a small round bur with a sharp tip. The pilot bur is then used to depth as delineated on the navigation screen based on preoperative planning.

This author prefers bone preservation rather than removing it (Fig. 11.11). A series of osseodensification burs are used to recountour the interseptal bone by bending it and recounturing it, with no bone removal. The implant is then placed. If there is space in the gap between the implant and the mesial and distal bone allograft is placed to decrease the potential of soft tissue invagination into the site.

# 11.8 Quadrant Multiunit Restorations on Implants

The patient presents with loss of adjacent molars and/or premolars in one quadrant. They would like to have a fixed prosthetic solution to avoid extrusion of opposing teeth and the need to wear a removable prosthesis. Surgeons need to understand where to place implants so they are under the teeth to avoid embrasures and allow for a screw-retained retrievable prosthesis.

The implants should emerge through the central fossa of the teeth to be restored. The final positions of the teeth will need to be determined prior to placing the implants. The analog method includes using articulated models with a setup of the proposed teeth. This setup is duplicated, and a laboratory fabricated stent is made usually using a vacuum form material. The surgeon uses the vacuum form stent to guide implant placement.

In order to see where the bone is under the planned prosthesis, a radiopaque material can be used when the patient is scanned prior to surgery (Fig. 11.12). A freehand approach can be adequate for many patients as long as a stent is used to avoid implant placement in embrasures.

Ideally, the scanned prosthesis can be converted to a precise guide. This requires software to place the implants using the emergence of the implants through the radiopaque setup to guide creation of holes within the stent to more accurately guide the implant placement. All analog methods require laboratory support, increase the time from exam to implant placement, and still have less accurate implant placement compared to navigated approaches [64].

The digital method avoids the laboratory portion, takes less than 30 minutes of staff and clinician time, and results in a navigated approach to place implants in their correct positions. The cone beam scan is taken with a patient tracking array (clip) in the patient's mouth. No tooth setup is placed. An intraoral scan is taken with a handheld scanner to include the mandibular and maxillary arches and a bite registration. This intraoral scan is converted to an .stl file which shows the occlusion.

The DICOM dataset of the cone beam scan is uploaded into the navigation computer software. The .stl files are then superimposed on the cone beam scan. This is accomplished by matching tooth-specific sites, like a cusp tip or a fossa, for both the .stl image and the cone beam scan. Three points are needed to superimpose the two images. The result is a clear image of the patient's teeth in occlusion.

The clinician then sets virtual teeth in the missing locations in occlusion since the opposite arch teeth are included in the superimposed images. After the virtual teeth are sized and positioned as necessary, virtual implants are placed with ideal emergence. The surgery is then performed using the normal navigation methods.

The same process can be used for static guides fabricated by a manufacturer and their planning software or in-office printed guides. The intraoral scan allows for the patient's arches to be clearly visualized in occlusion. Most cone beam scans used for navigation are taken with the jaws separated to avoid scatter interference from the teeth. The intraoral scans create a set of clean images like a photograph, which are easily superimposed over the bone of the cone beam scan. The time needed to take an intraoral scan is approximately 10 minutes, the software superimposition and implant planning takes less than 15 minutes, and the result is an accurate, time-efficient method to plan these cases.

# 11.8.1 Surgical Method

Incisions should be made to preserve keratinized gingiva (KG) and to ensure that the abutment is surrounded by KG after placement. In the mandible, the incision should bisect the band of KG on the crest and with the aid of releasing incisions allow for its placement adjacent to the implant healing abutment. In the maxilla, the band of KG is often quite wide, allowing for an incision to be made with an outline of a curvilinear portion to match to the curve of the healing abutment. Unless a large graft is performed at the time of implant placement, or the patient will be using a tissue borne removable prosthesis, healing abutments are placed to avoid a second-stage surgical procedure.

After the crestal bone is exposed, the implants are placed. When possible, the implant may be placed  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  subcrestal. This will result with improved crestal bone levels after the implants have integrated [65, 66]. Healing abutments can be placed with the gingival margins re-approximated. Anatomic shaped abutments can also be placed to shape the subgingival sulcus during the healing period, resulting in excellent contour matching final crown designs.

# 11.9.1 Surgery of the Anterior Mandible

# 11.9.1.1 Placement of Two to Five Implants in the Anterior Mandible

# (Figs. 11.13 and 11.14)

Patients who are totally edentulous in the mandible may not be able to consume a normal textured diet because of mobility of their denture.

The placement of endosseous implants into the anterior mandible is an excellent therapy for an implant-supported reconstruction, restoring the ability of these patients to consume a normal-textured diet. An improved diet results in normal nutritional intake, improved health, and greater self-confidence.

The options for the patient include (1) a conventional denture; (2) a tissue-borne, implant-supported prosthesis; or (3) an implant-borne and implant-supported prosthesis. The conventional denture is a viable option for many patients, especially those with financial limitations.

The tissue-borne removable prosthesis can be placed over one to five implants. Most often, two or four implants are used for a tissue-borne prosthesis (Fig. 11.13). The implant-borne prosthesis usually requires the placement of four to five implants in the anterior mandible anterior to the mental foramen (Fig. 11.14). For posterior mandibular implants, adequate bone must be available superior to the inferior alveolar nerve. After an informed patient has made the decision, surgery is scheduled.

# 11.9.2 Evaluation of Anatomy: Physical Examination of the Patient Without Teeth

After reviewing the patient's medical and dental history, the surgeon performs a physical evaluation, focusing on the anatomy of the mandible. The range of opening of the patient's mouth is recorded. Limitations in opening may affect the treatment plan in extreme conditions. The general health of the intraoral soft tissues is evaluated. Any undiagnosed pathologic condition or dental infection, as well as mucosal infections, must be treated to completion before implant placement.

The soft tissue attachments of the floor of the mouth and the mentalis musculature are noted. The width of the band of keratinized gingiva (KG) on the alveolar crest is documented. The distance from the crest to the

junction of the attached and unattached mucosa is recorded (Fig. 11.13). Examination of the soft tissues is important to determine the need for vestibuloplasty, either before or at the time of implant placement.

The locations of the submandibular ducts are evaluated to ensure that they will not be violated during the procedure. The locations of the mental foramina are palpated and, if necessary, transferred to a diagnostic cast for further planning.

The slopes of the labial and lingual cortices are palpated. The location of the genial tubercles is noted. In a relaxed vertical position of the jaws, the relationship of the anterior mandible to the maxilla is observed to determine the benefits of positioning the implants to correct or mask a class II or class III skeletal jaw relationship. The surgeon should be able to discuss with the patient the planned location of the implants and the need for an adjunctive soft tissue procedure, such as a simultaneous vestibuloplasty.

# 11.9.3 Evaluation of Anatomy: Radiologic Examination of the Patient Without Teeth

A cone beam scan is very useful to determine the specific anatomical morphology of the mandible. This scan will show the slope of the cortices, location of the mental foramen, course of the nerve as the nerve enters and exits the mandible from the foramen, and amount of bone present posterior to the foramen.

The lateral views show the mandibular plane angle, which is used to assess vertical dimension of the patient. In a class II mandible, the implants can be angled forward, and in a class III mandible, the implants can be retro-angled to potentially provide a class I dental setup. The anteroposterior view shows asymmetry but also the position of the angles. Patients with prominent angle regions often have parafunctional habits, which need to be taken into consideration when restoring patients.

Axial views of the mandible are useful to determine the course of the nerve. By moving through these axial images, one can see the course of the nerve and understand the forward extent of the loop. Each patient is unique, and this view helps avoid nerve injuries.

The temporomandibular joint views are useful to ensure adequate joint stability and to eliminate future problems secondary to erosive condylar morphology associated with osteoarthritis. A patient who is planned for extensive implant reconstruction may have a long history of posterior occlusal loss, which can be associated with vertical dimension changes in the joints. A stable joint will be easier to treat than one with erosive changes. This is important patient information to recognize before the implant reconstruction because vertical changes may be necessary preoperatively or within the provisional prosthesis.

# 11.9.4 Surgical Treatment for Placing Implants in the Mandible

If a two-stage approach is used, then an incision can be made either bisecting the band of KG on the crest, or a vestibular incision can be used for simultaneous vestibuloplasty using a traditional "lipswitch" approach. A two-stage approach is preferred when the patient will be wearing a provisional prosthesis such as a denture. This avoids trauma to healing abutments.

For an immediate loading case, the band of keratinized gingiva must be repositioned so the abutments are surrounded by keratinized gingiva.

When the mandible is  $12\mathrm{mm}$  or less in height, an incision placed labial to the thin band of KG allows for easier dissection. However, it cannot be accompanied by a lipswitch vestibuloplasty because displacement of the mentalis musculature in an atrophic mandible results in a drooping, soft tissue chin deformity.

A local anesthetic, typically  $1\%$  or  $2\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, is infiltrated into the labial and lingual tissues. Infiltration includes the labial aspect of the inferior border of the mandible, the lingual cortical plate to anesthetize branches of the mylohyoid nerves, and along the crest. Infiltration anesthesia on the crest creates a hydropic dissection, which aids in the subperiosteal dissection. Bilateral inferior alveolar nerve blocks are usually not necessary.

# 11.9.5 Placement of Two Implants

In general, when two implants are to be placed for an overdenture, the surgeon should consider the potential need for additional implants at a later time. For example, the patient may decide to change from a tissue-borne

prosthesis to an implant-borne prosthesis. In light of this consideration, when placing two implants into the anterior mandible, the surgeon locates the implants  $20\mathrm{mm}$  apart, each  $10\mathrm{mm}$  from the midline of the mandible, to allow for later implant placement if needed (Fig. 11.13).

After the round bur has been used to mark the sites, the initial drill approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter, depending on specific implant system, is used to create the first site. A parallel or guide pin is placed into the prepared hole, and the angulation is checked to ensure that the anteroposterior and medial-distal inclinations are appropriate. The surgeon needs to move to view the guide pin's orientation from in front of the patient and from the side to make sure the implants are not canted. The surgical guide, if available, is placed into the mouth to confirm that the implants are within the eventual denture base. If the patient has maxillary teeth or a denture, the mandible is closed gently to ensure that the implants are placed within the contours of the incisive edges of the maxillary teeth, not labially. After the correct angulation of the implant preparation has been confirmed or after any necessary changes have been made, the second site is prepared with the pilot bur in the proper axis.

The anterior mandible may have a dense cortical plate with abundant marrow space, or it may have minimal marrow with an abundance of cortical bone. A smaller or thinner mandible has more cortical bone and less cancellous bone. When dense bone is encountered, it is important to clean the drills often during the drilling sequence to keep the cutting surfaces clean and unclogged during preparation of the implant site. For placement of implants into dense bone, a thread former (tap) is used to create threads in the bone.

# 11.9.6 Placement of Four or More Implants

When four or more implants are to be placed into the anterior mandible, the incision design is the same as that used for two implants.

The mental foramen is used as the landmark for locating the distal implants. A caliper is used to mark the alveolar ridge no less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the mental foramen. This distance usually is the anterior extent of the nerve as it loops forward in the bone before exiting at the mental foramen. The extent of anterior "looping" can be easily seen by using the axial images from the cone beam scan. It is critical to examine the radiographs carefully to confirm the extent of the anterior loop of the nerve within the bone. A small nerve probe can be placed into the mental foramen; however, this procedure is reserved for clinicians with experience in handling sensory nerves. If an implant is to be angled to place the emergence in the first molar location, the entry

point is made typically  $1 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  distal to the foramen, allowing for angulation and avoidance of damage to the nerve. A guide pin is placed after the pilot bur has been used to confirm proper angulation and to confirm that the implant emerges on the crest rather than buccal or lingual.

A small, round bur is used to make a depression in the bone to locate the implant site on one side of the mandible. A similar mark is placed on the opposite side of the mandible no less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the mental foramen. The caliper then is set to 7 or  $8\mathrm{mm}$ , and the next implant locations are marked in a similar manner anterior to the two distal locations. If a fifth implant is to be placed, a mark is made in the midline of the mandible. Using the caliper, the surgeon places the implant bodies a sufficient distance apart to ensure adequate space for restoration and hygiene (Fig. 11.14). For 4-mm-diameter implants,  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of space center to center results in  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of distance between the bodies of the implants.

Patients with atrophic mandibles with  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  of bone height but less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  may not be healthy and thus are not candidates for bone grafting because of health-related issues. For these patients, four implants can be placed, with  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of the implant through the inferior border of the mandible and, as necessary,  $2\mathrm{mm}$  supracrestal. It is important to prepare the bone gently and to pretap the implant sites because the mandible may be brittle, have minimal blood supply, and are prone to fracture. The implants should be placed so as to avoid labial protrusion. Long-term follow-up of this method indicates excellent results, with anecdotal evidence that bone formation can occur distal to the implants, presumably in response to tensile and compressive forces on the mandible.

# 11.9.7 Immediate Loading of the Edentulous Mandible

A careful review of the references [67-80] reveals specific criteria that are consistently associated with successful patient treatment, including the following:

1. Adequate density of anterior mandibular bone, with insertion torque greater than 20 Newton-centimeters (N-cm), often cited to be greater than 50 N-cm  
2. Cross-arch stabilization of the implants with either a rigid metal bar or resin  
3. Use of threaded implants at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  long  
4. Sufficient interocclusal space for fabrication of the framework and interim prosthesis  
5. Patient dexterity and compliance with hygiene instruction and post-delivery care

When these five criteria are met in the patient, success should be expected if the remaining technical aspects of the implant procedures are performed properly.

If the plan is for an implant-borne prosthesis with a framework such as a hybrid-type design, then the surgeon will need to reduce the ridge to allow for  $16 - 18\mathrm{mm}$  of space between the crestal bone and the planned vertical location of the incisive edges of the teeth. At least  $16\mathrm{mm}$  is necessary to include space for  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of gingival thickness,  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of clearance to the intaglio surface of the prosthesis, a  $7 - 8\mathrm{mm}$ -tall framework, and the remaining space for acrylic to retain teeth. If bone reduction is not performed, then space limitations will result in a non-hygienic restoration with insufficient acrylic bulk, and teeth separation from the prosthesis will occur.

Several techniques [81-85] can be used to achieve immediate delivery of a final prosthesis. The original "teeth in an hour" procedure [86] used preoperative dentures and accurate mounting of the master casts to finalize the prosthesis. CT guidance was used to guide implant placement according to virtual planning, and a final prosthesis was then delivered immediately after implant placement. The procedure relied on the accuracy of the preoperative planning and very accurate models. However, because of small errors, which occur with all CT-guided cases, this method is now rarely used.

If the prosthesis is to be delivered the next day or within a few days, then implant indexing can be used at the time of implant placement. The impression copings are placed into the implants at the time of surgery and connected via dental floss and resin. After the resin connection has cured, the pickup is removed and transferred to a master cast. The prosthesis is then processed during the evening. It can be delivered the next day [82, 83].

# 11.9.8 Use of Computed Tomography Guide Stent for Fabrication of a Fixed Provisional

For an edentulous patient, a new denture is made and is approved by the patient regarding tooth size, shape, color, and location. It is used as a radiographic stent for CT planning. Six to eight 1-mm-diameter fiduciary radiopaque markers, typically gutta percha, are placed within the flanges of the duplicated or provisional denture. A bite registration is made to secure the duplicated denture in the planned position during the CT scan. The bite registration can be used to remount casts and can be used at the time of surgery. The patient has a CT scan performed with the radiographic stent in place using the

radiolucent bite registration. The intaglio surface of the duplicated denture must fit perfectly to the mucosa with no "air" pockets. If the cross-sections of the scan show space between the mucosa and the stent, then the surgical guide stent will not fit, and the implant placements will be inaccurate. A perfectly fitting radiographic duplicated denture stent will result in less error. A scan is also made of the radiographic stent by itself with the fiduciary markers in the flanges of the denture to allow for a dual scan method to be used.

The CT DICOM files are loaded into an appropriate dual-scan planning software system, and the implants are virtually placed. Attention is given to avoid the neurovascular bundle to orient the implants to emerge slightly lingual to the incisive edges and within the fossas of the posterior teeth. The depth of the implants is considered by using virtual abutments. After the planning is completed, a guide stent is fabricated.

At the time of surgery, the clinician has the guide stent and appropriate drill kit, the implants, the model with the provisional abutments still in place, and the full-arch temporary prosthesis. The entire team is present to allow for implant and prosthesis placement in one location.

# 11.9.9 Preoperative Preparation for Full-Arch Immediate Provisional Cases

The responsibility of the restorative dentist is to create the final prosthetic set of teeth in the form of a denture. A new setup is vital to guide accurate placement of the implants. For an edentulous patient, the new denture is tried in and approved by the patient. In a dentate patient, a mask of the proposed final prosthetics is tried in place. There are partially dentate patients in whom an esthetic preoperative try-in is difficult to achieve. For these patients, the dentist works with the laboratory to incorporate specific landmarks to predict esthetics and function for the provisional prosthetic, with the patient's understanding of the need for revision if necessary.

# 11.9.10 Preoperative Laboratory Procedures

After an immediate hybrid provisional prosthesis has been chosen as the planned treatment, a surgical guide stent is fabricated by duplication of the patient's existing denture in clear acrylic resin. An alternative is to fabricate the surgical guide stent in clear acrylic resin from the wax try-in or a provisional denture. The stent should

be prepared by drilling a slot lingual to the teeth to form a channel from second premolar to second premolar, indicating where four or five implants should be positioned to prevent screw emergence from the labial surfaces of the teeth. The screws securing the hybrid prosthesis should emerge lingual to the incisive edge of the teeth or within the fossae of the premolar teeth.

This author's preferred option is to use a CT scan to fabricate the surgical guide. This requires a denture with radiopaque markers to allow for accurate placement of the implants into the CT scan based on planned teeth positions. From the virtual planning, a static drill guide is fabricated with sleeves specific to the implant system to be used. The benefits of CT planning with static guides include complete knowledge of the bone morphology before surgery, use of a flapless surgical technique which shortens the surgical time and reduces postoperative pain and swelling, and laboratory preparation of the denture based on the transfer of the CT plan to a working model.

For the surgeon to have a reference to create  $15\mathrm{mm}$  of distance from the incisive edges of the prosthetic teeth to the bone, a ruler is used to mark  $15\mathrm{mm}$  from the teeth edges to the flange of the duplicated denture. A marking pen is used to scribe a line. The flange of the clear acrylic drill guide is trimmed to that distance. At the time of surgery, the drill guide will be placed and a line marked on the bone using a sterile pencil. The bone will be reduced to the appropriate height using drills, reciprocating saws, Rongeur forceps, or a piezosurgery cutting tip.

# 11.9.11 Surgical Procedure for Computed Tomography-Guided Implant Placement in an Edentulous Mandible

At the time of surgery, the surgeon and restorative dentist are both present. The surgical guide stent, model with abutments in proper position, and provisional prosthesis all are present and accounted for.

When using a CT-generated guide stent, infiltration of the local anesthetic is used. Excessive boluses are to be avoided to allow for proper seating of the guide stent. Time is allowed for absorption of the local anesthetic fluid for accurate placement of the guide stent on the mucosa. In an edentulous patient, a small incision can be made bisecting the often thin band of KG with a small reflection to avoid removal of the KG. A tissue punch is not recommended because of the desire to maintain KG around the implants. A limited reflection allows the KG to be present on both the labial and lingual surfaces of the implant abutments.

The guide stent is placed into the mouth. A bite registration is used to accurately position the guide stent, which is then secured to the mandible using pins or screws. Pins are easily removed and replaced, which is the preference of the author. Using the manufacturer's recommended sequence of sleeves, one implant site is prepared. If the ridge is narrow, then the guide stent is removed after the pilot holes have been made to verify accurate placement. If there needs to be an adjustment, it is made at this point. The surgeon must be aware of the range of crestal error, which can be up to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the edentulous, mucosa-borne guide.

In a wide ridge, there is less need for removal of the stent after the use of the pilot drills. Confirming accurate pilot hole placement is recommended when using a mucosa-supported guide stent. One implant site preparation is completed, and the implant is placed. A second implant is then prepared and placed on the contralateral side. The rest of the implant sites are then prepared. Slow-speed drilling, tapping the sites, and a gentle technique are necessary to avoid implant failure from trauma to the bone. The guide stent is removed and the abutments placed one at a time. By leaving the abutments on the model in the preplanned position, accurate abutment placement is predictable. Laboratories can fabricate an abutment seating jig that aids in abutment rotational orientation. Because the provisional prosthesis is adjustable and can be refined, small errors in positioning are expected and easily handled.

After the abutments have been placed, the surgeon torques them as prescribed. The abutments may involve additional parts that are screw retained to the abutments, or the abutments may be fixed in design and may require small adjustments. The hollow-shell teeth are refined, and the occlusion is checked to detect isolated contacts and ensure that the occlusion is evenly distributed.

# 11.9.12 Placement of the Temporary Cylinders

For all implant systems, there is a part that is cylindrical in form with ridges on it. For this section, these parts will be termed "temporary cylinders." The temporary cylinders are screw retained using titanium screws. The abutments have been screw retained to the implants and are supragingival. One temporary cylinder is placed on one abutment and lightly screw retained. The denture with holes is placed over the temporary cylinder. Interferences are removed to result in a passive fit. The temporary cylinder is marked with a marking pen to identify the height that needs to be removed. It is removed and reduced out of the mouth and then

replaced. The top of the cylinder should be flush with the adjacent acrylic of the denture. This will ensure a smooth interface after the cylinders are luted to the denture with denture resin.

The next temporary cylinder is placed and adjusted followed by the remaining cylinders one at a time. This is done in sequence until all of the temporary cylinders have been placed, the interferences have been removed, and the heights have been adjusted to allow for a smooth transition. If the temporary cylinders do not interfere with the opposing occlusion, then they can be shortened after luting.

# 11.9.13 Connecting the Temporary Cylinders to the Denture

A rubber dam is recommended to use while luting the temporary cylinders to the denture, avoiding acrylic penetrance into the surgical wound.

The denture is placed into the mouth and confirmed that it fits passively and the patient can bite into proper occlusion. The patient is instructed to occlude, and the dentist must confirm that the occlusion is identical to the verified position at the beginning of the procedure.

Cotton or another easy-to-remove material is placed to cover the screw holes to prevent resin from obliterating access to the screws that retain the temporary cylinders to the implant abutments.

There should be a small but definable space between the temporary cylinders and the acrylic of the denture. Resin of choice is used to lute the cylinders. Some resin can be pre-applied to the temporary cylinders to aid in adhesion of the acrylic or resin. The resin or acrylic is syringed to connect the cylinders to the denture.

This must be performed with the patient in the correct occlusion. Occlusion is verified by having the patient close into the established vertical dimension, often using a bite registration to verify that the denture is in the correct position. Centric occlusion is maintained while the acrylic resin sets.

After the resin is applied for luting, the screw holes of the cylinders must be cleaned to allow for their removal. This is done before the setting of the luting material. After the luting material has completely set, the screws that retain the temporary cylinders are removed. The prosthesis is then removed from the mouth.

In the laboratory, additional acrylic is added to fill gaps at the level of the temporary cylinders. The intaglio surface needs to be polished and smoothed to prevent food entrapment. The flanges are removed, and the labial and lingual aspects are trimmed to allow for hygiene access and to provide space for tissue swelling.

Three millimeters of space is necessary to allow for expected and normal postoperative tissue swelling. Because of the inability to remove the prosthesis during the implant healing period, the restorative dentist should create more space for cleaning than less space. A relatively large distance from the intaglio surface to the sutured gingiva is necessary to take into consideration swelling during the first week after implant surgery. If there is space restriction and pressure on the tissues, incisional breakdown can occur, resulting in bone loss or potential implant failure.

The inferior surface is contoured to allow for easy hygiene. The surfaces are smoothed and polished to avoid plaque and food retention during the 4 months of healing before its removal for final impressions. The surface of the temporary cylinders is flush with the adjacent acrylic of the denture.

# 11.10 The Flangeless Maxillary Restoration

The clinical problem to be addressed is the need to provide the patient with a fixed provisional and final restoration that is esthetic, functional, and maintainable. When a patient is planned for removal of their remaining maxillary teeth, the specific design of their provisional prosthesis should:

1. Achieve functional stability without breakage during the implant healing period.  
2. Achieve esthetic satisfaction for the patient.  
3. Be designed to allow for meticulous hygiene during the healing period.  
4. Allow for design modifications as needed for long-lasting success of the final prosthesis.

A flange is necessary for a hybrid-type designed prosthesis to provide pink gingiva-like material inferior to the smile line. This is necessary because of the  $15 - 17\mathrm{mm}$  of space from incisor edge to bone, which is necessary for the components, milled framework, and the teeth of a hybrid-type prosthesis. Often the space criteria require bone reduction (Fig. 11.15). The immediate full-arch hybrid-styled prosthesis will have a flange extending just superior to the smile line, often preventing ease of access for hygiene. The loss of hygiene access will result in gingival inflammation and bone loss [87-103].

The solution for this chronic hygiene access issue is the use of a fixed/removable-type prosthesis or elimination of the flange (Figs. 11.16, 11.17, 11.18, and 11.19). To eliminate the flange, the patient must have specific anatomical form in the anterior maxilla to allow for emergence of the prosthetic teeth from the gingiva simulating a natural appearance. Another advantage of

a "flangeless" prosthesis is the avoidance of bone reduction because space is similar to single-tooth implant restorations where preservation of bone is preferred. The following includes preoperative evaluation and the procedures.

# 11.10.1 Preoperative Evaluation: Esthetic Evaluation

The preoperative examination will evaluate the position of the current anterior teeth, the planned position of the anterior teeth, and the amount of bone present in the maxilla.

Standard incisor show measures are used to determine where the facial gingival margin of the final restoration will be located. This can be determined by placing a mockup over the current teeth, doing a laboratory setup, or fabrication of a new denture which has the teeth set in an ideal location with minimal flange present.

After the ideal vertical location of the facial gingival margin is determined, the use of a flangeless prosthesis can be chosen. If necessary, gingival augmentation can be performed at the time of surgery to enhance the contour of the gingiva [102]. Positioning of the implants from the canine locations posteriorly without implants in the anterior locations will allow flexibility in pontic design for the provisional and final prostheses. This is determined by the bone availability in planned implant positions. If angulation of the most posterior implants is necessary, then implants may need to be placed in the anterior incisor locations.

# 11.10.2 Laboratory Workup

A full-arch setup is performed on the models or using virtual software integrating photographs, the cone beam scan, and the data extrapolated from the physical exam of the patient. After the planned setup is finalized, it can be scanned and electronically sent to the surgeon and restorative dentist. This .stl file can be superimposed on the cone beam scan within planning software. Implants can be virtually positioned with emergence according to the prosthetic plan.

Navigation using a static guide or dynamic methods can be used to guide implant placement based on the prosthetic setup. The surgeon can also use anatomic landmarks such as the extraction sockets to guide implant positioning. Surgical guides are made to assist in implant placement and to confirm accurate implant positioning. If adjustments need to be made at the time of implant surgery due to unforeseen bone loss after

tooth removal, the implants can be repositioned with the aid of the information of the surgical guide stent. For example, an implant may be moved to the lateral incisor position if the labial bone is not preserved after removal of a maxillary canine tooth.

# 11.10.3 Provisional Prosthesis Fabrication

The scanned setup of the final teeth positions is merged with a scan of the prepared model, and the provisional is milled from a solid acrylic block in the correct shade. Two milled provisionals are often milled in case one fractures during the conversion process.

The milled provisional is then adapted to the prepared model and a palatal portion is fabricated to allow for accurate seating. A bite is also made to assure proper seating. The surgical guide stent is milled from a clear acrylic block with guide holes delineating implant positions.

# 11.10.4 Surgical Treatment Considerations

Prior to the day of surgery, the surgical guide stent and provisional milled restoration are available. The .stl file has been superimposed ("stitched") to the 3D image on the navigation system of the ct planning system. Virtual implants are positioned as planned, which guides implant placement. If a static guide is chosen, implant analogs can be placed into the static guide and a master model poured, the implant analogs in place. Subsequently, implant abutments can be placed in the model, retentive copings trimmed to length, and small holes to secure the retentive copings made prior to surgery.

Surgery is performed in a conventional manner. If dynamic navigation is used, the patient tracking array is placed on the anterior teeth. When using a flangeless provisional, combined with navigation, the reflection of the gingiva is only elevated to allow for tooth removal and exposure of the crest. The teeth are removed, preserving the bone. The implant sites are prepared using conventional methods using navigation if available. Implants are placed and countersunk to allow for emergence of the crowns similar to single-tooth implant placement. Throughout the procedure implant positioning is checked often with the aid of the surgical guide.

If possible, the use of straight emergence abutments is preferred. However, often angulation of implants is planned due to posterior bone availability. Angled abutments are used, but after the implants have integrated, they may need to be removed for implant-level impressions and the use of different abutments to idealize prosthesis design and esthetics. The use of straight emergence abutments may necessitate the use of composite materials in the provisional prosthesis, but the ease of removal and replacement is time- and cost-efficient compared to removal of angled abutment where their replacement after implant-level impressions may be difficult.

Gaps between the implant and labial bone are grafted with xenograft, similar to single-tooth sites, to maintain ridge contour. Incisions are closed around the abutments using resorbable suture. Because bone removal will be minimal, trimming of excessive gingival tissue is not indicated.

# 11.10.5 Patient Follow-Up

Patients are usually seen 1 day after surgery by the restorative dentist to confirm a balanced occlusion. Patients are prescribed antibiotics for 7 days as usual for

implant patients. After 4 months or longer for implant integration, impressions are taken for final prosthesis design. The final prosthesis can be milled with zirconia; a milled acrylic prosthesis with appropriate shade may be used for a long-term provisional prosthesis. A milled resin prosthesis may be used to decrease final prosthesis cost. If a milled resin prosthesis is used for the final prosthesis, the patient should understand that it may need to be replaced periodically due to breakage. The use of a milled provisional allows for copies to be milled using the original digital file.

# 11.11 Single Molars in the Maxilla

Bone availability is the key to successful placement of endosseous implants in the posterior maxilla. When the vertical height of the bone between the maxillary sinus

and the alveolar crest is limited, increasing the bone height by grafting will provide support for implants and prosthetic restoration.

# 11.11.1 Treatment Strategies

A patient presents with a maxillary molar tooth in need of removal secondary to loss of structure, fracture, failed endodontic therapy, or bone loss. In order to place an implant, there must be sufficient bone to stabilize the implant in position.

Pretreatment evaluation, after determination of the patient's medical history, begins with a cone beam scan. Two-dimensional radiographs are not sufficient to determine the amount of bone available. It is common to have sinus membrane thickening in a patient with maxillary molar problems [104]. In general, if the sinus mem

brane thickness is limited to less than  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , then sinus elevation is performed. If greater than  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , then a staged approach is used to avoid sinus infection.

Patients who smoked cigarettes or patients with a history of radiation to the mouth, autoimmune therapy, steroid use, uncontrolled diabetes, or other systemic disease that would adversely affect bone healing were staged with straightforward socket grafting without sinus elevation at the time of tooth removal.

# 11.11.2 Radiographic Evaluation

The cross-sections show the bone height around each of the molar tooth's roots. Often these roots extend above the sinus floor within the furcation or can protrude within the sinus or at the level of the floor with minimal bone if any present apical to the tooth root.

Often the bone thickness in the furcation region is less than needed for implant stability. After the radiographic evaluation is made, the surgeon can develop a treatment plan.

The following scenarios may be encountered.

# 11.11.3 Presence of Greater Than 9 mm of Bone Within the Furcation

The patient presents with a broken-down, non-restorable molar with at least  $9\mathrm{mm}$  of bone thickness in the furcation (Fig. 11.4). For these patients, the surgical protocol includes sulcular incisions with flap elevation as necessary and removal of the tooth preserving the buccal, furcation, and palatal bone. This may require the use of a piezosurgery periotome style tips to separate the tooth from the bone or the use of a drill to section the tooth with removal of each root. The goal is tooth removal with preservation of the bone.

The implant should be chosen to provide stability after placement and to avoid excessive sinus perforation. The center of the implant should be equidistant from the adjacent teeth. The facial-palatal position should allow for screw retention or cementation as determined by the treating team. It is important to maintain at least  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of buccal bone thickness after the implant has been placed. Navigation methods can be used to provide increase precision and accuracy of implant placement [5, 6].

Initiation of the implant site can be accomplished by a round bur or a tapered bur. The subsequent preparation should be performed preserving as much bone as possible. Drills that compact bone rather than remove bone may be useful to result in a well-defined osteotomy. The implant is placed  $\frac{1}{2} - 1$  mm subcrestal to allow for appropriate bone coverage and emergence. The root sockets can be grafted with allograft as per clinician preference. Healing abutments are used to allow for gingival healing without the need for exposure surgery.

If during implant preparation the sinus membrane is seen and perforated, the socket can be grated and allowed to heal with implant placement delayed. This may avoid patient problems with sinus irritation.

# 11.11.4 Insufficient Bone Height Within the Furcation for Primary Implant Stability (Fig. 11.20)

Because of invagination of the sinus into the furcation, there may be less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone available in the central fossa region of the proposed implant site. If the molar tooth with less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone is removed and the root sockets are grafted, there will still be a lack of vertical bone for implant placement. Jensen et al. [3] reported a technique that used osteotomes to create an island of bone within the maxillary molar extraction socket. This mobilized bone was gently tapped to raise it

implants, and the patient wore a fixed provisional prosthesis to guide the forma of the soft tissue. f The final prosthesis is porcelain fused to metal with natural tooth forms. The use of custom anatomical-shaped abutments combined with tissue shaping with the provisional resulted in a normal appearance of teeth. g As above in f. h This photo is 25 years follow-up showing preservation of the gingival profile with maintenance of ridge form.

superiorly, creating increased vertical height of the alveolar bone within the molar extraction site. In their report, no grafts were placed and patients had implants placed after bone had formed. A modification of the technique to have more precise control of the osteotomy of the bone bordered by the root sockets is used by this author [2]. This technique eliminates the need for lateral window surgery.

As an extension of their technique, a precise bone cutting method using a piezosurgery device is used, and after elevation of the bone, a graft is placed. The incisions that are made include a vertical release so a full-thickness flap can be elevated. The periosteum is incised, and the flap is released so it can be closed without tension, covering the graft.

# 11.11.5 Surgical Procedure

Local infiltration is used for anesthesia. A sulcular incision is made with vertical release incisions while avoiding the papilla on the adjacent teeth. A flap is elevated only on the facial aspect to expose the junction of the tooth to labial bone. A periosteal release is performed to

allow for passive flap rotation to cover the mesial and distal buccal root sockets.

The tooth is removed with the aid of a piezosurgery unit with a periotome tip to preserve the bone. If necessary, the tooth is sectioned with a small fissure bur to avoid loss of the labial cortical bone. After the tooth roots have been removed, granulation tissue is carefully removed while taking care to avoid damage to the sinus membrane if it is visible through the root sockets.

The piezosurgery (Piezosurgery Inc., Columbus, OH) unit is used to create precise osteotomies. The serrated tip is used to gently cut through the bone between the two buccal root sockets and then connect the cuts to the palatal root socket. Care is taken to cut through the bone, but not through the membrane. Loss of resistance is used to limit the depth of the cuts. The bone segment bordered by the root sockets should be mobile at this point of the procedure. A round osteotome with a flat tip is used to very gently superiorly raise the bone segment  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$ , resulting in a socket deeper than  $7\mathrm{mm}$ . The vertical bone height can be raised further when the implant is placed through a simple implant site preparation sinus elevation [105].

Fig. 11.20 a Patient presents with desire to replace maxillary left first molar. He has previously in another clinic had an implant placed in the second premolar location, with obvious perforation of the sinus. b A cross-section image shows lack of sufficient bone for implant placement. c These immediate postoperative radiographs demonstrate the doming effect when a graft is placed from the crestal approach. A 4.3-mm-diameter hole is prepared to within  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of the sinus floor. The floor is up-fractured gently. Xenograft is placed  
and gently compacted into the area with osteotomes to gradually elevate the membrane. Small amounts of graft are placed and compacted. The result is elevation of the sinus membrane as seen in these radiographs. d As above. e These radiographs show the same site 4 months after augmentation. Note the consolidation of the graft with maintenance of the height. f As above. g, h An implant is placed in a routine manner

After the segment of bone is mobilized and gently elevated, the graft is placed. No effort is made to elevate the membrane further to avoid membrane perforations. Because the root sockets are simultaneously grafted, the result will be a flat but thickened alveolus with adequate dimension for implant placement. The graft material chosen is at the clinicians' preference. Xenograft within the elevated portion is usually followed by allograft within the crestal portion, which has provided consistent results.

The gingival flap is closed with minimal tension. If the ridge has a prominent vertical facial morphology, a piece of collagen is placed over the palatal root socket, which has been grafted, with the edge of the flap limited to cover only the buccal root sockets. The patient is given sinus precaution instructions and antibiotics and advised to spray the nose with a decongestant aerosol to maintain the opening of the os for drainage.

Upon healing, the patient usually can have implants placed into these sites with intra-alveolar sinus elevation for another  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of bone height development or might have sufficient height for routine implant placement.

# 11.12 Crestal Approach for Sinus Augmentation

The crestal osteotome method can be used to increase vertical bone thickness either prior to implant placement or at the time of implant placement. This approach decreases the incidence of sinus membrane perforations, graft migration, sinusitis postoperatively, and in general patient morbidity [106, 107].

There are studies [108-110] that evaluated augmentation of the ridge using allograft and xenograft, with "bone" gains ranging from 3.5 to  $6.0\mathrm{mm}$ . These studies confirm that placing a material to maintain space will result in bone gain.

The bone gain from using the osteotome technique from the crestal approach ranges from 4 to  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , with or without grafting [109-118]. Different grafting materials did not seem to affect implant success rates [107, 110]. In a series of over 120 patients who were treated with the crestal approach, there were no differences reported comparing the use of allograft or autograft [107]. In general, a narrow sinus will result in more predictable bone augmentation with the crestal approach compared to a wide sinus [4]. A study comparing radiofrequency values for different approaches and timing did not review differences in implant stability after bone had formed [119].

When there is greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone, the success rate for implants placed immediately using the crestal

approach without a graft ranges from  $86\%$  to  $98\%$  [107, 109, 110, 115-117, 120]. The success rates comparing the placement of implants from the crestal approach with osteotome technique to conventional placement of the use of a two-step lateral window were similar [109, 119].

# 11.13 Anatomic Considerations for Material and Method for Sinus Augmentation

# 11.13.1 Bone Thickness

Bone thickness will affect the choice of method used to increase bone thickness in the posterior maxilla. Development of a lateral window with elevation of the sinus membrane along the floor and medial wall is often used when the bone is thin. Sinus floor elevation through the alveolar crest is a method that is used for any thickness of the alveolar bone [121].

# 11.13.2 Bone Height 9 mm or Greater

Implants can be placed without a graft. Based on clinician preference, the floor can be elevated during the implant preparation process to place longer implants [122-125].

If the thickness of the crestal bone is greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$ , a series of drills are used to within  $1\mathrm{m}$  of the sinus floor. Osteotomes are used to gently up-fracture the sinus floor bone. Placement of a graft within the preparation "hole" is performed sequentially to elevate the floor and membrane. A small amount of xenograft is placed within the osteotomy site. The osteotome is then used to gently pack the graft superiorly. Very gentle tapping is used to avoid membrane perforations. Additional graft is placed, and the osteotome is used again to add to the augmentation. This sequential graft placement and compaction may take time for accurate placement with  $0.5\mathrm{cc}$  graft material placed in a single site.

If the bone thickness is  $5\mathrm{mm}$  or greater, the same procedure is used. The implant preparation drills are used to final diameter. The osteotomes are then used. Graft is placed and then the implant is placed.

# 11.13.3 Bone Height 5 mm or Greater

Because the long-term evidence is not conclusive with the use of implants  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  tall, in the posterior maxilla, clinicians may choose to place implants  $9\mathrm{mm}$  or longer. When the cone beam cross-section shows  $5 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  vertical height, the sinus floor can be elevated

during the implant preparation process, with simultaneous implant placement [107, 109, 115, 116, 119]. There is evidence that sinus membrane elevation with no graft material placed may result in bone formation between the membrane and sinus floor [108, 111, 113, 114].

For ridges less than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness, a crestal window method is used. The concept is a window of bone is elevated with minimal bone removal and a larger island of bone is at the superior aspect of the augmentation (Figs. 11.21 and 11.22).

# 11.13.4 Bone Height 3-5 mm

In this situation, a clinical decision is made to use a crestal or lateral window approach based on the difficulty of raising the sinus membrane without perforation. If a molar tooth had been recently removed with its root tips within the sinus, the membrane may be difficult to elevate since it may be adherent to the prior root tip site. If there are septi present or remnants from a mucocoele or other sinus pathology, the membrane may be difficult to elevate.

A lateral window approach has more evidence base than the crestal approach for bone of this crestal bone height [126-130]. If the lateral window approach is used, the resultant bone height for implant placement may exceed  $11\mathrm{mm}$  on a predictable basis. If the crestal approach is used in this clinical scenario, the resultant  $6 - 9\mathrm{mm}$  of bone height may require a second crestal elevation at the time of implant placement.

# 11.13.5 Bone Height 2 mm or Less

In this clinical situation, the lateral window approach is usually chosen, although the crestal approach may be viable as evidence becomes available.

# 11.14 The Crestal Window Approach

In posterior maxillary sites, there may be less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone available. When this limited amount of bone is present, a graft is indicated to increase the vertical height of bone.

After the radiographic evaluation is made, the surgeon can develop a treatment plan. If there is greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of crestal bone height, a crestal approach to elevate the sinus floor is performed at the time of implant placement [121, 122]. If there is less than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of alveolar bone thickness, the crestal window approach can be used. This author has used this technique for one or two tooth sites for contiguous missing teeth.

# 11.14.1 Surgical Technique: Creation of an Island of Bone to Avoid Removal of Bone at the Time of Elevation of the Sinus Floor (Figs. 11.21 and 11.22)

The lateral wall island method is adapted to the crest.

The Surgical Procedure After local anesthesia infiltration, an incision is made along the palatal border of the crest with anterior and posterior release several millimeters from the planned alveolar crestal window site. The flap is raised with no perforations. If the gingival full-thickness flap is perforated, the procedure is aborted in lieu of a lateral approach. The elevated flap exposes the crest.

A piezosurgery serrated cutting tip is used to create an osteotomy through the crest. The cuts are made to create a square or rectangle of bone with  $2\mathrm{mm}$  margins to the adjacent teeth, the buccal, and the palatal bone. The boney cuts are made only through the crest, using tactile sense to avoid perforation of the membrane. The mobility of the segment is tested, and as needed the crestal bone cuts are reevaluated and re-scored, taking care to avoid excessive pressure on the bone during creation of the osteotomies to mobilize the segment of bone to be transported. Flat osteotomes are used only if they are broad based, blunt, and not sharp edged. The bone segment should be easily moved superiorly with gentle tapping.

The bone is then gently tapped superiorly  $4 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  using the lines on the osteotome as reference. After the segment is elevated, it is inspected to confirm no obvious sinus membrane perforations. This author uses xenograft in the area of the sinus elevation and allograft in the portion closer to the crest. An initial layer of graft is placed followed by gentle pressure using a wide flat base osteotome to move and compact the graft superiorly. Additional graft is placed and compacted several times to gently elevate the sinus floor. After the graft is placed, the incisions are closed. The patient is given sinus precautions, which includes avoiding nose blowing and any Valsalva maneuvers. Antibiotics are prescribed, and the patients are advised to use a nasal spray decongestant to avoid congestion. A postoperative cone beam scan is taken to confirm accurate placement of the graft without migration of the graft into the sinus. After bone forms, the implants can be placed. A healing period of 4-6 months is allowed prior to placing implants. The timing is based on observation of bone graft healing using the cone beam scans.

The thickness of the augmented bone is assessed on a cone beam scan 4-6 months after the sinus graft has

been performed. If there is less than  $9\mathrm{mm}$  of bone and greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of bone, the sinus is further intruded at the time of implant placement. The implant site is prepared to  $1\mathrm{mm}$  short of the floor using guidance and drill stops. After the implant site preparation reaches desired width for the implant, osteotomes are used to elevate the floor. Xenograft is placed and the implant is placed. By elevating the sinus floor from the crestal approach twice, a lateral window method is avoided.

# 11.15 The Use of Navigation to Guide Implant Placement

Traditional methods to place implants use freehand or limited guidance from laboratory-fabricated stents. The use of a static, CT-generated guide stent with a coordinated system of specified drilling can result in less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  crestal and apical deviation from the plan and angulation error less than  $5^{\circ}$  [131-138]. Freehand methods for implant placement have significantly more error compared to navigation methods [5, 6]. CT-generated static stents have workflow time considerations and cost considerations. The use of dynamic navigation uses a time-effective method to accurately place implants with equivalent implant placement error. The question for the clinician is when to use a static system or a dynamic navigation system.

The costs for using CT-generated static stents include the cost of the software and the cost for fabrication of the CT guide stent. The cost for the dynamic navigation system is the navigation computer system, which includes the arrays. Recurring costs include the cost of the patient-specific clips, which is relatively inexpensive.

Why should the clinician consider static or dynamic navigation? Navigation can result in accurate depth control and should decrease the chance of damage to the inferior alveolar nerve. Navigation allows for flapless or limited flap elevation, resulting in less patient postoperative morbidity. Navigation with virtual implant placement provides accurate spacing and angulation of implants compared to freehand approaches. Virtual implant planning and navigated placement can ensure appropriate implant angulation and depth for esthetic situations. The use of virtual implant planning and subsequent navigation allows prosthetic/surgical collaboration with precise planning and accurate orchestration of the plan to achieve a high level of patient-specific results. There are limitations with both static and dynamic navigation systems.

# 11.15.1 Static Guides

A static system uses CT-generated CAD/CAM stents, with metal tubes and a surgical system, which uses coordinated instrumentation to place implants using the guide stent. Implant position is dependent on the stent without the ability to change implant position. Static in this sense is synonymous with predetermined implant position without real-time visualization of the implant preparation site as it is being developed. No intraoperative position changes can be made with a static system unless the use of the stent is abandoned during the surgical procedure.

To fabricate a CT-generated surgical guide for static navigation, a cone beam CT scan (CBCT) is taken with the prosthetic plan in the mouth as an imaging guide. The fabrication of the imaging guide requires pre-scan lab work, which will necessitate time delays and additional cost to the team, and hence added cost to the patient. Future digital methods may eliminate the laboratory-based imaging guide. The CBCT, DICOM data must be entered into CT planning software. The use of the CT planning software requires training to use the software. Many clinicians do not proficiently learn the software and may decide to use a third party to plan the case. After the team finalizes the plan, the plan is uploaded to the stent manufacturer. A model or an optical scan of the arch is needed to fabricate a guide that seats accurately on the teeth. This requires impressions, pouring stone, and trimming the model and adds time and costs to the CT guide static method. The manufacturer will evaluate the uploaded scan and determine if it meets quality control parameters. The clinician may need to repeat the process if the static guide does not seat accurately on the teeth or tissues. There can be 2 weeks between upload and delivery of the guide stent. At this point, the surgery can be performed. The cost for static CT-generated guides will differ between manufacturers. These required preoperative procedures and their added costs, combined with the clinician's reluctance to gain proficiency with the planning software, create a workflow barrier for the use of a static CT-generated guide.

When using a CT static guide, the surgeon will require the appropriate surgical kit specific to the implant system. The implant choice cannot be easily changed once the CT guide stent has been fabricated. During surgery, the implant placement position cannot be changed unless the surgeon abandons the use of the CT guide stent. The use of the CT-generated guide stent also limits the ability to irrigate the drill during the process since access is limited to the bone, with the potential for increased heat production [139].

The use of static guides is difficult when the patient has limited mouth opening or for placement in the second molar regions. When the prolongation for accurate depth determination is added to the drill length, the combined length often exceeds the patient's maximal mouth opening. This problem is most evident in the posterior region of the mouth.

The advantages of using a static CT-generated guide stent are accurate implant placement, the use of flapless approach, the ability to use the guide stent to preoperatively fabricate fixed provisional restorations, and in

position, with the light source above the patient's head. c A close up of the patient tracking array and the handpiece with its array in position during surgery

general less invasive surgery, which results in less patient morbidity.

# 11.15.2 Dynamic Navigation (Fig. 11.23)

Presently available dynamic navigation systems for dental implant placement use optical technologies to track the patient and the handpiece and to display images onto a monitor [140, 141]. Optical systems use either passive or active tracking arrays. Passive systems use

tracking arrays that reflect light emitted from a light source back to stereo cameras. Active system arrays emit light which is tracked by stereo cameras.

A passive optical dynamic navigation system (X-Nav Technologies, Inc., Lansdale, Pa) requires the use of fiducials securely attached to the patient's arch during the CBCT (Fig. 11.23). The device that contains the fiducials allows for registration of the arch to the cameras, with the attachment of an array. The array is positioned extraorally and attached to the clip that contains the fiducials. The implant handpiece also has an array which combined with the clip's fiducials allows for triangulation and hence accurate navigation (Fig. 11.23). The drill and patient-mounted arrays must be within the line of sight with the overhead stereo cameras to be accurately tracked on the monitor [64, 142-148]. As needed, a small flap can be made to expose the crestal bone. The normal implant site drilling protocol is used. The surgeon uses the navigation screen to guide drilling with minimal direct visualization of the drill in the patient's mouth (Fig. 11.23).

The workflow for dynamic navigation begins with securing the fiducials to the arch. A clip that contains three metallic fiducials is fit onto the patient's teeth in an area that will not be operated. If an esthetic plan is to be used, radiopaque teeth as an imaging guide are included in the mouth to allow for later virtual implant positioning. The CBCT scan is taken with the clip in place. The clip is then removed and stored for use during surgery.

The DICOM dataset is loaded into the navigation system's computer. A virtual crown and virtual implant are placed. The software is simple and requires minimal computer experience by the clinician. Implants are generically generated by platform diameter, apical diameter, and length in  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  increments. The implant is oriented as needed.

At the time of surgery, the clip with the fiducials is attached to an array. The clip with the attached array and the handpiece with similar arrays are registered to the navigation system by staff. The surgeon uses traditional anesthesia and small incisions with minimal flap reflection. The clip array is securely repositioned onto the arch. The drill lengths are registered during the preparation process. The surgeon positions the patient and arrays for direct line of sight to the overhead cameras. The drills are oriented following the 3D images on the screen, which includes depth. The surgical assistant focuses on irrigation, retraction, and suctioning as usual. The implant can be placed fully or partially guided or by hand, depending on clinician preference.

The advantages of the dynamic navigation method are accuracy [149-152], time- and cost-effectiveness, less invasive flap reflection compared to freehand approaches,

less trauma to the surgeon since posture is improved with less back and neck bending, and the ability to change implant size, system, and location during the surgical procedure. In a patient who has difficulty in opening, or in a second molar site which can be difficult to access, dynamic navigation allows implant placement relying on the navigation screen to guide the drills without direct visualization in the mouth.

There is a variable learning curve to develop proficiency using a dynamic navigation system. The medical literature reports between 15 and 125 case experiences depending on procedure and the use of surgical simulators prior to the clinician developing proficiency with new surgical procedures [153, 154]. Dynamic navigation requires a team approach. Both the surgeon and the first assistant must learn to work together for efficient use of a dynamic navigation system.

# 11.15.3 Accuracy Considerations

# Static CT-Generated Guides

CT-generated guide stents result in more accurate implant placement compared to freehand or model-based non-restricted guides, including apical and platform position, as well as depth control [149, 150]. CT-generated guides do have measurable error associated with them. Depending on the use of mucosa- or tooth-supported guides, deviations range from  $0.6\mathrm{mm}$  to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  at implant apex to  $0.6 - 1.27\mathrm{mm}$  at the shoulder. Implant angulation deviations from the plan ranged from  $2.5^{\circ}$  to  $5^{\circ}$ . More than half are placed more superficial than planned [155, 156].

# Dynamic Navigation System Accuracy

A study was recently completed [5, 6] which evaluated the accuracy of a dynamic navigation system (X-Nav, Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA) to freehand methods.

Between-Surgeons Analysis: A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare surgeons within each method. With a freehand (FH) approach, all four surgeons were similar. With the dynamic navigation system, there were small differences between surgeons which related to the experience of the surgeons.

For the accuracy measures, each surgeon had better average accuracy and precision using guided methods than in freehand.

When comparing fully guided navigation to freehand methods, all measures were significantly different  $(p < 0.05)$ . When comparing partial guided navigation to the freehand method, all measures were significantly different  $(p < 0.05)$ . When comparing the fully guided navigation to partially guided navigation, there were significant differences for six of seven measures.

Table 11.1 Comparison of accuracy between implant placement methods  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Angular deviation (degrees)</td><td>Platform deviation (mm)</td><td>Apical deviation (mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic navigation [5]</td><td>3.15 ± 2.1</td><td>1.2 ± 0.5</td><td>0.88 ± 0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Static navigation [149]</td><td>3.89 ± ?</td><td>1.12 ± ?</td><td>1.39 ± ?</td></tr><tr><td>Freehand [5]</td><td>7.69 ± 4.9</td><td>1.67 ± 0.4</td><td>2.21 ± .99</td></tr></table>

Literature-based values for static tooth-borne guides: Two meta-analyses [64, 65] were used to compare the accuracy in this study to static guides. The dynamic navigation measures are similar to those reported for static guides (Table 11.1).

A method is needed to idealize implant placement for all cases. This method should be accurate, should have a practical workflow for the surgeon, and should have a reasonable learning curve to allow for proficiency to be achieved.

A dynamic navigation-guided system is at least as accurate as static guides and is much improved over freehand implant placement. Even with the aid of a laboratory-fabricated guide which is not true guidance, the error with the freehand approach is greater in all measured parameters [5, 6]. Experienced surgeons can place implants freehand within a sphere of accuracy, but using navigation methods is clearly superior.

# 11.15.4 Indications for Each Method

There are clinical situations that either method is advantageous over the freehand method. The choice of static or dynamic navigation will depend on the clinician's preference and experience. Either navigation method can be used for the following:

1. Flapless approaches: A site that has had previous ridge augmentation and the clinician wants to avoid disturbing the superficial part of the graft with flap elevation.  
2. Placement of adjacent implants requiring accurate spacing between implants and adjacent teeth. This insures appropriate spacing of the implants from the teeth and provides accuracy in maintaining appropriate space between implants.

3. The need for accurate implant angulation which is especially important in the esthetic zone and for screw-retained prostheses.  
4. Control of depth placement:

(a) To avoid nerve trauma  
(b) To place the preparation osteotomy adjacent to the sinus floor, when elevating the sinus floor through the implant preparation site  
(c) To intentionally engage the floor of the sinus or nasal floor for bicortical implant stability

A CT-generated static guide has advantages for edentulous cases. For the edentulous case, a static CT-generated guide is used when:

1. A flapless method is desired.  
2. The CT-generated guide can be used to preoperatively fabricate a provisional prosthesis on models generated from the static guide itself.  
3. The clinician desires the use of a bone reduction guide to accurately provide space for the planned prosthesis.  
4. Implant placement is critical for a planned full-arch fixed crown and bridge-type prosthesis.

Dynamic navigation is indicated when the surgeon plans the following:

1. Placement of implants in cases with limited mouth opening  
2. Placement of implant on the same day the CBCT is taken  
3. Placement of implants in difficult access locations such as the second molar  
4. Placement of implants when direct visualization is difficult  
5. Placement of implant in tight interdental spaces when static guides cannot be used due to tube size  
6. Placement of implants adjacent to natural teeth in situations where static guide tubes interfere with ideal implant placement

There are specific situations where there is a clear method choice. As the experience of the clinician increases and their surgical proficiency is achieved, the dynamic method may predominate because the workflow is time- and cost-efficient.

In dentate patients, dynamic navigation requires the presence of teeth to stabilize the registration clip and array. The registration/clip array should not be placed on temporarily cemented provisional restorations or mobile teeth.

Placement of implants in molar locations with difficult direct visual access occurs in patients with limited

mouth opening or crestal bone loss, resulting in the need for drill extenders. Placement of adjacent implants requires accurate spacing between implants and adjacent teeth. Static or dynamic systems can each be used, but the selection will be based on clinician's experience and case-specific considerations.

Dynamic navigation is flexible, allowing the clinician to change the surgical plan as the clinical situation dictates. It also requires no lab work, thus allowing for immediate scanning, planning, and guidance on the same day as patient presentation. The clinician needs to understand that there is a learning curve to gain proficiency, which may require additional time for training, simulation, and practice on a manikin.
