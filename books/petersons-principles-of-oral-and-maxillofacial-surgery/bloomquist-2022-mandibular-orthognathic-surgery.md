# Learning Aims

1. Understand the rationale, evolution, and limitations for the early types of mandibular osteotomies  
2. Learn the various indications and limitations for contemporary mandibular osteotomies  
3. Learn and understand the potential complications of mandibular osteotomies

# Introduction

Mandibular osteotomies have been used to correct dentofacial deformities for over 170 years. Originally, they were very simple and directed toward the correction of isolated and specific problems. Our understanding of bone healing along with advances in anesthesia the complexity of the various mandibular procedures evolved. It was the relentless pursuit of our surgical forefathers to further develop and understand these important procedures that has led us to the level of sophistication is our surgical procedures of the mandible that has helped so many people around the world.

Extensive training is necessary to perform these procedures in a safe and effective way. This chapter details the progression of mandibular orthognathic procedures, discussing their indications, surgical steps and approaches, as well as the potential complications in a very comprehensive way.

# Important Keypoints

1. Several types of deformities can be treated using more than one type of procedure.  
2. Different procedures carry different potential complications even though they can be used to treat the same dentofacial deformity.  
3. The surgeon should choose the specific procedure that will resolve the patient's problem with the least possible incidence of morbidity.

# Conclusion

The spectrum of mandibular osteotomies at our disposal is significant and gives the surgeon many options for a patient-specific procedure to address their specific problem. Different procedures, however, carry different degrees of complexity, risk, and complications. It is therefore incumbent on the surgeon to select the procedure most appropriate for the patient's needs. Given the number and variety of proven methods as described in this chapter, the surgeon should have no difficulty in making the correct decision for the problem needing to be addressed.

The development of mandibular osteotomies for correction of dentofacial deformities closely parallels the advancement of oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty more than any other group of surgical techniques. From Hullihen in 1849, who was the first to describe a

mandibular osteotomy, to Obwegeser in 1955, who developed the sagittal osteotomy of the vertical ramus, there has been dramatic progress in the techniques of mandibular osteotomies. After Obwegeser's original paper in German, and especially since his description of techniques in the English literature, orthognathic surgery has seen dramatic changes in use as well as refinement of the osteotomies. Although the development of osteotomy techniques is ongoing, the purpose of this chapter is to describe the most commonly used surgical procedures for the mandible and also to emphasize the refinements in technique that have been the result of the most recent clinical as well as basic science research.

# 62.1 History

Hullihen [1] corrected a burn patient with an anterior open bite and mandibular dentoalveolar protrusion with an intraoral osteotomy, similar to an anterior subapical osteotomy (Fig. 62.1a-c). His efforts did not stimulate much interest, because it was almost 50 years later when Angle [2] described a body osteotomy done by V. P. Blair [3] (Fig. 62.2a) for a patient with mandibular horizontal excess. This technique, with minor modifications, was advocated until the 1970s. Since then, the only major modifications in the body osteotomy that have occurred are a greater emphasis on preserving the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and a change to an intraoral approach.

The horizontal osteotomy of the vertical ramus popularized by Blair [4] (see Fig. 62.2b) was performed through an extraoral approach. As with many of the early mandibular procedures, a horizontal bone cut was made above the lingula and was described for correction of both mandibular horizontal deficiency and horizontal excess. An intraoral technique was not suggested until Ernst [5] discussed his procedure approximately 25 years later. This method of correcting mandibular deformities was used for almost 60 years, but because of its lack of postoperative stability, it has fallen into disuse.

The subcondylar osteotomy (see Fig. 62.2c), a description of which was first reported by Limberg [6] as an extraoral technique, has undergone relatively minor refinements to the intraoral vertical subcondylar osteotomy (VSO) that is used today. There has, however, been a substantial number of osteotomy designs involving the vertical ramus that begin in the sigmoid notch, which has led to some confusion in the nomenclature of what is a fairly closely related group of ramus osteotomies. The names that have been developed have generally been based upon the length and direction of the cuts made in the posterior portion of the vertical ramus. The subcondylar osteotomy was used to describe the condy

lar neck osteotomies of Kostecka [7] and Moose [8]. Generally, longer cuts that extended to the posterior border above the angle, such as described by Limberg, Thoma, and Robinson, were referred to as "oblique osteotomies" [5-10]. Shira, however, coined the term "oblique sliding osteotomy" for this particular surgical procedure [11]. Finally, Caldwell and Letterman [12] described a vertical osteotomy of the mandibular ramus that included a cut from the sigmoid notch to the inferior border, in front of the angle of the mandible. The cut was posterior to the mandibular foramen, and a portion of the lateral cortex of the distal fragment was decorticated to allow a larger area of bony contact. In general, these latter two groups of osteotomies are now called "vertical osteotomies," but some semantic differences still persist. Specifically, the terms vertical subcondylar osteotomy (VSO) and vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO) are still used interchangeably in the literature. Primarily, this type of osteotomy was designed for correction of mandibular horizontal excess, or mandibular asymmetries, although Robinson [10] described its use with a bone graft for advancement in horizontal deficiencies of the mandible.

The intraoral approach to the subcondylar osteotomy was first described by Moose in 1964 [13]. He approached the condylar neck medially with a straight bur. Winstanley [14] suggested a lateral approach in 1968, but it was not until Hebert and colleagues [15] described the use of a special oscillating saw that this approach became popular.

A variation of the VSO was suggested by Wassmund in 1927 [16] (Fig. 62.3a), which is similar to what is now called the inverted-L osteotomy. Pichler and Trauner [17] later suggested inserting bone grafts into the defect created by the advancement of the mandible. Caldwell and coworkers [18] further modified the inverted-L by adding a horizontal cut just above the inferior border of the mandible to create what is now called the  $C$  osteotomy (see Fig. 62.3b). The stated advantage of the C osteotomy was that the bone cut design made the use of a bone graft unnecessary. This advantage was further enhanced by the modification suggested by Hayes [19], with the splitting of the inferior limb sagittally so that more bone contact could be achieved. A further interesting approach to this group of VROs used for horizontal mandibular deficiency is the modified-L osteotomy

described by Fox and Tilson [20]. They eliminated the superior horizontal cut of the C osteotomy and, instead, extended the vertical cut to the sigmoid notch. Then the coronoid process was removed and added as a free graft into the defect resulting from the mandibular advancement.

The greatest development in osteotomies of the vertical ramus is the sagittal osteotomy, credited to Obwegeser and Trauner, but generally now used in a fashion modified from the original technique described in 1955 [21]. Lane has been referred to as the developer

of a form of the sagittal osteotomy, with parallel horizontal bone cuts made through the medial and lateral cortices of the vertical ramus (Fig. 62.4) [22]. The medial cut was made just above the lingula, with the lateral cut made just below it. This idea was expanded by Schuchardt [23] before being refined and popularized by Obwegeser and Trauner [21]. The major modifications in the osteotomy design were first made by DalPont [24] with his vertical cut through the lateral cortex as well as the suggestion that the medial horizontal cut be extended only to a point above the lingula and not to the posterior

border (Fig. 62.5). This latter technique shortens the split posteriorly, to the area of the retrolingular fossa and not to the posterior border, and as was further discussed by Hunsuck [25], decreases the trauma to the overlying soft tissues. Many clinicians have offered suggestions for improving the sagittal osteotomy, but the only other major innovation to this technique has been the use of internal rigid fixation. Spiessl [26] suggested the use of screws for fixation of the fragments in the sagittal osteotomy. Although wire osseous fixation is still used by some surgeons, rigid internal fixation in some form (bicortical screws or monocortical plates and

screws) has become the standard technique for the bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO).

Osteotomies of the mandibular body do not generally receive the same degree of attention as osteotomies of the vertical ramus, but they have undergone refinements and variations from the original anterior alveolar osteotomies of Hullihen [1] and the body osteotomies of Blair [3]. The first variation of Hullihen's procedure did not appear until 90 years after the original description, when Hofer [27] described an anterior mandibular alveolar osteotomy to advance anterior teeth in correction of mandibular dentoalveolar retrusion (Fig. 62.6a). Kole [28] modified this procedure by suggesting the use of bone grafts from the mental region to the defect caused by the rotation of the anterior dentoalveolar segment (see Fig. 62.6b). Clinicians now employing Hofer's osteotomy generally use some form of bone graft in the alveolar defect if significant movement of the fragment is planned. Mandibular alveolar osteotomies have expanded primarily in two ways from Hofer's original procedure. Kent and Hinds [29] initially presented the use of the single-tooth osteotomies of the mandible in 1971, and MacIntosh [30] closely followed with his description of the total mandibular alveolar osteotomy in 1974. The latter procedure continues to be popular, with minor variations recommended by other clinicians.

Osteotomies of the body of the mandible have been described in almost every conceivable form, with the most durable advancements being the step osteotomy, initially described by Von Eiselberg in 1906 [31] (Fig. 62.7a), and the horizontal osteotomy of the symphysis described by Hofer in 1942 [32] (see Fig. 62.7b). The step osteotomy was originally described for the treatment of mandibular horizontal deficiency, but it has been used in various forms for mandibular horizontal excess as well as asymmetry. The horizontal osteotomy of the symphysis has also developed a large degree of versatility, with its use in various forms being suggested for almost any skeletal deformity of the bony chin.

# 62.2 Anatomic and Physiologic Considerations of Mandibular Surgeries

# 62.2.1 Vascular Supply

A major concern with surgery of the facial skeleton is the vascular supply to the bony segments. This was demonstrated dramatically by the explosion of orthognathic surgery in the United States, after Bell and Levy's stud

![](images/ef2c4f07d217574f38574056b96ac19274551e2442c323de4fae420e767f8b67.jpg)

ies of vascular effects of the osteotomies [33]. Although all of the techniques they evaluated had been previously used in patients, there had not been any experimental evaluations of the physiologic basis for many of the procedures. Bell and Levy's work demonstrated that blood flow through the mandibular periosteum could easily maintain a sufficient blood supply to the teeth of a mobile segment, even when the labial periosteum was degloved. Blood flow from the periosteum was considered to be centripetal, to distinguish it from the blood flowing from endosteal vessels outward (centrifugal) that was associated with long bones. Previously, clinicians believed that the inferior alveolar artery had a primary role in nourishing the mandible, but Bell and Levy [33] demonstrated that there is also a sufficient blood supply from the surrounding soft tissues, even if the

inferior alveolar artery was compromised. More recent work in animals suggests that the blood supply to the body of the mandible under normal conditions comes almost entirely from the inferior alveolar artery [34]. However, when this source is obstructed, the peripheral blood vessels quickly take over for the anterior mandible. The posterior mandibular dentoalveolus, however, does not benefit from this kind of collateral blood supply, which calls into question the safety of posterior mandibular segmental alveolar osteotomies. Zisser and Gattinger [35] showed pulpal necrosis in the molars of horizontal osteotomies done above the IAN in the body of the mandible of dogs.

The safety of combined mandibular osteotomies, such as ramal procedures and body osteotomies, has been a concern because of the predominant role of the

![](images/c7cbcb36535774c0455dbd09626f382e898cdcfb4628e1d2f0797f784936517c.jpg)

inferior alveolar artery [36]. The fragility of the vascular supply to the mandibular alveolus engenders some concern over the common use of subapical osteotomies. Although their relative safety has been demonstrated by both animal studies and substantial clinical experience, subapical osteotomies need to be carefully planned to ensure as large a vascular pedicle as possible [33, 37]. Complications, such as pulpal necrosis, soft tissue defects, and loss of teeth and bone, have demonstrated the delicate nature of the blood supply, especially when attempts to move small dentoalveolar fragments are made. The effect of aging on the vascular supply to the mandibular body is an area about which very little information is known, particularly whether aging causes a switch from the centrifugal to the centripetal blood supply. Bradley [38] has demonstrated an apparent decreasing capacity of the inferior alveolar vessels that occurs with aging, but the impact of this effect on mandibular osteotomies is unknown. Subapical osteotomies are not routinely performed today.

Osteotomy designs of the vertical ramus have profited from studies of the effects of surgery on vascular supply. The proximal segment of the vertical subsigmoid osteotomy maintains its blood supply through the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) capsule and the attachment of the lateral pterygoid muscle. However, the inferior tip of this fragment may undergo vascular necrosis based upon prior experimental studies [39]. This observation led to the suggestion that fewer problems may occur if the cut is made above the angle of the mandible [39].

The importance of the periosteal blood supply as well as the endosteal supply in the vertical ramus has been explored by animal research [40-43]. When the medial pterygoid and masseter muscles are stripped, both blood flow and blood supply studies have demonstrated the possibility of avascular necrosis in the proximal segment. Comparisons of extensive muscle stripping of the vertical ramus versus preservation of the masseter attachment have demonstrated a significant difference in

the vascularity of the inferior portion of the proximal fragment. These studies of blood supply of the vertical ramus may be of value in predicting the vascular effects of the C or L osteotomies. However, resorption of the proximal fragment has not been reported in these particular bone cuts, possibly because of the rarity of their use. However, given the available research, it is prudent to minimize the periosteal and muscle attachment stripping on the medial surface of the proximal fragment with either the C or the L osteotomy, or any of their variations.

The last unanswered question concerning vascular supply in mandibular orthognathic surgery is the determination of a safe distance away from the apex of the teeth to make horizontal bone cuts. Much of the data addressing this question are based upon research about the maxilla [44]. From these early animal studies, the pulpal blood supply of a tooth should not be affected if a cut is made at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  away from the apex of the tooth root. Zisser and Gattinger [35], however, saw pulpal changes in dogs with some horizontal cuts that were made  $10\mathrm{mm}$  away from the apex. Whether these distances have any relevance to humans is unknown. Clinically, the incidence of tooth devitalization from horizontal subapical osteotomies is extremely low and it can be assumed that, for the most part,  $5\mathrm{mm}$  is an adequate guideline. A cut made  $10\mathrm{mm}$  from the apices, although allowing a greater safety margin, is often impractical because of other anatomic limitations. The greater distance from the apices of the teeth not only minimizes direct pulpal injury but also increases the vascular pedicle to the mobilized segment.

# 62.2.2 Nerves

The surgeon working around the face must be constantly aware of the nerve network that exists in this area. Fortunately, in considering the mandible, these concerns can be narrowed down to essentially two major nerves: the marginal mandibular branch of the seventh cranial nerve and the third division of the trigeminal nerve, and most frequently, one of its branches, the IAN. The marginal mandibular branch is usually at risk only during extraoral procedures. Although trauma to this nerve has been reported to occur during an intraoral approach, it is rare and, for the most part, appears to be preventable. Avoiding damage to this nerve during extraoral approaches to the mandible is a major surgical goal; in most cases of orthognathic surgery, it is achieved because soft tissue anatomy in patients undergoing the surgery has not been disturbed by disease or trauma. The techniques of these approaches, as well as the methods for minimizing the risks of damage to the marginal

mandibular branch, are covered elsewhere in this text. Damage to the third division of the trigeminal nerve is, however, a much-discussed issue in mandibular surgery. The course of the IAN into the vertical ramus and then through the body of the mandible makes it extremely susceptible to damage from almost every mandibular surgical procedure. In most cases, the surgeon's main goal relative to this nerve is to minimize the trauma, because its avoidance is almost impossible. In the past, surgeons stressed the importance of looking for and sometimes freeing up the nerve as it either entered or left the mandible before making osteotomies in the areas of the foramina. However, there is a trend toward avoiding this step, unless it is absolutely necessary to make the osteotomy as close to the nerve as possible. The simple act of exposing the nerve seems to increase the chance of postoperative sensory deficiency.

Often, the debates regarding whether one mandibular osteotomy is preferable to another are primarily based on the potential of damaging the IAN. This has resulted in many clinicians trivializing the damage found after certain techniques. Well-defined standards for both long- and short-term follow-up of nerve damage during mandibular procedures have been discussed [45]; however, in most papers, these have not been used to evaluate sensory deficits. In addition, very few controlled studies have been published comparing procedures, so, as a result, not much can be concluded regarding any of the various attempts to minimize nerve damage.

Studies evaluating the loss of tooth sensibility from horizontal osteotomies below the dental apices, however, have been quite consistent. Most authors found a relatively high loss of response to pulp testing immediately after osteotomies, especially when teeth are close to a vertical osteotomy [46-48]. However, this loss may not correlate with actual loss of tooth vitality and, thus, either tooth loss secondary to an osteotomy or the need for endodontic therapy is very low.

# 62.2.3 Muscles

Orthognathic surgery affects muscles primarily in one of two ways: it may change the length of a muscle or it may change the direction of muscle function. Effects of these changes are still not understood, although various authors have emphasized the importance of recognizing and controlling muscular alterations of orthognathic surgery. The muscles commonly discussed in orthognathic surgery of the mandible have been the muscles of mastication and the suprahyoid group of muscles. Recent interest in the soft tissue effects of facial skeletal surgery has expanded interest to the other facial mimetic muscles. This latter group, however, has generally not been dis

cussed relative to mandibular osteotomies, with the possible exception of the effect of anterior mandibular osteotomies on the attachment of the mentalis muscle. The muscles of mastication, however, have received considerable attention, dating back to the early vertical ramus procedures. Research interest on the effects of altering these muscles concentrated either on their effect on skeletal changes, especially relapse after mandibular osteotomies, or on the changes in the function of these muscles.

Distraction of the superior segment of a horizontal osteotomy of the vertical ramus owing to the temporalis muscle influence after surgery was noted early by surgeons who used this technique [49]. Evaluation of this procedure after correction of prognathism found a superior movement of the mandible in the gonial region as well as a downward and backward movement at the symphysis. This change, which was attributed to the forces of the pterygomasseteric sling, has received considerable attention, not only in mandibular setbacks done with osteotomies through the vertical ramus but also in mandibular advancements [50-55]. The apparent shortening of the vertical ramus has been noted in a number of studies, and in some, a correlation has been demonstrated between this change and the posterior movement of the symphysis. The exact reason for the change in the gonion has not been clearly demonstrated. Kohn [54] demonstrated the movement of this point inferoanteriorly in mandibular advancements by way of a measurement he termed the "gonial arc" (Fig. 62.8). Most investigators believe this represents distraction of the condyle from the fossa, and this hypothesis was further supported by the migration of the gonion back during the postoperative period [54, 55]. The long-term

![](images/501da57781c9622d90faf58e5b126d18cc6246830919df4881649301c8fee23e.jpg)  
Fig. 62.8 Gonial arc used for showing condylar position change with a mandibular osteotomy

postoperative decrease in gonial arc was generally believed to be due to remodeling, especially resorption that occurred at the mandibular angle [40, 43]. Especially in early studies, resorption could have accounted for this change because of the accepted technique of completely stripping muscle attachments from the proximal segment. However, in more recent studies in which minimal muscle stripping was done, a similar result has been noted [56, 57]. Will and associates [58] noted condylar distraction followed by an "overshoot" in the resettling of the condyle in the fossa. This change in condylar position may be due to either displacement of the disk within the TMJ or compression of the soft tissues of the joint by increased pressures secondary to the muscles of the pterygomasseteric sling.

The rotational change in the proximal segment of a mandibular osteotomy has been implicated in relapse by multiple clinicians who believe that the muscles of the pterygomasseteric sling reassert themselves after the surgery [59, 60]. Therefore, there has been an emphasis on carefully repositioning the proximal segment as close as possible to its preoperative position, which is a difficult task because there are many variable influences acting on condylar position that are different when records are obtained in an upright and awake position as opposed to supine under general anesthesia. Unfortunately, a correlation between mandibular ramus positioning and relapse in the case of mandibular advancements has never been demonstrated. A few studies have shown a relation between relapse of mandibular setback surgeries and the position of the vertical ramus [61]. It has been noted in these surgeries that the degree of clockwise rotation of the proximal fragment in a sagittal osteotomy seems to relate to the amount of forward relapse of the distal segment. Franco and colleagues [61] theorized that both stretching of the medial pterygoid muscle as well as the elongation of the anterior fibers of the masseter and temporalis muscles from the clockwise rotation of the proximal segment can contribute to relapse in lengthening the muscles of the pterygomasseteric sling. This can result in a change in mandibular position as has been documented by Yellich and coworkers [62]. The degree to which this is active in orthognathic surgery remains unclear.

The contribution of the suprahyoid muscles to relapse in mandibular advancement surgery is equivocal, with many clinicians supporting the existence of this relationship. Ellis and Carlson [63] demonstrated in monkeys that relieving the suprahyoid muscles from the symphysis of the mandible decreased the amount of relapse when the mandibles were advanced. Clinical studies, however, have failed to show a relation between suprahyoid myotomies and relapse [64, 65]. Animal studies have also demonstrated that adaptive changes occur in the connective tissues at the muscle-tendon and tendon-bone interfaces but only with large advancements [66].

The belief, however unsubstantiated, that muscle pull in some way does affect the stability of mandibular osteotomies has led to a variety of recommendations. Historically, the most common method advocated is the attempt at minimizing the change in muscle position and length. The cutting of muscle attachments, such as has been recommended for the suprahyoid group, has the potential for increasing morbidity. Without significant evidence that this is of much value, this additional surgery cannot be justified. However, there has been recognition that muscles and their attachments seem to adapt fairly quickly if the bone is held rigidly for a long enough time [66, 67]. It is important to recognize that intermaxillary fixation (IMF) does not provide a completely stable method of bone fixation, especially if the teeth have been under active orthodontic movement. In addition, the greatest amount of relapse of mandibular osteotomies seems to occur in the first 3-6 weeks after surgery. Whatever the causes of the instability during this time, several techniques have been designed to provide increased stability for this initial period, to improve the stability of mandibular osteotomies. Primarily two techniques have been attempted: external supporting mechanisms and internal rigid fixation. The only external technique that has been of much value has been the wiring technique termed skeletal fixation. With this procedure, the bony skeletons are tied to one another, circumventing the periodontal ligaments of the teeth. This has been used with IMF, maintaining mandibular immobilization for 6-8 weeks (Fig. 62.9) [58, 67, 68]. The alternative procedures of internal rigid fixation techniques using plates or screws are discussed in the next section.

# 62.3 Mandibular Osteotomy Techniques

# 62.3.1 Mandibular Ramus Osteotomies

Osteotomies in the vertical ramus have been the preferred technique for correcting developmental deformities of the mandible. This preference has increased with closer cooperation between orthodontists and surgeons in treating dentofacial deformities. Most of the time, the dental arch discrepancies can be corrected orthodontically, leaving to the surgeon the responsibility for moving the coordinated dental arch into its appropriate position, as dictated by functional and aesthetic demands. Operations in the vertical ramus, therefore, are considered primarily when the dental arch as a unit has to be moved. As previously noted, there are numerous techniques for osteotomies of the ramus, but essentially three different procedures, with minor variations, are currently accepted techniques.

# 62.3.2 Vertical Ramus Osteotomy (VRO)

Osteotomies extending from the sigmoid notch vertically behind the IAN foramen to the inferior border or angle have had several different names, but generally, the VRO seems to describe the procedure best (Fig. 62.10). This osteotomy was initially done through an extraoral approach, but with the development of small offset oscillating blades with a long shaft, and adequate retraction, the intraoral route has become preferred.

# 62.3.2.1 Indications

The VRO has been limited to deformities requiring the mandible to be set back for mandibular horizontal excess or to be rotated for mandibular asymmetry. Robinson and Lytle [69] stated that this osteotomy can be used for mandibular advancement, but generally, this recommendation was not accepted owing to questionable stability. Hall and McKenna [70] later revived this indication for minor  $(2 - 3\mathrm{mm})$  advancements.

# 62.3.2.2 Technique

When preparing for an intraoral VRO, one needs to closely evaluate the panoramic and lateral head films or CBCT for the position of the inferior alveolar foramen relative to the posterior border of the mandible. The incision is made in the mucosa from midway up the anterior border of the ramus to the first molar area. The periosteum is reflected laterally to expose the entire lateral ramus, with the exception of the condyle neck and coronoid tip. Care should be taken to avoid the reflection of periosteum off of the posterior and inferior borders. Muscle attachments at the angle are generally difficult to

Fig. 62.10 The length of the osteotomy changed over time getting longer and more vertical. The original design (a) was short because it was done percutaneously with a Gigli saw. The desire for more bony contact and the ability to complete it intraorally lead to a  
longer osteotomy as depicted in (b). The current design (c) maximizes bony contact and minimizes the tendency for condylar displacement by maintaining some medial pterygoid attachment

elevate and should be left to ensure blood supply to this area and support to the proximal segment. A special retractor, Merrill-Levasseur, fits around the posterior border, posterior to the angle, and retracts tissue laterally, so that an oscillating saw can be used (Fig. 62.11a). Also, Bauer retractors, left and right, can be used superiorly in the sigmoid notch for additional retraction, visualization, and vascular structures near the sigmoid notch.

The saw chosen should have a rounded blade that is set at an obtuse angle to the long shaft of the drill to facilitate the osteotomy. The blade can be used first to score the proposed osteotomy line on the lateral cortex. This line is then closely checked for its position relative to the sigmoid notch, posterior border, and angle. The use of the so-called antilingula has been proposed as the

landmark for the mandibular foramen, but has generally fallen into disfavor because of both the difficulties with its identification and its lack of predictable relation to the foramen [12, 71, 72]. The cut should be made no more than  $5 - 7\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the posterior border at the anticipated level of the foramen, using the retractor as a guide to the posterior border [73]. With the increasing popularity of virtual surgical planning and prefabricated cutting guides, the positioning of the osteotomy in relationship to the mandibular foramen and posterior border can be further delineated. The cut can be carried through the medial cortex, starting in the middle of the ramus then carried superiorly to the sigmoid notch, and lastly finished at the inferior border (see  $\boxed{\mathbb{O}}$  Fig. 62.11b). Alternatively, one can start at the inferior aspect and

Fig. 62.11 The intraoral VSO. a Exposure. b Vertical ramus osteotomy. c Proximal fragment displaced laterally

proceed superiorly as the likelihood of encountering a vascular hazard increases in that direction and prompt management of a vascular incident requires that the osteotomy be completed for access. In considering the locations of the osteotomy cut, the vascular hazards should be recognized, including the masseteric artery superiorly, the inferior alveolar artery in the middle, and the facial artery inferiorly. Therefore, the surgical ability to control a bleed from one of these three sources should factor into the decision regarding where to begin and where to end the osteotomy. As the cut is completed, anterolateral tension is maintained on the Merril-Levasseur retractor so that the proximal fragment will be brought out laterally and prevent medial displacement. A straight clamp can be used to rotate the segment laterally after the cut is made and then to stabilize it while periosteum and muscle are stripped from the medial cortex down to the angle (see Fig. 62.11c). Again, a small attachment is left at the angle to ensure a blood supply. This proximal fragment can be held for

ward and laterally by a small gauze pack while the opposite side is being completed. If the proximal fragment is lost medially, it usually can be brought into the field with the help of a "J" shaped periosteal elevator that is inserted posteromedially at the level of the sigmoid notch or at the inferior aspect of the proximal fragment while the distal fragment is being pulled forward. The mandibular dentition is brought into its new position after the completion of both osteotomies, as established by a prefabricated occlusal splint and stabilized with maxillomandibular fixation.

Attention is directed back into the wound and toward placement, or reduction, and stabilization of the proximal fragment. Wire osseous fixation is generally not needed, although advocated by some surgeons. Most important is achieving as broad a bone contact area as possible, without displacing or rotating the condyle. Adjustment of the lateral cortex of the distal fragment may be performed with a straight fissure bur or small acrylic bur to permit the proximal fragment to lie

as flat as possible against the vertical ramus. Care should be taken to ensure that the long axis of the proximal fragment does not differ considerably from its preoperative position. After a thorough irrigation of the wound, the mucosa is closed with a running, resorbable suture. No drains or external dressings are typically needed, and IMF is used for 4-6 weeks, depending upon patient age and other factors. Postsurgical radiographs should be taken as soon as possible to confirm that the condyles have not been displaced or dislocated. A small amount of forward and downward position of the condyle is common, and this generally resolves during the period of IMF (  $\bullet$  Fig. 62.12).

Preoperative submentovertex radiographs, or now a CBCT, have been recommended to identify divergence of the posterior border. It has been suggested that an angle smaller than 130 degrees produces such a significant surgical problem that in this type of patient, a VRO procedure should be avoided and another technique used. The use of this radiograph as a criterion for choosing this technique has been questioned, but some still believe that it can be used to identify the more difficult cases [73, 74].

A large number of variations of the VRO technique have come in the osteotomy design. Oblique versions, with the cut ending above the angle, have been described by many clinicians, with the only apparent benefit being the relative ease in performing the technique. Theoretically, there should also be less chance of damaging the IAN, but there has been no study to confirm this benefit. Interestingly, the one potential drawback, that of decreased skeletal stability, also appears to be difficult to demonstrate [75]. In contrast with this shorter cut, surgeons have recommended that a larger portion of the inferior border be left with the proximal fragment, especially in the larger mandibular setbacks [70]. This permits a good attachment of the medial pterygoid muscle to be maintained at the mandibular angle, which has been claimed to help seat the condyle in the fossa as the patient wakens from anesthesia. This variation, including the use of 8 weeks of IMF, is claimed to decrease one of the problems of the intraoral VRO, specifically that of condylar sag and the resulting open bite that can occur on the release of fixation. Unfortunately, no clinical data have been reported that support this claim. The use of osseous wire fixation has been

advocated to ensure the seating of the condyle. Again, no study comparing wire osseous fixation with no fixation has shown any advantage for the use of the wire [76-78]. This may be explained in the intraoral procedures by the technical difficulties of wire placement. However, Ritzau and associates [77] showed in an excellent prospective study that even from an extraoral approach, the position of the condyle in the fossa is not improved with the use of wire osseous fixation.

The effect of the temporalis pull on relapse has led to other recommendations that include either stripping the temporalis attachment completely off of the coronoid process or coronoidotomy. The use of coronoidotomy has been recommended by some clinicians for large setbacks, with a few using this modification routinely. The advantage of the coronoidotomy relative to prevention of relapse has not been studied, but the stability of the intraoral vertical subcondylar ramus osteotomy (IVRO) with coronoidotomy, compared with the sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) of the vertical ramus in mandibular setbacks, has been investigated and the IVRO seemed to be more stable [79].

The use of the inverted-L osteotomy is another method used to neutralize the temporalis influence. This modification of the IVRO requires stripping off the medial periosteum to identify the lingula so that a horizontal cut can be made without increasing the risk of damaging the IAN. A further modification of the inverted-L osteotomy has been the use of rigid internal fixation. Although technically a difficult surgery, it permits the early release from IMF. Unfortunately, there are no long-term studies that evaluate the stability of any of the inverted-L techniques.

# 62.3.2.3 Alternative Techniques

The major variation of the described VRO technique is the use of an extraoral approach. The soft tissue incision is similar to that commonly used for an external approach to a fracture of the mandibular angle, with an approximately 4-cm incision made  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the angle and the inferior border of the mandible (Fig. 62.13a). A combination of sharp and blunt dissection is used to access the inferior border of the mandible. Care is taken to avoid damaging the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. After incising through the periosteum, the bone cuts are similar to those that have been described (see Fig. 62.13b).

The external approach has been advocated for large mandibular setbacks of greater than  $10\mathrm{mm}$ , difficult asymmetries, or large vertical moves in patients with unusual facial structure. Except for the risk of the scar, the risks of this technique have been reported as being comparable with the intraoral technique [50, 80].

# 62.3.2.4 Complications

# Stability

Postoperative change in skeletal and dental position after the use of VRO in the treatment of mandibular horizontal excess has received much attention. Goldstein [81] was the first to use serial cephalograms to evaluate the postoperative change of the mandible after surgical correction of the mandibular prognathism. He noted the anterior relapse that has now been well documented. Poulton and colleagues [82] recommended overcorrecting the mandibular setback by  $2\mathrm{mm}$  to provide for the relapse that they noted. This amount of average relapse has, surprisingly, remained fairly consistent throughout

![](images/7f3f043ca252a006910a9958cf3a02a75f5a72472ddd346533f7ee901bf03b8b.jpg)

the history of this technique, even though technical changes in procedures have been made [80, 83]. Stella and coworkers [84] noted that the variation in the amount of relapse in mandibular setbacks was large and attempts at identifying controllable variables should be made. They suggested that the proximal fragment rotation affects the short-term pogonion changes, although they did not present any corroborative research. The finding that the pogonion tends to move posteroinferiorly during IMF has been well documented [52]. This movement, later followed by the anterosuperior "relapse" that occurs after skeletal fixation wires, does seem to stabilize the initial movement but does not affect the long-term relapse [50, 51, 56].

Vertical instability of the VRO develops soon after the release of IMF in many patients. This problem was initially attributed to the "condylar sag" seen on x-ray films taken soon after surgery [73]. Although condylar sag may be one cause of relapse, a major contributor seems to be the insufficient time of IMF. The VRO is generally not considered an appropriate surgery for correction of anterior open bite. In Scandinavian countries, however, this surgical procedure has been successfully used for patients with mandibular horizontal excess and anterior open bite [85].

# Nerve Damage

The chance of damaging the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve is one of the reasons given by several surgeons for avoiding the extraoral approach to the VRO. This concern, however, seems to be unsubstantiated, in that almost all of the clinicians reporting on the results of this approach have noted very little, if any, motor nerve damage. Damage to the IAN, however, is a concern in using a VRO. The incidence of trauma to the IAN at the time of surgery has been reported to vary from being "rare" to occurring  $36\%$  of the time [70]. Long-term sensory defects have also been reported to vary from none to  $35\%$  [45, 86]. These apparent discrepancies can be explained by the differences in the sensitivity of the measurement techniques; in addition, there is a wide variation in the time after surgery during which the patients were tested. Other variables, such as whether the osteotomy was approached intraorally or extraorally as well as variations in the length of the cut, theoretically could affect the incidence of sensory problems, but comparison studies have not been done. From studies that have been done, the incidence of damage to the IAN is low with the VRO compared with the SSO [86, 87]. The patient, however, should be warned that shortterm sensory loss is a definite risk and permanent paresthesia is possible.

# TMJ Dysfunction

Interesting literature has been published on changes in TMJ function after a VRO. These have included a number of radiographic studies documenting positional change of the condyle relative to the fossa. Radiographically, there is an initial downward and forward movement of the condyle, with a subsequent tendency to return to its preoperative position [77, 78, 82]. Sometimes, a double contour of the condyle appears approximately 6 months postoperatively, which has been attributed to condylar remodeling after the surgery [88]. Remodeling of the glenoid fossa has also been documented [78].

In one early review of 100 cases, 6 patients were reported to have TMJ problems at 1 year after surgery [89]. A form of the VRO has been used to treat patients with TMJ pain and dysfunction. It appears that the VRO does not put the TMJ at any significant risk, and it may in fact be salutary for patients with preexisting TMJ dysfunction [90-92].

# Other Complications

Among the other reported complications of the VRO, vascular necrosis of the proximal segment seems to be the most potentially devastating. The maintenance of some muscle attachment to the angles makes this possibility unlikely.

# 62.3.3 Inverted-L and C Ramus Osteotomies

Osteotomy designs in the vertical ramus that include both the condyle and the coronoid in the same segment have varied from Blair's simple horizontal osteotomy to the modified C osteotomy of Hayes. The horizontal osteotomy of the vertical ramus has generally fallen into disuse because of the substantial relapse potential, but many of the remaining suggested variations continue to have treatment value. The two procedures that seem to be the most popular are the inverted-L and the C osteotomites. Both are generally approached extraorally, although intraoral variants are possible [93]. Clinical studies of either technique are rare, but those that exist seem to demonstrate reasonable success in correcting skeletal deformities with minimal complications.

# 62.3.3.1 Indications

The C osteotomy is generally reserved for the treatment of horizontal mandibular deficiency, with some authors suggesting that it can be used to close an anterior open bite. The inverted-L, however, has been used for the

correction of most types of mandibular horizontal discrepancies, including an anterior open bite. Generally, advancements of the distal segment with either technique require bone grafting to ensure adequate bone union.

# 62.3.3.2 Techniques

The basic techniques for an extraoral approach to perform a C and an inverted-L are the same, with the only modification being the inferior horizontal cut in the C osteotomy. For that reason, the inverted-L is described first, with various modifications of the C discussed later. The patient is prepared and draped, such that access to both the mouth and the submandibular incision area can occur without contamination of the skin wound by oral organisms. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, but most surgeons use a plastic drape with adhesive on one edge to separate the two areas. The external drapes should be arranged so that they allow turning of the head for access to the submandibular wounds as well as access to the mouth.

The submandibular incision is made  $2\mathrm{cm}$  below the angle and inferior border of the mandible. The posterior portion is curved superiorly to follow the cervical skin line as well as to improve the access to the entire vertical ramus. Generally, the incision is approximately  $6\mathrm{cm}$  in length. Sharp dissection is used down through the platysma, and then blunt dissection is begun to minimize risk to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. The incision through the pterygomandibular sling and periosteum is made along the inferior border and is carried around the angle and up the posterior border about  $2\mathrm{cm}$ . Periosteum and attachments for the masseter are completely stripped off the lateral cortex of the vertical ramus up to the level of the sigmoid notch. Very

little periosteum is stripped off the medial side, especially at the angle, to retain as much blood supply as possible to the proximal fragment. The posterior vertical osteotomy is made at least  $7\mathrm{mm}$  in front of the posterior border and extends to a point of the inferior border just in front of the angle. The horizontal cut is made above the anticipated position of the inferior alveolar foramen (Fig. 62.14a). As mentioned previously with the VRO, it is wise to have a good radiographic view of the ramus so that the position of this foramen can be more accurately located. It is helpful to review the study by Reitzik and associates [72] of the position of the foramen relative to the lateral landmarks to lessen trauma to the neurovascular bundle.

Once the cuts are made, the medial periosteum may have to be elevated from some of the distal fragments to allow its advancement. Moist gauze is placed in the wound, and a similar procedure is done on the opposite side. After completion of the contralateral side, drapes are pulled back and shifted such that the oral cavity can be entered to place the mandibular teeth into the new occlusal position and secured with IMF. The surgeons who are involved in the intraoral fixation should change gloves and surgical gowns before the drapes are replaced so that the skin incisions can again be approached. The next step varies depending on the type of mandibular movement that occurred; however, the importance of maintaining the proximal fragment close to its preoperative position remains. If the distal segment is set back, the proximal segment has to be overlapped laterally (see Fig. 62.14b). As described with the VRO, some adjustments of the lateral cortex of the distal segment may be necessary to permit the passive position of the proximal fragment as well as to provide a good area of bone contact. The use of some form of fixation is

generally recommended, although the use of no interosseous fixation has been suggested [93]. The type of osseous fixation varies widely; however, rigid internal fixation with metal plates or mesh secured with screws has become more popular [93]. After irrigation, the wound is closed in layers by whatever suturing method and material the surgeon prefers. Care should be taken to ensure hemostasis as the wound is closed. If there is any concern about hematoma formation, a small drain should be placed. External pressure dressings are maintained for 24-48 hours. When the bone has been stabilized with wire fixation, IMF is used for at least 6 weeks and preferably 8 weeks.

# 62.3.3.3 Alternative Techniques

The most commonly used variation of the previously mentioned technique is the C osteotomy. This technique was first described jointly by Caldwell and coworkers

[18] in an article reviewing their experiences with what they called a vertical-L osteotomy. They described a variation of their basic vertical-L with the addition of a horizontal cut that extended forward from the vertical cut below the inferior alveolar canal (Fig. 62.15a). This permitted a larger amount of bone contact when the mandible was advanced. They also realized the problems caused by advancing the coronoid process and recommended either cutting the coronoid loose (coronoidotomy) or including it with the proximal segment (C osteotomy). Arcing the inferior cut was suggested to permit increased bone contact as the distal segment was advanced (see Fig. 62.15b) [94]. Unfortunately, the proposed arc cannot always be made because the position of the neurovascular bundle may interfere. Sagittal splitting of the inferior limb of the C osteotomy was proposed both to increase the bone contact area when the mandible was advanced and to

![](images/9325c84fce104131a57e1446696eb0047bd88f6aa872da1f14b72d8935cd8444.jpg)

decrease the problem of "notching" of the inferior border (see Fig. 62.15c) [19]. This latter problem, which is noticeable in some patients, is caused by the defect along the inferior border resulting from the advanced distal segment of the mandible. A further variation used to improve bone healing includes a bone graft taken from the lateral cortex of the distal segment and transferred back into the gap of the mid-ramus area (see Fig. 62.15d). The coronoid process has also been recommended as a free graft into this defect [20].

A further major modification of the described techniques is the use of rigid internal fixation [95-97]. The use of vitalium mesh with two screws in each fragment has been demonstrated as being effective, but any rigid plate with screws can be used to permit the early release of maxillomandibular dental fixation.

# 62.3.3.4 Complications

The skeletal stability of the inverted-L and its modifications, unlike the VRO, seems to be technique-sensitive to the type of fixation used. Like stability studies for almost all aspects of orthognathic surgery, controlled clinical studies are nonexistent, and the comparison of techniques by a single institution, if reported, lacks sufficient numbers of patients to make valid conclusions. Farrell and Kent [93] evaluated inverted-L and C osteotomies and reported skeletal relapse similar to what had been reported for the BSSO. However, because there were different criteria for the use of these two types of osteotomies, comparisons between them are questionable. Greebe and Tuinzing [98] compared the stability of mandibular advancement by way of an inverted-L or a BSSO. With only a few patients, they did not show any difference between the groups, but they did claim that skeletal relapse was dependent on the ratio of posterior facial height to anterior facial height. The largest studies of the stability of the inverted L included the use of rigid internal fixation in patients who had the mandible advanced. These seem to demonstrate that the use of rigid fixation for this type of procedure is more stable than simple IMF [96, 97]. However, statements relative to the stability of mandibular setbacks or the closure of open bites cannot be made, although a few authors seem to advocate these skeletal deformities as indications for the use of the inverted-L osteotomy [96, 99].

The incidence of facial nerve damage has not been mentioned in any review of these techniques, although it can be inferred to be quite low, given the reports for the external approach to the VRO. The incidence of damage to the IAN should be higher than the extraoral VRO because of the horizontal portions of the osteotomy,

but Reitzik and colleagues [96] reported only a  $6\%$  incidence of permanent anesthesia with inverted-L osteotomies. The incidence of unsightly scars, which many clinicians claim deters them from using this approach, is unknown with this group of osteotomies.

# 62.3.4 Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy

The BSSO of the vertical ramus has in a relatively short time become the predominant orthognathic procedure of the mandible. Schuchardt [23] is credited for the use of an intraoral approach to what was called the "step" osteotomy of the vertical ramus. Specifically, he described parallel horizontal cuts through the cortex of the vertical ramus, the medial cut located above the lingual, and the lateral cut made about  $1\mathrm{cm}$  below that level. A split was then made between these two cortices, and the distal segment could then be advanced or set back. Lane evidently described a very similar procedure earlier, but it probably was done extraorally (see Fig. 62.4) [22]. The singular credit for improving on this osteotomy, as well as being its strongest advocate, belongs to Obwegeser, who together with Trauner in 1955, described a sagittal split of the vertical ramus [21]. This intraoral technique included the medial horizontal cut above the lingula, but the lateral horizontal cut was lower than that of Schuchardt and extended to a point just above the angle, at least  $25\mathrm{mm}$  below the lingual cortical cut (Fig. 62.16a). A wide-splitting osteotome was then used to obtain a split between the cortices, with care taken to preserve the IAN and vascular bundle. This procedure was later slightly modified by Obwegeser by angling the lateral cut more toward the inferior border of the mandible (see Fig. 62.16b). The major modifications still in use today were suggested by DalPont [24]. The change commonly attributed to DalPont is the forward extension of the vertical cut through the lateral cortex just behind the second molar. But he also suggested the use of a medial cut that extends just past the lingula so that the posterior split would rather occur in the mylohyoid groove at the inferior border. Multiple other modifications have been suggested, but surprisingly, the present-day osteotomy remains very similar to that initially described by Obwegeser and DalPont. Also in use today is the description by Hunsuck [25] to terminate the medial horizontal cut in the retrolingular fossa, and not attempt to cut through the posterior border; this would ensure that the induced fracture would occur posterior to lingula, in the thin bone, rather than in the thick cortical bone of the posterior border of the ramus.

# 62.3.4.1 Indications

The BSSO has been advocated for all types of mandibular deformities and for each possible mandibular movement that includes the entire horizontal ramus of the mandible.

# 62.3.4.2 Technique

This osteotomy has had multiple variations described, as would be expected for such a popular procedure, but many of them are based upon one surgeon's individual preferences, and the effect of these alterations of the osteotomy on the outcome of the procedure is questionable. Therefore, only the basic procedures are outlined, as well as the significant modifications that have been shown to affect the outcome or seem to have a solid theoretical foundation.

The incision is made on the anterior portion of the vertical ramus, midway between the occlusal planes. It is carried downward through the middle of the retromolar fossa to a point about  $5\mathrm{mm}$  behind the second molar. Then the incisions wind laterally and forward to a point distal just to the first molar (Fig. 62.17a). The incision should be kept lateral enough to allow easy closure of the wound later in the procedure in the event the teeth are in IMF. The periosteum is reflected to expose the lateral cortex of the mandible down to the inferior border for the vertical cut only. The exposure should be limited posteriorly to maximize the blood supply to the proximal fragment; this usually means the exposure ends at about the antagonial notch, and the masseter muscle is reflected minimally. A lateral channel retractor, or Minnesota retractor, can be placed at this time to assist in retraction as the periosteum is elevated from the retromolar area up the anterior border of the vertical ramus. Periosteal elevators are used during this portion

of the surgery. The attachment of the temporalis muscle can be tenacious, but it may be reflected off of the coronoid process to the level of the sigmoid notch to ensure adequate access for the medial horizontal cut. Most times, this means stripping approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  of the temporalis attachment off the anterior border of the coronoid process. The periosteum is then elevated from the medial surface of the vertical ramus, starting at about the level of the sigmoid notch and extending back to the medial flare at the start of the condylar neck. Inferiorly, the medial cortex is exposed to the lingula, with care being taken to minimize trauma to the IAN just below this area. The periosteal elevation can be extended inferoanteriorly along the internal oblique line to the distal of the second molar to allow better exposure of the osteotomy site, with care taken to protect the lingual nerve. A variety of retractors are available for the protection of the medial soft tissues and IAN, but it is wise to choose one that permits as much visualization as possible while at the same time protecting the soft tissue (see Fig. 62.17b). Excessive medial retraction should not be done in order to minimize nerve damage. It should be noted that, most commonly, it is not necessary to carry the medial exposure to the posterior border of the vertical ramus.

The osteotomy is begun by making a horizontal bone cut through the medial cortex of the vertical ramus that extends from a point just posterior to and above the lingula to the anterior border of the ramus. Anteriorly, the cut is made about halfway through the ramus, but in the concavity above and behind the lingula, it should be shallow to allow the posterior medial split to initiate in the mylohyoid groove (see Fig. 62.17c). Sometimes, it is helpful to use a large round or acrylic bur to remove bone from the internal oblique ridge so that the depth of

this concavity can be visualized. Occasionally, at the level of this horizontal cut, there is no significant cancellous bone to delineate the cortices. Here, the use of a half thickness of the ramus is the most practical guideline for judging the appropriate depth of this cut.

The vertical cut through the buccal cortex is generally made just distal to the second molar and extends from the inferior border superiorly to the external oblique ridge. Sometimes, the mandible is thin and the external oblique ridge ends at the distobuccal aspect of the second molar. In this case, the superior aspect of the vertical cut should be posterolateral enough so that the roots of the second molar are not placed at risk. The cut should be as close to perpendicular to the inferior border as possible and extended just into cancellous bone. Caution must be used such that the cut is not made any deeper because the IAN may be just medial to the buccal cortex in this region.

The vertical and horizontal cortical cuts are connected, starting superiorly at the anterior border of vertical ramus and continuing down just inside the external oblique ridge to the vertical cut (see Fig. 62.17d). Again, the cut is made into cancellous bone, when at all possible, with the superior part of this connection being as deep as possible, especially if no cancellous bone is present. This will minimize the chance of an inadvertent fracture of the medial cortex. Some surgeons recommend that the corners between the horizontal and the connecting cuts, as well as the vertical and the connecting cuts, be rounded again to minimize a fracture. Difficulty is encountered often and can occur if a third molar is present and has been planned to be removed at the time of surgery. It is generally prudent to plan for the mandibular third molars to be removed well in advance of the SSO because they can make the surgery more difficult. Preferably, these third molars should be removed at least 9–12 months in advance of the SSO. Even experienced surgeons who remove third molars at the same time as the osteotomy may have difficulty in obtaining a successful split, but in general, the presence of third molars is a significant risk factor for bad splits, such as inadvertent buccal or lingual cortical plate fractures. Also, the bone defect left by the removal of the third molar can make the use of rigid fixation with bicortical screws more difficult and also weaken the bone distal to the second molar, resulting in less support.

Techniques vary widely regarding how the actual bone split is accomplished. The method described here is an attempt to be as universal as possible. First, steps are taken to ensure that the limits of the split occur as defined by the horizontal and vertical bone cuts. A narrow (4-mm) thin osteotome may be driven along the horizontal cut and directed so that it cuts through the medial cortex above and behind the lingula. It is also

used to ensure that the split at the base of the vertical cut is started through the midpoint of the inferior border. Many surgeons also use this type of thin osteotome to "step" along the connecting cut to help ensure that the split stays close to the lateral bone cortex. Traditionally, wide-wedging osteotomes have been used to slowly complete the split. More often today, a special spreading instrument, a Smith spreader, is used along with a smaller osteotome to allow more control of the split. Generally, the movement is initiated along the vertical cut and carefully extended posteriorly. The fine osteotome can be used to keep the split close to the lateral cortex. If the IAN is encountered, it is carefully separated from the proximal fragment. The split along the inferior border can be difficult to control, and the judicious use of a thin osteotome will assist in this area. Finally, as the posterior split through the medial cortex is made, care should be used to prevent the split from continuing behind the mylohyoid fossa and starting up the neck of the condyle. The speed of the split often varies, depending on the elasticity of the bone. In older patients, in whom the bone is not as elastic, the split can occur very suddenly. Preventing inappropriate fractures is dependent on the care used not only in making the cortical bone cuts but also in ensuring that the splits occur as planned at the posterior aspect of the horizontal cut and along the inferior border.

The two key areas necessary to ensure that an appropriate osteotomy occurs and to minimize the chance of a bad split are the medial horizontal cut into the retrolingular fossa and the cut through the inferior border on to the lingual aspect of the mandible. Attention should be directed to the area of the inferior border osteotomy to assist if a bad split is noted, and control in this area could prevent propagation of an inadvertent osteotomy.

The medial pterygoid attachments are stripped off the proximal fragment to permit freedom of movement between the two fragments. If the mandibular teeth are planned to be retropositioned, either unilaterally to correct an asymmetry or bilaterally for correction of horizontal mandibular excess, an appropriate amount of bone is removed at this time from the anterior portion of the proximal fragment. The amount of bone removal may be based upon model surgery or the prediction tracings. With large setbacks or advancements, the bone will need to be removed from the anterior edge of the vertical ramus. When setting the mandible back, this needs to leave space between the vertical ramus and the mandibular second molar to prevent this area from interfering with the patient's ability to clean the mandibular second molars (see Fig. 62.17e). Conversely, in large advancements, bone sometimes has to be removed from the remaining portion of the anterior border of the vertical ramus of the distal segment just

anterior to the lingula to prevent encroachment of the segment against the maxillary tuberosity (see Fig. 62.17f). After the opposite side is split, the mandible is moved into its new position and stabilized with IMF. It may be preferable to use an interocclusal splint to ensure accurate positioning of the mandible relative to the maxilla, based on the presurgical model surgery. It is unusual for teeth to interdigitate accurately enough to obviate the use of a splint, although, if there is a full dentition and the occlusion is deemed stable, it is acceptable to apply IMF without the use of an interocclusal splint.

The placement of osseous fixation is performed at this point. Because multiple techniques are possible, different options are described in the following section on "Alternative Techniques." For the SSO, rigid fixation techniques generally include bicortical screws or monocortical plate and screw fixation. After placement of osseous fixation, if rigid fixation is used, the IMF is released, allowing the occlusion to be evaluated. If an interocclusal splint is used, it may be removed at this time to monitor the occlusion during the postoperative phase. The wounds are thoroughly irrigated and closed with the use of a resorbable running suture. No drains or external dressings are generally necessary, and guiding elastic intermaxillary traction may be used postoperatively (Fig. 62.18).

# 62.3.4.3 Alternative Techniques

There are many variations to the technique described here, and in this section, only the major variations are discussed. The design of the osteotomy itself has received much attention, with each variation representing an attempt to decrease the incidence of complications, although there is very little supportive research for any of the modifications. Obwegeser was responsible for two variations, the first being his original design, in which the buccal cut was horizontal and parallel to the lingual cut through the cortex of the vertical ramus (see Fig. 62.16a). This original technique was modified by making the lateral cortical cut at an angle to the medial cut so that the posterior portion of the osteotomy ended just above the angle (see Fig. 62.16b) [100].

A popular modification of DalPont's vertical osteotomy is the continuation of this cut completely through the inferior border, which, according to surgeon advocates, made the split easier to perform, and decreased the chance of a bad split [59]. This technique, however, makes the use of rigid fixation with bicortical screws difficult [101]. A few modifications have been suggested for the connecting cut, with the primary goal of allowing better control of the proximal fragment. These modifications appear to be primarily personal preferences

because there is no evidence that these changes improve the outcome of the procedure.

A major area of variation for the SSO is in the use, or nonuse, of osseous fixation [21, 25, 102, 103]. The original Obwegeser technique [104] used wire through the superior lateral and medial cortices. This technique, with minor variation, became the standard for the SSO until rigid fixation became popular [59]. The use of circummandibular wires and inferior border wires have also been suggested as improved methods to control the proximal fragment [105]. No evidence exists that any of these wiring techniques have an advantage for minimizing complications [26].

Spiessl [26] introduced the concept of using screws for "rigid internal fixation" of the SSO. Following its introduction in 1974, there was a slow acceptance of this method of osseous fixation. Currently, there is little debate on the advantages of using rigid internal fixation; however, a wide variety of methods and materials are used. Initially, the use of three  $2.7\mathrm{-mm}$  "lag" screws on each side was advocated. A lag screw is placed by drilling a "guiding" hole with a larger drill through the lateral cortex, followed by a smaller hole through the medial cortex that is threaded with the use of a tap. Lag screws are then used to fix the proximal fragment tightly to the distal fragment. Compression across the osteotomy site was believed to be important to speed the healing of the osteotomy as well as to ensure the stability of the mandible. Concern developed among surgeons that compression may cause increased IAN damage and displacement of the condyles, with subsequent TMJ dysfunction [106, 107]. An alternative technique, the positional screw, or bicortical screw, in which both cortices are drilled of equal diameter, has been advocated for stabilizing the osteotomy segments [100]. This technique permits maintenance of the gaps that may occur between the proximal and the distal fragments due to minor bony interferences, with no effort being made to compress the two segments together that may torque the condyle or compress the IAN. Standardization of techniques does not exist in rigid fixation of the SSO because there are many differences in screw sizes, number of screws, materials used, and whether plates are used across the osteotomy sites. Most of the research in the United States has centered on the use of three screws that are  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter. The use of monocortical screws and plates has become more widely used and a large multicenter study has provided clinical evidence to support this as routine practice. Direct comparisons of the various rigid fixation techniques in the literature are scarce and do not demonstrate that any one technique has any advantages [108-110]. One exception was noted by Fujioka and coworkers [111], who found that there

was more rotation through the osteotomy sites in patients with monocortical plate and screw fixation, perhaps justifying the need to consider additional fixation with counterclockwise rotation movements.

The use of resorbable screws has been a recent addition to fixation schemes. First attempted in Finland, the screws are made from polyglycolic acid using different manufacturing techniques and formulas. Development of these self-reinforced polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid copolymers that have reliable strength to withstand forces of mastication has made their use applicable in orthognathic surgery. The obvious advantage of resorbable fixation is to obviate future hardware removal, which is rarely necessary in the United States, but it has become an issue with patient concerns of risks of any permanent implant. The key features that are crucial in its application in orthognathic surgery are the rigidity and strength of the material, with the ability to resorb in a timely fashion. A few small studies have shown apparent stability of these resorbable implants comparable to metallic fixation; however, some inherent problems with material handling and early fixation failures have been reported [112-114]. Suuronen and associates [112] reported the use of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) screws for fixation in SSO, with no apparent malocclusion or skeletal relapse. Harada and Enomoto [113] and, later, Ferretti and Reyneke [114] compared titanium and resorbable screws and noted no difference in healing between the two groups, and no statistically significant difference in skeletal relapse. However, Harada and Enomoto's patients used IMF for a period ranging from 9 to 14 days after surgery [113]. Kallela and colleagues [115] used self-reinforced poly-L-lactic acid (SR-PLLA) screws for mandibular osteotomies and no IMF postoperatively. The mean advancement was  $4.57\mathrm{mm}$  at B point, and the mean relapse was  $17\%$ . In their 2-year follow-up study in 1999, the authors reported osteolytic changes seen around the resorbable screws in  $27\%$  of cases, and the screw canals remained as radiolucent shadows without complete bony fill [115]. Turvey and coworkers [116] reported experience with resorbable fixation for 194 osteotomies of the maxilla and/or mandible. Forty-three of the patients had SSOs with  $2\mathrm{-mm}$  resorbable screws placed on each side for fixation. They reported only 1 infection at the SSO site and 1 patient who exhibited excessive masticatory forces that resulted in the loosening of the fixation. More recently, the use of resorbable plates with monocortical screws has been advocated. A large group of 272 patients were evaluated for complications other than neurosensory changes. Titanium plates were used in 152 patients, and resorbable plates, a copolymer of L-lactic acid, and D-lactic acid were used in 120 patients. The authors conclude that complications, including relapse, which was  $18.3\%$

for resorbable plates and  $8.6\%$  for titanium plates, must be questioned owing to the large number of variables in the study. However, the apparent successful treatment of that number of patients is impressive [117].

Acceptance of the routine use of resorbable fixation with the SSO will require long-term evaluation with well-designed studies comparing these materials with the metal hardware. The major potential risk of permanent metal fixation is the possibility of bone remodeling, causing the hardware to become noticeable and possibly irritating to the patient. Although rarely reported in the literature, oral and maxillofacial surgeons have had experience with patients returning to have plates and screws removed simply because these implants have become noticeable or palpable. This problem must be weighed against the still unknown side effects of the resorbable materials. A prime example of these unknowns is the precise time required for total resorption and degradation of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly-D,L-lactic acid (PDLLA) in human tissues, which is reported to range anywhere from 90 days to 5 years. Surgeons must closely follow the literature to determine the practicality of these new materials.

An interesting suggested modification in the SSO technique is the purposeful changing of the rotational position of the proximal fragment to control the direction of mandibular growth. It has generally been recommended that the proximal segment be maintained as close as possible to its preoperative position. O'Ryan and Epker [118] have further suggested that rotating the proximal fragment in a growing patient can change the vector of condylar growth and, thereby, influence the final mandibular position. Studies have failed to support this contention [119]. There is also concern with an SSO in growing children, especially those requiring significant advancement. Huang and Ross [120] demonstrated what they believed to be a cessation of mandibular growth and condylar resorption in growing patients in whom SSO procedures were performed. Whether this was a problem with the techniques used or a problem with performing surgery in such a young group of patients is unknown, but this effect has not been noted in any further literature.

A final modification of the SSO is the concomitant use of a mid-symphyseal osteotomy to allow for correction of width discrepancies in the dental arch. For example, this could be used to narrow the mandibular arch form in lieu of a two-piece maxillary osteotomy, and this may be a more stable procedure. Although this procedure may be used with any of the ramal osteotomies, it has only been described with the SSO. First mentioned by Bell [121], it has become more practical with the use of rigid internal fixation. A single four-hole plate across the bone cut between the mandibular central inci

sors, along with an intact orthodontic arch wire, provides sufficient postoperative stability [122]. Concerns regarding adverse effects on the TMJ and periodontium have been shown to be insignificant [123].

# 62.3.4.4 Complications

# Stability

The stability of the SSO of the vertical ramus is arguably the most studied complication in orthognathic surgery. Because the relapse patterns differ between mandibular advancements and setbacks, their particular etiologies most likely differ as well; however, many of the important principles for preventing relapse in each scenario may be the same. Whereas much of the research on mandibular advancement has been done in the United States, mandibular prognathism has generally received the greatest interest in the Scandinavian countries and the Far East. This highlights one of the major problems for surgeons attempting to decide on which techniques to use to minimize undesirable postoperative skeletal change. There are large variations in research techniques as well as surgical approaches that exist not only between surgical centers in different countries but also within the same country. Fortunately, there is enough corroboration in the literature that some general statements and conclusions can be made.

One of the most important findings made regarding the stability of mandibular osteotomies was that IMF does not prevent postoperative skeletal change. Intermaxillary elastics may have a minor influence on bony remodeling at the osteotomy sites, but the rigid fixation used may be difficult to overcome with elastic traction. More likely, the elastics provide some dental changes (extrusive movements), and possibly some condylar remodeling, that may serve to correct minor postoperative malocclusions. Although the influence of postoperative elastic traction on occlusion applies to any type of maxillary or mandibular osteotomy, it was first recognized in the evaluation of mandibular SSO. It is generally believed that paramandibular connective tissue pressures and muscle vectors are the major factors influencing relapse, especially in cases of mandibular advancement [52, 53, 123]. However, early attempts at minimizing these effects, such as suprahyoid myotomies and external supportive devices, have not been shown to be effective [64]. Internal support techniques, however, have been shown to be effective. Prior to rigid fixation screws and plates, a type of internal support called skeletal fixation was shown to be effective in decreasing the downward and backward relapse pattern of mandibular advancements [64]. This fixation was used in addition to IMF and consists of wires placed from the piriform rim to circummandibular wires placed in the cuspid or molar regions (see Fig. 62.9). Interestingly, Van Sickels [124]

noted a decrease in relapse in patients with large advancements when skeletal fixation was combined with rigid internal screw fixation.

Other possible causes of relapse include patient age, preoperative mandibular plane angle, rotational position of the proximal fragment, amount of distal segment advancement, and displacement of condyle within the fossa. The effect of mandibular plane angle is controversial because of conflicting reports in the literature, most of which evaluated patients who had wire osseous fixation with IMF. Mobarak and associates [125] clearly found decreased stability in patients with steep mandibular plane angles when rigid internal fixation was used. Of the remaining variables evaluated, only the last two appear to be definitively supported by clinical studies. In their multicenter study, Schendel and Epker [64] found that displacement/dislocation of the condyle from the glenoid fossa was a significant predictor of relapse. This was further confirmed by Lake and coworkers [55], who showed a correlation between the amount of advancement and the amount of relapse.

The final area that must be considered in relapse in both mandibular advancement and setback is the rigidity of the fixation across the osteotomy site. Early investigators thought that fixation across the osteotomy site may hinder the natural repositioning of the condyle in the fossa that occurs during IMF [103]. Later studies showed that wire osteosynthesis was superior to no osseous fixation in fragment positioning, and the incidence of relapse was decreased [102]. However, the search for an improved osseous wiring technique that would decrease relapse was not successful, with most studies on osseous wiring techniques consistently reporting a mean relapse of approximately  $30\%$ . The large range of individual relapses that does exist has led many surgeons to believe multiple factors influence relapse.

The use of rigid internal fixation techniques has become the preferred method for minimizing skeletal relapse in the SSO. Schmoker and colleagues [126] discussed the advantages of lag screws in SSO. Their initial study of skeletal stability evaluated mandibular setbacks, comparing the use of three  $2.7\mathrm{-mm}$  screws versus wire fixation and one or two screws. It was not until 1985 that Van Sickels and Flanary [127] showed evidence that a similar rigid fixation technique provided increased stability in mandibular advancements. Furthermore, larger and longer studies have clearly shown the stability of using three bicortical screws for fixation of the SSO [128-131]. These studies have reported a mean relapse rate between  $0.0\%$  and  $8.0\%$ . The majority of studies comparing rigid internal fixation techniques versus the use of wire osseous fixation have also confirmed a significant difference in stability between the techniques [132-136]. Interestingly, the only

clinical study that evaluated the stability of osseous wire fixation versus rigid screw fixation on patients treated at the same center seemed to show a comparable long-term stability [137]. This study, however, reported an unusually high stability of the wire osseous fixation group and did nothing to dispute the stability of the screw fixation. Dolce and associates [136] found, in their long-term follow-up of the multicenter study in which the patients were randomly assigned between internal rigid fixation with screws and wire osseous fixation, that at 5 years, the rigidly fixed mandibles were skeletally more stable, and there was no significant difference between the two groups in anterior overbite and overjet. This particular effect is difficult to explain except for some instability in the orthodontics. The number of screws may very well influence the stability, although only Spiessl's original study [26] demonstrated a difference. Knaup and associates [131] tried to demonstrate some differences in the stability on large advancements in evaluating three versus four bicortical screws per side. They found no difference in horizontal changes but did show more stability with four screws when there was counterclockwise rotation of the distal fragment. This finding then led to an early attempt to reevaluate the possibility that anterior open bites can be successfully closed with BSSO stabilized with rigid screw fixation. Recently, the possibility of closing open bites with mandibular osteotomies in a stable fashion has been supported by other studies [138].

Finally, several biomechanical studies have shown that the placement of three bicortical positional screws to fixate an SSO is more stable in an L configuration (two near the superior border, one near the inferior border) than in a linear configuration (three placed near the superior border), although there is concern that the inferior screw may iatrogenically injure the IAN or not engage the lingual aspect of the distal segment, resulting in less stability.

Another common method for rigid internal fixation of the SSO is the use of mini-plates with monocortical screw fixation. Generally,  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  systems are used with two monocortical screws placed on either side of the osteotomy to secure one four-hole plate [139-142]. Questions remain over the minimum number of screws necessary to prevent relapse and whether more or larger screws, or plates, will improve stability in longer advancements. It has been shown that a single  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  screw does not seem to increase mandibular stability over wire osseous fixation, and therefore, it could be argued, in light of the previously reviewed research, that an increase in number or size of screws, and/or plates, may result in more osseous stability [131, 143].

With the exception of Schmoker and colleagues' original studies [126] on the stability of using rigid internal fixation in the correction of mandibular progna

thism, a majority of the clinical research on the use of these fixation techniques has focused on mandibular advancements using SSOs. Profit and associates [79] evaluated the stability of using rigid internal fixation with screws in patients with mandibular setbacks. They compared these patients with patients who were treated VRO as well as patients who had wire IMF with SSO. Interestingly, they found that the rigid internal fixation seemed to be less stable, with almost  $50\%$  of patients having more than  $4.0\mathrm{mm}$  of skeletal relapse. In one of the largest retrospective studies of mandibular setbacks, Chou found a large skeletal relapse of  $21\%$  at 1 year after surgery [144]. This relatively large amount of skeletal relapse with rigid internal fixation has been verified by a comparison of bicortical positional screws with plate and monocortical screw fixation by Chung [145], as well as an excellent systematic review by Joss and Vassalli [146]. It is clear from the literature that mandibular setback using rigid internal fixation is relatively unstable and that, unlike mandibular advancement, consideration for overcorrection is warranted.

# Nerve Damage

The possibility of damage to the IAN during SSO has been well known since the technique was first described, but surprisingly, the issue was minimized early on. Kole [147] first mentioned a high incidence of neurosensory problems immediately after surgery for patients with SSOs, but most clinicians claimed a very low incidence of long-term neurosensory problems [148]. In contrast, Walter and Gregg [45], in an objective study of sensory problems, noted a large incidence of long-term problems. Since this first definitive study, there has continued to be a variety of reported instances of both immediate postsurgical as well as chronic sensory disturbances.

Westermark and coworkers [149] evaluated 496 SSOs for possible correlations between neurosensory dysfunction and other variables, such as age of the patient, mandibular movement, type of split technique and fixation, degree of intraoperative nerve encounter, and surgeon skill. Nerve dysfunction developed in  $40\%$  of cases. Age had a significant influence on the recovery of the neurosensory function as well as the severity of neurosensory disturbance. Intraoperative nerve encounter and nerve manipulation, as well as surgical experience, were also reported to have an effect on nerve dysfunction. Other variables had no significant effects on the incidence of neurosensory dysfunction. Ylikontiola and colleagues [150] also found a statistically significant positive correlation between subjective neurosensory loss and patient age and, in addition, the magnitude of mandibular movement and degree of manipulation of the IAN intraoperatively.

Other clinical research has noted a significant relation between patient age and nerve recovery. This

finding was noted early on by MacIntosh [151], who emphasized that this osteotomy should not be used for patients older than 40 years. Another interesting correlation was made by Van Sickels and associates [152] who reported that patients with a concurrent genioplasty had a greater loss of IAN sensation initially. Unfortunately, the wide variation in neurosensory testing protocols makes comparisons of these various reports difficult and makes the evaluation of techniques that have been suggested to decrease the incidence of nerve damage difficult as well.

White and colleagues [153] indicated that damage to the IAN most likely occurs either during the medial retraction of the soft tissues for the horizontal osteotomy in the vicinity of the IAN as it enters the mandibular foramen or during the vertical bone cut anteriorly where the nerve may be close to the buccal cortex. Guernsey and DeChamplain [154] believed that IAN damage occurred during the actual splitting of the mandible and reported that segments of the neurovascular bundle may remain in the proximal fragment after the split. This has led some surgeons to recommend the use of a small flat (spatula) osteotome during the split, instead of the wide-splitting osteotome, although this remains controversial [155]. The fine osteotome is malleted carefully along the lateral cortex and cancellous bone junction but may also place the nerve at risk for iatrogenic injury because its actual position in three dimensions is unknown in each patient. It has been reported that the nerve is exposed less often during the split by this technique, and consequently, it has been assumed that this results in less sensory disturbances [156, 157]. Unfortunately, this technique has not been directly compared with any other, and the comparison of the occurrence of sensory disturbance between reports is not possible. Yoshida and coworkers [157] and, later, Yamamoto and associates [158] found that nerves that were close to the lateral cortex, as determined by radiographs, were more likely to have severe sensory alteration after surgery. The deficits were also more likely to be present 1 year after surgery when the marrow space between the mandibular canal and the external cortical bone was  $0.8\mathrm{mm}$  or less. Some authors believe that by making the vertical cut in the lateral cortex more posterior, a lower incidence of sensory problems occurs [157, 159]. This has not been substantiated in comparison studies, and in fact, the IAN may be closer to the buccal cortex in the third molar region than further anteriorly.

Another possible cause of sensory loss to the IAN may be due to sharp medullary bone irregularities of the proximal or distal fragments or to compression of the IAN when the proximal fragment is positioned and fixated, especially if there is a "lag screw" component to

the fixation [160, 161]. A round or acrylic bur can be used cautiously to remove any bone spicules as well as to widen and deepen the canal in the proximal fragment to prevent this nerve compression effect. Care must be taken when working around the nerve so that instruments used during the osteotomy do not themselves cause direct iatrogenic nerve damage. This concern has been heightened with the use of screw fixation. Paulis and Steinhauser [162] noted slightly higher incidences of long-term sensory loss in patients with rigid screw fixation compared with simple osseous fixation, but statistics were not used and the significance of their numbers is questionable. Nishioka and colleagues [163] performed a comprehensive study involving sensory loss after the use of screw fixation and found the incidence of IAN sensory loss to be high but within the range of sensory loss reported by other well-designed objective studies. Subsequently, the effect of type of fixation on neurosensory functional outcome was extensively studied by a number of authors using different methods of clinical neurosensory testing [164-167]. Brushstroke directional discrimination was diminished to a greater extent in the rigid fixation group compared with the wire fixation group from 8 weeks through 2 years postoperatively; however, monofilament contact detection discrimination did not show any significant difference between types of fixation throughout the 2-year followup [164]. Despite a high number of studies on neurosensory disturbance after orthognathic surgery, the severity of IAN injury is difficult to compare across different studies because there is a lack of standardization regarding which neurosensory tests were used, methods in which the tests were performed, and how the results were interpreted. Certain neurosensory tests are more sensitive in detecting sensory nerve deficit than others. Tests that evaluate patients' abilities to discriminate direction have been shown to be more sensitive indicators of trigeminal neurosensory impairment than other tests such as light touch detection. Westermark and coworkers [165] used a visual analog scale (VAS), light touch perception, and temperature testing and concluded that there is a positive correlation with nerve dysfunction. Alternatively, Chen and associates [166] compared three methods of assessing neurosensory disturbance after SSO: two-point discrimination, pressure-pain thresholds, and perceived sensation changes in specific facial regions. The two-point discrimination test was consistent with patients' self-ratings of neurosensory problems using facial maps, but the pressure-pain test was the least sensitive to neurosensory changes. The frequency of IAN disturbance ranged from  $10.0\%$  to  $94.0\%$  depending upon the testing method and the testing site used. In a well-controlled study by Nakagawa and colleagues [167], the occurrence of a long-lasting

postoperative trigeminal sensory hypoesthesia was found to be dependent on the nerve involvement at the bone split interface, the manner of fixation, or the intraoperative handling of the tissue surrounding the nerve. Essick demonstrated improved return of sensation and less patient concerns following the SSO with the use of biofeedback sensory retraining exercises [168]. The biofeedback sessions, which occurred 1 week and 1 and 3 months after surgery, resulted in significantly less pain, "unusual feeling," and numbness than the control group. This training seems to be the only postoperative variable, other than time from surgery, that can influence spontaneous neurosensory recovery.

Although the neurosensory function of the IAN after SSO has received a great deal of attention, few studies have documented the incidence of lingual nerve dysfunction, mostly related to bicortical screw overpenetration of the lingual cortex. Jacks and associates [169] retrospectively reviewed the patient-reported incidence, duration, and perceived deficit associated with lingual nerve function. In the SSO patients,  $19\%$  reported lingual nerve sensory changes, of whom  $69\%$  reported a resolution of symptoms within 1 year and  $88\%$  reported altered activities of daily living. When compared with the IAN, lingual nerve sensory changes occurred much less frequently and resolved more frequently and sooner, but they were associated with greater perceived deficits in patients' daily activities. Zuniga and colleagues [170] were the first to report on studies performed to assess the effect of lingual nerve injury and repair on human taste perception. Gent and coworkers [171] examined perceived taste intensity and taste quality identification on localized regions of the tongue after orthognathic surgery. Lingual nerve function in taste perception was diminished at 1-2 months after surgery, likely due to impaired chorda tympani nerve function, but it improved by 6-9 months after surgery.

# TMJ Dysfunction

The incidence of TMJ dysfunction is considered in two ways: first, the incidence of TMJ symptoms that are present after surgery compared with preoperative findings; and second, the change in mandibular range of motion. The latter may obviously not be related to TMJ dysfunction; conversely, it must be considered when evaluating the effects of the surgery on the TMJ. Unfortunately, few authors related these two areas when they reported on the effect of the SSO. Another factor that must be taken into account in evaluating the effects on the TMJ from orthognathic surgery is the possible contribution from presurgical orthodontics. There is certainly debate regarding the influence of orthodontics on TMJ dysfunction, in both the short and the long term.

Similar to neurosensory loss, the potential of the SSO to cause TMJ dysfunction was recognized early [24]. Reporting on the incidence of TMJ problems, however, has been highly variable, with most authors recording only the postoperative complaint without any reference to the preoperative condition. Some of the first reviews that did look at pre- and postoperative TMJ symptoms seemed to imply an increase in joint noise, but not in pain, after the SSO [56, 172, 173]. The use of rigid screw fixation was believed by some to cause an increase in TMJ problems by fixating the condyle into a position that may not be natural or adaptable after surgery [174]. This concern was highlighted by radiographic findings of condylar changes that occurred with rigid screw fixation. Kundert and Hadjianghelou [106] demonstrated that this tendency occurred with both wires and screws but was greater with rigid fixation than with a wire osseous fixation technique. In neither study was there a discussion of whether these changes had any clinical consequences. Hackney and associates [175] found that with bicortical screw fixation for SSO used for mandibular advancement, little change in condylar position occurred and there was no significant effect of the surgery on TMJ symptoms. Paulis and Steinhauser [162] compared preoperative and postoperative TMJ symptoms in two large groups who had either rigid screw fixation or wire osseous fixation of SSO. They found no difference in postoperative incidence of temporomandibular joint (TMD) between the two groups and, in fact, found a notable decrease in TMJ pain in both groups. The possibility that the SSO may benefit patients with TMJ symptoms was suggested by Martis [176] and Karabouta and Martis [177]. They reported that only  $11\%$  of the patients who had TMJ symptoms before surgery had any symptoms after surgery, whereas about  $4\%$  of the asymptomatic patients had TMJ problems after surgery. These results were better than, but consistent with, a study of all types of orthognathic surgery patients, which showed an improvement in a large percentage of patients, with relatively small risk for the asymptomatic patient [178].

There is, surprisingly, a body of evidence in the literature that suggests that the SSO may have a beneficial effect on preexisting TMJ dysfunction. It is generally believed that TMJ dysfunction (internal derangement, anterior disk displacement) is found at a higher incidence in class II patients compared with patients with classes I and III malocclusions. The use of the SSO as an alternative to the mandibular condylotomy to treat patients with painful TMJ dysfunction has been proposed by some authors [179]. They suggest repositioning the proximal segment and increasing the joint space, both of which are thought to have an unloading effect

on the highly innervated neurovascular retrodiskal tissues. However, this is controversial and there has not been adequate research to confirm this impression. Other studies have indicated the trend that class II patients who undergo SSO advancement may have improvement in TMJ symptoms, whereas class III patients who undergo SSO mandibular setback are less likely to improve or more likely to develop worsening TMJ symptomatology. Each patient must be treated individually based upon their age, dentoskeletal deformity, and preexisting TMJ symptoms.

Debate on rigid versus wire fixation relative to the effect on the TMJ has led to a number of studies that have shown no significant difference in the incidence of TMJ symptoms between patients who received rigid fixation versus wire osteosynthesis during SSO [180]. Feinerman and Piecuch [181] compared the TMJ outcomes of the mini-plate with monocortical screw group versus the superior border wire fixation with IMF group. They found no demonstrable long-term differences between the two groups with respect to mandibular vertical opening, crepitus, and TMJ pain. In fact, masticatory muscle pain and TMJ clicking improved with rigid fixation and worsened with nonrigid wire fixation. One of the reported findings of a large prospective study comparing rigid screw fixation with wire IMF was that, although large mandibular advancements along with counterclockwise rotation of the distal segment resulted in more muscle as well as TMJ symptoms soon after surgery, at 2 years, there was significant decrease in both myofascial and TMJ symptoms.

The only negative report on the effects of SSO on the TMJ was by Wolford and colleagues [182], who evaluated changes in TMJ dysfunction in patients with presurgical TMJ internal derangement as well as the long-term stability of orthognathic surgery. Unlike other clinicians, they noted the development of new TMJ symptoms, or an aggravation of existing TMJ symptoms, in a group of patients at 14 months postsurgery. Therefore, the authors recommended that surgical correction of preexisting TMJ pathology with formal TMJ surgery be considered, either preceding or concurrently with the orthognathic procedure. In summary, it appears that there is a low risk of worsening TMJ symptoms in patients who have preexisting TMJ dysfunction with the SSO procedure. In addition, conversely, the SSO may result in improved TMJ symptoms in a greater number of symptomatic patients owing to changes in the orientation of the TMJ apparatus and subsequent TMJ adaptation. Unfortunately, standardized methods of predicting TMJ outcomes in individual patients after SSOs have not been developed.

Mechanical displacement of the condyle out of its correct position has been implicated as a significant fac

tor in postsurgical skeletal relapse after SSO. For this reason, as well as in an attempt to minimize TMJ problems, a great deal of interest has been focused by early investigators on the issues of condylar position after SSO [183]. There has been a myriad of technical notes on how to maintain the preoperative condylar position and use of different condylar repositioning devices, based on anecdotal reports of individual surgeon experiences. Harris and coworkers [184] examined factors influencing condylar position after SSO fixated with rigid fixation. The amount of advancement did not correlate with condylar displacement. Condyle angulation and superoinferior movement did correlate somewhat with the amount of advancement. In addition, Van Sickels and associates [185] found that the condylar position was slightly different with rigid fixation versus wire osteosynthesis beyond 8 weeks postoperatively, but the ultimate position of the condyle was not significantly different. They found, as have many others, that the final condylar position was posterior and superior to its preoperative location after mandibular advancement. Renzi and colleagues [186] specifically examined class III patients without preoperative TMJ dysfunction; half of the patient population was treated with a condylar positioning device and the other half was treated with manual intraoperative control of condylar position. The condylar repositioning device did not prevent the changes in condyle positions in all cases. Neither group had any skeletal or occlusal relapse or postsurgical TMJ dysfunction. The value of using condylar positioning devices was reviewed by Costa [187], who concluded that there was no scientific evidence until 2008 to support the routine use of these devices. However, some surgeons continue to use some form of positioning devices and attempt to demonstrate benefit in the extra time required for these methods. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used by Saka for evaluation of not only condylar position but also position of the disk in this prospective study comparing a condylar repositioning device versus regular manual positioning [188]. Postoperatively, they found a significant difference between these two groups, with anterior disk displacement significantly more common without the repositioning device. The condylar position after surgery, however, was found to be similar. Unfortunately, there was no mention of postoperative TMJ symptoms, although there was an assumption that problems would occur in those patients with a displaced disk. However, it is important to understand that the incidence of new-onset TMJ dysfunction in healthy individuals after orthognathic surgery is known to be low as previously mentioned. The assumption of many surgeons that changes found with TMJ imaging have clinical consequences may be unfounded, and this study included only

patients without preoperative TMJ symptoms. Therefore, it is not surprising that the patients did not develop any postsurgical TMJ dysfunction. Also, the clinical implication of condylar and disk position in the healthy versus preexisting TMJ dysfunction groups may be different; therefore, the true clinical significance of condylar and disk position in exacerbation of TMJ symptoms remains unknown.

Computed tomography (CT) has enabled clinicians to assess and quantify condylar position changes in three planes of space. Alder and colleagues [189] reported that changes in condylar position occurred in all planes of space, but the most common postoperative condylar position was more lateral with increased condylar angle, a higher coronoid process, and a condyle located more superior and posterior in the fossa. Rebellato and coworkers [190] found an increased superior postsurgical movement of the condyle with increasing magnitudes of surgical advancement of the mandible.

MRI has revolutionized the examination of the TMJ, in that it not only allows the evaluation of condylar position but also provides information on disk position and morphology. Gaggl and associates [191] reported clinical and MRI findings of the TMJ in class II patients, preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Clinically, patients had improvements in joint pain and abnormal joint sounds such as clicking. The MRI showed displacement of the disk in 38 of the 50 joints preoperatively and in 28 postoperatively. No correlation was made between the change in disk position and improvement in TMJ symptoms, which is consistent with other MRI studies. Ueki and colleagues [192] made interesting comparisons of the condylar and disk positions after SSO and IVRO and correlated these findings with TMJ symptoms postoperatively. Fewer or no TMJ symptoms were reported by  $88\%$  of patients who underwent IVRO and by  $66\%$  of patients who underwent SSO. MRI studies showed no change in anterior disk displacement after BSSO; however, improvement was seen in  $44\%$  of patients who underwent IVRO, at least in the early postsurgical period.

The effect of SSO on the mandibular range of motion has been studied extensively. Whereas Stacy [193] found that patients who underwent mandibular setbacks with IMF generally returned to presurgical function within 9 months after surgery without any physical therapy, other authors have found very different results. Storum and Bell [194] found that without active physical therapy after the release of IMF, there was a decrease in the patient's ability to achieve preoperative opening when compared with patients who had an active rehabilitation program. This latter study is consistent with most clinicians' experience, and some

form of active physical therapy is recommended after release from IMF. However, there is some research and intuitive evidence that rigid internal fixation that permits mandibular movement soon after surgery may result in a more rapid return to preoperative mandibular movement without active physiotherapy [195]. However, the literature remains inconclusive [195, 196]. Nishimura and coworkers [196] found that final postoperative mouth opening was not significantly influenced by the type of fixation. Hatch [197] also found in a large prospective study of wire versus rigid internal fixation that at 5 years, that there was no significant difference between the two groups. Interestingly, they also noted that neither group returned to completely normal preoperative mouth opening levels.

Another poorly understood TMJ complication is idiopathic condylar resorption, or spontaneous resorption of the condyles, after SSO [198]. This process is different from standard orthognathic relapse with the abnormal resorption being seen primarily in a specific group of patients; specifically young female patients who have had a history of TMJ dysfunction before surgery, with a steep mandibular plane angle, and who have undergone a large mandibular advancement. Some remodeling of the condyles is expected to occur after SSO, but fortunately, only rarely does this condylar resorption result in significant clinical changes with pain and apertognathia. Cutbirth and colleagues [199] evaluated long-term condylar resorption after mandibular advancement stabilized with bicortical screws. Large advancements and preoperative TMJ symptoms significantly correlated with long-term postoperative condylar resorption at the mean follow-up of 3 years. The amount of vertical resorption did not directly correlate with the amount of relapse seen between 6 and 8 weeks or in the long term. Surprisingly, there was an improvement in TMJ symptoms for the group as a whole and even among the group who developed condylar resorption. It should be noted, however, that it is often difficult to distinguish between normal condylar remodeling and significant condylar resorption. In the Cutbirth and colleagues study [190], the authors arbitrarily established a parameter of less than  $10\%$  loss of condylar height to be considered as "normal remodeling." Attempts to delineate the normal versus pathologic processes are difficult and may lead to an underestimation of the actual number of clinically significant condylar resorption cases that may occur.

Hoppenreijs and coworkers [200] evaluated the long-term treatment results of 26 patients (23 women and 3 men) who developed progressive condylar resorption after orthognathic surgery. The preoperative condylar configuration was noted in patients with deep bites to have more resorption on the superior aspect of the con

dyle, whereas patients with anterior open bites had resorption on the superior and anterior surfaces of the condyle. Thirteen patients were managed without surgery after the diagnosis of condylar resorption, and only 3 patients had class I occlusion at the end of treatment. Thirteen patients underwent a second surgical correction, with seven patients having satisfactory occlusal results. Four of the patients had relapse with a stable occlusion not requiring further treatment, and two patients had complete relapse requiring a third surgical procedure. It was suggested that without surgical intervention after condylar resorption, further resorption ceased after approximately 2 years. The authors speculated that either the mechanical loading during or after SSO and/or the impediment of blood flow to the condylar segment and the TMJ capsule may play a role in condylar resorption. However, the etiology of this process is still unclear, but it does seem to be self-limiting and the resulting dental skeletal deformity can usually be successfully treated with further mandibular surgery.

Various studies utilizing cone-beam CT scans, including one by Chen in 2015 [240], evaluated remodeling of the condyles before and after mandibular advancement. Their study found that resorption typically occurred in the posterior aspects of the condyles; however, there was some apposition in the anterior surfaces of the condyles as well. A most recent study by O'Sullivan et al. 2018 [241] utilized three-dimensional condylar mapping. Thirty-one subjects treated by the co-author (SMS) with skeletal Class II and Class III malocclusions underwent condylar mapping postsurgically, both short term and long term. They concluded that there were no statistical differences between right and left TMJ structures in the fossa and condyles relative to remodeling; however, remodeling did occur primarily on the posterior, superior, and lateral regions, which is similar to previous studies. Resorption of the condylar head occurred on the posterior-superior regions while apposition occurred in areas of the posterior, superior, and lateral regions. They also found that resorption in the glenoid fossa was primarily posteriorly with significant differences seen over time. When apposition occurred in the fossa, that apposition tended to take place over the long term. All resorption and apposition were clinically insignificant suggesting that the condyle is a "plastic" structure. It is interesting to note that there was no resorption on the medial pole even though the use of position screws for fixation and a positioning clamp was used in all 31 cases, and is often cited as an etiology for medial resorption due to compression. This study appears to refute the notion that the combination of positioning clamps and screw fixation when used in combination may pose a higher risk of condylar morphological changes due to untoward compression leading to relapse or progressive condylar resorption.

# 62.3.4.5 Condylar Malposition

Condylar malposition is a complication when performing the sagittal split osteotomy that can result in an immediate or delayed malocclusion. It is also one that is relatively easy to detect intraoperatively. Reyneke and Ferretti [239], described a very straightforward method to identify three forms of condylar malpositioning after sagittal split osteotomy. The first and most common form is what is described as central sag which is an inadequate anterior superior seating of the condyle thus creating excessive superior joint space which, upon release of maxillomandibular fixation following the application of rigid fixation, results in a Class II malocclusion and open bite. A complication such as this simply requires removal of the sagittal split fixation, reseating the condyles, reapplication of rigid fixation, and verification of the bite correction.

The other two forms of condylar malposition were referred to as peripheral condylar sag. Type 1 occurs when the condyle is positioned inferiorly in the fossa with inappropriate contact within the fossa, either lateral, medial, posteriorly, or anteriorly. The contact in the fossa will maintain the occlusion until such time as resorption and remodeling occur, and then there is often delayed occlusal relapse.

Peripheral condylar sag Type 2 occurs when the position of the condyle is vertically correct in the fossa; however, incorrect placement of rigid fixation causes torquing of the condyle typically laterally or medially. Once the maxillomandibular fixation is removed, the tension is released and the condyle moves either laterally or medially and slides inferiorly, creating an open bite posteriorly often with changes in the sagittal position, trending toward Class III.

All condylar sag scenarios should be addressed intra-operatively to ensure passive seating of the condyle to avoid three-dimensional remodeling that can result in relapse or more serious resorptive problems.

# Miscellaneous Complications

A wide variety of other complications have been reported after SSO. Early reviews of complications from this procedure noted excessive blood loss, postoperative airway compromise, aseptic necrosis of bone segments, and facial nerve damage. Better experience and improved instrumentation seem to have dramatically decreased the incidence of these problems. Bleeding is generally easily managed by direct or indirect pressure over the bleeding soft tissue and vessels. Lanigan and associates [201], reporting on a questionnaire sent to a large number of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, found only 21 cases of significant bleeding after mandibular osteotomies. Suspected sources of bleeding included the inferior alveolar artery, facial artery, maxillary artery, and retromandibular vein. Management primarily included

direct pressure packing or ligation of the vessel at the point of severance through the open wound. Extraoral approaches to gain access to the facial or external carotid artery can be ineffective owing to the collateral circulation. Angiography with embolization is considered appropriate in cases of acute persistent postoperative arterial bleeding of more than  $0.5\mathrm{mL / min}$ .

A group of problems that seems to persist is the inadvertent fracture in the anterior buccal aspect of the proximal segment or the posterior lingual aspect of the distal segment. Good surgical technique with extension of the osteotomies into the marrow space minimizes these problems, and care used during the split is worth the effort because correcting a "bad" split can be difficult. Fortunately, the use of screws and plates does improve the chance of obtaining a satisfactory result, in light of an unexpected fracture, with minimum further morbidity to the patient [202]. It has been believed that one of the major risk factors predisposing to buccal cortex fracture is the presence of impacted third molars. Precious and colleagues [203] retrospectively reviewed two groups of patients: one group with retained impacted third molars removed during BSSO and the other group with third molars having been removed at least 6 months before BSSO. There was a  $1.9\%$  incidence of unfavorable fractures, and the majority of fractures occurred with the group who had the third molars removed at least 6 months before the BSSO. Mehra and coworkers [204] reported  $2.2\%$  unfavorable fractures in 500 procedures. They noted a larger percentage of unfavorable fractures in the patients with retained third molars  $(3.2\%$  vs.  $1.2\%)$ . This finding is consistent with that of Reyneke and associates [205] who found that the presence of unerupted third molars increased the degree of difficulty of SSO, and in all 4 out of 139 patients, unfavorable fractures occurred in patients with unerupted third molars present at the time of surgery. Ideally, third molars should be extracted at least 9–12 months or more before the SSO, both to minimize unfavorable fractures and to allow optimal bony healing, especially when planning on the use of internal rigid fixation.

Airway patency and induction of iatrogenic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have become an area of concern to some clinicians, especially in the cases in which the mandible is retropositioned. Riley and colleagues [206] reported two patients who were surgically treated for prognathism and later developed OSA. Kawamata and coworkers [207] studied patients with mandibular prognathism who were treated with either SSO or VRO for mandibular setback. Using three-dimensional CT imaging, they quantified the posterior airway space after surgery and found that the lateral and frontal widths of the pharyngeal airway had decreased by  $23\%$  and  $11\%$ ,

respectively, and this reduction in airway dimension did not resolve at 1 year after surgery. However, in the longer postoperative period, a visible recovery of pharyngeal width was seen in some cases. The finding of decreased airway dimension secondary to mandibular setback has been confirmed by other studies. Therefore, one should be cognizant of any physiologic and medical etiologic factors, including preexisting OSA, that may have contributed to the emergence of OSA symptoms, rather than simply using the measurement of the posterior airway space after mandibular osteotomy as the sole means of predicting the development of new-onset OSA.

In general, the risk of infection seems to be low with the SSO owing to the vascularity in the head and neck region. In their clinical review of 700 consecutive cases of mandibular osteotomies, Bouwman and associates [208] reported that screw removal owing to infection was performed in  $2.8\%$  of cases. Screw loosening occurred in the first postoperative week, which resulted in an occlusal discrepancy in 4 patients. Fifteen sides required one or more screws to be removed as a result of infection. In a large study of complications in orthognathic surgery, Acebal-Bianco and colleagues [209] reported 36 infections out of 802 mandibular osteotomies  $(0.05\%)$ , but only 5 patients had hardware removed owing to infections.

# 62.3.5 Horizontal Ramus Osteotomies

Since Blair's first description of his osteotomy of the horizontal ramus [3], a variety of osteotomy designs have been documented. Initially, the surgeons used extraoral, or a combination of extraoral and intraoral techniques, but since the early 1950s, the advocated approaches have primarily been intraoral. It is difficult to choose a representative technique for the body osteotomies because of the wide variations described as well as the relative infrequency of these techniques. Of the described procedures, the step osteotomy is reviewed because of its versatility and its apparent common use in some centers.

# 62.3.5.1 Indications

The greatest limitations of body osteotomies are that the osteotomy must be made through the dental alveolus so edentulous spaces are usually required and the IAN is at risk for injury during these procedures. Because these osteotomies are made anterior to the pterygomasseteric sling, some surgeons believe that the results are more stable and, therefore, prefer body osteotomies in the treatment of prognathism when there are edentulous spaces. Other unusual mandibular abnormalities, such

Fig.62.19 a, b The step osteotomy

![](images/6407fa13481ade54cb0364024bbcaba5f6854829b1ac239fd6509b15f2abef07.jpg)

as asymmetries, may also be treated more appropriately with one of these forms of osteotomy as opposed to an osteotomy of the vertical ramus.

With the step osteotomy, the surgeon must be concerned about the horizontal component of the "step," which often has to be performed between the IAN and the apices of the tooth roots. Sufficient room should, therefore, be available for this cut, unless the surgeon plans to externalize part of the IAN so that the cut can be made at the level of or below the inferior alveolar canal.

# 62.3.5.2 Technique

An incision is made  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  below the level of the attached gingiva (enough tissue is left superiorly to permit later suturing) and is carried forward at this level to the cuspid, where it can be dropped down  $5\mathrm{mm}$  and extended forward to the midline (Fig. 62.19a). The periosteum is elevated inferiorly until the mental foramen is located and then the remainder of the periosteum is stripped to expose the area of the osteotomy. The attached gingiva is also carefully elevated in the area of the dental alveolar cut so that it can be protected during the osteotomy.

The vertical cut through the alveolus is made with either a saw or a bur. A finger should be kept on the lingual aspect of the mandible to prevent the power instrument from penetrating the mucosa. Because the lingual mucosa is very thin, some surgeons may find it helpful to place a fine ribbon retractor between the bone and the mucosa. This is done by making a horizontal incision a few millimeters lingual to the teeth and the edentulous area and then carefully elevating the mucosa down below the floor of the mouth. The retractor is then placed and supported with the surgeon's finger to ensure it is not displaced while making the cuts. When the sur

gical plan includes a mandibular setback, a block of bone must be removed to permit posterior positioning of the mandible. The distance between the parallel cuts necessary to remove the bone should be as close as possible to the planned setback, as determined by the model surgery. The vertical cuts are carried inferiorly to the level of the planned horizontal cut, which would be at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  below the dental apices. The inferior vertical cuts are then made, again using parallel cuts as necessary for a setback of the distal fragment. Finally, the horizontal cut is made, preferably by a saw, to minimize bone removal and endangering of the apices or the IAN (see Fig. 62.19b).

The distal segment is related to the proximal segment with an occlusal splint and fixed with IMF. If the mandible is set back any significant distance, a wedge of attached tissue over the alveolar vertical osteotomy must be removed to permit the setback. This wedge should be narrower than the planned movement to allow tight mucosal contact. This eliminates the need for suturing in this area, which is often difficult. Osseous wire fixation can be placed at the inferior border, or if a rigid fixation technique is preferable, straight four-holed plates with monocortical screws can be placed above and below the nerve. With a rigid fixation technique, the IMF wires can be cut and the segment stability and position checked before closure of the wound. The surgical sites are thoroughly irrigated and the mucosa is then closed with a resorbable suture. IMF, if used, is maintained for 6-8 weeks (Fig. 62.20).

# 62.3.5.3 Alternative Techniques

There are multiple variations of mandibular body osteotomies. Generally, the mucosal approaches are similar, although some surgeons prefer to make a cervical incision posterior to the mental foramen and then carry it

below the attached tissue in the anterior symphyseal region. This approach, unfortunately, presents some difficulty with wound closure, especially if IMF is used.

One of the most difficult variations in the surgical approach occurs when there is a need for visualization or exteriorization of the IAN, if an osteotomy is planned through the inferior alveolar canal. The easiest method for this is similar to that described by Epker [210].

After the lateral surface of the mandible is exposed in the area of the planned osteotomies, parallel horizontal cortical cuts are made on either side of the anticipated route of the IAN. These cuts are extended beyond

either side of the planned osteotomy, sufficient to permit adequate approach to the nerve as well as to permit enough freedom of the nerve during stretching or compression that will occur with the planned segment movements. Perpendicular cuts are made just through the cortex at approximately 1-cm intervals (Fig. 62.21). Starting with the forward cuts, a thin sharp 4-mm osteotome is used to carefully start a cleavage line through the cancellous bone, preferably just below the cortex. As each individual section is broken away, the medial aspect of the fragment must be checked to ensure that a nerve is not still attached to it. After all the small lateral corti

Fig. 62.21 Decortication for exposure of the inferior alveolar nerve and vessels

cal segments have been removed, often the nerve has been exposed and judicious use of a small surgical curette is all that is needed to remove any bone spicules over the nerve as well as to carefully lift the nerve out of its canal. If a cancellous bone is still covering the nerve, a medium-sized round bur can be used to carefully remove the overlying bone. A small periosteal elevator or a surgical curette can be positioned in the lateral aspect of the canal when the nerve is exposed and the thin bur used to remove the remaining overlying bone. Following the visualization or exteriorization of the IAN, the osteotomies can proceed as planned.

Although primarily used for distal fragment setback, the step osteotomy can be used for advancement. To accomplish this, a horizontal incision must be made on the lingual side of the alveolus, posterior to the vertical alveolar bone cut. The mucoperiosteum below this cut can then be elevated to allow it to be stretched with the advancement. The lateral incision is designed to permit the labial tissue to be pulled lingually, without tension, so that soft tissue closure can be done. Bone grafts are generally used in the gaps created by the advancements, especially in the alveolar area, where prostheses may later be placed.

Sagittal osteotomies of the horizontal ramus have been described with either an extraoral or an intraoral approach possible [211, 212]. With the intraoral approach, the lingual exposure has to be increased to make the vertical cortical cut. This generally requires that the incision on the lingual side of the teeth be brought forward, close to the midline, so that retraction may occur without endangering the surrounding soft tissue. The advantage of this type of osteotomy is that it allows the use of rigid internal fixation with bicortical screws, and generally, a bone graft is not needed if the distal segment is advanced.

# 62.3.5.4 Complications

Reports of body osteotomies in the literature include mostly case reports; therefore, there are few series reporting incidence of complications. The wide variety of techniques makes it impossible to make any definitive statements about body osteotomies. Therefore, this section is primarily limited to the listing of the reported complications, many of which can be anticipated simply from the knowledge of the anatomy of the area.

# Relapse

One of the primary reasons given by surgeons for using a body osteotomy procedure is the stability of the technique. Sandor and coworkers [213] assessed relapse of the step osteotomy and found it to be very stable. Most other authors have not strictly analyzed the results but claim a good long-term stability with their particular technique [214, 215].

# Neural Complications

Those studies that include reports of the incidence or duration of neurosensory damage report a high spontaneous recovery rate [214, 215]. Unfortunately, these studies are of questionable value because of the inadequate testing methods used. It can be expected, however, that immediate postoperative sensory loss will be present after any of the body osteotomies, especially those that require visualization or exteriorization of the IAN. The incidence of devitalization of teeth on either side of the osteotomy or of those teeth above the horizontal cut of the step osteotomy is unknown, although it is probably similar to those reported with mandibular subapical osteotomies.

The increased potential of nonunion in body osteotomies has been discussed, but the incidence is unknown. The possibility of this occurring is very low if, as has been suggested, care is used in osteotomy design to ensure sufficient bone contact as well as in the provision of adequate fixation.

The possibility of periodontal defects does exist for osteotomies made close to the teeth where the surrounding soft tissue pedicle may be injured. As has been noted earlier, the possibility of this occurring in midline osteotomies is low, but whether this can be related to other parts of the dental alveolus is doubtful [216].

# 62.3.6 Subapical Osteotomies

There are essentially three types of mandibular subapical osteotomies: the anterior subapical, the posterior subapical, and the total alveolar osteotomy. Whereas these techniques have fallen out of favor as primary treatment options, each has a small place in orthognathic surgery;

therefore, the indications and techniques of each are described individually, and because the complications are similar, these are discussed together as well.

# 62.3.6.1 Anterior Subapical Osteotomy Indications

The subapical osteotomy has historically been popular because of its versatility to move the anterior mandibular teeth and alveolus in almost every possible direction, although it is not commonly performed today. The greatest concern in this procedure is the potential for damaging teeth, and therefore, space must be present or created to permit safe vertical cuts in the dental alveolus.

# Procedure

If necessary, teeth are removed to permit osteotomies or to provide space for the planned alveolar movement. The incision begins about  $1\mathrm{cm}$  behind the planned vertical osteotomy and is carried forward about  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  below the attached tissue until reaching the cuspid, at which time, it can be positioned inferiorly and carried to the midline to connect with a contralateral incision. The periosteum is elevated, exposing the lateral cortex of the mandible, with care around the mental foramen as well as attention paid to leaving soft tissue attachments at the inferior border to ensure stability of the soft tissue-chin morphology. The attached tissue at the planned vertical osteotomy site must be elevated, and if posterior movement of the segment is anticipated, some of this tissue may have to be removed. As mentioned with the step osteotomy, the width of the tissue removed should be less than the planned posterior movement to ensure adequate soft tissue contact and coverage.

The vertical osteotomies are made using parallel cuts when the posterior movement of the segment is planned. Adequate preoperative radiologic evaluation and planning will minimize the chance of damage to the IAN. Most anterior subapical osteotomies are designed to include the cuspid and the incisors, which generally place the vertical cuts anterior to the mental foramen. Difficulties arise if the planned osteotomy includes extraction of the first bicuspid or if the cut is planned behind this area. The importance of being able to make the horizontal cut at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  below the tooth apices cannot be overemphasized. Not only is the vitality of the teeth potentially compromised, but the entire dentosseous segment may be affected by the level of the horizontal cut. If parallel horizontal cuts are planned to move the anterior segment apically, the superior cut is made first. The inferior cut is then made, and the segment of bone is removed without over manipulation of the dental alveolar segment that might increase the likelihood of injuring the soft tissue pedicle (Fig. 62.22a). Beveling the cut from anterior to posteroinferior will

minimize the amount of bone to be removed and increase the size of the lingual soft tissue pedicle. Usually, when attempting to reposition the mobile dentoalveolar segment to the rest of the mandible, further bony interferences are encountered. These exist primarily on the lingual cortex of the vertical cuts, and care must be used in the rotation of the mobile segment to access this cortex. As mentioned earlier for the step osteotomy, when possible, a retractor should be placed between the bone and the thin lingual mucosa to minimize iatrogenic soft tissue trauma.

After ensuring an adequate seating of the teeth into the surgical splint, the segment is stabilized by either wiring the splint to the teeth individually (see Fig. 62.22b) or placing circumferential mandibular wires that can be combined with IMF. Osseous wires or plates with monocortical screws are rarely needed for stability, but can be used if desired. Plates and monocortical screws can be used with the splint but, generally, do not provide sufficient stability by themselves. Bone gaps caused by movement of the segment, especially by vertical movement necessary for the closure of an anterior open bite, should be grafted. The use of cortical bone from the symphysis, as advocated by Kole [28], has been popular because many patients with an anterior open bite have the long anterior face, which can be improved by removal of a segment of the genial bone (see Fig. 62.22c). The surgical site is then irrigated thoroughly and closed with resorbable sutures.

# 62.3.6.2 Posterior Subapical Osteotomy Indications

The posterior subapical osteotomy has few indications, especially if orthodontics is an option. Primarily, it can be used as an aid in the correction of supereruption of posterior mandibular teeth or ankylosis of one or more posterior teeth. Abnormal buccal or lingual positioning of these teeth can also be improved upon with this technique, when orthodontics is not available or feasible [217].

# Technique

The technique of Peterson, who first described this osteotomy [208], can be done with local anesthesia and sedation or with general anesthesia. An incision begins  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the attached gingiva, beginning at the anterior border of the vertical ramus. This incision is made down to the bone and carried forward to the cuspid region. The periosteum is stripped superiorly and inferiorly sufficiently to expose the lateral cortex for the planned osteotomies (Fig. 62.23). The osteotomy is outlined with a bur, based on the preoperative radiographic analysis of the length of the roots and the position of the inferior alveolar canal. The vertical cuts are made first through both cortices with a fine osteo

tome or thin saws. The horizontal cut is carried only through the buccal cortex, and a thick splitting osteotomy is used to complete the osteotomy. Care is taken to ensure that the IAN is not caught in the mobile segment and that appropriate bony adjustments are made to permit the planned movement. The segment is positioned and stabilized with an acrylic splint and wire. Grafting is used if a bone gap is significant, and the mucosa is closed with a running resorbable suture.

# Alternative Techniques

Major modification of this technique would be appropriate if insufficient distance exists between the dental apices and the inferior alveolar canal. In such a situation, the IAN may be externalized, as described previously, and a horizontal cut made through the inferior alveolar canal. Periapical radiographs taken intraoperatively after the buccal horizontal cut will ensure that the

osteotomies are made at a safe distance from the teeth and canal. This latter technique has been found to be useful because adequate visualization is difficult with the presence of posterior teeth. Also, with either of these techniques, the horizontal cut can be made safely through the lingual cortex, which eliminates the lack of predictability of the induced lingual cortical fracture.

# 62.3.7 Total Mandibular Subapical Alveolar Osteotomy

# 62.3.7.1 Indications

The total mandibular subapical alveolar osteotomy, first described by MacIntosh and Carlotti [218], has limited application today, but can prove valuable in isolated mandibular dentoalveolar protrusion or retrusion. It has also been advocated for closure of an anterior open bite when used with a bone graft.

# 62.3.7.2 Technique

An incision begins on the external oblique ridge of the base of the vertical ramus. The incision is carried down to the bone and extends forward  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  below the attached gingiva. The incision can be positioned inferiorly in the region of the canine and forward where it meets the contralateral incision at the midline. The periosteum is elevated to expose the lateral cortex, with care taken around the mental nerve, as well as leaving some attachment at the inferior border of the symphysis for the soft tissue chin. The vertical cut posterior to the terminal molar is made first and carried down to the level of the planned horizontal osteotomy. As with the step osteotomies, the horizontal cut needs to be placed appropriately, based upon preoperative periapical radiographs. If this cut cannot be made safely between the

dental apices and the inferior alveolar canal, the IAN needs to be exteriorized or the cut placed below the canal (Fig. 62.24a). The horizontal cut can then be placed low enough to be at a safe distance from the dental root apices, as well as maintaining an adequate vascular pedicle to the dental alveolus. The angle of the horizontal cut should be made to facilitate segment movement; for instance, a flat cut paralleling the maxillary occlusal plane permits the straight advancement of the segment without significantly changing mandibular vertical height while at the same time maintaining a large area of bone contact.

The mobile segment is related to the maxilla with an acrylic interocclusal splint and IMF. Osseous fixation can be achieved either with the lateral cortical wires placed in the first bicuspid area along with maintaining IMF or by rigid internal fixation with monocortical plates and screws. As with correction of an anterior open bite, any significant bone gaps created may be filled with graft material. The wound is thoroughly irrigated and closed with resorbable suture.

# 62.3.7.3 Technique Variations

Booth and associates [219] suggested a variation of the total mandibular subapical osteotomy that combines the SSO of the vertical ramus with the total mandibular alveolar osteotomy (see Fig. 62.24b). This modification has a number of advantages over the original technique. First, the osteotomy is made below the inferior alveolar canal, thereby decreasing the risk of damaging the IAN and tooth roots, at the same time preserving the vascular supply to the mobilized segment. Also, the sagittal part of the osteotomy allows a larger bone contact area to assist in bony healing.

The total mandibular alveolar osteotomy can also be divided into interdental segments to correct axial

inclination of teeth or close edentulous sites. These modifications are not easily performed with Booth's osteotomy, but can be valuable as a variation of the original procedure.

# 62.3.7.4 Complications

The complications of all mandibular subapical alveolar osteotomies are considered together owing to their similarities. Stability is often mentioned as one of the advantages of the alveolar osteotomies because of the minimal soft tissue forces acting on these areas. Unfortunately, there have been very few studies to document this claim, and the technique has limited use. Available studies question the stability of these segmental osteotomies. Theisen and Guernsey [220] evaluated six patients who had anterior subapical osteotomies. At 1 year after surgery, an average of  $1.0\mathrm{mm}$  of movement of the incisors was noted on lateral cephalograms. In contrast, Kloosterman [48] evaluated a much larger group and found a  $30\%$  recurrence of an open bite after anterior maxillary osteotomies. Pangrazio-Kulbersh and MacIntosh [221] compared the hard and soft tissue changes in a retrospective study comparing total subapical osteotomies with BSSOs for treatment of mandibular retrognathia. They found no significant difference in skeletal changes at 1 year. Interestingly, the major difference between the two groups was at soft tissue "B" point, with the subapical osteotomy resulting in a significant decrease in the labiodental angle.

Unlike segment stability, neurologic and vascular complications of segmental osteotomies have received a great deal of attention. Much of the research has focused on pulpal changes and not on peripheral IAN sensory loss or avascular necrosis with bone loss. Both of these latter problems are recognized complications of mandibular subapical osteotomies, but there are no clinical studies noting their exact incidence [28, 36]. Many authors report some incidence of sensory change of the lower lip and chin but claim that there have been no permanent problems with the return of normal sensation in about 3 months [218, 229, 221].

Clinical and animal studies on the effect of mandibular osteotomies on pulpal blood flow are numerous [35, 37, 39, 40]. An early animal study did not note many vascular changes when a lingual vascular pedicle was maintained [33]. However, all subsequent studies have noted a significant decrease in blood flow, especially to the dental pulp [222]. Histologic studies of dental pulp after subapical osteotomies reveal some pulpal necrosis in most teeth [35, 223]. Whether this is of clinical importance is questionable, because there were relatively few teeth in clinical series that required endodontics or extraction [47, 48]. It is likely that some pulpal necrosis occurs in greater numbers of teeth than are clinically

evident [224]. The only way that pulpal changes have been assessed clinically is with "vitality testing" and laser Doppler flow studies. A change in pulpal nerve sensation does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in pulpal vascularity. However, the rate of recovery of sensory loss seems to give some measure of the iatrogenic trauma to the teeth. Early clinical studies seem to show that teeth in mandibular alveolar osteotomies fare better than their maxillary counterparts [225]. More recent and larger studies, however, have demonstrated the reverse [47, 48]. One report found that approximately  $40\%$  of the teeth in the repositioned mandibular segment remain unreactive to vitality testing at 1 year [47]. This high incidence of pulpal trauma was attributed to technical errors during surgeries. The incidence of teeth requiring endodontics ranges from  $1.5\%$  to  $10\%$ . The teeth at greatest risk for damage are those in the mobile segment directly adjacent to the vertical osteotomies. The teeth immediately posterior to the vertical cut are approximately equal in risk to the teeth in the center of the mobile segment.

Periodontal problems have been mentioned by authors reviewing mandibular alveolar osteotomies [48, 220]. The incidence and quantitative evaluations of soft and hard tissue loss have not been done, although individual cases of significant interdental bone loss have been noted. Periodontal problems are seen less frequently when the vertical cuts are made in extraction sites than when the cuts are attempted between teeth without extraction [48].

# 62.3.8 Horizontal Osteotomy of the Symphysis (Genioplasty)

The horizontal osteotomy of the symphysis, or genioplasty procedure, differs very little from that originally described by Hofer [32], except that the procedure is routinely performed intraorally. The versatility of this procedure for correction of skeletal deformities of the chin is impressive, and the results are superior to those of synthetic implant placement in most cases.

# 62.3.8.1 Indications

This osteotomy of the anterior inferior border of the mandible, with minor variations, can be used to improve almost every conceivable skeletal abnormality of the chin. The technique is primarily used only for aesthetic reasons, and therefore, its use depends upon the patient's concern about appearance of this area of the face, more commonly in syndromic cases. Often, the surgeon has to bring the genioplasty to the patient's attention when other facial osteotomies are planned because of the impact that these osteotomies will have on chin promi

nence and aesthetics. The indications, therefore, are often made apparent by comprehensive presurgical treatment planning.

# 62.3.8.2 Technique

The horizontal osteotomy of the symphysis is often done in conjunction with other major osteotomies and, thus, is frequently accomplished under general anesthesia. However, it can be performed as a separate procedure on an outpatient basis with sedation and local anesthesia.

The mucosal incision is made on the labial side of the vestibule at approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above its depth and extends posteriorly to the first bicuspid region. This incision is carried just below the mucosa to the depth of the vestibule and then angled directly to the labial cortex through the mentalis muscle (Fig. 62.25a) in an "apron" fashion with the posterior limbs closer to the attached gingiva to avoid the terminal branches of the mental nerve exiting from the mental foramen. The periosteum is elevated inferiorly to a point just below the intended level of the osteotomy. Laterally, the periosteum is elevated to the mental foramen and then extended posteroinferiorly to the mandibular inferior border below the mental foramen bilaterally. The extent of the posterior cortical exposure is generally determined by the position of the mental foramen and the vertical height of the mandible in this area. In most cases, the exposure terminates in about the first molar area. Caution must be taken if the genioplasty is performed at the same time as a BSSO procedure, because not only with the incisions closely approximate one another but also the osteotomies nearly overlap. In general, no attempt is made to expose the mental nerve by

releasing the soft tissue around it, primarily because the nerve can be small and friable, making inadvertent severing a possibility. Therefore, "skeletonization" of the mental nerve should be avoided in all cases. The periosteal elevation posterior to the mental foramen is minimized to only what is necessary for placement of a narrow channel retractor and the reciprocating saw blade or bur.

It is helpful at this point to inscribe a vertical mark (or two or three marks) into the bone across the planned osteotomy site in the anterior mandible so that the transverse position of the inferior fragment can be more easily reoriented after completion of the osteotomy. The osteotomy cut is then made with a reciprocating saw, preferably because this technique minimizes soft tissue trauma on the lingual aspect of the mandible (see Fig. 62.25b). The length and angle of the horizontal cut may have profound effects on positioning of the mobilized segment as well as the final postsurgical results. Further osteotomies or osteoplasties of the chin are made after mobilization of the inferior segment. The stabilization of the segment in its new position can be done with cortical wires, circummandibular wires, or plates and screws; prebent chin plates are available with varying degrees of advancement in millimeters, and these may be used in a reverse fashion for setback procedures of the chin. For vertical augmentation or reduction, standard four-hole plates with screws may be used, possibly using a bone graft, if necessary. The wound is irrigated and closed in two layers, mentalis muscle and mucosa, with resorbable sutures. Care should be taken to reapproximate the mentalis muscle formally in order to prevent chin ptosis ("witch's chin") postoperatively. Elastoplast tape, or similar tape, should be placed across

![](images/a738cfa6836a95d710ff27451e506dc13e87cbaf752ee939609003271f6ff24a.jpg)

the lip and chin to support and maintain mentalis position, and it is continued for 2-5 days to minimize hematoma formation and to support the suture repair. Patients should be instructed not to pull on their lip in order to minimize the possibility of wound dehiscence.

# 62.3.8.3 Alternative Techniques

The primary technical alterations in the horizontal osteotomy are based upon variations in the osteotomy design, and these design differences depend upon the preexisting symphyseal deformity that is being corrected with genioplasty. Obwegeser [100] concentrated on correction of horizontal deficiency of the chin when he described the basic procedure (Fig. 62.26a). He suggested that a midsagittal osteotomy of the inferior fragment may be helpful in preventing the prominence of

the posterior ends of the fragment, relative to the body of the mandible, as the fragment is advanced (see Fig. 62.26b). A narrower chin point can also be obtained by taking a wedge of bone out from the lingual aspect of this cut (see Fig. 62.26c). The length of the cut posteriorly has important aesthetic consequences, and antagonial notching can be unaesthetic when it occurs at the junction of the distal portion of the advanced genial segment and native mandible and subsequent bony remodeling that occurs in that region. Most notably, larger advancements require a larger cut to the first or second molar region. This permits a smoother line to the inferior border of the mandible. Overlapping an advanced inferior fragment on the lateral cortex of the symphysis allows both an increase in horizontal prominence as well as a decrease in the ante

rior mandibular vertical height (see Fig. 62.26d) [226]. Larger advancements of the inferior fragment can be obtained by double or triple osteotomies, rotation of the fragment combined with a graft at the posterior gap, and bone graft between the symphysis and the fragment (see Fig. 62.26e-g) [227, 228].

Horizontal chin excess is traditionally treated by positioning the inferior segment posteriorly [229]. Depending on the angle of the cut, this may also increase anterior facial height. Sometimes when this is done, it is necessary to remove the posterior ends of the inferior fragment to prevent unsightly protrusions from the inferior border of the mandible (see Fig. 62.26h). When a patient has a normal facial height, the plane of the osteotomy should parallel the Frankfort horizontal or natural head position (NHP), if at all possible. The anterior chin projection may be reduced by using parallel, or V-shaped, osteotomies in a more vertical plane, with the middle segment removed (see Fig. 62.26i).

Vertical symphyseal excess can be reduced by removing the middle segment of bone when the plane of two parallel osteotomies is more horizontal (see Fig. 62.26j). These cuts, however, do not always need to be parallel and, in fact, should be designed to fit the particular structural problem. This design also permits the correction of a mild horizontal deficiency that is combined with a mild vertical excess (see Fig. 62.26k). This skeletal problem can also be corrected with a single osteotomy placed more vertically and by repositioning the segment anteriorly (see Fig. 62.26l). Vertical symphyseal deficiency can be addressed only with an interpositional graft, with either bone or other implant material (see Fig. 62.26m). The use of plates and screws alone to hold the segment in an inferior position has been suggested as well (Figs. 62.27 and 62.28).

The use of wires, pins, screws, or plates and screws for the fixation of the inferior segment is common. Precious and associates [230] evaluated the changes that occur as the bone remodels after a horizontal osteotomy. They recommended that the fixation takes into account these changes, especially the positioning of rigid fixation devices. Plates placed along the superior border of the inferior fragment may become noticeable to the patient as the bone remodels.

Finally, a horizontal osteotomy can be used in combination with a midline osteotomy and BSSO to allow narrowing of the mandibular arch form and at the same time advancing or setting back the chin. In this situation, the inferior segment acts as a plate and with two screws placed on either side of the vertical cut in order to stabilize the segments (Fig. 62.29).

# 62.3.8.4 Complications

The incidence of postoperative problems after a horizontal osteotomy of the symphysis is rarely mentioned. This may be because genioplasties are frequently done in conjunction with other osteotomies, which makes the designation of various complications to one particular portion of the surgery difficult. Van Sickels evaluated sensory loss from SSOs and the effect of other factors, including genioplasty [152]. He found that there was greater initial sensory loss with genioplasty in all age groups, but prolonged neurosensory dysfunction persisted only in older patients. It is intuitive that a BSSO combined with a genioplasty would have a higher incidence of IAN dysfunction than either procedure performed alone, and the literature confirms this suspicion. The possibility of sensory loss from genioplasty alone has not been adequately evaluated, although in one study, it was noted that postsurgical sensory loss was found in all patients, but it was temporary, with normal

sensation returning within 12 months [231]. Another study reported a  $3.5\%$  long-term incidence of sensory deficits after genioplasties.

Most of the literature concerning genioplasties concentrates on the soft tissue response to the skeletal movement. Reports of relapse after genioplasty are few and conflicting. Some clinicians report that there is essentially no relapse after a genioplasty, noting only a spontaneous remodeling of the sharp corners of the advanced segment occurring with time [232-235]. These studies, however, follow patients for only up to 1 year. Two other studies with follow-up of at least 1 year do seem to show some instability of the skeletal chin advancement [236, 237]. The mean relapse with a genial advancement varies widely (from  $2.6\%$  to  $30\%$ ), and the one consistent finding is that most of the skeletal relapse occurs within the first year. As with stability studies of other osteotomies, there exists a large variation in individual relapse, and no attempt has been made to identify the specific etiologies. However, there are probably many factors involved, including patient age and the magnitude of advancement. There have been no studies on the stability of this surgery in correction of other symphyseal deformities. Martinez and colleagues [234] found that regeneration

of the cortical thickness of the symphysis was significantly better in patients younger than 15 years of age. They suggested that this may be beneficial if further surgical advancement of the chin is to be considered. Other complications, such as bone loss and infection, have been reported, but small samples preclude any definitive conclusions regarding precise incidence [238].
