# 7.1 Introduction

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons commonly perform dentoalveolar procedures in adults. In children, the same procedures present different challenges. Behavioral management in pediatric patients is especially important. The surgeon should understand the child's stage of psychological development and must interact with these patients in an age-appropriate manner. To achieve a successful result, an attempt should be made to establish a supportive relationship with the child and parents prior to the operation. In some cases and for some procedures, conscious sedation or general anesthesia may be necessary if appropriate collaboration with the child is not possible. It is critical to avoid a psychologically traumatic experience that could have an impact on future dental and medical treatment.

There are also age-related anatomic differences between adults and children. For example, in the mixed dentition, special attention must be paid to avoid dam

aging permanent tooth buds when removing supernumerary and impacted teeth. Sequence and timing of eruption of the permanent dentition must be understood so that interventions will not disrupt normal eruption of teeth in and near the operative field. Impacted canines, supernumerary teeth, and prominent frena are conditions more commonly seen in children than in adults. In this chapter, we review common dentoalveolar surgery procedures in pediatric patients.

# 7.2 Impacted Teeth

An unerupted tooth is defined as one that has normal eruption potential but has not yet progressed into the mouth [1]. An embedded or an impacted tooth is one that lacks normal eruptive force [2]. An impacted tooth is one that does not achieve its normal position relative to erupted adjacent teeth and supporting alveolar bone. Normal eruption of teeth is essential for development of the maxilla, the mandible, and the dentoalveolar segments. Missing or impacted teeth may affect the overall facial development.

A tooth may fail to erupt for many reasons, the most common being a lack of space due to underdevelopment of the maxilla and/or mandible [2]. Failure of eruption may also be associated with an overlying cyst or tumor (Fig. 7.1), trauma to the tooth bud, mechanical obstruction by supernumerary teeth (Fig. 7.2), scar

tissue from previous surgery, ankylosis of primary or permanent teeth, habits (e.g., thumb sucking), ectopic position of the tooth bud, congenital deformities (cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis), systemic diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism), or syndromes (e.g., cleidocranial dysostosis; Crouzon, Apert, Hurley, or Down syndrome; etc.) [3-7]. In many cases, no specific cause of eruption failure is identified.

Impacted deciduous teeth are uncommon. When they do occur, the most frequent tooth is the second primary molar [2]. Overall, mandibular and maxillary third molars are the most commonly impacted permanent teeth followed by maxillary canines, mandibular and

maxillary premolars, and second molars [8, 9]. Embedded first molars and central incisors are rarely seen in the absence of pathology [10].

Appropriate treatment of an impacted tooth may include surgical extraction if there are dental caries, damage to adjacent teeth, or periodontal disease. When there is an associated cyst or tumor, extraction is indicated, but treatment of the pathologic lesion takes precedence. Longitudinal observation of an impacted tooth is feasible, but the patient should be educated on the risk of resorption of adjacent roots, development of cysts, tumors, or infection. When possible, and with the exception of wisdom teeth, every effort should be made to

expose and orthodontically assist the eruption of impacted teeth.

# 7.3 Impacted Maxillary Canines

Maxillary canines are the most commonly impacted teeth, after third molars, with an incidence between  $1.7\%$  and  $2.2\%$  [9]. Females are affected twice as often as males. The tooth is located on the palate three times as often as on the labial aspect of the ridge [11]. Permanent canines should be erupted before the age of 14 years in girls and 15 in boys [12]. Crowding as a result of arch length discrepancy is the usual cause of failure of eruption of these teeth.

If recognized early and if the crown of the impacted tooth is located posterior to the center on the lateral incisor, extraction of the primary canine before the age of 11 should lead to spontaneous eruption in most cases [13-15].

$\Theta$  Extraction of a primary canine before the age of 11 could lead to spontaneous eruption of the permanent canine.

When eruption is not anticipated, an impacted canine can be left in place; surgically extracted, exposed, and orthodontically moved to its normal location (Fig. 7.3); or autotransplanted. Although it is usually preferable to preserve an impacted canine, in some situations, removing the unerupted tooth will shorten treatment time and provide an acceptable result. For example, if premolars have to be extracted for crowding, a deep, horizontally impacted canine can be removed instead and the premolar modified to look like a canine. Consultation and coordination with the patient's orthodontist are necessary to establish the appropriate treatment plan.

# 7.3.1 Maxillary Canine Exposure

The first step is to accurately localize the impacted tooth in three dimensions (3-D). Failure to do so will prolong the procedure, which may result in inadequate or incorrect flap design and unnecessary soft tissue dissection. In addition, the young patient may be traumatized and his/her cooperation lost.

Visual inspection, manual palpation, and panoramic [16], periapical, occlusal, and cephalometric radiographs could be used alone or in combination to determine the exact position of the tooth. But nowadays, most practitioners use cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) [17, 18]. This imaging technology provides valuable information on the position, inclination, amount of bone covering the tooth, 3-D proximity and

resorption of adjacent roots, position of anatomical structures (maxillary sinus, nasal floor, inferior alveolar nerve), and dental development of the impacted tooth (Fig. 7.4) [19]. Conventional CT scans should be avoided in children for this indication to avoid radiation exposure.

Complications encountered with surgical exposure of maxillary canines include infection, paresthesia of infraorbital and nasopalatine nerves, damage to adjacent structures (roots, maxillary sinus, nasal floor), failure of eruption, necrosis of the flap, and lack of attached gingiva or bone around the exposed tooth [20].

# 7.3.2 Palatally Impacted Canines: Technique (Fig. 7.5)

A sulcular incision is made on the palatal side of the ridge and a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap elevated. Releasing incisions are not necessary and should be avoided (Fig. 7.5c). If bone is covering the crown of the impacted canine, it is easily removed with the sharp end of a periosteal elevator. Enough bone should be removed with a round surgical bur so that it can be fully exposed. Then, the dental follicle is excised using curettes or electrocautery. The latter offers the advantage of keeping the operative field dry, making bonding of the orthodontic bracket, if necessary, easier. Removing bone to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) is unnecessary and could lead to significant bone loss around the tooth [21]. Mobility of the embedded tooth should be verified with an elevator. If no movement can be elicited and there is a suspicion of ankylosis, the tooth should be luxated gently.

# Tips

Use electrocautery to remove dental follicle. This will help achieve hemostasis and facilitate bonding.

At this point, if the position of the tooth is favorable, excision of the overlying gingiva and bone may be sufficient for the canine to erupt [20, 22, 23]. If the inclination of the impacted tooth is unfavorable or if the tooth is deep, the crown is acid-etched, and an orthodontic button or bracket is attached with a composite-type adhesive (Fig. 7.5d). A bracket with gold chain is also an excellent choice in this situation. Self-cured or light-cured material can be used to fix the bracket to the tooth, depending on surgeon's preference. The chain is then attached with a suture to the orthodontic arch wire. Other appliances have been used for traction on

After 1 year of traction, the position of the tooth did not change significantly d. The tooth was re-exposed and finally erupted in good position e

unerupted teeth, including a wire around the cervical margin, pins inserted in the enamel, and polycarbonate crowns. These devices are no longer recommended because of their potential complications and because of the efficacy of etched brackets and chains.

The flap is closed with resorbable sutures over the orthodontic appliance. The chain or wire is fed through the incision, or a window can be created through the palatal flap to expose the entire bracket and chain [20]. A periodontal dressing can be applied. This technique

gives access to the tooth if the bracket fails and needs to be re-bonded and allows the orthodontist more freedom to adequately apply the correct traction vector to the tooth. The direction of eruption should be palatal and away from the root of the lateral incisor to prevent bone and root resorption. When the crown of the impacted tooth has erupted through the palatal gingiva, it then can be moved toward the alveolar ridge [23]. This technique has been shown to decrease periodontal problems between the lateral incisor and canine [24].

# 7.3.3 Labially Impacted Canines: Technique (Fig. 7.6)

The general principles for exposure of a labially impacted canine are similar to those described for palatally impacted teeth. However, specific attention must be paid to preserving the attached gingiva overlying the canine. Removal of keratinized tissue with electrocautery must be avoided. An apically repositioned flap of the keratinized attached gingiva is recommended (Fig. 7.6a, b) [3, 25, 26]. This technique minimizes the risk of developing periodontal problems once the tooth has erupted [20]. An alternative procedure is a closed eruption technique, where the soft tissue is repositioned

over the tooth and bracket. However, this could lead to increased treatment time, diminished control of orthodontic tooth movement, and need for further surgical procedures (uncovering, periodontal surgery) [27].

# Perform an apically repositioned flap to preserve keratinized tissue.

An incision is made on the alveolar crest with vertical releasing incisions on each side, leaving sufficient flap width to accommodate the canine in its erupted position (Fig. 7.6a, b). If a primary tooth is present, it should be extracted. The full-thickness flap is elevated, and bone is removed to expose the crown of the impacted canine. Again, the dental follicle is removed and an orthodontic bracket bonded to the crown of the tooth. The inferior aspect of the flap is sutured apically at the cervical margin of the canine (Fig. 7.6c-e). A periodontal dressing can be applied for a few days for patient comfort.

# 7.3.4 Maxillary Canine Autotransplantation

In very rare occasions, impacted canines that cannot be orthodontically moved into position after exposure can be autotransplanted. This is usually the case for canines

with an angulation greater than  $45^{\circ}$  to the vertical or that are close to the midline [20].

The tooth is extracted atraumatically and moved to its desired position after socket preparation. The maxillary arch should be fully banded and the transplanted tooth stabilized to the arch wire for a period

of 2-3 weeks. Both Moss and Pogrel have reported a success rate of approximately  $70\%$  with this procedure [28, 29]. Endodontic treatment with calcium hydroxide may be necessary if external root resorption develops. This will usually occur within the first 2 years.

# Key Points

- Most maxillary impacted canines are located on the palatal side.  
There is no need for excessive bone removal around an impacted tooth during exposure for traction.

# 7.4 Impacted Mandibular and Maxillary Premolars

Impacted premolars are more common in the mandible than in the maxilla. In the mandible, the second premolar is the second most common impaction after third molars, and the tooth is usually located on the lingual side or in the middle of the alveolar ridge [1, 21]. On the

![](images/d01778cf4d8cface1cde814132042f7b3a14a23c9c5bd5a845ed02e493aa2fa7.jpg)

maxilla, like impacted canines, premolars are most commonly found on the palate [3].

Space should be created for eruption of an impacted premolar by extracting the second primary molar, if present, and/or by orthodontic tooth movement as necessary [21]. If the tooth does not spontaneously erupt, it should be exposed, and the orthodontist should connect it to the arch wire and move it into position.

# 7.4.1 Impacted Premolar Exposure: Technique

Impacted mandibular premolars are located by inspection, manual palpation, and radiographic evaluation. An occlusal radiograph can be helpful to identify the position of the tooth. If the tooth is located on the lingual side, it is exposed by a sulcular incision on the lingual aspect of the ridge (Fig. 7.7). If located on the buccal side or in the middle of the alveolar ridge, an apically repositioned flap may be necessary if the amount of keratinized tissue is an issue. Otherwise, a sulcular incision is performed and an envelope flap is elevated. The crown of the tooth is exposed, the dental follicle is removed, and an orthodontic bracket is secured to the tooth with adhesive. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the mental nerve when elevating a flap in this area.

Impacted maxillary premolars are exposed by the same technique as described for impacted canines.

# 7.5 Impacted Maxillary Incisors

The incidence of impacted maxillary incisors is lower than that of impacted canines and premolars [30]. In tertiary hospital settings, where trauma to the anterior maxilla is frequently encountered, the incidence of

impacted incisors may be higher than reported [3]. Primary incisors that are avulsed, intruded, loosened, or lost due to infection can affect the follicle of the permanent incisors, resulting in higher rate of impaction. Lack of eruption can also be a consequence of hypertrophic and fibrotic gingival tissue overlying the alveolus of the anterior maxilla. This is usually secondary to premature loss (before the age of 5) of primary central incisors. Mesiodens or impacted supernumerary incisors may also cause delayed or failure of eruption of maxillary incisors. These teeth should be removed when the roots of the permanent incisors are  $\frac{1}{2}$  to  $2/3$  developed to facilitate their identification and to prevent damage to developing permanent teeth during the procedure.

# 7.5.1 Maxillary Incisor Exposure: Technique

If the root of an impacted incisor is completely formed or if the apex is closed, there is little chance of spontaneous eruption. The tooth is first located by inspection, manual palpation, and radiographs as described previously. These teeth are commonly on the labial aspect of the ridge. A crestal incision, with vertical limbs at the mesial and distal margins of the incisor crown, is made. The full-thickness flap is elevated and the crown of the tooth uncovered. Remnants of the dental follicle are excised with electrocautery. A bracket is bonded to the tooth if no spontaneous eruption is anticipated. The flap is apically repositioned to ensure adequate attached gingival as the tooth erupts (Fig. 7.8). If the tooth is located in the middle of the ridge, a sulcular incision is used, a flap is elevated, and the follicle is removed by electrocautery. A button or bracket is placed on the tooth and connected to the orthodontic arch wire. The

Fig. 7.8 Preoperative radiograph of a 10-year-old male patient with impacted central incisors secondary to the presence of two supernumerary teeth a. The left central incisor failed to erupt after

flap is reapproximated and sutured. The tooth is orthodontically moved into the arch.

If the incisor root is not completely formed, a path for eruption can be created by removing hypertrophic gingival tissue overlying the tooth, impacted supernumeraries, or other pathologies. This will often allow spontaneous eruption. If the tooth does not erupt, it should be exposed, bracketed, and orthodontically moved into position as described above.

# 7.6 Impacted First and Second Molars

Although the incidence of impacted first and second molars is low, this can result in significant periodontal and occlusal problems for adjacent and opposing teeth [31]. Mandibular first and second molars are more commonly impacted than those on the maxilla. As with any impacted teeth, it is better to make the diagnosis and treat the problem before the roots are fully developed [32]. This allows for spontaneous eruption.

As the roots develop, they may become deformed and dilacerated along the inferior border of the mandible. If this occurs, it is more difficult to get the

impacted molar to erupt spontaneously [25]. Impacted second molars, in many cases, are a result of inadequate space and anterior migration of the third molar tooth bud. Treatment consists of removing the third molar prior to complete root development of the 12-year molar. This will provide enough space for the second molar to upright into a normal position. For teeth with incomplete root development and before closure of root apices, Kaban et al. obtained satisfactory result by surgical exposure and gentle luxation and extraction of the impacted third molar as appropriate [31].

# 7.6.1 Impacted Molar Exposition: Technique

A flap is elevated and bone is removed to expose the crown of the impacted molar. The dental follicle is excised using electrocautery. If there is a space problem, the impacted third molar is removed. The 12-year molar is luxated gently. If necessary, an orthodontic bracket for traction is bonded to the tooth and connected to the arch wire with a chain or wire.

# 7.7 Supernumerary Teeth

An increase in the number of teeth is defined as hyperdontia. The additional teeth are termed "supernumerary" [2]. A possible explanation for an increased number of teeth is the development of excessive dental lamina, which in turn leads to the formation of additional tooth buds [2, 33]. Syndromes associated with hyperdontia include cleidocranial dysplasia (see Fig. 7.2), Apert, Crouzon, Down, Gardner, Ehlers-Danlos, Sturge-Weber, etc. [2].

In most cases, only one supernumerary tooth is present. The anterior maxilla is the site of predilection [34]. A supernumerary tooth in this area is called a mesiodens (Fig. 7.9) [2]. The next most common supernumerary tooth is a fourth maxillary molar (distomolar if located posterior to the last molar; paramolar if located medially or laterally of other molars), followed by a fourth mandibular molar and mandibular premolars [34]. Most supernumerary teeth fail to erupt and remain impacted.

# Mesiodens: supernumerary tooth in the anterior maxilla

A supernumerary tooth in the anterior maxilla should be addressed early because it can prevent normal eruption of permanent central incisors. They are usually extracted when  $1/2 - 2/3$  of the roots of the central incisors are formed. This makes it easier to identify the roots of the normal incisors and to identify the abnormal tooth [3]. The supernumerary is located by manual palpation, plain radiographs, or CBCT.

Fourth molars are usually extracted at the same time as third molars, unless they are too deep. In these cases, they are left in place and extracted when they take the place of the extracted third molar [3]. Supernumerary premolars are removed when the permanent premolars exhibit  $1/2 - 2/3$  root development.

Teeth can also be present in the new born (natal teeth) or appear shortly after birth (neonatal teeth) [35]. Most of these teeth represent deciduous mandibular incisors. If they are supernumerary teeth, they are usually mobile and associated with eruption cysts and can be removed.

# Key Points

From more to less common, supernumerary teeth are mesiodens  $>$  fourth maxillary molar  $>$  fourth mandibular molar  $>$  mandibular premolars.

# 7.8 Hypodontia

The absence of one or multiple teeth is one of the most common developmental anomalies of the dentition [2]. Many syndromes have been associated with a decrease in the number of teeth, one of the most common being ectodermal dysplasia (more than 100 types described) (Fig. 7.10). These patients occasionally present with the absence of all teeth, a condition called anodontia.

The most common missing teeth are third molars, followed by first and second molars, second premolars, and maxillary lateral incisors [2]. Patients with complete cleft lip and palate have an increased incidence of a

missing lateral incisor on the cleft side. The absence of teeth has an adverse effect on the development and growth of the alveolus. If a deciduous tooth is present, it should be retained until such time as the missing permanent tooth is replaced with a dental implant or the space closed orthodontically.

# 7.9 Transplantation of Teeth

With the increased popularity and long-term success of dental implants, autologous tooth transplantation is rarely performed. However, in some situations, it remains a useful technique for replacing a missing tooth. Allogenic tooth transplants, on the other hand, ultimately fail because the antigenic properties of the periodontal ligament cause a local immune response. Rejection is manifested by external and internal root resorption.

Autotransplantation of impacted canines and transplantation of third molars to replace a first or a second molar are the most commonly performed procedures. Canine transplantation was discussed earlier in this chapter.

A third molar can be transferred to replace a first or a second molar congenitally missing or lost due to dental caries (Fig. 7.11). The transplanted tooth should be free of infection, and the root should be at least

$50\%$ , ideally 2/3 developed [36]. If the donor tooth is extracted atraumatically and if the periodontal ligament is preserved, the overall success rate is high. Pogrel obtained a success rate of  $72\%$  in a series of 400 transplanted teeth [29]. The success of the procedure is inversely related to the amount of time between extraction of the donor tooth and transplantation and directly related to the fit of the transplant in the recipient socket. Initial stability of the transplant is also crucial. Some authors recommend prophylactic endodontic treatment with calcium hydroxide a few weeks after the procedure [37]. In most cases, endodontic treatment is performed only if external or internal root resorption is noted. Complications of autotransplantation include ankylosis, resorption, and development of periapical pathology.

# 7.9.1 Molar Tooth Transplantation: Technique (Fig. 7.11)

The recipient site should be free of pathology and infection. The donor third molar is extracted with care to prevent fracture of the roots and damage to the periodontal ligament. The tooth is inserted in the recipient socket and forced in place below the occlusal plane. Septal and periapical bone may have to be removed for a better fit. It is important to avoid occlusal interferences during the healing process [38]. Gingival tissues are sutured in place around the tooth. A periodontal dressing or an orthodontic wire can be used to maintain the tooth in place. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for 7 days. The tooth should erupt spontaneously and level with the occlusal plane.

implant appears too far apically in relation to adjacent teeth, and the final restoration is not esthetically acceptable

# 7.10 Dental Implants in the Growing Child

Dental implants are considered the standard of care to replace missing teeth in the adult. They are widely used and the success rate is high [39-41]. The use of dental implants in the growing child presents specific challenges related to the vertical growth of the alveolus. There is no periodontal membrane around an implant, and therefore the implant does not stimulate bone formation by transmission of occlusal forces to the alveolar bone [42-45]. Rather, similar to an ankylosed tooth, the implant becomes progressively submerged as the adjacent alveolus grows in height (Fig. 7.12) [46]. In addition, because transverse growth of the maxilla occurs in part by bone apposition on the lateral aspect of the alveolus, an implant will take a more palatal position as the maxilla develops [47]. Fixed prosthesis crossing the midline should be avoided, because this will have a negative impact on transverse growth at the midpalatine suture [42].

Mandibular growth occurs both at the condyle and by apposition of bone on the posterior aspect of the ramus with resorption on the anterior surface [48]. Growth of the alveolar bone follows principles similar to what is observed in the maxilla, resulting in progressive lingual and inferior displacement of dental implants placed in growing children. Implants placed in the mandible should not be connected across the midline with a fixed prosthesis because this will affect the transverse growth of the mandible [42].

Implants that are located too far apically and palatally/lingually are difficult to restore, and the root/crown ratio may be affected negatively. The gingival margin around submerged implants will be located apically, resulting in poor esthetics of the final restoration.

Despite these concerns, there are some indications for implant placement in children. In ectodermal dysplasia, where the growth pattern is abnormal, dental implants offer several advantages over a removable prosthesis [49]. Replacement of teeth with dental implants in

Fig. 7.13 This 24-year-old female patient had a prominent maxillary labial frenum attached to the incisive papilla. Note the blanching of the papilla when the lip is stretched. Because the frenum was not excised in time, she developed periodontal problems between the two maxillary incisors as demonstrated by the gingival recession

a reconstructed segment after tumor resection is another indication for implantation in children. No growth is expected in this area, so a prosthesis can be fabricated and modified over time as needed to prevent supraeruption of teeth [3]. Placement of implants and functional loading preserve the grafted bone.

# 7.11 Prominent Maxillary Labial Frenum

It is common for pediatricians and parents to be concerned when there is a prominent labial frenum because it is sometimes accompanied by a diastema between the primary or permanent central incisors. A labial frenum contributes to the persistence of a diastema if it crosses the alveolar ridge and is attached on the incisive papilla [50]. The papilla blanches when the lip is stretched (Fig. 7.13). Other causes of diastema between maxillary incisors include thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, missing or impacted teeth, atypical swallowing pattern, bony pathology between incisors, midline bony cleft, and notching of alveolar bone between incisors [50-53].

In infants, a prominent labial frenum inserted on the alveolar crest is not abnormal. With vertical growth of the maxilla, the frenum becomes positioned superiorly and eventually assumes a normal position in most children [51]. A frenectomy should not be performed before eruption of the permanent canines is underway, because as these teeth move inferiorly and anteriorly, the diastema will close in most cases [50]. Excising the frenum before the eruption of the six maxillary anterior teeth may create scar tissue between incisors, making closure of the diastema difficult, even with orthodontic forces.

A frenectomy may also be indicated to prevent periodontal problems, but in most cases, it is removed to aid in closure of a diastema or for esthetic and psychosocial reasons [54].

# 7.12 Techniques

# 7.12.1 Standard Frenectomy

Histologically, the frenum is composed of a significant amount of elastic fibers. These fibers are thought to contribute to the development of the diastema [51]. Therefore, when performing a frenectomy, it is crucial to remove this fibroelastic band to prevent recurrence.

An incision is made on each side of the frenum, from its attachment on the incisive papilla to the labial mucosa. On the alveolus, the incision is extended down to the periosteum. The frenum is removed resulting in an elliptical defect. The mucosa is undermined, and releasing incisions can be made along the mucogingival junction on each side to facilitate closure. The labial flap is closed by medially transposing both edges to the midline. The resultant soft tissue defect below the mucogingival line heals by secondary intention (Fig. 7.14). Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary. Patients are instructed to maintain good hygiene in the area, and they are placed on a soft diet for a few days.

# 7.12.2 Laser Frenectomy

A laser frenectomy is a shorter operation than standard frenectomy and produces less swelling and postoperative discomfort. However, patient cooperation is necessary to prevent laser injury to surrounding structures.

The frenum is placed under tension by pulling on the upper lip. Then, a carbon dioxide laser is used to excise the frenum to the periosteum. No sutures are necessary, and postoperative instructions are the same as with a standard open approach.

# 7.13 Mandibular Labial Frenum

A high labial frenum between lower central incisors can cause periodontal inflammation, gingival recession, and eventually bone loss if not treated. This is a result of the pulling action of the frenum on the interdental papilla. There is trapping of food, plaque accumulation, inflammation, and loss of attached gingiva. If periodontal problems persist even with good oral hygiene and intermittent scaling and root planning, a frenectomy is indicated.

# 7.14 Techniques

# 7.14.1 Standard Technique

This technique is the same as the one described for a maxillary labial frenum. The frenum is excised elliptically and the labial mucosa re-approximated after undermining and advancing tissues on each side. The keratinized tissue on the superior aspect is allowed to heal by secondary intention, maintaining the width of the attached gingival [55]. A gingival graft is rarely necessary in pediatric patients [50].

# 7.14.2 Z-Plasty Technique

The frenum is excised and the resultant defect is closed using a Z-plasty design. A Z-plasty is composed of three limbs of equal length. The vertical limb in this case is created by the excision of the frenum. Two limbs are drawn at  $60^{\circ}$  from the vertical limb. The two triangles created are undermined, rotated, and translated toward each other. This changes the direction of the scar and lengthens the lip [56]. A gain in length of approximately  $75\%$  can be expected with  $60^{\circ}$  angles [56].

# 7.14.3 Laser Frenectomy

This technique is identical as the one described for the laser maxillary labial frenectomy.

# 7.15 Linguual Frenum

A high lingual frenum, also called a tongue-tie, is attached on the tip of the tongue and on the lingual alveolar ridge [50]. If the frenum is short, tongue motion, particularly protrusion and elevation, is limited. Oral surgeons are often asked by parents and pediatricians to remove the frenum because of the fear of speech impairment. This often occurs if the frenum is very short and if the tongue exhibits decreased movement and particularly clefting when the child attempts to protrude or elevate it. In many cases, speech articulation develops normally and a frenectomy is not necessary. Consultation from a speech pathologist should be obtained.

A lingual frenum that extends high on the alveolar ridge may produce a diastema and periodontal problems related to the mandibular central incisors. Simply cutting through the frenum may work, but in some cases, the linear scar created may limit tongue mobility. To avoid this, the frenum could be excised and a V-Y (Fig. 7.15) or Z-plasty closure carried out to increase the length of the ventral surface of the tongue. A laser frenectomy can also be performed, as described above.

# Key Points

- Be careful to avoid openings of sublingual glands and Wharton's ducts while incising.  
- Avoid hematoma of the floor of the mouth with complete hemostasis before closure.

# Conclusion

Minor dentoalveolar surgery remains, for most oral surgeons, a common practice. With careful planning, good communication with referring dentists or other specialists, and adequate surgical techniques, most complications can be avoided. This is especially important in children to avoid the need for other interventions, affect negatively the growth of the maxilla, or disrupt normal eruption of teeth.
