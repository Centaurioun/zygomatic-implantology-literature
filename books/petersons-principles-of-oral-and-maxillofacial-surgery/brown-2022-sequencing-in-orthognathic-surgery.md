# 64.1 Introduction

The progression of orthognathic surgery has mirrored scientific advancements in biological understanding and osteointegration. In the early years of orthognathic surgery, surgeons would perform osteotomies of the mandible as an isolated procedure for the treatment of dentofacial deformities. As the anatomy of the Le Fort maxillary osteotomy became understood, its use in orthognathic surgery increased [1, 2]. This newfound comfort to mobilize the maxilla allowed surgeons to correct increasingly complex facial abnormalities by operating on both the maxilla and the mandible.

Simultaneous bimaxillary surgery compared to staged bimaxillary osteotomies has the main benefit of completing surgical correction in a single surgical operation. With accurate treatment planning, bimaxillary surgery for the correction of dentofacial deformities has also become highly predictable. However, the evolution of bimaxillary surgery from a two-staged procedure [3] to a single-stage procedure [4, 5] brought with it controversy about the sequence in which to perform the osteotomies [6, 7].

The traditional sequence for bimaxillary surgery has been to operate on the maxilla first and then the mandible. Prior to stable internal fixation with screws and plates, surgeons used osseous wire fixation in conjunction with maxillomandibular fixation for repositioning the jaws. The maxilla was the only jaw that could be stabilized with wire fixation, so the maxilla had to be operated first. Plate and screw fixation, which came relatively late in the history of orthognathic surgery, allowed the mandible to be made stable so surgeons then had a choice as to which jaw they operate first when performing bimaxillary osteotomies [8].

Sequencing double-jaw surgery is often determined by surgeon preference. Either mandible-first or maxilla-first bimaxillary sequencing can provide predictable clinical outcomes with proper planning and execution. Errors with diagnosis, clinical evaluation, model surgery, fabrication of intermediate or final splints, and surgical execution of preplanned moves can inherently

affect not only the first jaw operated but also the opposing jaw. This chapter will discuss not only the appropriate steps to completing each surgical sequence but also the specific scenarios in which one sequence or the other may be more beneficial. Application of these techniques may reduce surgical error, make surgery easier, and possibly improve patient outcomes.

# 64.2 Presurgical Planning of Bimaxillary Surgery

# 64.2.1 Conventional Model Surgery

The sequencing of bimaxillary orthognathic surgery has a greater potential for error than with isolated maxillary or isolated mandibular surgery. Model surgery plays a large role in that potential error. Since both jaws are being "disarticulated" from the skull, placing them in the proper three-dimensional position requires special maneuvers so that the jaws can be accurately positioned. No matter which jaw is operated first, it must be done accurately.

Bimaxillary surgery, when performed through model surgery, requires that the patient's casts be mounted on an articulator. A facebook transfer is typically used in order to achieve an accurate mounting of the maxillary cast, and an interocclusal registration is taken with the mandible in centric relation to mount the mandibular cast [9, 10]. Although model surgery is quickly becoming replaced with virtual surgical planning (VSP), there is still a place for mock surgery on dental casts. It is imperative that accurate model surgery is carried out to reduce errors in presurgical planning.

The mandible's position, as it relates to the cranial base and maxilla, is a complex system based on the temporomandibular joint, perioral soft tissues, and dental occlusion that has many different clinically relevant positions [11]. Centric relation (CR) is defined as the position of the mandible and occlusion when the head of the condyle is situated in its most anterior and superior position within the glenoid fossa. It is considered the most reproducible position of the mandible to establish a maxillomandibular relationship [12-15]. Centric occlusion (CO) is the position of the mandible (and condyle) when teeth are in maximum intercuspation (MI). The position of the condyles may differ between centric occlusion and centric relation, and it is uncommon for CO to equal CR. Centric relation is used to mount models because that is the only reproducible position of the condyles when the patient is under a state of general anesthesia. An error in the recorded occlusion will be reflected in splint fabrication and subsequently in the operating room. This is critical to

understand and very important when doing an isolated maxillary surgery or when operating the maxilla first on a bimaxillary surgery.

# 64.2.2 Maxilla-First Model Surgery

Model surgery contains potential for errors that are translated into errors in surgery through inaccurate intermediate and/or final splints. Errors in dental cast mounting with a poor facebow transfer, errors in bite registration, errors in reference points on the casts, and errors in accurately moving the segments for surgery are just some of the factors that can affect clinical outcomes [16]. It is therefore imperative that appropriate model surgery is carried out to reduce errors in presurgical planning.

Ideally, two maxillary casts, two mandibular casts, a bite registration, and a facebow registration must be taken prior to presurgical model surgery. While it is possible to perform model surgery on only one set of articulated models, it is always best to never perform surgery on the original set of mounted models. That way, one can always go back to the original sets for splint fabrication if one chooses to alter the sequence of surgery. So, it is best to mount two sets of models and only operate on one set. The first step in maxilla-first model surgery is to accurately mount the maxillary cast with a facebow transfer. The temporomandibular hinge-axis on an articulator differs from the cephalometric Frankfort horizontal line depending on the style of articulator and facebow used [17, 18]. This difference between the temporomandibular hinge-axis and Frankfort horizontal line will create errors in the occlusal plane and ultimately in the final maxillary and mandibular positions. It is important to account for this in the facebow transfer [9].

Next the mandibular cast is mounted with an interocclusal bite registration. The patient must be in CR during the bite registration. If the patient is not in CR during planning, then the true CR during surgery will cause inaccuracy in maxillary position. Any error in the maxillary position will then be transferred to the mandibular position.

The second maxillary model is first moved to its final position and an interim split is created against the second uncut mandibular model. If the maxilla requires segmentation, that is performed first and then the new dental arch is moved to its new position against the uncut mandibular model. A splint between the repositioned maxillary cast and the uncut mandibular cast must be fabricated to use during surgery to help reposition the maxilla. Different types of splints are possible including a palatal splint or an interocclusal splint. The mandibular cast is then sectioned and mounted into its

final position. If the patient does not have a stable occlusion, a final splint may be additionally created.

Maxillary-first model surgery has the potential for errors in the facebow recording, recording centric relation, and the repositioning of the maxillary cast on the articulator [19]. It is the surgeon's responsibility to accurately account for each of these potential problems and verify that model surgery correlates with the clinical exam.

# 64.2.3 Mandible-First Model Surgery

Multiple techniques of performing model surgery are possible for mandible-first sequencing for bimaxillary surgery [20, 21]. If articulated model surgery is performed in the laboratory there are two methods that can be used. The first is conventional model surgery as described above using two sets of models—one set is used for surgery and the other set is not sectioned. One can then change the operated and the unoperated models to see if a maxilla-first or a mandible-first interim position seems most reasonable. The appropriate splints can then be made depending on which jaw one decides to operate first.

The second method of mandible-first model surgery is quite different. An accurate facebow transfer to mount the maxillary cast is not necessary. Instead, the maxillary cast can be mounted on an occlusal plane table. Wolford and Galiano pioneered mounting with the occlusal table in order to remove the inaccuracies that a facebow transfer can produce [21]. Their technique uses a SAM articulator (SAM Dental, Munich, Germany) which sets the occlusal plane angle to the angle traced from the cephalometric analysis with additional clinical measurements for maxillary cant and midline rotations. [Fig. 64.1] The technique of using the occlusal table does not accurately record the maxilla in relation to the cranial base; thus, it cannot be used for anything but mandible-first surgery but it can accurately represent the clinical position of the patient's jaws.

Next, the maxillary cast is mounted with an interocclusal registration. Both steps are verified with the clinical exam. The mandibular cast is repositioned into the planned position based on clinical and radiographic examinations. An interim split is fabricated between the uncut maxilla and the repositioned mandible. If the maxilla is a single piece with no segmentation required or if the final occlusion is stable then the model surgery is completed. However, if either of these two scenarios is encountered, then additional steps are required.

If the maxillary cast is planned for segmentation or the final occlusion is not stable, then an additional splint may be required. To manufacture a final splint, the maxillary cast is positioned into the final occlusion. If

segmentation was required, it is achieved prior to setting the maxillary cast into its final position. A palatal splint can be fabricated to support the segmented maxilla. The last step is to fabricate the final splint if required because of an unstable occlusion.

# 64.3 Maxilla-First Sequencing

The maxilla-first sequence for bimaxillary orthognathic surgery has been well established [22-24]. Properly orienting the maxilla in space is the foundation for accurate maxilla-first bimaxillary surgery. Using the uncut mandible to position the maxilla requires a reproducible temporomandibular joint position during the mounting of the models on the articulator and during the execution phase in the operating room. Accurate repositioning of the jaws is complex and can be technically challenging. The relatively simplistic maxillary movements in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and medial-lateral directions are compounded by pitch, yaw, and roll rotations [25]. There have been a variety of different techniques employed to attempt accurate surgical repositioning of the maxilla. Freehand maxillary repositioning, internal references, and intraoperative facebow devices have been used in the past to position the maxilla in free space. Studies have shown that the use of an external vertical reference point in combination with an intermediate splint is very predictable and much more accurate than those techniques that do not employ them [26-28].

Operating the maxilla-first when performing bimaxillary surgery has been shown to provide similar accuracy as when performing an isolated maxillary osteotomy [29]. Jacobson et al. found that  $80\%$  of their patients

who had a Le Fort I osteotomy were within  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of their preplanned position at the immediate postoperative appointment. There was no difference in accuracy based on complexity of the surgery (bimaxillary surgery versus isolated maxillary surgery). Other studies corroborate these findings with no statistical difference between the accuracy of isolated maxillary surgery compared to bimaxillary surgery [30]. For instance, Bouchard et al. found that there was little difference between predicted and actual movements of the Le Fort I osteotomy with all discrepancies being less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  [31].

There are certain maxillary movements that have been shown to be more accurate than others during maxillary surgery when the mandible is used to position the maxilla using a splint and an external vertical reference. Vertical repositioning of the maxilla has been shown to be more accurate  $(0.5 - 1\mathrm{mm})$  than horizontal repositioning (up to  $2\mathrm{mm}$ ) from the planned movement [32]. In the end, errors in maxillary movement during maxilla-first sequencing are  $\leq 2\mathrm{mm}$  and have minimal clinical significance.

# 64.3.1 Maxilla-First Surgical Sequence

Even when employing maxilla-first bimaxillary surgery, many surgeons prefer to start by first performing corticotomies for the sagittal split ramus osteotomies (SSRO) prior to the Le Fort osteotomy without completing the splits [33]. Originally, this technique was used in order to minimize the amount of surgical manipulation that had to be done to the mandible after stabilizing the maxilla in the days with only wire fixation. This practice has largely continued due to surgeon preference.

An external, stable point of reference is required in order to correctly position the maxilla in the preplanned vertical position [27, 34, 35]. One can measure from the incisors to the medial canthus, or a more stable method is using a Kirschner-wire (K-wire) inserted through the skin at nasion. The K-wire is then trimmed to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  from the skin and a measurement from teeth #8 and #9 are recorded.

A standard Le Fort osteotomy is completed and the maxilla mobilized. Any planned segmentation can then be completed. A splint within a splint option (piggyback) [36] or a palatal splint with an interocclusal type intermediate splint are two methods that can be employed. Once the maxilla is fully mobilized (and possibly segmented), it is wired into occlusion with the intermediate splint between the upper and lower teeth. The maxillomandibular complex is then rotated clockwise or counterclockwise until the proper vertical dimension has been established. It is crucial that the mandible be placed into centric relation with the condyle in its most anterior, superior position within the glenoid fossa during this maneuver because the position of the jaws is predicated on the condyles being in the same position they were when the models were mounted on the articulator. If superior repositioning of the maxilla is planned, bony interferences are gradually removed until the appropriate vertical dimension is achieved by measuring from the incisors to the external reference point. When the surgeon is confident that the condyles are seated in centric relation and the proper vertical relationship has been attained, plate and screw fixation can be applied. Because the mandible, after it is mobilized, will be wired into final occlusion with the maxilla, it is imperative that stable fixation be applied to the maxilla. Typically, four plates are adequate. Maxillomandibular fixation is removed and passive movement of the mandible into the intermediate splint is verified. This is a critical step to assure that the condyles were well seated in the glenoid fossae and the occlusion passively and reproducibly can be placed into and out of the intermediate splint.

The mandibular osteotomies can then be completed. The mandible is placed into the proper maximal occlusion position with or without a final splint and maxillomandibular fixation secured. Stable internal fixation may then be applied across the mandibular osteotomies. During fixation of the mandible, gentle upward pressure should be applied at the angles to ensure that the condyles are well seated. Upon removal of maxillomandibular fixation, passive fit of the mandibular dentition into the final splint or the maxillary dentition must be verified.

# 64.3.2 Scenarios in Which Maxilla-First Sequencing Is Advantageous

# 64.3.2.1 Clockwise Rotation of the Maxillomandibular Complex

Clockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex during bimaxillary surgery is much easier when performing the maxilla-first sequence. This is mainly due to the intermediate position during surgery. When performing the mandible-first orthognathic sequence for clockwise rotations, there is a transient anterior open bite created intraoperatively in the intermediate position. [Fig. 64.2] This requires a large, thick intermediate splint that may make maxillomandibular fixation difficult. If, however, the maxilla is operated on first, the intermediate splint is much thinner and easier to use. The patient can more readily be placed into maxillomandibular fixation and the anterior dentition can aid in verification of the presurgical plan.

# 64.3.2.2 Mandibular Osteotomy Is Not Stable

There are two possible causes of unstable fixation of the mandible: (1) A planned, non-fixated osteotomy, (2) a "bad split" causing unstable fixation. Planned osteotomies that may not be planned for stable internal fixation are the intraoral vertical ramus and the inverted "L" mandibular osteotomies. [Fig. 64.3] If one chooses one of these procedures without the application of stable internal fixation, the ability to do mandible-first orthognathic sequencing is not possible and the maxilla must be operated on first.

Far less common is an unplanned "bad split" causing an inability to predictably fixate the proximal and distal segments. [Fig. 64.4] Approximately  $1 - 9\%$  of sagittal split osteotomies are complicated with an unfavorable fracture of the proximal or distal segments [37, 38]. The most commonly fractured areas of a sagittal split osteotomy are the buccal plate of the proximal segment and the lingual plate of the distal segment [39]. A bad split may not necessarily compromise functional success, but it may compromise the ability to obtain rigid fixation [40].

Risk factors that may be associated with a "bad split" are presence of unerupted third molars in young patients, older age, sex, surgeon experience, and mandible morphology [41-44]. The presence of unerupted third molars increasing the incidence of a "bad split" depends on patient age. Young patients (<20 years old) with unerupted or impacted third molars have a higher rate of a bad fracture [45]; however, presence of impacted third molars in older patients (>30 years old) does not necessarily increase the risk of a "bad split" [46]. If third

molars are to be removed prior to orthognathic surgery they should be removed at minimum 6 months prior. Many surgeons advocate waiting 6-9 months after third molar removal before a sagittal split osteotomy.

When performing the bilateral sagittal split osteotomy prior to the maxillary osteotomy it is imperative that the mandible have predicable internal stability. The preoperative assessment of each patient should be attuned to patient risk factors that may cause an unfavorable mandible fracture. In the event of a "bad split," the surgeon may fixate the mandible and abort orthognathic surgery until the mandible fracture is healed, or continue with surgery with the possibility of introducing error into the preoperative plan. Surgeon experience and confidence in fixation should ultimately determine how to manage this complication.

# 64.4 Mandible-First Sequencing

The mandible-first sequence in double-jaw orthognathic surgery has many applications that may be beneficial to the surgeon during both planning and surgical execution. [47-50] Mandible-first bimaxillary surgery owes its existence to rigid internal fixation. Without the application of stable internal fixation, the mandible-first sequence is not possible because it is required to help reposition the maxilla. If mandibular repositioning is not stable due to osteotomy design or there is a high likelihood of an unpredictable osteotomy split, the maxilla-first sequencing should be planned. Some mandibular osteotomies, for instance the SSRO, lend themselves to easy application of stable internal fixation. As with maxilla-first surgery, the condyles must be placed into the proper position within the glenoid fossa to obtain the proper position of the mandible. This section will review the clinical situations in which the mandible-first sequence is advantageous.

# 64.4.1 Mandible-First Surgical Sequence

Mandible-first bimaxillary surgery begins with the mandibular osteotomies. Once the proximal and distal segments are separated, the mandible is placed into its intermediate position against the uncut maxilla with the intermediate splint in place. Maxillomandibular fixation is used while appropriate internal fixation is applied across the mandibular osteotomy segments. During fixation of the mandible, gentle upward pressure should be applied at the angles to ensure that the temporomandibular joints are well seated. Every effort to prevent a bad split should be employed. Upon removal of maxil

lomandibular fixation, the passive fit of the mandibular occlusion into the final splint should be verified.

After completion of the mandibular surgery, an external reference point is used to correctly position the maxilla in the preplanned vertical position. A standard Le Fort osteotomy is completed. After adequate mobilization of the maxilla is achieved it is placed into MMF with the repositioned mandible. If the maxilla was segmented, a palatal or occlusal splint would be secured to the segments prior to establishing MMF.

At this point, it is crucial that the mandible be placed into centric relation with the condyle in its most anterior, superior position within the glenoid fossa. Bony interferences are gradually removed until the appropriate vertical dimension of the maxilla is achieved, and the maxilla is plated with plates and screws. Maxillomandibular fixation is removed and passive movement of the mandibular teeth into the final splint is verified.

# 64.4.2 Scenarios in Which Mandible-First Sequencing Is Advantageous

# 64.4.2.1 Inaccurate Bite Registration or Discrepancy in Centric Relation and Centric Occlusion

Many factors can have an effect on condylar position during the taking of an interocclusal registration and during surgery. It is a technique-sensitive record with inter-operator errors [51-53], and its error can even be compounded by the impression material used [54]. In maxilla-first sequencing, the interocclusal registration provides the ability to make the interim splint. When the interocclusal registration is inaccurate the interim splint will not provide the appropriate position of the maxilla during surgery. If a patient has habitual posturing of the mandible with a functional shift in occlusion, an inaccurate interocclusal registration may occur. This will create a situation where the position of the condyles is inaccurate and will lead to a faulty foundation to begin orthognathic surgery. Many patients may be coached into centric relation and have their bite registration taken appropriately, but if this becomes very difficult, it may be best to either anesthetize the patient to obtain a centric relation registration or instead plan mandible-first bimaxillary surgery.

Occlusion must always be checked after general anesthesia has been induced in order to verify that the occlusion on the operating room table is the same as the mounted models. That is why it is always good to have a second, uncut set of articulated models available. One can use them to compare the patient's occlusion under

general anesthesia. If the mounted models and the occlusion on the operating table do not match, then another model surgery has to be done with an accurate interocclusal bite registration or one can make an interim splint for mandible-first surgery if the original set of models has not been cut and the surgery can proceed with mandible-first surgery.

In mandible-first sequencing, the interocclusal registration does not have to be accurately performed because the treatment planning is structured around the final incisor position. Any error in centric relation or interocclusal registration is accounted for intraoperatively by repositioning the condyle into the glenoid fossa during fixation of the mandible. If the condyle is seated in the centric relation during fixation of the mandible, the interocclusal registration does not have to be accurate. This can be helpful in a patient with difficulty in reproducing centric relation. Such patients are those with functional shifts, inflamed joints, or patients who cannot fully cooperate.

# 64.4.2.2 Segmented Maxillae

The Le Fort 1 osteotomy is a well-established surgical technique for the repositioning of the maxilla [55, 56]. It is one of the most versatile surgical procedures in orthognathic surgery. A Le Fort osteotomy can reposition the maxilla in all 3 planes (anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and medial-lateral) and all 3 axes of rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw). One of the greatest advantages of a Le Fort 1 osteotomy is the ability to readily segment the dental arch into pieces, allowing correction of transverse discrepancies, dual occlusal planes, Curve of Spee abnormalities, and Bolton discrepancies [57]. The segmented Le Fort 1 osteotomy is more commonly used than a single-piece Le Fort 1 osteotomy likely due to these abilities [58] [Table 64.1].

In traditional bimaxillary surgery with the maxilla-first sequence, an intermediate splint must be fabricated to fit between the maxilla and the unoperated mandible [32]. When the maxilla is segmented or in a patient with a maxillary cleft there is also the need to maintain the

Table 64.1 Indications for the segmentation of a Le Fort 1 osteotomy

transverse dimension with a palatal splint. [Fig. 64.5] Model surgery in such cases must produce a palatal splint, an intermediate splint that fits over the palatal splint, and usually a final splint. These splints can be difficult to accurately position with multiple floating segments.

When the mandible is operated on first, there are potential benefits for segmented maxillae. The mandible will be in its final position when placing the segmented maxilla into maxillomandibular fixation. This allows for the maxilla to be in maximum intercuspation prior to fixation. Not only does this negate the need for a complex overlay of surgical splints, but it also removes the inaccuracies that would have been introduced with that method. During mandible-first sequencing, the measurements required during the model surgery are only from the central incisors, first molars, and pogonion [59].

Overall, a reduction in model surgery time and decreased errors in splint fabrication are the benefits for a segmented maxilla with mandible-first sequencing.

# 64.4.2.3 Counterclockwise Rotation and Downgrafting of the Posterior Maxilla

One indication for bimaxillary surgery is the alteration of the occlusal plane. Clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) rotations of the maxillomandibular complex typically require the use of bimaxillary surgery. The CCW rotation is particularly useful in steep mandibular angle Class II skeletal deformities, the most common dentofacial deformity that requires surgical correction [58, 60]. The CCW rotation has the benefit of projecting pigeonion (Po) in a retrognathic mandible or hypoplastic chin and thereby providing enhanced esthetic results.

When performing a CCW rotation the posterior maxilla is typically downgrafted in order to correct a steep occlusal plane while also keeping the maxillary incisor at an esthetic and functional position. In maxilla-first sequencing, this causes an anterior open bite during the intermediate positioning. The resultant intermediate splint is large and bulky. Not only does this make maxillomandibular fixation difficult but it also can cause the mandibular condyles to translate within the glenoid fossa. If the condyles are not in their CR position as they were when the models were mounted on the articulator, the maxilla will be repositioned into an incorrect position. [Fig. 64.6]

Counterclockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex is better achieved with the mandible-first sequence. First, it creates a posterior open-bite rather than an anterior open bite in the intermediate position. One does not have to worry about the condyles translating forward as one does with maxilla-first sequencing. [Fig. 64.7] Second, CCW rotation is more predictable

when performing mandible-first bimaxillary surgery. In a study by Liebregts et al. the achievability of planned orthognathic movements from the preoperative time point to the postoperative time point were compared between maxilla-first and mandible-first surgery [61]. The study included 58 patients with maxilla-first bimaxillary surgery and 58 patients with mandible-first bimaxillary surgery. Maxilla-first surgery was statistically more accurate in anterior displacement of the maxilla and mandible, but no significant differences in vertical or transverse displacements were found. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of mandible-first for predictability of CCW rotations.

in maximum intercuspation or with a final splint. If the patient had maxilla first surgery, this typically negates the need for a final splint, adequately corrects the occlusion, and removes errors in intermediate splint fabrication

# 64.4.2.4 Large Maxillomandibular Advancements

In large maxillomandibular advancements like the ones used for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, maxillomandibular fixation in the intermediate position may be difficult to achieve when performing maxilla-first surgery because the maxilla will be advanced, and this limits the surface area of opposing dentition for stabilizing the occlusion. This problem is accentuated in cases with mandibular retrognathia where a very large overjet is created by maxillary advancement. This severe overjet is prevented by the mandible-first sequence. When the mandible is advanced first it maximizes the available

surface area of opposing teeth for performing MMF into the intermediate position. [Fig. 64.8]

# 64.4.2.5 Anterior Open Bite Correction

Anterior open bite is a difficult dentofacial deformity to correct [55, 62, 63]. Patients often require counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to correct the problem [64, 65, 66]. When counterclockwise rotation of the mandible is required, performing maxilla-first sequencing causes the anterior open bite to become accentuated in the intermediate position. The intermediate splint will need to be very thick anteriorly, potentially causing translation of the condyles, creating inaccuracies.

Performing the mandibular surgery first closes the open bite and the intermediate splint is significantly simplified. In addition, the anterior dentition may now serve as a guide to setting maxillomandibular fixation. The decrease in splint thickness, increased ease of maxil

lomandibular fixation, and ability to use the anterior dentition as a guide for model surgery are all great benefits to mandible-first in anterior open bites when counterclockwise mandibular rotations are planned.

[Fig. 64.9]

# 64.4.2.6 Rigid Fixation of the Maxilla Versus Mandible

Lack of rigid fixation of the mandible negates mandible-first bimaxillary surgery. Lack of rigid fixation of the maxilla similarly negates maxilla-first bimaxillary surgery. In patients with thin maxillae, there is always the question of whether stable fixation can be achieved.

[Fig. 64.10] Unfortunately, severely atrophic maxillary bone is often not identified until during the surgery. If there is difficulty in providing stable, internal fixation of the maxilla during maxilla-first bimaxillary surgery then positioning the mandible into its final position can

the surface area for the intermediate splint. b If instead the mandible is advanced first, the intermediate splint has a greater surface area to limit problems in maxillomandibular fixation

dislodge the maxilla. With both jaws free-floating the accuracy of each movement cannot be verified and the patient is subject to subpar results.

If poor maxillary bone is identified from the CBCT and splints for mandible-first surgery are available, the surgeon can avoid maxillary hardware failure by operating the mandible first. The mandible has thicker bone and, barring a poor split, will likely be able to have stable, internal fixation applied. This allows for a stable, reproducible landmark for maxillary positioning as the final step. Usually, edentulous maxillae tend to have thin and fragile bones.

# 64.5 Concomitant TMJ Surgery Staging

The temporomandibular joint is the foundation for accurate and reproducible orthognathic surgery [21]. Patients that have temporomandibular joint pathology or degeneration are more likely to have worse function, esthetics, pain reduction, and stability when performing orthognathic surgery [67-69]. Simultaneous TMJ and orthognathic surgery can address problems in the joint as well as the occlusion in one operation.

Surgery of the temporomandibular joint during bimaxillary orthognathic surgery may be concerning to many surgeons due to the potential for change in condylar position. Many different surgical factors may significantly alter the position of the mandible.

Temporomandibular joint articular disk repositioning typically displaces the condyle downward and forward. Removal of tissue from the joint during a high condylectomy or removal of condylar pathology will inevitably displace the mandible. Intraoperative and postoperative edema or hemarthrosis can displace the mandible anteriorly and inferiorly. Some of these factors may be controlled by operating on the TMJ first in the bimaxillary surgery sequence. Another possibility is to operate on the TMJ as a prior surgery to bimaxillary repositioning in order to establish a new TMJ position to operate from.

If concomitant temporomandibular joint surgery is executed with orthognathic surgery (TMJ disk repositioning, discectomy, total joint reconstruction, etc.), attention needs to be paid to sequencing. When performing concomitant temporomandibular joint and bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, the TMJ surgery must be performed before the mandibular osteotomies. The TMJ surgery establishes the basis for the new mandibular position. If the mandibular surgery were performed before the TMJ surgery, its final position would be altered by the TMJ surgery. Even if the maxilla is operated on first, the TMJ surgery must follow and precede the mandibular osteotomies for a stable mandibular position.

Two sequences are possible. The first sequence is to perform the maxillary surgery, then the temporomandibular joint surgery, and finally the mandibular surgery. Assuming one wishes to maintain sterility of the TMJ surgical field, this first sequence requires two sets of sur

Second, the surgeon may begin with the temporomandibular surgery, then the mandible surgery, and finally complete the maxillary surgery. This sequence allows for one set of instruments.

# 64.6 Virtual Surgical Planning

Errors in presurgical treatment planning may occur at many different points during the clinical exam, acquisition of dental records, evaluation of radiographic records, model surgery, fabrication of intermediate or final splints, and during surgery. Bimaxillary surgery only complicates this by adding significant complexities to the ability to move the jaws in free space. The accuracy and stability of two-jaw surgery heavily rely on accurate surgical planning at each of these crucial steps. With the advent of cone-beam computer tomography (CBCT), two-dimensional (2D) cephalometric analysis can now be visualized in the three-dimensional (3D) realm [70]. The software environments which allow virtual surgical planning (VSP) have been shown to be less

time consuming compared to conventional model surgery and in some ways more accurate than conventional surgery [71, 72].

One crucial step in virtual surgical planning that can introduce significant error is the acquisition of the CBCT. For maxilla-first virtual surgical planning, the CBCT is, in essence, the facebow transfer for model surgery. Therefore, the CBCT must be obtained in centric relation for maxilla-first virtual surgical planning. If the patient is not in centric relation with their condyle in the fossa, then the intermediate splint will be inaccurate and place the maxilla off from the preplanned position.

Virtual surgical planning has had a high level of recorded accuracy [73]. De Riu et al. measured the accuracy of bimaxillary orthognathic surgery between computer-assisted model surgery and conventional model surgery at the immediate postoperative time point [74]. Linear measurements were similar between the two groups with  $< 2\mathrm{mm}$  difference between planned and actual movements. Angular measurements were more accurate with computer-assisted surgery than with conventional presurgical planning with 1.19 degrees difference between planned and actual movements. In general, virtual surgical planning adds a greater amount of accu

racy and adds clinical and radiographic detail to patients with facial asymmetries.

Computer-generated splints can be made from the virtual surgical plan and used during surgery. This negates many of the potential errors in conventional model surgery; however, the size of splints and the ability to place a patient in maxillomandibular fixation during the intermediate position and final position can still be problematic. In addition, mandible-first sequencing still requires stable internal fixation. Comparing accu

racy and precision of virtual surgical planning will continue to be crucial as virtual surgical planning continues to change the face of orthognathic surgery.

One benefit of VSP and computer-generated splints is that the surgeon can request two sets of splints. [Fig. 64.11] One splint for maxilla first and another for mandible-first surgery. Even if a maxilla-first approach was planned, if after induction the surgeon identifies that the patient has a different occlusion than that used during planning, one can employ the mandi

# 64.6.1 Patient-Specific Implants

Three-dimensional planning, virtual surgical planning, and computer-assisted manufacturing has made maxillary and mandibular custom plates a reality. With the use of a patient-specific cutting and drill guides, patient-specific implants (PSI) can be used to reposition the maxilla or mandible without the use of splints or maxillomandibular fixation. [Fig. 64.12] [75, 76] Multiple studies have assessed PSI in clinical applications and determined there is a great amount of accuracy and precision for placing the maxilla or mandible in its planned position [77]. The ability to reposition the maxilla or the mandible independent of the other jaw removes the need for an intermediate splint. The surgeon can now operate

on the maxilla first with no need to have an accurate interocclusal registration preoperatively, and no need to assure the condyles are in their centric relation position during acquisition of records (i.e., CBCT) or during maxillary surgery. Once the maxilla is repositioned using the custom bone plate, the mandibular osteotomy is completed in the usual manner. This is not a technique that should be applied to the mandible. PSIs in the mandible rely on controlling the position of the condyles during the CBCT and planning phase. This is not often the case and can be difficult to reproduce, negating the very value of this technique.

Care must be taken when relying on PSIs. First, there is potential for error in seating the presurgical cutting / drill guide. If the guide is not adequately adapted to the patient's bone, then there will be inaccuracy in seating the PSI. If the PSI is damaged or deformed between the manufacturing process and the operating room there must be a backup, intermediate splint available. Without

# Conclusion

Bimaxillary orthognathic surgery can be completed with maxilla-first or mandible-first surgical sequencing. If the mandible is operated first, rigid fixation is necessary. Counterclockwise rotation is often easier when operating the mandible first. Clockwise rotation is often easier when operating the maxilla first. An accurate bite registration and facebook transfer are crucial to performing maxilla-first surgical sequencing when not employing PSIs. Either surgical sequence will produce similar accuracy if adequately planned and executed. Virtual surgical planning and patient-specific implants may make orthognathic sequencing less critical and will employ the maxilla first approach in most cases.
