# 19.1 Introduction

Dentoalveolar trauma comprises a wide spectrum of injuries to include the teeth; periodontium which includes the gingiva, periodontal ligament, and alveolus; as well as nearby soft tissues including the tongue, lips, and oral mucosa. Damage to these structures affects the function, esthetics, and psychological health of the patient.

The epidemiology varies in type, severity, etiology, and population. Dentoalveolar trauma has become a public health problem due to the increase in violence, traffic accidents, and sports injuries [1, 2]. MVAs, assault, domestic violence, and falls are some of the most common etiologies, but there are also a substantial number of injuries resulting from bicycle accidents and animal attacks [3-5]. Evaluation and treatment of dentoalveolar fractures have been well established; however, advances in technology and treatment modalities have expanded the ability to improve on reconstructive outcomes and overall prognosis.

Dentoalveolar trauma comprises a wide spectrum of injuries to include the teeth, periodontium (gingiva, periodontal ligament, and alveolus), and nearby soft tissues (tongue, lips, and oral mucosa).

# 19.2 Etiology and Demographics

# 19.2.1 Epidemiology

Dentoalveolar injuries commonly occur in the pediatric, teenage, and adult populations. Each group has specific etiologies that pertain to age, sex, and demographics.

In the pediatric group, the primary cause of these injuries is falls. Possibly during the first years of life, the early anatomic development and skeletal weight distribution cause the poor coordination and balance that leads to such injuries. Falls are usually seen within the home, and some studies find that the most common

![](images/765e09f8512a3e8d3107207020d152e6a1aceee6fc3a4409d3fa98a884458a70.jpg)  
Fig. 19.1 A 6-year-old child with maxillary dentoalveolar fracture and multiple perioral and intraoral lacerations secondary to fall after dog attack

injury is usually localized to the enamel. Usually the anterior maxilla is the most common location [6, 7].

In the larger surveys, the pediatric population accounts for  $5\%$  of all facial fractures [4]. Andreasen [8] reported a bimodal trend in the peak incidence of dentoalveolar trauma in children aged 2-4 years and 8-10 years. Likewise, there was an overall prevalence of  $11 - 30\%$  in the children with primary dentition (Fig. 19.1). Those with permanent or mixed dentition ranged from  $5\%$  to  $20\%$ . The ratio of boys to girls continues to be reported as 2:1.

Children and adolescents overlap with respect to the etiology of dentoalveolar injury. Contact sports and playground activities lead to most injuries. In fact, approximately one-third of all dental trauma is secondary to sporting accidents [6].

The use of mouthguards and appropriate head gear, however, has helped to decrease sport-related injuries [7-10].

Child abuse appears to be another significant cause of dentoalveolar and facial injury. The WHO definition of child abuse is: "that which results in actual or poten

tial physical harm from and interaction or lack of interaction which is reasonably within the control of a parent or person in a position of responsibility, power or trust."

An alarming census of child abuse is documented in the literature. In the year 2000, an estimated 879,000 children were abused. Of these,  $19.3\%$  were physically abused [9]. In the United States, over  $50\%$  of physical trauma in child abuse occurs in the head and neck region [11].

Internationally, about  $7\%$  of all physical injuries involve the oral cavity, with  $9\%$  between ages 0 and 19 years [10-12]. Children less than 1 year in age are most likely the target of abuse [13]. Signs of suspected abuse in adolescents include bruising, abrasion, lacerations (tongue, lips, oral mucosa, palate, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, frenum), dentoalveolar fractures, and dental dislocations/avulsions.

Signs of sexual abuse can be manifested in the oral cavity in a variety of ways. Sometimes signs of abuse can be seen without typical injury patterns.

Oral signs are tissue erythema, ulcers, vesicles, purulence, and pseudomembranous and condylomatous lesions of the lips, tongue palate, and nasopharynx. Evidence of forced oral sex can be manifested by palatal erythema and petechiae [14, 15].

Generally, adult injuries are caused by motor vehicle collisions, contact sports, altercations or assaults, industrial accidents, and iatrogenic medical or dental misadventures. Studies also correlate adult injuries and socioeconomic status with MVAs being more common in more advanced locations, while interpersonal violence is usually seen in the less economically advanced regions. Similar to pediatrics and teenagers, males are significantly more commonly injured with an age range of 20-30. Expectantly, maxillary incisors are the most vulnerable, while in the posterior region, first premolars are injured most likely due to traumatic occlusion. Intuitively, studies have confirmed that most of these injuries occur on weekends during the months of June and August when people are celebrating and playing outdoor sports or other outdoor activities [1, 2].

Leathers and colleagues [15, 16] reported on orofacial injury profiles in an inner-city hospital. They found that most orofacial injuries resulted from intentional violence and the victims were primarily socially and economically disadvantaged groups in the minority populations.

Black and coworkers [17] related substance abuse—specifically alcohol and “street drugs”—with orofacial injuries. They found that a significantly greater proportion of patients who screened positive for drug and alcohol abuse at the time of injury had a previous history of head injury and/or orofacial injury. Further, we should consider the high rate of

recidivism in this population as another behavioral factor.

Other groups at increased risk of dentoalveolar and perioral soft tissue trauma are those with seizure disorders and animal bite and domestic violence victims [18].

In most instances, perioral soft tissue injuries accompany dental and dentoalveolar fractures. Multiple studies report lacerations as the most common seen soft tissue injury followed by hematomas and abraisions [14, 19]. Interpersonal violence and bicycle and motorcycle accidents account for a large volume of soft tissue injuries with similar epidemiology as hard tissue injuries. However, in some studies, female patients are more likely victims of interpersonal violence when the assailant and the victim are involved in a domestic relationship. Trauma to the lips, tongue, and oral mucosa can also be seen in seizure patients as well as animal bite victims [20].  
- With seizure-related injuries, the most commonly reported anatomic locations are the tongue, lips, and cheek with the tongue being reported as high as  $50\%$ . It has been reported that in admission for seizure patients,  $5.6\%$  have tongue or oral lacerations during their admission [19-21].  
Severity of the injury in victims of animal bites greatly depends on the type of animal, the setting of the attack, and the age of the victim. In dog bites,  $60\%$  are seen in children less than 12 years of age, and lips are the most common site of injury [3]. In recent years, there has been an increase in conflicts between humans and wild carnivores in North American urban areas. Commonly, these conflicts include property damage, anthropogenic food consumption, and livestock and pet attacks with injury to people being quite rare in comparison [5, 22].  
Usually unprovoked, bears attacked considerably more adults than children. In a JOMS study of 21 cases, 6 had upper and lower lip lacerations. Additionally, one victim had commissure injures. None had dental or alveolar injures.

# 19.3 History and Physical Examination

As with any trauma patient seen in the hospital setting or even in the private office setting, those patients presenting with dentoalveolar trauma require a detailed and accurate history and physical. Details such as medical history, allergies, time and location of incident, and loss of consciousness will be important in dictating the best treatment algorithm for these patients. These patients present with a unique potential for aspiration, neurosensory deficit, and potential airway collapse that is not seen in many other types of traumatic injuries.

The clinician should approach each and every patient in a detailed systematic and methodical manner.

Given the volatile nature of head injuries, the forces required to fracture the dentoalveolar complex area are enough to result in closed head injuries. These injuries if unaddressed can be catastrophic.

In the current climate of dentistry and medicine, the onus is on the clinician to accurately and completely diagnose and document the extent of a patient's injury (Table 19.1). Clinical preoperative photographs should be considered along with a well-documented systematic examination.

The examination should consist of several parts:

- An extraoral soft tissue examination paying close attention to neurosensory deficits as well as the possibility of impregnation of the tissue with various debris types (gravel, tooth fragments, piercings, and penetrating foreign bodies such as bullet fragments) (Fig. 19.2).  
- An intraoral soft tissue exam again paying close attention to areas of neurosensory fibers as well as areas of salivary duct passage (Fig. 19.3).  
An intraoral hard tissue examination. The maxillary and mandibular alveolar processes should be manually palpated for evidence of fracture. The mandible and maxilla should also be palpated for evidence of Le Fort-type injuries and/or mandibular fractures (Fig. 19.4).

A comprehensive dental examination—including the presence or absence of all 32 teeth and their potential for fractures as well as presence or absence of dental restorative filling crowns and removable prostheses. Percussion testing of involved teeth will help the clinician develop the extent of the dental injury (Fig. 19.5).

Dentoalveolar trauma requires a detailed clinical exam and proper documentation.

Appropriate radiographic studies are imperative in appropriate treatment planning.

- Consider preoperative photographs prior to invasive treatment.

# 19.4 Imaging

When dealing with dentoalveolar fractures, radiographic studies are a valuable adjunct to the clinical examination. Previously, these studies were usually limited to

Patient was taken to OR for nonrigid splint of dentoalveolar fracture with wire-composite splint and revision of tongue laceration repair

two-dimensional analysis (Figs. 19.6 and 19.7). The exception to this was seen in the poly-trauma cases that necessitated medical-grade computed tomography of the head and neck. In-office CBCT scanners are becoming the norm not just for surgeons, but for many general dentists, endodontists, and pediatric dentists as well. Given the ability to acquire a detailed 3D radiograph in the confines of the office has changed how many of these injuries are managed. The use of CBCT offers advantages to determining best treatment options as well as prognosis as seen in Fig. 19.8.

In cases where teeth fragments are unaccounted for and in the case of significant debris in soft tissue lacerations, a CBCT can be a useful adjunct in identifying these pieces. The role of plain chest and abdominal series still exists and can help to screen for the possibility of aspiration of all or parts of missing teeth and/or restorations [23-25].

# 19.5 Classification of Dentoalveolar Fractures

Once the diagnosis of dentoalveolar injury is made, the injury is classified for ease of communication and treatment planning. Many classification systems have been proposed over the years based on the type of injury, the cause, the treatment alternatives, or a combination of

$\square$  Fig. 19.9 Ellis classification: I, fracture within enamel; II, fracture of enamel-dentin; III, fracture involving pulp; IV, fractures involving the roots

these. The two most common systems are those developed by Ellis and Davey (Fig. 19.9) and Andreasen (Figs. 19.10, 19.11, and 19.12). The most commonly used simple and comprehensive classification of dento-alveolar injuries is one that was developed by Andreasen and originally adopted by the World Health Organization system for disease classification, using the International Classification of Diseases codes. The classification can be applied to both permanent and primary dentition. It includes descriptions of injuries to teeth, supporting structures, and gingival and oral mucosa. Injuries to the teeth and supporting structures are divided into dental tissues, pulp, periodontal tissues, and supporting bone as follows:

# Periodontal Tissue Injuries

- Concussion: defined as an injury to the periodontium producing sensitivity to percussion without loosening or displacement of the tooth.  
Subluxation: the tooth is loosened but not displaced.  
Luxation (i.e., lateral) dislocation or partial avulsion: the tooth is displaced without an accompanying comminution or fracture of the alveolar socket.

# Injuries to the Supporting Bone

- Comminution of the alveolar housing, often occurring with an intrusive or fracture of a single wall of an alveolus  
Fracture of the alveolar process, en bloc, in a patient having teeth but without the fracture line necessarily extending through a tooth socket

Fracture involving the main body of the mandible or maxilla

# 19.6 Treatment of Injuries to the Hard Tissues and Pulp

# 19.6.1 Enamel Fractures Crown Infractions

These injuries include fractures, chips, and cracks that are confined to enamel, not crossing the enamel-dentin border but terminating at the border. The cracks or fractures can be seen by indirect light or transillumination.

Treatment involves smoothing the rough edges or repairing with composite resin. It is difficult to predict future pulpal vitality; for this reason, perform pulp testing immediately after the injury and again in 6-8 weeks.

![](images/13c3871c7bd7d0625b090bfad21734af7199d526731cf0a143f54c9eee97a74a.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 19.13 Crown fracture without pulp involvement. The fracture of the central incisor involved both enamel and dentin. Treatment involved sealing the dentinal tubules with a dentinal bonding agent followed by an esthetic composite restoration

# 19.6.2 Crown Fracture Without Pulp Involvement

Crown fractures are the most frequent injuries in the permanent dentition. Crown fractures that expose dentinal tubules potentially may lead to contamination and inflammation of the pulp, eventually resulting in pulpal necrosis if untreated. Luxation injury concomitant to crown fractures, with or without pulp exposure, is the primary source of pulpal complications following injury. Prognosis is better if the enamel-dentin fracture involves a tooth that has not been luxated because the blood supply to the pulp has not been disturbed, and the immunologic defense systems in the pulp will combat bacterial invasion (Fig. 19.13). Treatment is directed at protecting the pulp by sealing the dentinal tubules. Although zinc oxide-eugenol cement has been one of the best agents for producing a hermetic antibacterial seal, it is generally not recommended at the site where a composite resin restoration is placed because the eugenol component may interfere with polymerization, at least with some composites. A similar effect has been seen with a hard-setting calcium hydroxide paste, resulting in bond strength reduction in certain dental bonding agents. In fractures with dentin exposure only, we recommend a dental bonding agent, followed by a composite restoration. With pulp exposure, the preferred treatment is calcium hydroxide placed directly over the exposure and sealed in place with a glass ionomer cement followed by a dentin bonding agent and composite [27].

# 19.6.3 Crown Fracture with Pulp Involvement

Crown fractures involving the enamel, dentin, and pulp are called complicated crown fractures by Andreasen and Class III fractures by Ellis. Prognosis depends on the length of time that has elapsed since the injury occurred, the size of the pulp exposure, the condition of the pulp (vital or nonvital), and the stage of root development. Make every effort to preserve the pulp in immature teeth. Conversely, in mature teeth with extensive loss of tooth structure, pulp extirpation and root canal therapy are prudent before post, core, and crown restoration. The prognosis is best for teeth with a vital pulp exposure if the fracture is treated within the first  $2\mathrm{h}$ . Treatment requires direct pulp capping for small pinpoint exposures. If a patient's tooth has an open apex and a small pulp exposure is seen within  $24\mathrm{h}$ , it should be directly pulp-capped with calcium hydroxide. Perform calcium hydroxide pulpotomies for larger exposures and for small exposures in teeth with open apices over  $24\mathrm{h}$  old. The direct pulp cap of calcium hydroxide pulpotomy is designed to allow a tooth with an open apex to complete root development. Teeth that have calcium hydroxide pulpotomies usually require root canal therapy along with a post and core and ultimately coronal coverage.

In fractures with a vital pulp and a closed apex, perform a direct pulp cap if there is a small pulp exposure and if the patient is seen within  $24\mathrm{h}$ . If the pulp exposure is larger than  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  or if it has been present for over  $24\mathrm{h}$ , carry out root canal therapy.

# 19.6.4 Crown-Root Fracture

With a fracture that is longitudinal and follows the long axis of the tooth or if the coronal fragment constitutes more than one-third of the clinical root, extraction is generally recommended. However, with a fracture line that is above or slightly below the cervical margin, appropriate forms of conservative therapy can usually be used to restore the tooth. Crown lengthening or orthodontic elevation of the involved tooth may be necessary.

# 19.6.5 Root Fracture

This type of fracture is limited to fractures involving the roots only (Ellis IV). Most root fractures occur in the apical and middle one-third and rarely in the cervical

![](images/19e09e850e5d10e1110081de16cd9c598e971a2731ee18cb1daf686b8ea89402.jpg)

one-third. Root fractures are not always horizontal; in fact, they are often diagonal in angulation. Radiographs taken immediately after an injury may not show a horizontal or diagonal root fracture. After 1 or 2 weeks when inflammation, hemorrhage, and resorption have caused the fragments to separate, the radiograph will show the damage more conclusively.

Root fractures in the apical or middle one-third are usually not splinted unless there is excessive mobility (Fig. 19.14). Treatment of mobile root fractures consists of apposition of the fractured segments with rigid splinting for 12 weeks. The decision to remove fractured teeth and replacement with immediate implants if possible is becoming a more routine method of practice

(Figs. 19.15, 19.16, 19.17, and 19.18).

Treatment for cervical one-third root fractures usually involves extraction of the tooth or orthodontic extrusion of the root.

# 19.6.6 Periodontal Tissue Injury and Treatment

Injury to the periodontal tissue presents itself in many ways. Radiographically, this injury usually involves an evident dislocation or a movement of the tooth and nar

rowing or loss of periodontal space may be seen. The fate of the tooth that has sustained a periodontal injury is twofold. Primarily, we see the injury from the localized impact and the late complication of the secondary resorptive process. The likely result of displacement injuries is the development of some type and degree of resorption. Thus, to better treat these types of injuries, the surgeon must understand this process. This process affects both primary and permanent dentition. The etiology and pathogenesis are essentially identical to that

seen in avulsion injuries, which we discuss later in this chapter in "Exarticulations (Avulsions)."

# Concussion

Often this injury is overlooked because no acute clinical or radiographic evidence of trauma is seen. No abnormal mobility, displacement, or bleeding is apparent; only minimal injury to the tissues was acquired. Frequently, the history of the insult guides the surgeon

to the suspected tooth or teeth. The hallmark to diagnosis is a marked reaction to percussion in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The discomfort is similar to that of a "hot tooth," hyperemic quality. Because a concussed tooth may take on a chronic course or exhibit progressive problematic sequelae, it warrants close monitoring.

Treatment includes taking the suspected tooth out of occlusion to avoid function. If at all plausible, consider occlusal adjustments on the opposing dentition, thereby limiting further trauma to the involved tooth.

# Displacements

Displacement injuries, or luxations, principally involve the primary and permanent maxillary central incisors. The mandibular teeth are less at risk, unless a Class III malocclusion exists. Generally, displacement injuries are more prevalent in primary dentition owing to the increased elasticity and resilience of the bony supporting structures. Conversely, permanent teeth will have an increased risk of tooth fracture [27-28]. The specific luxation classification depends on the force and direction of traumatic impact. Fifteen to  $61\%$  of luxation injuries occur in the permanent dentition and  $62 - 73\%$  in the primary dentition. Multiple teeth are usually involved in luxation injuries [29, pp. 315-77].

# Subluxation

Subluxation injuries occur when there is an injury to the tooth supporting structures that causes abnormal loosening; however, there is no clinical or radiographic displacement of the involved tooth. The tooth is sensitive to percussion testing and occlusal forces. Rupture of the periodontal tissues is usually evident by bleeding at the gingival margin crevice (Fig. 19.19).

Treatment is similar to that for concussion injuries with occlusal adjustments and vitality testing. Excessive mobility may necessitate nonrigid stabilization. Continue follow-up evaluation and vitality testing for 6-8 weeks. Approximately  $26\%$  of injuries with this classification result in pupal necrosis, and endodontic treatment is indicated. Studies show that external resorption will occur in  $4\%$  of these injuries [30]. Subluxation has the lowest frequency of periodontal tissue injury resorption.

# Intrusive Luxation

Intrusive luxations may cause marked displacement of the tooth into the alveolar bone, with possible comminution or fracture of the alveolar socket. Percussion sensitivity is limited, and decreased mobility is noted because the tooth is essentially locked in. A high-pitched metallic sound is elicited on percussion, reminiscent of an ankylosed tooth. The intrusive injury is more commonly seen in the maxilla because of its less dense anatomy and

irregular premaxillary configuration. The superiorly placed hollow cavities and thin floors of the nasal and maxillary sinuses create a formula for relative ease of dislodgement of teeth to these sites when intrusive forces are encountered. Intrusive injuries are the most severe of the luxation injuries that involve the pediatric patient. The intruded primary tooth may be impinging on the tooth bud of the permanent successors in a buccalocclusal position [31, 32]. The incidence of pupal necrosis is relatively high (96%). Inflammatory resorption incidence may reach  $52\%$  as a result of the necrotic pulp.

Treating intrusive injuries depends on root development. If incomplete root development exists, allow the intruded tooth to re-erupt. Continue this process for approximately 3 months. If re-eruption does not occur, to facilitate this process, place an orthodontic extruding appliance. If pulp necrosis occurs, seek endodontic therapy. In cases of complete root development with closed apices, re-position the tooth atraumatically, and stabilize with a nonrigid splint. Then, initiate endodontic therapy in approximately 10-14 days after injury. Use CaOH as a canal filler in this therapy to retard or inhibit the inflammatory or replacement resorption process [33-35]. In fact, use CaOH in any intrusive luxation injuries that result in the displacement of the tooth in excess of  $3 - 5\mathrm{mm}$ , and initiate within 2 weeks. This, along with instrumentation of the canal, will eradicate the bacterial contamination and allow for the repair of the periodontal ligament.

Replace the CaOH filler if it resorbs during the healing process. Arrange for frequent radiographic follow-up at 3-month intervals, and continue for 6-12 months. Perform conventional root canal therapy with guttapercha obturation when signs of resorption have ceased.

# Extrusive Luxation

Extrusive luxations are the partial displacement of the tooth out of the socket in a coronal or incisal direction with lingual deviation of the crown. This results in the rupture and severance of the neurovascular and periodontal ligament (PDL) tissues, respectively. There are gross mobility and bleeding at the gingival margin. Further, radiographically, the PDL space is widened. A dull sound is heard on percussion testing. Pulp necrosis occurs approximately  $64\%$  of the time, and a relatively low frequency of external resorption is seen at  $7\%$  [36].

It is treated by delicately placing the extruded tooth back into the proper position in the socket. Check and re-check occlusion to ensure no rotation has occurred. Then, stabilize the tooth with a nonrigid splint for approximately 2-3 weeks. If signs of pulp necrosis occur, employ endodontic therapy (Figs. 19.20, 19.21, and 19.22).

# Lateral Luxations

Lateral luxations may result from traumatic forces that displace the tooth, or teeth, in many directions; however, the lingual direction appears to be the most prevalent. These luxations often involve the bony alveolar socket. The radiographic appearance is similar to the extruded tooth on occlusal views, with the PDL space widening in the apical direction. Linear or comminuted fractures are the norm. Lingual and buccal plate expansion may render the tooth mobile. Localized soft tissue compromise is often apparent. When bony defects exist beneath the gingiva, it is common to see complex lacerations and step defects. Because the tooth is often locked in an errant position, the percussion resonance and mobility resemble the intruded tooth.

Fig. 19.22 Ten-day follow-up after splint placement

The key to treatment is to reestablish preinjury occlusion. Delay soft tissue repair until this is completed. Manipulate the tooth or teeth back into the socket. If an alveolar segment is involved, reposition it. Digitally apply buccal and lingual pressure in cases of traumatic bony expansion to ensure early PDL repair. Apply a nonrigid splint that is extended to and is supported by the presumably uninjured adjacent teeth. Leave the splint in place for 2-8 weeks, depending on bony healing, which may require longer stabilization time. Avoid the use of

disimpaction devices, such as forceps or hemostats, while attempting to reestablish proper alignment of teeth or segments. Excessive fulcruming forces may further compromise the tooth and/or supporting structure.

In persons who may have experienced delayed treatment in excess of  $48\mathrm{h}$ , reestablishing occlusion may be difficult and traumatic. Consider spontaneous or orthodontic realignment. Continue frequent radiographic follow-up and vitality testing for several months. Adjacent teeth that may have become devitalized warrant vitality testing. Any signs of pulp necrosis should be met with immediate endodontic therapy.

Another complication to consider is the loss of marginal bone support in both lateral and intrusive luxation injuries, which can occur as a temporary or permanent condition. It is seen clinically as an ingrowth of granulation tissue at the gingival crevice, resulting in a loss of attachment. This is the normal process of periodontium healing and takes up to 6-8 weeks. When this process occurs, continue maintenance of the splint, and pay close attention to oral hygiene compliance to prevent further bone loss. The frequency of this bony loss reaches  $5\%$  for lateral luxations and  $31\%$  in intruded luxations [29, p. 383].

# 19.6.7 Exarticulations (Avulsions)

Avulsion injuries are the most severe of the dentoalveolar injuries. By definition, these injuries involve tooth or teeth that are completely dislodged from the socket for a period of time. Owing to the higher risk of aspiration, supporting structure damage, or actual physical loss of the tooth, these injuries require special attention. Old ideology and myths still plague the use of newer proven protocols. Avulsion injuries occur from  $0.5\%$  to about  $16\%$  in the permanent dentition and occur less in the primary dentition  $(7 - 13\%)$ , with children ages 7-9 years being most associated with this injury. These injuries usually involve a single tooth, with the maxillary central incisor most often at risk, which is due to the relative instability of the periodontal ligament during the progressive eruption of these teeth [37].

The treatment of such injuries must be geared toward early reestablishment of periodontal ligament cellular physiology. The fate of the avulsed tooth depends on the cellular viability of the periodontal fibers that remain attached to the root surface prior to reimplantation. Although extraoral time is a factor, newer physiologically compatible solutions are available that can maintain and/or replenish periodontal ligament cell metabolites. Two such solutions are Hank's balanced salt solution and ViaSpan (Figs. 19.23 and 19.24).

Both Hank's solution and ViaSpan are physiologic with compatible pH and osmolality (Table 19.2).

![](images/a369ad241d488df826fe945fcc259f3724bf29d5d44df116456c86a98fcff41d.jpg)

Fig. 19.24 ViaSpan is a cold transplant organ storage medium which can be used to store avulsed teeth

ViaSpan is the solution of choice for organ storage during transport for transplantation. The relative availability and cost-effectiveness of Hank's solution make it the medium of choice in storage of avulsed teeth. Commercially available by Phoenix Lazarus Inc., Save-A-Tooth, an emergency tooth preserving system that contains Hank's solution as its active ingredient, is a mainstay in many athletic first aid kits.

Other methods for temporarily storing an avulsed tooth are milk, saliva, and saline; however, their ability to replenish cellular metabolites has not been documented. Milk is a readily available medium for the lay person, and, because time is of the essence, it is the medium of choice in the absence of Hank's solution or ViaSpan. Milk will only prevent further cellular demise; thus, it is used specifically when teeth have been extraoral for  $< 20\mathrm{min}$ . Any periodontal ligament extraoral exposure  $>15\mathrm{min}$  will deplete most of the cell metabolites; for this reason, a longer period of extraoral time limits milk's effectiveness to maintain cellular viability. Unlike Hank's solution and ViaSpan, which can store avulsed teeth and replenish cellular metabolites for  $24\mathrm{h}$  and 1 week, respectively, milk as a storage medium becomes ineffective after approximately  $6\mathrm{h}$  [38, 39].

# 19.6.8 Treatment

Root maturation, the extraoral time, and the general health of the tooth preinjury determine the course of treatment. In general, early or immediate replantation is preferred.

Teeth that are in poor condition from a hygiene standpoint are generally not replanted. Those that present with moderate to severe periodontal disease, gross caries involving the pulp, apical abscess, infection at the replanting site, and bony defects and/or alveolar injuries, in which supporting bone is lost, are less likely to be considered for replantation.

To optimize success of treatment, replant and stabilize avulsed teeth within  $2\mathrm{h}$  (120 min). Periodontal ligament cells become irreversibly necrotic after this time frame. The surgeon may attempt to salvage avulsed teeth, even if the critical 2-h period has passed, but should be aware that the prognosis becomes progressively worse.

Teeth with open apices  $>1$  mm diameter have a prognosis that is much better than that of the more mature or closed-root apex. Treat the tooth with an open root within the 2-h time frame by placing it in Hank's solution for about  $30\mathrm{min}$ . Next, place the tooth in a  $1\mathrm{mg} / 20\mathrm{mL}$  doxycycline bath for  $5\mathrm{min}$ , followed by splint stabilization [40, 41]. If radiographic or clinical evidence of pathology is noted, perform an endodontic apexification procedure with a  $\mathrm{CaOH}$  filling. The  $\mathrm{CaOH}$  should be periodically replaced until the apex is closed, followed by conventional root canal therapy.

Newer materials for apexification procedures are on the market that decrease the need for multiple CaOH replacements, one of which is ProRoot MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate), marketed by Dentsply Tulsa Dental. Contrary to CaOH, MTA provides a hard-setting nonresorbable surface with cavity adaptation. It provides excellent tissue biocompatibility and allows for immediate apical seal [42, 43].

The increased potential for reestablishment of pulpal circulation in teeth with open apices has been shown to improve prognosis of survival of the pulp and PDL in the avulsed tooth. This revascularization process is optimized by the topical application of doxycycline. Individuals who have avulsed teeth with mature or closed apices and who present within the 2-h time frame are treated by placing the tooth in Hank's solution for about  $30\mathrm{min}$ , followed by replantation and splinting for 7-10 days. Carry out endodontic cleansing and shaping of the canal, and place a  $\mathrm{CaOH}$  filling just prior to splint removal. Final gutta-percha obturation is contingent on resolving canal and/or root pathology (6-12 months). Late failure of the replantation process is manifested as either inflammatory or replacement resorption owing to a necrotic pulp or compromised PDL, respectively.

In individuals who experience an extraoral period that exceeds  $2\mathrm{h}$ , apical root morphology plays little role in the success rate. Eliminate the necrotic periodontal ligament strands manually or chemically in a sodium hypochlorite wash for approximately  $30\mathrm{min}$ . Perform root canal therapy extraorally with conventional cleansing and shaping of the canal. Withhold final obturation until the canal, dentinal tubules, and root surface have been treated with various chemicals in a stepwise fashion. First, a citric acid bath for  $3\mathrm{min}$  followed by rinsing with  $0.9\%$  NaCl, will open and debride the dentinal tubules, thus allowing unimpeded ingrowth of connective tissue to the root surface. Second, the tooth should be moved to a  $1\%$  stannous fluoride solution for  $5\mathrm{min}$ . This will decrease the risk of the resorption process.

Finally, set up a 5-min bath of  $1\mathrm{mg} / 20\mathrm{mL}$  doxycycline, which will rid the root surface of residual bacterial remnants and facilitate pulpal revascularization. Complete the final obturation with gutta-percha. The tooth is then replanted into preinjury alignment and splinted for 7-10 days (Boxes 19.1 and 19.2).

Splinting Protocol and Technique Splinting after avulsion and displacement injuries immobilizes the tooth or segment into proper preinjury alignment. This allows for the initial pulpal re-vascularization and periodontal ligament healing. Several techniques have been advocated in the past; however, the recommendations of the arch bar, self-curing, Essig, intracoronal, and circumferential splints may rarely present with an indication but are not routinely recommended. Each has been demonstrated to violate one or many of the basic splint requirements. The arch bar, in particular, produces an eruptive or extrusive force because of the placement of the wire beneath the height of contour of the tooth. Also, the rigid nature of these techniques will facilitate the external resorption process (Fig. 19.25).

As a result, the acid-etch/resin splint (or variants of this technique) is the treatment of choice [29, pp. 347-50; 44]. This technique fulfills the requirements of acceptable splint utilization in a maxillofacial traumatic injury (Box 19.3).

The acid-etch technique is the only system that most closely adheres to these recommendations (  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Fig. 19.26) Box 19.4).

2. Stabilize the injured tooth in a normal position.  
3. Provide adequate fixation throughout the entire period of immobilization.  
4. Neither damage the gingiva nor predispose to caries and should allow for a basic oral hygiene regimen.  
5. Not interfere with occlusion or articulation.  
6. Not interfere with any required endodontic therapy.

7. Preferably fulfill esthetic demands.  
8. Allow a certain mobility (nonrigid) to aid periodontal ligament healing in cases of fixation after luxation injuries and replacement of avulsed teeth; however, after root fracture, the splint should be rigid to permit optimal formation of a dentin callus to unite the root fragments.  
9. Be easily removed without re-injury to tooth.

12. Remove splint in 7-10 days.

<sup>a</sup>It may be prudent to use a composite shade that differs from the natural color of the involved teeth as this will facilitate ease of removal and prevent trauma to enamel

# 19.6.9 Treatment of Fractures of the Alveolar Process

Owing to the exposed anatomy, alveolar fractures usually occur at the incisor and premolar regions. Treatment involves early reduction and stabilization of the involved segments. Depending on the fracture's severity, use either an open or closed technique. Digital manipulation and pressure, along with rigid splint stabilization, will usually be sufficient in the closed technique. Leave the splint in place for approximately 4 weeks.

A gross displacement and/or impedance to reduction may necessitate the open technique. Inability to freely reduce fracture segments may be due to root or bony interferences or impaction (apical lock). Access to the area involves an incision that provides adequate exposure and is located apical to the fracture lines. The segment is then disimpacted or freed up. Proper alignment and occlusion are then attained, and the segments are stabilized with suitable transosseous wire or a small

monocortical plate. Ensure that the closure of the wound is meticulous to prevent exposure of bone and/or hardware to the ingress of bacteria.

Stabilize teeth that may be mobile in the fractured segment with an appropriate secondary splint after bony stabilization. Likewise, avoid removing teeth that are considered nonsalvageable and that are within the bony segment until the bony healing phase is completed (~4 weeks). Obvious infection and inadequate bony envelopment indicate early removal.

Alveolar fracture may affect pulpal health of the teeth within the fractured alveolus. When the fracture level is apical to the root tips, the vascular supply to the pulp is less at risk; however, if the line of the fracture and root apices are in contact, the teeth in the alveolar segment are at a higher risk for internal or external resorption.

In concomitant injuries, such as maxillary or mandibular fractures, early maxillomandibular fixation is accomplished with a technique that will allow for dual treatment

of the dental and/or alveolar injury and the jaw injury (e.g., arch bars and maxillomandibular fixation). Perform the more invasive open reduction if indicated.

Avulsive injuries will often expose bone and jeopardize tooth support. Aim treatment at soft tissue coverage in the form of judicious mucosal advancement flaps. Consider early removal for teeth without bony support.

# 19.6.10 Treatment of Trauma to the Gingiva and Alveolar Mucosa

Traumatic injury to the oral soft tissue mainly consists of abrasion, contusion, and laceration. If these injuries are not addressed, they can place the underlying bony tissue at risk for devitalization. Frequently, these injuries may alert the surgeon to underlying trauma. The ultimate goal of treatment is to re-establish vital soft tissue bony coverage.

An abrasion is a superficial wound wherein the epithelial or gingival tissue is rubbed, worn, or scratched. Treatment consists of local cleansing with a mild disinfectant soap for the skin and saline rinsing and/or irrigation of the gingiva. Antibiotic coverage is seldom necessary. Inspect the wound for possible foreign body (asphalt) accumulation, which could lead to unsightly accidental tattooing. If present, carry out meticulous removal within  $12\mathrm{h}$ , with care not to further inoculate the patient [45]. The removal process includes a technique that aligns the surgical blade perpendicular to the direction of the abrasion.

# Contusion

A contusion, a hemorrhage of subcutaneous tissue without laceration or break of overlying soft tissue, is similar to a bruising injury caused by blunt trauma. Treating gingival contusion includes local cleansing and observation. This injury may be associated with an underlying hematoma or ecchymotic formation, which is generally self-limiting. Antibiotic coverage is usually unnecessary.

Lacerations are the most common form of facial injury. Gingival lacerations may involve an underlying bony defect. Treatment involves early cleansing and reapproximation. Remove devitalized tissue in a conservative manner, and suture in a manner that limits wound tension. Consider antibiotic and tetanus prophylaxis. More serious avulsive gingival wounds warrant close inspection of remaining tissue and underlying bony integrity. Exposure of any underlying bony defect may

indicate localized keratinized sliding or advancement flaps. If nonkeratinized tissue is used for coverage, future grafting may be indicated.

# 19.6.11 Pediatric Dentoalveolar Trauma Treatment

The poor coordination of pediatric patients who are learning to walk, as well as their relatively large pulp chamber-to-tooth ratio, accounts for most pediatric dentoalveolar injuries. Managing the patient may require sedation and restraint; thus, additional factors must be dealt with during the treatment regimen.

Displacement injuries are more prevalent than are tooth fractures in the primary dentition secondary to the relative resilience of the surrounding bone. Similarly, these injuries are more common in the pediatric dentition than in the permanent dentition.

Treating the primary dentition is dictated by the likelihood that the permanent tooth bud may be compromised, secondary to the buccal-occlusal position of the primary teeth to the permanent tooth bud (Fig. 19.27). Transmission of force to the developing tooth is possible in displacement injuries, which may cause interference with odontogenesis, ultimately resulting in enamel discoloration and/or hypoplasia (Fig. 19.28).

Table 19.3 provides a summary of the treatment regimen.

Andreasen and Raven reported on the general prognosis of the traumatized permanent successors, secondary to forces applied by the primary dentition. They found that the individual's age at the time of injury and the type of luxation play a major role in the errant development of the permanent dentition (Fig. 19.29) [34, 36, 46].

# 19.6.12 Thermal Injuries

Thermal injuries can be grouped into two categories, hyperthermal and hypothermal injuries. Table 19.4 lists both hyperthermal and hypothermal injuries which are similarly classified based on the level of injury.

Of the hyperthermal burns, electrical burn in the perioral region is most commonly seen in children. Degree of

injury depends on voltage, contact duration, tissue type, and path of current. In general, electrical burns are rare.  $70\%$  occur before age of 2 years, and  $90\%$  happen under the age of 4 years. The most commonly involved anatomic regions are the lower lip and oral commissure [48, 49].

Oral mucosal hypothermal injuries are very rare. A recent increase may be the result of the increasing use of liquid nitrogen in creating cuisines. Since the boiling point of liquid nitrogen is  $-195^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , when it contacts with the oral mucosa and saliva, the drop will vaporize which usually prevents injury of the mucosa. This is called the Leidenfrost effect. However, if the tissue is cooled below  $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , frostbite can occur, with resultant tissue damage depending on the level injury [50].

Thermal injuries, depending on the severity, should be initially treated at a burn center.

Table 19.4 Classification of hypothermal an hypothermal burns based on level of injury  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Hyperthermal</td><td>Hypothermal</td></tr><tr><td>First-degree burns (superficial) burns</td><td>Appearance: red, painful, dry, and with no blisters Symptoms: pain Tissue damage: long-term damage is rare and usually consists of an increase or decrease in the skin color</td><td>Appearance: localized pallor with waxy texture Symptoms: anesthesia, swollen, with a reddened border Tissue damage: weeks after sloughing off</td></tr><tr><td>Second-degree (partial-thickness) burns</td><td>Appearance: red, blistered, and may be swollen Symptoms: very painful progressing to pressure and discomfort Tissue damage: local infection (cellulitis), may have scarring</td><td>Appearance: clear fluid-filled blisters Symptoms: lasting cold sensitivity and numbness Tissue damage: hardened, blistered skin dries, blackens, and peels</td></tr><tr><td>Third-degree (full-thickness) burns</td><td>Appearance: white or charred Symptoms: scarring, contractures, amputation (early excision recommended) Tissue damage: painless</td><td>Appearance: smaller, more proximal hemorrhagic vesicles Symptoms: pain Tissue damage: weeks after injury, persists and a blackened crust (eschar) develops can have long-term ulceration</td></tr><tr><td>Fourth degree burns</td><td>Appearance: black; charred with eschar Symptoms: no sensation in the area since the nerve endings are destroyed Tissue damage: damage the underlying bones, muscles, and tendons</td><td>Appearance: tissue is firm and nonmobile with inability to move tissue over the underlying bone Symptoms: painless rewarming Tissue damage: injury that extends into underlying muscle, tendon, and bone Results in tissue mummification</td></tr></table>

# Key Points

Dentoalveolar trauma is seen in both children and adults.  
- Falls, interpersonal violence, sporting accidents, and seizures are all common causes of injury.  
Appropriate treatment of pediatric injuries is paramount in preventing permanent tooth bud injury.

# Conclusion

Since dentoalveolar trauma is such a common occurrence in an OMFS practice, the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of such injuries should be well understood by clinicians. Newer imaging modalities and a standardized approach provide improved prognosis. Given the fact that many of these cases are seen in pediatric patients, preventing long-term disability by appropriate care cannot be understated.
