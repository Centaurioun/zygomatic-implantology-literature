# 59.1 Introduction

Orthognathic surgical planning involves primarily the creation of an appropriate surgical orthodontic diagnosis matched with patient goals. The methods for proper diagnosis are well documented and have not changed with the development of technologies other than the facilitation of communication and ease of data capture. On the opposite end, the technical orthodontic and surgical aspects have not changed much over the past 20 years and advances in materials and surgical outcomes are still related to experience and surgical planning.

The biggest change and improvement in orthognathic surgical planning has occurred because of digital technologies in planning and surgical guide and splint fabrication. A variety of digital platforms can be used to improve the ability to accurately diagnose problems and to determine what movements are required, i.e., computer-aided design (CAD). These same digital platforms are then used to produce accurate interfaces that allow for improved outcomes using prefabricated surgical guides and splints, i.e., computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

This chapter discusses the incorporation of a variety of digital platforms to improve the ability to accurately diagnose problems, develop a surgical treatment plan, and produce accurate interfaces that allow for improved outcomes.

# 59.2 Initial Consultation

# Important Points:

- Accurate diagnosis in the initial treatment phase allows appropriate orthodontic preparation for the planned orthognathic surgical movements.  
Neglecting thorough data collection and planning in this phase can result in compromised outcomes.

Organizing records and obtaining proper clinical examination data is essential for the diagnosis of dentofacial deformities. Prior to embarking on treatment, it is imperative that proper diagnosis with regards to dental, orthodontic, orthognathic, and maxillofacial perspec

tives is clearly understood. It is important for the surgeon to understand that not all presurgical orthodontic treatment is the same, and that presurgical orthodontics prepares the jaw(s) for the intended surgical movements for each individual patient. Therefore, early diagnosis will avoid problems such as tooth size discrepancy, spacing issues, transverse discrepancies, inappropriate vertical height changes, habits, incomplete growth, and many other subtleties or issues that can compromise and destabilize results. All issues that may result in future instabilities or limitations in treatment are addressed at the time of the initial diagnosis.

# 59.2.1 Patient History

# 59.2.1.1 Chief Complaint, Expectations

Understanding the patient's chief complaint is of critical importance. Patients are oftentimes unable to express what their main concern is. Not uncommonly, patients will repeat vernacular they have heard, but they may be hiding their true concerns or shy to express their complaints. The patient may state that all they want is their teeth to be straight, but they have paralyzing anxieties regarding their appearance. A challenge oftentimes is the adolescent patient that presents with anxious parents not being able to express the reasons for presentation. For some patients with dentofacial deformities, the ability to self-express the effects the condition plays a role in their lives can be difficult. A prudent surgical team should develop the skills in communication to listen well and probe in a caring manner to ensure that the patient's desires are understood.

# 59.2.1.2 Orthodontic History

The orthodontic history is needed in order to determine if any compensations have been induced. Questions specific to previous extractions, crowding, phase I orthodontic treatment, attempt at rapid maxillary expansion, and the use of headgear are all important to understand what the true underlying diagnosis may be. History or presence of abnormal oral habits such as thumb sucking and tongue thrusting helps the surgeon and the orthodontist better determine the etiology and prognosis of treatment.

# 59.2.1.3 Age, Growth, Recognition of Anomalies

Knowledge of when the patient first started to notice a particular dentofacial deformity helps the clinician to determine the timing and method of treatment. Certain discrepancies in jaw growth (such as maxillary retrognathia with a normal mandible) can often be managed with growth modification during the active growth

period [1]. On the other hand, primary mandibular prognathism is not amenable to growth modification, and is better managed with growth monitoring and future surgical correction, without early orthodontic camouflage.

# 59.2.2 Clinical Exam

The clinical examination is a major component of treatment planning dentofacial deformities. This becomes obvious when one considers the two most common treatment goals in the correction of dentofacial deformities—stable and functional occlusion, and harmonious facial balance. Regardless of the chosen method of treatment planning (i.e., traditional cephalometric and model surgery versus computer-assisted surgical planning), the practitioner must heavily rely on findings from the clinical examination when planning orthodontic and surgical movements. One must keep in mind that findings from imaging and ancillary studies are surrogates of, and adjuncts to the clinical findings, and must be weighed appropriately.

The primary purpose of clinical examination during the initial consultation is to establish a baseline upon which presurgical orthodontics are planned accordingly. The surgeon must recognize the critical importance of the initial assessment. The surgeon and the orthodontist must "build in" the appropriate orthodontic setup to allow the desired skeletal movements. The patient should never be dismissed and be instructed to "come back when orthodontically ready" without proper evaluation and communication with the orthodontist.

The clinician must be systematic and comprehensive in obtaining data. The following is an example of

sequencing a comprehensive clinical examination. While the importance of some elements may vary depending on the specific clinical scenario (and some elements could be omitted altogether), it is important for the clinician to fully appreciate the clinical significance of each in order to gather pertinent data in the most efficient way possible.

# 59.2.2.1 Maxillofacial

# Facial Examination

Examination should generally start with the face, in an "outside-in," "big-to-small" approach so as not to miss obvious yet important details. Similarly, the facial examination should be performed systematically from different views, namely the frontal, lateral oblique, and profile views.

Prior to a detailed facial examination, the patient's head must be oriented in a standardized fashion [2], as the head orientation has a major impact on the assessment of projections and symmetry. It is only after the determination of the head orientation that reference planes and lines (such as the facial midline) are established. Head orientation methods are generally based on either the "natural head position," or a clinician assessment-based orientation. While there is no gold standard, the clinician must be consistent with the orientation method throughout the entire evaluation and planning process. It is during this step that findings such as orbital dystopia and nasal deviation be recorded and accounted for.

The frontal facial examination begins with the assessment of the facial form and proportions, respectively (Figs. 59.1 and 59.2). It is important to note that ethnic variations exist and must be considered when making assessments, especially in horizontal facial proportions.

coincident with the gonion. b, The vertical facial thirds (delineated by the trichion, glabella, subnasale, and menton) should be equal. The lower facial third is subdivided into two (delineated by the intercommissural line), with the upper lip making up the upper third

Asymmetries are assessed, both for the mandible and the maxilla. For the mandible, the position of the chin point (soft tissue pogonion) as well as the contours of the inferior border are evaluated. For the maxilla, the dental midline in relation to the facial midline (especially the philtrum), occlusal plane cant (relative to the pupils), and symmetry of the buccal corridors on smile are noted. Further details on the frontal facial examination are discussed in the subsequent sections.

The profile is assessed in a similar fashion (Figs. 59.2b and 59.3), starting with the vertical proportions and overall facial convexity. Especially in patients with significant sagittal maxillomandibular discrepancies, vertical proportions from a frontal view can be affected by parallax, and a vertical assessment on the profile view could be used to corroborate that from the frontal. Projection of the nose and upper lip, as well as the angulation of the upper lip, should be assessed (Fig. 59.4). The lateral oblique view is useful in assessing the malar and paranasal projections (Fig. 59.5a-d) because these areas are often obscured on the profile view in patients with prominent cheek soft tissues.

It is important to recognize that the findings in the initial encounter are subject to change with presurgical orthodontics. For example, extraction of the maxillary first premolars with retraction of the anterior teeth will result in the decrease of upper lip support and upper lip angulation, and decompensation of posterior buccolingual angulations could introduce premature contacts, which could affect the vertical and horizontal

facial dimensions. The surgeon (and not just the orthodontist) must take such anticipated changes into account to appropriately plan presurgical orthodontic strategies.

# - Temporomandibular Joint Examination

The significance of the temporomandibular joint in orthognathic surgery is twofold. First, healthy and stable temporomandibular joints are required since nearly all orthognathic surgical procedures utilize the mandible as a reference for jaw repositioning, and joints must be symptomatically stable for posttreatment rehabilitation. The second significant factor is that the temporomandibular joint could be a contributing cause for the patient's dentofacial deformity [3]. Severe class II dentofacial deformities could be secondary to degenerative diseases of the temporomandibular joint (Fig. 59.6). In such cases, both the timing and method of management become crucial in the prognosis of treatment.

A standard temporomandibular joint examination is performed, including the mandibular range of motion, joint noises, tenderness of the articular structures and the muscles of mastication, as well as dynamic occlusion. The clinician may obtain a centric occlusion record at this point.

# 59.2.2.2 Airway

The significance of the upper airway evaluation is multifold. First, it serves as an airway risk assessment tool for the eventual administration of anesthesia for the planned surgery. Patients with severe mandibular retrognathia are generally at risk of loss of airway under anesthesia and may require special precautionary measures such as awake fiberoptic intubation. Second, the treatment plan in those deemed at risk of obstructive sleep apnea may steer the clinician more toward the advancement of the jaws rather than a setback. Lastly, orthognathic surgery may be performed to manage obstructive

sleep apnea, either as an adjunct or as the sole modality. In any situation, the surgical planning must have the upper airway in mind.

It is prudent for the clinician to employ a screening tool such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to complement the examination. The airway examination should include items such as neck and mandibular range of motion, thyromental distance, Mallampati score, and assessment of the adenoids and tonsils. Many of these findings could be corroborated in subsequent routine imaging. However, when there are concerns for airway insufficiency, further ancillary testing such as nasopharyngoscopy, drug-induced sleep endoscopy, or polysomnography should be sought [4, 5].

# 59.2.2.3 Dental

Intraoral examination is generally brief, involving Angle classification, arch form, molar and incisal angulations, interincisal relationship, accounting for erupted and missing teeth, crowding or spacing, caries or periodontal pathology, and status of restorations. Dynamic occlusion including centric occlusion—maximum intercuspal position discrepancy, cuspid rise, group function is also recorded.

The intraoral examination in a surgical candidate is somewhat different from that in a nonsurgical orthodontic candidate in that in the former, the malocclusion is secondary to discrepancies in the maxillary and mandibular position. In other words, in a surgical candidate, the occlusion in situ is not representative of the

orthodontic needs or "readiness." Therefore, much of the needed information is obtained from a set of dental models (standard or digital), as these allow the clinician to hand-articulate them into a better horizontal and vertical relationship and assess a multitude of important orthodontic data. It is for this reason that in a surgical candidate, evaluation of dental models should be regarded as part of the physical examination, and not an ancillary or optional step.

Some of the crucial data to be obtained during model evaluation include the following:

# a. Transverse relationship:

Discrepancies in the sagittal position of the maxilla and the mandible alter the transverse relationship. When this relationship is corrected (via hand-articulation into the predictive class I occlusion, which roughly "simulates" the anteroposterior surgical movements), the transverse relationship could change. Reversal of a transverse discrepancy on hand-articulation is referred to as a relative transverse discrepancy, and maintenance of a preexisting transverse discrepancy is referred to as an absolute transverse discrepancy. In addition to the posterior transverse relationship, that in the anterior (i.e., canine region) must be analyzed. This is because strategies to address anterior and posterior maxillary constrictions differ, and the timing may be significantly impacted depending on the choice of treatment (e.g., surgically-assisted rapid palatal expansion for anterior maxillary constriction). Other assessments of transverse relationship include the Curve of Wilson, the inclination of the maxillary teeth, the amount of crowding, and the vault of the palate.

# b. Bolton analysis:

Bolton analysis involves identifying any tooth size discrepancy between the maxilla and mandible. This is significant because substantial discrepancies will not allow intercuspation into a class I canine and/or molar relationship, which is important for a mutually protected occlusion during excursion. Failure to identify Bolton discrepancies could result in an unstable occlusal setup or unnecessary closure of spaces from microdontic teeth. When microdontic teeth are present (most often maxillary lateral incisors), spaces need to be created distal to the microdontic teeth for future cosmetic restoration. This analysis is limited because it does not consider the inclination of the teeth and their buccolingual thickness.

# c. Arch form, arch length, and tooth angulations:

Dental models allow a more detailed evaluation of the arch form and tooth angulations. Incompatibility of arch forms manifest as the inability to achieve a reasonable occlusion from molar to incisor and is

therefore difficult to detect with only intraoral examination. The arch length can be accurately measured, and associated problems such as the Curve of Spee can be analyzed in detail. Also, the angulation of teeth could be assessed from different angles when models are assessed. For example, assessing the buccolingual angulation of the molars (i.e., Curve of Wilson) could give the clinician a clue as to the most appropriate strategy in maxillary expansion cases.

# d. Interdental space preparation:

During the presurgical preparation, oftentimes there is the creation of "Iowa spaces." These are in general  $2\mathrm{mm}$  spaces created bilaterally distal to the lateral incisors. The goal of the "Iowa space" is to allow for an unhindered Class I canine setup during the presurgical preparation. Generally, it is used in the maxilla and most often for cases of anterior open bites or with the use of mandibular advancements. Orthodontically, the 4 incisors are tipped forward, allowing for mandibular manipulation into a Class I canine occlusion and post-surgery if there is no relapse the teeth are easily brought back into place for normalized overbite-overjet. It is important to note that these spaces are distinctly different from creating space for anterior Bolton discrepancies—the sole purpose of "Iowa spaces" is to allow a Class I canine relationship independent of the incisors.

# 59.2.2.4 Esthetic

Facial esthetics is one of the most central treatment goals in the orthognathic surgical patient. The clinician's role is to not only identify deviations, but also the potential sources of these deviations so as to plan accordingly both from a surgical and orthodontic standpoint. Prior to making the esthetic diagnosis, it is important to recognize that facial esthetics is a subjective quality that is subject to change with time, gender, race, and cultural setting [6-8]. The clinician must be cognizant of these variations and attempt to elicit as much information as possible during the initial patient interview.

Key items in the esthetic evaluation are discussed below.

# a. Incisal display.

An esthetically pleasing incisal display at rest is a key component to facial esthetics. There is some variability in age and gender, with a higher range seen in younger patients and in females [9, 10]. In general, a favorable incisal display at rest for the young patient is accepted as  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  for males, and  $3 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  for females. It is important to recognize that incisal display at rest does not always correspond to incisal display on smile, as the latter is a dynamic measurement affected by how high or low

an individual's smile line is. Therefore, the term "gummy smile" should not be equated to a vertical maxillary excess [11]. Central incisor position and angulation.

In addition to the vertical position of the central incisor, the horizontal position and angulation have a profound impact on the overall facial esthetics [12]. Both the central incisal position and angulation play a crucial role in upper lip support, which in turn play a central role in nasolabial esthetics. The clinician must plan the presurgical orthodontics with the final incisal position in mind. That is, the clinician must be able to reasonably anticipate the incisal position after presurgical orthodontics, surgery, and postsurgical orthodontics.

b. Profile, chin, and nasolabial esthetics

A straight profile is generally preferred, and both qualitative (clinician's subjective assessment) and objective quantitative [13, 14] can be used during the assessment. Elements that make up the profile silhouette include the nasal projection, upper lip projection and angulation, chin position, and morphology. The clinician should correlate each region with the corresponding facial unit (e.g., upper lip with the maxillary dentoalveolar unit, chin position with the mandibular skeletal unit), and plan with the anticipated facial changes in each region in mind. Helpful analyses like the Holdaway ratio can be used in evaluating the prominence of the chin relative to the mandibular incisors. However, knowledgeable practitioners know to only apply many such analyses in the normalized maxillomandibular position (i.e., after performing the visual treatment objective, or VTO) because if the reference lines are used, such analyses are based on orthognathic maxillomandibular positions, making them inapplicable to untreated retrognathic or prognathic mandibles.

Figure 59.7 provides an example of a concise and condensed form utilized to obtain essential esthetic, occlusal, orthognathic, and TMJ information that will guide a working diagnosis and treatment plan.

# 59.2.3 Digital Data Acquisition

# 59.2.3.1 Photography

Clinical examination and radiographs are relatively consistent throughout different centers and practitioners. It begins with photographs that include frontal and lateral resting views, as well as animated photographs

(59.8). It is important to be able to obtain a lateral photograph with the lips apart that will match the cephalogram, and an animated photo of the patient at full smile. Further detailed record-taking can be

obtained with videography showing the patient's animation which also aids in esthetic evaluation; however, accurate, representative photographs alone are often enough for diagnosis. Proper lateral, central, and overjet photographs of the dentition in occlusion are needed in order to make proper orthodontic assessment and analysis. Oftentimes occlusal photographs of the maxillary and mandibular dental arches are also helpful when it comes to discussion and communication.

Recommended cameras were once restricted to single-lens reflex (SLR) digital cameras with macro lenses from  $100 - 110\mathrm{mm}$ . Currently, the new digital sensors that are found in a variety of formats (Digital SLR, mirrorless SLR, digital cameras, smartphones) have the ability to produce excellent quality images.

The very best images currently include the higher-end DSLR with macro lenses but a new generation of multiplatform mirrorless SLRs with sensitive digital capture are excellent. Many smartphones can be used for impromptu images however they are a challenge to standardize the images. Lensed cameras have a fixed ratio designated on the lens which provides for accurate and relatable images over time. That is, if a facial image is taken at a 1:1 ratio all the time, measurements taken on the image to compare to later time frames will be the same. The overall importance is that the photography be standardized and easily referenced if matching images to radiographs when predictive software is utilized.

Newer 3D cameras can be used to match the surface topography of a CT image with a digital photograph. Once prohibitively expensive, these have now come down considerably in price and offer an attractive solution to image capture and can be used for soft tissue prediction but its accuracy still needs improvement. With the overwhelming amount of storage required with digital planning, practitioners need to work with their information technology team or their own software to develop safe, rapid, clear access to the images and secure, encrypted methods to share and store.

# 59.2.3.2 Intraoral Scanners

# Intraoral Scanners That Are Available for

# Orthognathic Surgical Treatment Planning

Evolved from dental use since 1984 with the first CEREC machine, intraoral scanning has transformed the ability to register and accurately recreate structures in the maxillofacial complex. Despite the initial cost, the units have been shown to be cost-effective due to decreased chair time, inventory of materials, staff time, and shopping and transportation. Most clinically usable intraoral scanners are either laser light or optical (white-light) by which they emit light. There are laboratory types of scanners that are a surface-contact type. The technology also can be divided into three imaging tech

nologies by which the light is emitted and received (triangulation, parallel confocal, 3D motion video, and accordion fringe interference) and there are no significant clinically superior technologies [15, 16]. However, with orthodontic brackets in place as for orthognathic surgery planning, some differences in accuracy between scan types can occur with stitch type scanners [17].

Not all scanners have the capacity to scan metal braces and sharp structures well. Currently, the most popular scanners are outlined in Table 59.1. Some scanners do require powder to be applied to the teeth or even onto exposed metal in order for the registration to take place. Their individual characteristics and preferences for preoperative orthognathic surgical treatment planning will eventually be determined by the individual practitioner.

Once the scanned information is acquired, the files are generally saved into the scanners-attached data drive, the individual system's cloud-based server and then these can be exported to the preferred laboratory, digital planning service (DPS), or locally, which can then be sent to a formatted 3D printer. The images can be seen on the scanner's interface, or remotely the file can be viewed using a licensed or a simple open-source software.

The different file types are either DICOM (.dcm) (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) and STL (.stl) (Stereolithography, or Standard Triangulation Language). DICOM is useful for storing, exchanging, and transmitting medical images such as CT. STL is a file format initially made for stereolithography computer-aided design (CAD) software, and is now a universally accepted file format for 3D dental models. The benefit of STL files is that they are easily copied and can be read by 3D printer to print models, orthognathic surgical guides, and splints. The scans then uploaded to the DPS are then merged to the CBCT or CT. Condylar positioning, however, should be relied upon the centric relation derived from the CBCT or CT rather than the scanned occlusion [18].

# 59.2.3.3 Radiography and Other Imaging

Cephalograms (Fig. 59.9a, b) are recommended to be taken with a closed centric relation position and slightly opened lips at repose to allow accurate assessment of the soft tissue contours of the face. Most patients have lip competency in the general orthodontic population and the cephalometric positioning is consistent. However, the orthognathic population many times will not have proper lip competency at rest.

It is important to note that digitized cephalograms are of a poorer quality than traditional X-rays and of

worse quality are the cephalograms obtained from cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans. If a CBCT is the sole method of radiographic imaging, then reformatted images can generate panoramic and lateral and posterior-anterior views. While such reformatted images are acceptable for diagnosing they have not been demonstrated to be as yet reliable for the accurate representative changes that are seen with standardized cephalograms [19].

Another useful imaging for initial diagnosis is the panoramic radiograph  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 59.9c. Although subject to distortion, the panoramic radiograph gives the clinician a quick view of the maxillofacial complex. Pertinent structures for orthognathic surgical planning include

realistic predictions showed that in b (pre-surgery with decompensations) the dentition did not require SARPE or Segmental Lefort. The image in c shows the post-surgical prediction with good transverse alignment. These predictions can be invaluable in surgical orthodontic planning

condylar morphology, presence of third molars or supernumerary teeth, interradicular space, and bony pathology.

# CBCT/CT

Three-dimensional (3D) imaging such as CBCT or CT has the distinct advantage of a detailed 3D view of the maxillofacial skeleton, which in turn allows 3D digital surgical planning. Also, analogs of conventional 2-dimensional (2D) imaging can be reconstructed based on the 3D data (Figs. 59.10, 59.11, 59.12, and 59.13).

The choice of imaging should follow the "ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable)" rule, and for any

modality the clinician should be cognizant of the ionizing radiation exposure as well as cost in relation to the anticipated benefits. A full-field CBCT appropriate for orthognathic surgical planning is between  $68 - 599~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$ , compared to  $9 - 26~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  for a panoramic and  $3 - 6~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  for a cephalometric X-ray. A CBCT provides valuable 3D data that allows 3D computer-assisted planning, which can be especially valuable for asymmetry or other complex cases. Also, 3D assessment of the airway and temporomandibular joints, and periodontal bony support could be done to further corroborate the clinical examination findings. While a CBCT is not mandatory in orthognathic surgical planning, its versatility and excellent risk-to-benefit ratio have made its use routine in many practice settings. Newer CBCTs have allowed for

faster acquisition times and decreased scan times, thereby reducing movement artifacts.

A medical-grade CT yields superior detail compared to CBCT [20] (but with higher doses of ionizing radiation, and with lower accessibility). Ultimately, the choice between CBCT or CT varies on the availability of the technology, eventual applicability, practitioner preference, and degree of detail required.

Newer adaptations and technology in CBCTs have allowed for faster acquisition times and decreased scan times, thereby reducing movement artifacts. For the purposes of orthognathic surgery and routine planning, CBCT has advantages over CT multimodal modalities including a lower cost, a lower dose of radiation, less scatter, better handling of streak artifacts secondary to

metal restorations and brackets, fine cuts, good bone details, and less defects due to partial volume artifacts. However, it lags significantly behind in fine details, smoothness, soft tissue outlines, a higher noise level, lower contrast, higher resolution, image quality, and a limited field [20, 21].

# 59.2.3.4 Polysomnography, Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy

As discussed in the previous sections, certain dentofacial deformities are frequently associated with upper airway constriction. In situations where there is suspicion of airway constriction secondary to a dentofacial deformity, a sleep medicine consultation for potential obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be warranted. This is especially the case if the patient has positive signs and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing during history taking.

A sleep physician will generally recommend a polysomnogram. While the gold standard for diagnosing OSA is polysomnography, the role of drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) [5, 22, 23] has gained increasing attention. The benefit of DISE is its ability to identify the location and pattern of upper airway obstruction in a state that simulates natural sleep. This potentially overcomes the limitation of upper airway evaluation on imaging such as CBCT, as CBCT is taken in an upright state when awake, and tensing of the pharyngeal and tongue musculature cannot be accounted for when the image is taken.

Because of the controversial effectiveness of upper airway surgery in the management of patients with OSA, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that strict indications for surgery be present [4]. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons should be made aware that a close evaluation of the area of obstruction should dictate treatment rather than de facto opting for maxillomandibular advancement for every OSA diagnosis. Using the VOTE (Velum, Oropharynx lateral wall, Tongue base, Epiglottis) classification to accurately locate the obstruction has shown to be useful [23].

# 59.2.3.5 Cervical Vertebral/Hand Wrist Maturation and Other Imaging

Growth assessment is critical in both nonsurgical and surgical candidates, as the type and timing of treatment are affected by growth status [24]. For skeletal Class III surgical patients, cessation of growth must be verified prior to initiating surgical treatment, as latent mandibular growth can contribute to relapse. While no single method is fail-proof, commonly used methods include

superimposition of serial cephalometric radiographs, the cervical vertebral maturation method, and handwrist maturation method [25].

Specialized imaging can be used in special situations. One example is the use of scintigraphy to detect the status of abnormal growth activity in hemimandibular hyperplasia [26]. In such cases where unilateral abnormal growth occurs rather irrespective of chronological age, routine imaging methods of growth assessment are of little value.

# 59.2.4 Determining a Diagnosis and Generate a Problem List

The clinician must organize all the collected data and interpret them in a meaningful way that would lead to generating a preliminary treatment plan. Traditionally, this has been done in the form of a "Problem List" that includes skeletal, soft tissue, and dental problems. While this approach simplifies organization, 2 important facts must be emphasized: First, each problem in the problem list must be accompanied by a concrete orthodontic and/or surgical plan, whether that plan is to correct or accept the problem. Second, each problem and associated plan is closely related to another and must not be thought of as independent steps. An example would be a scenario in which an abnormal maxillary incisor inclination and occlusal plane angles which are identified as problems to correct. Correcting an abnormal occlusal plane (via surgical rotation) inevitably leads to changes in the maxillary incisal angulation (in relation to a fixed reference plane). If these two problems are viewed as independent and corrected separately (e.g., orthodontic correction of incisal inclination and surgical correction of the occlusal plane), the resultant setup may not allow for proper correction of both problems.

The surgeon and the orthodontist must identify the points in the problem list which need to be addressed in the initial phase of treatment. These are typical problems whose management involves irreversible procedures such as extractions and surgical expansion. Failure to identify such problems in a timely fashion could result in unnecessary delay or compromise in treatment. Table 59.2 shows an example of a generated problem list for the case in Fig. 59.14. The list is derived from clinical, imaging, radiographic, and cephalometric inputs. It generates both an orthodontic and surgical list of problems that can be addressed with the combined surgical orthodontic steps.

# 59.2.5 Visual Treatment Predictions/ Surgical-Orthodontic Treatment Options and Communication with the Orthodontist

The orthodontist and the oral and maxillofacial surgeon must be sharing the same information with the patient. This includes what the overall length of treatment time will be and enable them to commit to surgery from an orthodontic, surgical, and medical standpoint.

Current digital formats, electronic communication choices, and rapid transfer and assessment allow for immediate, accurate, and timely communication options for the surgical orthodontic team. The orthodontist needs to know from the surgeon what direction and guidance on decompensations are required. The surgeon requires to know what extractions, occlusal setup, and limitations of movement will be expected from the orthodontist. These are the challenges in surgical orthodontic treatment planning. Much of this can be addressed with visual treatment predictions of the skeletal complex but of critical importance is the occlusal setup [20].

The case in Fig. 59.10 presents the images of an occlusion that requires planning. The patient requires bimaxillary surgery for a Class III skeletal deformity. It is presented as an example as to the challenge between orthodontist and surgeon in determining treatment planning and a visual treatment prediction. The initial transverse measurement shows the maxilla transverse dimension deficient by  $8\mathrm{mm}$  and it is felt a surgically-assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) may be required. However, with current technologies, the orthodontist is quickly able to create a diagnostic setup (like the wax-ups of old) [27]. The photographs in the setup clearly show that the dentition with some dental expansion, arch perimeter increasing, and some dental tipping needs no surgical expansion at all.

The skeletal discrepancy (i.e., a surgical-orthodontic diagnosis) is established from the onset. The production of a problem list with the categorization of the deficiencies, abnormalities, or discrepancies that exist is useful. This allows us to determine the course and predictability of the surgery. It is necessary from the outset to figure out how much widening the maxilla needs. This often-overlooked point is addressed with study models. The

determination as to whether or not a segmental osteotomy or a surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion varies among surgical teams and the comfort involved depending on the complexity of the case. It is also dependent on the orthodontic preparation. The classic VTO and the principles thereof have not changed with the digital technologies XOrthognathic surgery:diagnosis. They have evolved in the technical aspect, but the VTO remains a staple particularly due to its usefulness in the surgical orthodontic communication and treatment planning.

# 59.3 Peri-Orthodontic Mid-Treatment Review

Important Points:

The peri-orthodontic mid-treatment phase verifies progression of the initial orthodontic plan.  
This step involves an identical but more focused data acquisition compared to the initial treatment phase.  
At this stage, the final surgical plan should be generated in order to steer the final steps in preparation for surgery and the workup.

The purpose of the peri-orthodontic mid-treatment review is to ensure that the initial orthodontic plan is progressing without deviation, and to gauge readiness of surgery. The sequence of assessment is identical to the initial visit, but with special emphasis on several aspects pertinent to the specific case.

# 59.3.1 Evaluation of Growth and Orthodontic Progress for Surgery

Growth is a critical factor in determining surgical readiness, particularly for Class III dentoskeletal malocclusion with mandibular prognathism. To minimize the risk of surgical relapse from latent growth, a combination of wrist films, superimposed lateral cephalometry, and CBCT showing the spheno-occipital junction can be

used to aid the surgical orthodontic team in determining appropriate surgical timing [28]. In general, the ideal age for surgery appears to be after cessation of mandibular growth as verified on imaging (or bone scans in the unilateral hypertrophy patient) for class III mandibular excess patients. For Class I or II dentoskeletal malocclusion, surgery can be considered before growth is complete when psychosocial factors dictate. In the case of maxillary expansion, orthopedic expansion might be effective up to age 14 (females) and 16 years (males).

Notwithstanding, the psychosocial needs and requirements of the patient may supersede these growth determinants and close monitoring of mental maturity and preparedness is required. A fine balance between too early surgery resulting in a poorly prepared patient subjecting them to relapse and possible stunting subsequent growth needs to be tempered by performing surgery too late when orthodontic management, patient

compliance, the effects of social stigma and burnout lead to an unsatisfied patient. Readiness therefore for surgery depends on three items—Growth (and patient mental maturity); orthodontic preparedness for postoperative finishing; and requirements for successful surgical preparation and execution.

Orthodontic surgical readiness classically entails decompensation, placing teeth over basal bone, and in a periodontally stable position. Orthodontists must also minimize any excessive intrusive or extrusive movements or indeed even expansive movements outside of the alveolar envelope. It is important not to perform Class II or Class III elastic mechanics in correction. The ideal anteroposterior position with a Class I canine, and proper overbite relationships with no crossbites are the minimal needs for the orthodontist. Given these results, most alignment or leveling can be easily facilitated postsurgery [29].

However, it must be acknowledged that with the push toward a "surgical first" approach and different mechanical systems (e.g., clear aligners, lingual orthodontics), what was once established protocol is no longer de rigueur. Complete level and alignment with study models ascertaining whether a case would be finished in a perfect Class I with ideal overbite and overjet is no longer a requirement and has not been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes. Current approaches to preparedness are whether the orthodontic team can finish postsurgical cases, while allowing surgical movements to achieve the planned facial changes. Regardless of the approach, orthodontic readiness can only be determined with the articulation of models (stone analog or digital). If patients are having the orthodontic mechanics with clear aligners, then diagnostic working models can be virtually demonstrated to the surgical orthodontic team using the software interface used by the clear aligner provider (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 1.5).

# Orthodontic Parameters and Requirements

The same parameters discussed in 1.2c are evaluated during the peri-orthodontic mid-treatment phase. The orthodontist and the surgeon must ensure that the presurgical orthodontics is progressing as planned, and identify and address any deviations. Like in the initial consultation phase, study models (either stone or digital) must be obtained for proper assessment.

# 59.3.2 Review of History, Chief Complaint, and Clinical Examination

The primary purpose of the peri-orthodontic midtreatment encounter is to not only assess the progress of

the presurgical orthodontics, but also to review the treatment goals and any interval changes with the patient. As in the initial patient encounter, treatment motivations and goals are reviewed, and any change must be recorded and factored into the treatment plan for feasibility and potential modifications. Also, interval growth is assessed to rule out latent growth in the mandibular prognathic patient.

Once this has been reviewed, the same procedures as described in  $\triangleright$  Sect. 1.5 are repeated, and any new or existing orthodontic needs are identified and addressed accordingly. As in all phases of treatment, close communication with the orthodontist is mandatory.

# 59.3.3 Establishment of an Orthognathic Surgery Digital Planning Timeline

The preliminary treatment plan established after the initial consultation is verified or modified based on assessment of the patient and records obtained at the peri-orthodontic mid-treatment visit. At this stage, the treatment plan becomes more specific, which allows the clinician to establish a concrete planning timeline. This can be done in a manner that fits the clinician's treatment style.

Table 59.3 outlines a suggested timeline required to create and implement the workflow of presurgical preparation. In traditional model surgery, the lab time dictates the creation of the surgical splint. In digital planning, it is the transport of the material that is the rate-determining step. In-house methods of splint or surgical guide fabrication can shorten some steps.

# 59.4 Digital Surgical Workup: Preoperative Preparation

# Important Points:

The preoperative phase involves acquisition of data for final surgical planning and the armamentarium required differs from analog methods.  
- This step is a culmination of the acquisition, processing, interpretation, and planning of the data collected in the preceding stages.

Once presurgical orthodontic treatment is deemed complete, presurgical records are obtained for final surgical planning. The examination and the records obtained are identical to those described in the previous treatment stages. While the traditional analog method may be changing character with digital developments, the steps and requirements have not changed. A significant disad

vantage as well comes from the cost of these technologies and the rapid obsolescence that occurs with emerging tools.

# 59.4.1 Database Gathering

# 59.4.1.1 Minimum Digital Hardware and Software Requirements

A complete digital acquisition method for orthognathic surgical planning involves the following:

Digital photography.  
- Digital imaging (cephalogram and tracing, digital panoramic radiography, CT/CBCT).  
Intraoral scans of the dentition.  
Computer-based visual treatment objectives.

Cloud-based servers to store and share data.  
- Communication sharing strategies.  
Large capacity data uploading software.  
Basic personal computing mechanism.  
Internet video capabilities.  
A single standard reproducible software collection program to both share and store these "virtual" database charts.

# System Requirements for Complete Digital Recording, Transfer, Design, and Manufacturing

Computer: Obvious requirements include some form of processing computer. With current cloud-based data storage, the data can be kept secure and readily available.  
- Presentation software: Commonly available presentation software can be used to easily and efficiently store high-quality images, videos, notations, and chart information with significant flexibility. All images PDF, JPG, STL, and videos can be stored in this one file format.  
Laser leveler: Most in-office panoramic radiographs or CBCTs will have projected vertical and horizontal lights that are projected on a patient's face to indicate the facial midline and the Frankfort horizontal line. To these lines can be added radiopaque markers. A CBCT/CT is taken with the markers in place and this will facilitate the orientation of the head when the engineers of the digital planning company segment and clean the images.  
Cephalometric tracing software: Virtual treatment objectives capability can be in 2D or 3D. These programs can also act as image storing and higher-level in-house manufacturing o splints can be generated with some computing knowledge. Recently, free online programs with limited capability are available and for small fees, they can increase in sophistication.  
SLR digital camera: A full-frame SLR camera with a  $100\mathrm{mm}$  macro lens with no distortion or recent mirrorless SLRs with super-sensitive image processors are preferred. Handheld phone cameras may be enough to record video or quick photos, but standard esthetic facial images need to be created with proper lenses without distortion and reproducible magnifications (1:1 for facial and 1:3 for dentoalveolar).  
Intraoral scanners: An intraoral scanner is preferred to a desktop scanner (which requires obtaining stone models with conventional impressions).  
3D file reader: While a 3D file reader is not always required if the scans are sent directly to the DPS, if they are to be stored in the clinician's database, they need to be viewed. A wide variety of commercial and

open-source software is available, with a varying number of features.

Cloud storage: There are numerous, safe, reliable, and dependable cloud-based storage methods available. However, encryption of data may be required, and regional legislative requirements need to be followed which may differ across countries and jurisdictions.  
Adaptable CAD/CAM digital manufacturer: Currently there are several DPS and commercially available surgical simulations software, as well as independently developed noncommercial ones.  
Treatment coordinator: Although this is not a "system requirement," a knowledgeable computer literate assistant is required to compile, collate, organize, prepare, upload and download and basically keep track of all the different small bits of information that is distributed to the many members of the team that one person needs to hold this responsibility.

# 59.4.2 Software Requirements for Cephalometric Analysis and Predictive Software

Various software are available that allow individual surgical orthodontic teams to easily create, modify or sequence cephalometric analyses that satisfy clinicians' preferences and treatment objectives. Many of these cephalometric software programs allow the clinician to gather, collate, organize, plot, trace, and predict both the 2D and 3D images and data [30]. Fig. 59.11 (3.2.a.#2) shows an example of one such program. The digitally traced cephalogram is plotted and then any array of analyses can be chosen. This example case combines the Steiner and Wits and Tweed analyses. A practitioner can choose any analysis or create his/her own.

Many software have a free-trial period, and some offer tracing and prediction services around on a per-case basis. There are radiographic services available that can be outsourced for all the digital requirements which avoid the necessity to purchase all these elements in a single office. This is particularly true given the state of rapid planned obsolescence of technologies (in particular, 3D printers) that improve on a yearly basis and whose plateau is challenging to predict.

# 59.4.3 Quality Guidelines: Imaging/Digital Scans, CBCT/CT Acquisition, and Communication Tools

# 59.4.3.1 Secure Data Sharing

Cloud sharing is the most popular and efficient way to share electronic data, and is frequently used in clinical

practice. The advantages of cloud sharing are obvious in digital data acquisition and planning for orthognathic surgery. While regulations for safeguarding protected health information (PHI) vary depending on jurisdiction, several commercial cloud-sharing services can be used for clinical practice in the United States. According to guidance on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Cloud Computing published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, healthcare providers can store or process PHI via cloud sharing if they enter into a business associate agreement with a cloud service provider [31]. In addition, this guidance recommends both the healthcare provider and the cloud service provider to undergo their own risk assessment). Prudence is required, and the clinician must be familiar with regulations in his/her jurisdiction.

# 59.4.3.2 Video Conferencing

Most DPS will arrange for a video conference either through their own interface and secured network or via popular and safe software. Most are free of charge and can be used for other team members including treatment coordinators between orthodontic and surgical and laboratory communication. The ability to share screens and change the templates greatly improves the ability to share ideas and make changes.

# 59.4.3.3 Digital Conferencing Steps

# Steps in Digital Planning Orthognathic Surgery Cases

On hand, the clinician must have records (clinical photographs, imaging, models, or dental scans), and a clinical treatment plan workup up sheet. Table 59.4 outlines a recommended sequence to help with the digital meeting with whichever DPS or self-derived planning to ensure all steps are covered and all three dimensions are examined. This sequence is current at the time of publication and changes according to advances in technology and the development to individual preferences, and is meant to be a suggested guide. As we add elements in digital planning, some steps are changed, added, or eliminated to make constant improvements.

# 59.4.4 Final Digital Treatment Plan

# Tools to Aid in Diagnosing Facial Deformities: Orthognathic Surgical Treatment Workup

The DPS requires practitioners to communicate with the use of pre-labeled forms in order to present all the information and data that are necessary. We suggest that surgical orthodontic practitioners develop their own set of records to both gather and share the information critical in the DPS communication or if the

Detrimental surgical manipulation.  
Poor follow-up.

The table shows that there are errors of a technical nature that can be improved upon and it is seen with digital technologies. One notable example is the accuracy of digital technologies over traditional analog in positioning the head in space [32]. However, not recognizing the importance of this step can lead to critical errors, despite "employing" digital planning. There are errors in decision-making and planning that are operator-specific and can be due to judgment and record taking. The final error is in the execution of the plan. Not included in this chapter are the numerous added technologies of intraoperative positioning and localizing technologies, and the prefabrication of fixation hardware that can greatly improve accuracy. These are covered elsewhere in this book.

The central idea of the table is to allow a clinician a view and problem-solving solution when technical or judgment mistakes are made and how to differentiate between the two and how to correct it.

# 59.4.6 Surgery-First Approach

The surgery-first approach was introduced to eliminate the presurgical orthodontic phase and accentuated dentofacial deformities associated with orthodontic decompensation, and also potentially lessen the overall treatment time. Emerging data from the literature shows an overall decrease in treatment time [33, 34], with stability comparable to that of the traditional "orthodontics-first" approach in some [35]. Despite these benefits, routine use of the surgery-first approach is often not feasible, as there are many difficulties in the

Table 59.6 Recognition of potential errors in digital planning. Orthognathic surgery involves a variety of elements and variables that create a situation which sets up for errors along the way. The actual process from diagnosis to debanding takes years and involves hundreds of steps. The table demonstrates the potential areas of errors in performing orthognathic surgery with both traditional and digital planning. Overall, it shows there are fewer areas for error with digital planning and those errors are easily corrected and compensated and the digital planning demonstrates significant advantages

planning phase that are not apparent in the traditional approach.

Because the surgery-first approach involves no presurgical orthodontics, the skeletal movements must be planned with the final orthodontic outcome in mind. This can be extremely challenging, as prediction of the final orthodontic outcome is difficult if there are significant arch length/width discrepancies, asymmetries, and vertical discrepancies. Besides the technical disadvantages of difficulty in placing passive arch wires (and as a result more frequent dislodgement of brackets and hooks during intraoperative intermaxillary fixation), the clinician typically must deal with an unstable postsurgical occlusion which makes postsurgical rehabilitation challenging [36].

Due to these challenges, case selection must be done with full understanding of the anticipated benefits, predictability, and the clinicians' comfort level [37]. Use of orthodontic simulation in conjunction with computer-assisted surgical planning [38, 39] can be used to minimize sources of unpredictability and to potentially expand the indications for the surgery-first approach.

# 59.4.7 Role of Clear Aligners in Digital Planning

Due to its increasing popularity, clear aligner therapy (CAT) has become a mainstay of contemporary orthodontics [40]. This trend is largely due to the growing demand among prospective patients in more esthetic alternatives to traditional brackets and wires, including those presenting with dentofacial deformities [41, 42].

Although early methods for the adaptation of CAT with orthognathic surgery was slow in most surgical centers, recent improvements in preoperative orthodontic prescription preparation [43, 44] digital planning with

computed tomography (CT) and intra-oral scanners [20], intraoperative techniques regarding fixation and positioning [45], and presurgical orthodontic mechanical support have created a fluid and easy transition for most orthognathic cases.

The challenges in adopting this technology for orthognathic surgery relate specifically to the intraoperative and postoperative control of the occlusion. This has been well established in the use of fixed appliances but requires intuitive strategies that are being developed. As procedures become further established, complex cases such as multisegmental LeFort osteotomies are easier to manipulate and control if CAT is used with full crown covered CAD/CAM formed surgical guides that are fabricated to aid in intraoperative positioning [46].

(59.12). For orthodontists, the preparation for an OGS case differs when using CAT compared to traditional braces; however, this is a technical change rather than an orthomechanical issue for which they need to be instructed.

# Treatment Planning

Important Points:

Several critical steps must be followed to ensure accuracy of the surgical plan.  
While the underlying principles are the same for all cases, each type of deformity requires emphasis on different aspects of planning. Accuracy in the surgical plan can only be obtained with accurate treatment planning and appreciation of factors that affect accurate planning and execution.  
Every deformity, every case is unique but the underlying planning principles are similar.

Two cases are shown to illustrate the steps in treatment planning outlined in the above sections. Case I focuses on the presurgical orthodontic considerations, whereas Case II is to highlight the considerations in planning for facial asymmetry.

# Case I

This case is shown because it demonstrates a surgical orthodontic challenge with respect to the maxillomandibular crowding and overall transverse constriction. The photographic composite and the radiographic images are shown (Fig. 59.13b). The diagnosis generated by both the surgeon and the orthodontist include the following:

Class II malocclusion of skeletal and dental etiology associated with mandibular retrognathia, microgenia, a long mid-face, narrow maxillomandibular complex, moderate to severe crowding, vertical maxillary excess, characterized by dolichocephaly, a narrow facial structure, an ineffective pogonion, and an obtuse nasolabial complex.

The cephalometric and panoramic radiographs do not present with any unusual structures and confirm the clockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex, small maxilla and mandible. A cephalometric tracing highlights the steep occlusal plane, the ineffective pogonion, excess in SNB and ANB, and retruded mandibular dentition.

The treatment plan involves presurgical orthodontics to level and align the dentition over basal bone with extraction of the third molars. However, management of the moderate to severe crowding and the left posterior crossbite remains. Although the transverse discrepancy was  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in a predicted class I and there is severe crowding—a plan would be to perform a SARPE without extraction to gain perimeter space. However, the alveolar segments are tipping lingually and the teeth can alleviate the crowding by expansion dentally. Similarly, the mandibular teeth are upright (there is little to no curve of Wilson) therefore any overexpansion of the maxilla would result in excess buccal segment overjet.

The difficulty is in the presurgical orthodontic setup. Surgically the case would benefit from maxillary impaction and advancement to a more favorable central incisor position, a mandibular advancement, and a genioplasty advancement. The computer-aided surgical simulation greatly facilitates targeting the central incisor position and occlusal leveling.

# Case II

This case is shown to demonstrate how the orthodontic treatment objective is simple but the surgical VTO is critical.

The patient in Fig. 59.14a had previous orthodontics, with a chief complaint of facial asymmetry and cant: "I have a crooked smile." The surgical orthodontic diagnosis is: Class I malocclusion of skeletal etiology characterized by a canted maxillomandibular complex, a shortened lower face height associated with lip incompetence at rest a canted and inverted U-shaped smile esthetic associated with a chin deviated to the left, and unevenness to the inferior border of the mandible.

The cephalometric and panoramic radiographs (Fig. 59.14b) do not present with any unusual structures and confirm cant by the unevenness of the inferior borders, the shortened ramal, and condylar height on the left side. A cephalometric tracing (Fig. 59.14c) highlights the flat occlusal plane, the proclined central incisors, the ineffective pigeonion (negative Holdaway ratio), and a slightly prognathic maxilla and mandible.

The treatment plan involves termination of presurgical orthodontics with the extraction of the third molars. Correcting the cant and the occlusal plane require exquisite knowledge of where the maxillomandibular movement

will be placed. Steepening of the occlusal plane will have several benefits including uprighting the proclined incisors, creating an esthetic U-shaped smile (however it will demand the need for a genioplasty because pogonion will be set back). Similarly, correcting the cant will provide for an even, balanced facial appearance and swing pogonion over to the middle. This can only be performed with bimaxillary surgery and with the aid of computer-assisted surgical simulation the steps show the outcomes are achieved. All elements in the treatment sequencing described are utilized in planning this case.

The lateral cephalometric tracing was used to help determine the amount of occlusal planed steepening as shown in Fig. 59.14c. The clinical exam established the most esthetic vertical position of the maxilla. The DPS helped in targeting the maxillary incisor midline based on the clinical measurements. The cant was corrected by a combination of the clinical, photographic, and 3D planning (Fig. 59.14d). The chin position was established by the rotation seen on the cephalometric treatment simulation, the projection required on the 3D images, and the clinical examination with demonstration of panned movements established one year postoperatively. (Fig. 59.14e).

# Conclusions

Successful orthognathic surgery outcomes hinge on many key factors summarized below  $\square$  Fig. 59.15 shows a suggested algorithm.

Expectations: This includes the understanding of patient and family goals with realistic outcomes clearly defined for the patient. As well, the surgical limitations are essential to establish proper communication and trust. The successful orthognathic surgeon requires essential and advanced orthodontic knowledge as well as the limitations of orthodontic therapy.

Diagnosis: Both the orthodontist and surgeon must be able to produce a surgical orthodontic diagnosis independently. A thorough functional examination with appropriate TMJ evaluation is required. This includes an occlusal analysis and determination of MIP to CO shifting, functional shifts of occlusion, and instability within the TMJ.

Esthetics: It has been clearly demonstrated that most patients undergoing combined surgical orthodontic therapy do so with esthetic objectives in mind [47]. Practitioners are warned to understand and be able to work and communicate with the esthetic demands of the current wave of the newly and well-educated (social media) generation. Detailed facial examination from all approaches, dimension, directions, and views are required. Facial asymmetries and cants need to be determined and inspected using soft tissue parameters as the digital planning most often relies on hard tissue references that may not be accurate. Also, keen awareness of the changes in nasal base, tip, and pogonion position is needed to prepare patients for adjunctive measures to correct or improve on possible changes secondary to orthognathic manipulation of the maxilla and mandible.

Cephalometry: Cephalometry is still essential at least for the proposal of this chapter and method, to continue with the traditional 2D cephalometric

analysis which is important when we communicate and share information. However, it also represents and exemplifies how horizontal, angular, and vertical abnormalities, and possible corrections can be quickly seen, represented, and understood.

Cephalometric digital analysis and virtual treatment planning can now be easily generated through various formats. Some programs are readily available for the orthodontist but many oral and maxillofacial surgeons with medium to low volume orthognathic surgery cases may not invest in the technology. Online resources do provide with less costly alternatives.

CAD/CAM: Computer-aided design and manufacturing have transformed orthognathic treatment planning and execution. This powerful tool, however, does require proper understanding of the capabilities as well as the limitations before its use. The CAD/CAM process is merely a tool akin to a "virtual articulator." It should be an aid to support the diagnosis and plan, and it provides excellent occlusal positioning and predication and it significantly simplifies segmental surgery.

Surgical Plan: All of these steps above are then combined and brought together during the virtual digital planning session. The decision of what gross movements in all axes must be determined before the digital planning session. Digital planning is only a guide or confirmation of what was decided in the clinical examination and the 2D and 3D analyses. The influence of the movements must be tempered with surgical knowledge and limitations. Movements to minimize relapse should be understood. Condylar positioning and its replication intraoperatively need to be coincident. Finally, application of rigid fixation techniques and occlusal stabilizations need to be mastered in order to avoid postsurgical complications.
