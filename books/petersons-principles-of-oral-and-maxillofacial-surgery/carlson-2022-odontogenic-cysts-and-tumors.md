# Learning Aims

1. Odontogenic cysts and tumors are rare entities.  
2. A differential diagnosis must be established for the lesion under consideration to initiate proper treatment.  
3. The findings of an expansile and destructive lesion on a panoramic radiograph should lead to a differential diagnosis consisting of odontogenic cysts and tumors.  
4. The differential diagnosis of the lesion will determine the need for incisional biopsy versus proceeding directly to removal of the odontogenic lesion.  
5. Proper treatment begins with a decision regarding the utility of obtaining special imaging studies before or after an incisional biopsy of the lesion.  
6. The microscopic analysis of an incisional biopsy, or the surgeon's experience and wisdom leading to definitive surgical removal without first obtaining an incisional biopsy, will permit definitive and evidence-based treatment for odontogenic cysts and tumors.  
7. Complete surgical removal of the odontogenic cyst or tumor most commonly results in cure.

# 31.1 Introduction

Odontogenic cysts and tumors are uncommon lesions of the oral and maxillofacial region that must be considered whenever examining and formulating a differential diagnosis of a destructive, expansile, and radiolucent process of the jaws. The clinical presentation, radiographic appearance, and natural history of these lesions vary considerably, such that odontogenic cysts and tumors represent a diverse group of lesions of the jaws and overlying soft tissues. These pathologic entities have been studied and reported on extensively, yet collectively speaking, their occurrence is sufficiently frequent to warrant their continued discussion.

Purely defined, odontogenic refers to derivation from a tooth-related apparatus. Tooth formation is a complex process that involves both connective tissues and epithelium. Three major tissues are involved in odontogenesis including the enamel organ, the dental follicle, and the dental papilla. The enamel organ is an epithelial structure that is derived from oral ectoderm. The dental follicle and dental papilla are considered ectomesenchymal in nature because they are in part derived from neural crest cells.

For each tooth, odontogenesis begins with the apical proliferation from the oral mucosa of epithelium known as the dental lamina (Fig. 31.1). The dental lamina, in turn, gives rise to the enamel organ, a cap-shaped structure that subsequently evolves into a bell shape.

After forming the enamel organ, the cord of dental lamina normally fragments and degenerates; however, small islands of the dental lamina may remain after tooth formation and are believed to be responsible for the development of several of the odontogenic cysts and tumors.

The enamel organ has four types of epithelium. The innermost lining is referred to as the inner enamel epithelium and becomes the ameloblastic layer that forms tooth enamel. The second layer of cells adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium is the stratum intermedium. Adjacent to this layer is the stellate reticulum, followed by the outer enamel epithelium. Surrounding the enamel organ is loose connective tissue known as the dental papilla. Contact with the enamel organ epithelium induces the dental papilla to make odontoblasts that form dentin. As the odontoblasts deposit dentin, they induce the ameloblasts to begin forming enamel.

Following the initial formation of the crown, a thin layer of the enamel organ epithelium known as Hertwig's root sheath proliferates apically to provide the stimulus

for odontoblastic differentiation in the root portion of the developing tooth. This epithelial extension later becomes fragmented but leaves behind small nests of epithelial cells known as rests of Malassez in the periodontal ligament space. The rests of Malassez are believed to be the source of epithelium for most periapical cysts but generally are not believed to give rise to any of the odontogenic neoplasms, with the possible exception of the squamous odontogenic tumor.

In the development of a tooth, following completion of enamel formation, the enamel organ epithelium atrophies to form a thin flattened layer of cells that covers the enamel of the unerupted tooth. This layer of epithelium is known as the reduced enamel epithelium. In the normal sequence of events, this reduced enamel epithelium later merges with the surface epithelium and forms the initial gingival crevicular epithelium of the newly erupted tooth. However, if fluid accumulates between the reduced enamel epithelium and the crown of the tooth before tooth eruption, a cyst is formed that is known as a dentigerous or follicular cyst.

An understanding of the progression of odontogenic cysts and tumors within the oral and maxillofacial region requires a thorough knowledge of the cell cycle of these lesions and an appreciation of the concept of proliferation versus apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Many of the pathogenetic mechanisms of odontogenic cysts and tumors can be explained via the cell cycle (Fig. 31.2). Normally cell division is divided into four phases:  $\mathbf{G}_1$  (gap 1), S (deoxyribonucleic acid

synthesis),  $\mathrm{G}_2$  (gap 2), and M (mitosis). A key event is the progression from  $\mathrm{G}_1$  to the S phase. Genetic alterations, if unrepaired in the  $\mathrm{G}_1$  phase, may be carried into the S phase and perpetuated in subsequent cell divisions. The  $\mathrm{G}_1$ -S checkpoint is normally regulated by a well-coordinated and complex system of protein interactions whose balance and function are critical to normal cell division [1]. As can be seen in Fig. 31.2, once genetic change occurs that encourages the development of an odontogenic cyst or tumor, a series of events mediated by the odontogenic lesion occur that may promote proliferation. Such events support the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the progression of odontogenic cysts and tumors.

Various signaling pathways regulate the process of odontogenesis and three of these pathways with gene mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic cysts and tumors, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK), the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, and the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 31.3). The MAPK pathway is involved in the development of ameloblastomas and adenomatoid odontogenic tumors; the SHH pathway is involved in the development of the ameloblastoma and the OKC; and the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the development of the calcifying odontogenic cyst, dentinogenic ghost cell tumor, and the odontogenic ghost cell carcinoma [2].

# Definition

Odontogenic refers to derivation from a tooth-related apparatus. Odontogenic cysts and tumors may therefore represent an aberrant embryogenesis where otherwise genetically programmed tooth structure results in the formation of cyst or tumor with or without complete tooth formation.

# 31.2 Odontogenic Cysts

With rare exceptions, epithelial-lined cysts in bone are seen only in the jaws [3]. Other than a few cysts that may result from the inclusion of epithelium along embryonic lines of fusion, most jaw cysts are lined by epithelium that is derived from odontogenic epithelium, hence the term odontogenic cysts. The World Health Organization's 2017 classification of odontogenic cysts appears in  $\triangleright$  Box 31.1. While odontogenic cysts are inseparable from odontogenic tumors that may be cystic, they were

omitted from the World Health Organization's 2005 classification and were updated substantially from the 1992 classification. These entities are appropriately and collectively replaced in the 2017 classification of odontogenic tumors, cysts, and allied lesions [4].

# 31.2.1 Dentigerous Cyst

By definition, a dentigerous cyst occurs in association with an unerupted tooth, most commonly mandibular third molars. Other common associations are with max

illary third molars, maxillary canines, and mandibular second premolars [3]. They may also occur around supernumerary teeth and in association with odontomas; however, they are only rarely associated with primary teeth [3, 5]. Although dentigerous cysts occur over a wide age range, they are most commonly seen in 10- to 30-year-olds. There is a slight male predilection, and their prevalence appears to be higher in Caucasian than in African-American patients. Many dentigerous cysts are small asymptomatic lesions that are discovered serendipitously on routine radiographs, although some may grow to considerable size causing bony expansion that is usually painless until secondary infection occurs.

Radiographically, the dentigerous cyst presents as a well-defined unilocular radiolucency, often with a sclerotic border (Fig. 31.4). Since the epithelial lining is derived from the reduced enamel epithelium, this radiolucency typically and preferentially surrounds the crown of the tooth. A large dentigerous cyst may give the impression of a multilocular process because of the persistence of bone trabecule within the radiolucency. However, dentigerous cysts are grossly and microscopically unilocular processes and probably are never truly multilocular lesions [3]. Three types of dentigerous cysts have been described radiographically, including the central variety, in which the radiolucency surrounds just the crown of the tooth, with the crown projecting into the

![](images/7607af51e387aac97ea00537e7838c085ec312d2d1f5919e4c709243a6fcb1c8.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 31.4 This unilocular radiolucency of the right mandible associated with impacted tooth number 32 was discovered when the patient noted a swelling of the upper aspect of his right neck and a panoramic radiograph was obtained

cyst lumen. In the lateral variety, the cyst develops laterally along the tooth root and partially surrounds the crown. The circumferential variant of the dentigerous cyst exists when the cyst surrounds the crown but also extends down along the root surface, as if the entire teeth were located within the cyst.

One diagnostic dilemma for oral and maxillofacial surgeons is distinguishing between a dentigerous cyst and an enlarged dental follicle. This distinction becomes clinically significant when the surgeon considers whether to submit tissue removed with an impacted third molar for histopathologic examination as opposed to clinical designation as a follicle, with simple disposal of the tissue. The radiographic distinction becomes somewhat arbitrary; however, any pericoronal radiolucency that is  $>5\mathrm{mm}$  is considered suggestive of cyst formation and should be submitted for microscopic examination. It is noteworthy that pathologists also struggle with the distinction between dental follicles associated with developing teeth and odontogenic lesions [6, 7]. It seems that odontogenic cysts, odontogenic fibroma, and odontogenic myxoma are the lesions most often inappropriately diagnosed by surgical pathologists owing to a general unfamiliarity with the normal process of odontogenesis [6].

Of perhaps even greater diagnostic and treatment concern is the large unilocular radiolucency. Although most commonly classified radiographically as dentigerous cysts, it is incumbent upon the surgeon to section these excised specimens in the operating room and to consider frozen-section analysis. In fact, some specimens may contain a focus of unicystic ameloblastoma and therefore require consideration of more extensive treatment.

The histologic features of dentigerous cysts may vary greatly depending mainly on whether or not the cyst is inflamed. In the noninflamed dentigerous cyst, a thin epithelial lining may be present with the fibrous connective tissue wall loosely arranged (Fig. 31.5). In the inflamed dentigerous cyst, the epithelium commonly demonstrates hyperplastic rete ridges, and the fibrous cyst wall shows an inflammatory infiltrate.

Most dentigerous cysts are treated with enucleation of the cyst and removal of the associated tooth, often without a preceding incisional biopsy due to their unilocular radiographic character and presumed diagnosis (Fig. 31.6). Larger cysts and multilocular lesions assumed to represent odontogenic cysts that are treated in the operating room should probably undergo frozen-section diagnosis and appropriate treatment that might be dictated by other diagnoses. Alternatively, the surgeon may elect to perform a preoperative incisional biopsy of a multilocular radiolucency to distinguish an odontogenic keratocyst amenable to enucleation and curettage from an ameloblastoma that requires resec

tion. Curettage of the unilocular cyst cavity is usually advisable at the time of its removal in case a more aggressive cyst or an odontogenic tumor is diagnosed histopathologically that is appropriately managed with enucleation and curettage. Such diagnoses would include the odontogenic keratocyst and the unicystic ameloblastoma.

Large dentigerous cysts may be treated with marsupialization (Fig. 31.7) particularly when enucleation and curettage might otherwise result in neurosensory dysfunction or predispose the patient to an increased chance of postoperative pathologic fracture of the man

dible. Some patients who are not candidates for general anesthesia may also be treated with a marsupialization procedure in an office setting under local anesthesia. This permits decompression of the large dentigerous cyst with a resultant reduction in the size of the cyst and bony defect. Thereafter, the smaller cyst can be removed in a surgical procedure of less magnitude.

We emphasize the best practices requirement for histopathologic examination of all radiolucencies that are empirically diagnosed as dentigerous cysts. These include those that are enucleated as well as those that undergo marsupialization, during which time it is important to inspect the cyst lumen and submit a representative portion of the lesion, such as an intraluminal nodule for histopathologic examination. Support of this statement stems from the occasional formation of a squamous cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, or ameloblastoma from or in association with a dentigerous cyst [8-10]. The prognosis for most histopathologically diagnosed dentigerous cysts is excellent, with recurrence being a rare finding.

# Key Points

- Dentigerous cysts most commonly present as unilocular radiolucent lesions.  
A large dentigerous cyst should be considered suspicious for a unicystic ameloblastoma and microscopically examined accordingly.

A large dentigerous cyst may be treated by marsupialization, particularly when a high risk exists of postoperative pathologic fracture of the mandible.  
Etiologic teeth and associated teeth must be removed with dentigerous cysts to provide high rates of cure of such cysts.

# 31.2.2 Odontogenic Keratocyst

The odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a distinctive form of odontogenic cyst that deserves special consideration because of its specific histopathologic features, aggressive clinical behavior, and controversial nomenclature. One investigator [11-13] has historically suggested that the odontogenic keratocyst is a benign cystic neoplasm rather than a cyst, and other references have applied the nomenclature "keratocystic odontogenic tumor" including the World Health Organization classification of odontogenic tumors in 2005 [14]. The evidence for reclassification of the OKC as a tumor was based on aggressive growth, recurrence following surgical treatment, the rare observation of a solid variant of the OKC, and perhaps most importantly, mutations in the PTCH gene [15, 16]. PTCH gene mutations are demonstrated in approximately  $85\%$  of OKCs in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and approximately  $10\%$  of non-syndromic OKCs [15]. The  $15\%$  of syndromic

patients in which the mutation cannot be demonstrated can possibly be explained by somatic mutation of the PTCH gene. This explanation provides theoretical justification for neoplastic pathogenesis of the OKC in nonsyndromic patients in which most patients do not exhibit the mutation. In addition, it was unclear if there was intention to classify the genetically mutated OKCs as neoplasms and the nonmutated OKCs as cysts. Finally, other cystic lesions of the jaws were not genetically studied such that it is not currently known whether these genetic mutations are unique to the odontogenic keratocyst or more globally expressed. Most oral and maxillofacial pathologists felt that insufficient evidence existed to support renaming this pathologic entity as a tumor such that the World Health Organization reaffirmed the cyst designation of the odontogenic keratocyst in their 2017 update [15].

Two variants of the odontogenic keratocyst are well known; the sporadic cyst and the syndromic cyst associated with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Both variants of the odontogenic keratocyst are believed to be derived from remnants of the dental lamina. This cyst shows a different growth mechanism and biologic behavior from the previously described dentigerous cyst. Most authors believe that dentigerous cysts continue to enlarge due to increased osmotic pressure within the lumen of the cyst. This mechanism does not appear to hold true for odontogenic keratocysts, and their growth may be related to unknown factors inher

ent in the epithelium itself or enzymatic activity in the fibrous wall [17].

Precise microscopic diagnosis and treatment of the odontogenic keratocyst are important for three reasons: (1) this cyst is recognized as being more aggressive than other odontogenic cysts [18], (2) the odontogenic keratocyst has a higher rate of recurrence than other odontogenic cysts [19], and (3) the association with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome requires that the clinician examines a patient with multiple cysts of the jaws for physical findings that might diagnose this syndrome [20-22].

Odontogenic keratocysts may be found in patients ranging in age from infancy to old age; however,  $60\%$  of cases are seen in people between 10 and 40 years old [23]. In his series of 312 cases, Brannon found a mean age of nearly 38 years [24]. The peak prevalence was in the second and third decades of life, with only  $15\%$  occurring past the age of 60 years. Woolgar and colleagues reviewed 682 odontogenic keratocysts from 522 patients and found a mean age of 40 years for patients with single nonrecurrent cysts and 26.2 years for patients with multiple cysts of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome [25]. A slight male predilection is usually seen, and  $60 - 80\%$  of cases involve the mandible, particularly in the posterior body and ascending ramus [3]. While it is rare for a dentigerous cyst to appear multilocular on radiographs, it is most common for odontogenic keratocysts to appear multilocular (Fig. 31.8). Many appear unilocular and can therefore be confused with dentigerous cysts. It is clear, therefore, that the differential diagnosis of a unilocular radiolucency must include both entities and that treatment of a unilocular radiolucency should include curettage in the event that the diagnosis is later determined to be odontogenic keratocyst. When multiple multilocular radiolucencies are noted on a panoramic radiograph, the clinician must perform an incisional biopsy or intraoperative frozen section and investigate the possibility of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (▶ Box 31.2).

$\square$  Fig. 31.9 The classic histologic appearance of an odontogenic keratocyst from the incisional biopsy of the lesion in  $\square$  Fig. 31.8 (hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification  $\times 40$ )

Histologically, the odontogenic keratocyst is amenable to instant microscopic pattern recognition. A uniform layer of stratified squamous epithelium, usually six to eight cells in thickness, is present (Fig. 31.9). The parakeratotic surface is characteristically corrugated. The wall is usually thin and friable, which can pose problems for removal in one piece intraoperatively. Epithelial budding and the presence of daughter cysts may be noted in the connective tissue wall. It is generally advisable to ask the pathologist to examine the sections carefully for these two features as they generally impart a more aggressive character to the cyst. The presence of daughter cysts is more commonly noted in syndromic cysts than sporadic cysts, but not exclusively noted in syndromic cysts [26].

Similar to the treatment of most odontogenic cysts, the odontogenic keratocyst may be treated with enucleation and curettage and is ideally removed in one piece, which requires acceptable access and lighting (Fig. 31.10). As such, patients are ideally treated in an operating room setting under general anesthesia. This is particularly helpful when removing large cysts. It is our experience and that of others that a large majority of sporadic odontogenic keratocysts may be effectively managed with a thorough enucleation and curettage surgery [27, 28]. MacIntosh once advocated the resection of odontogenic keratocysts with  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  linear margins as the preferred primary method of treatment, and reported on 37 patients with 43 lesions emphasizing the efficacy and superior results of resection over all other therapeutic undertakings [29].

The reported frequency of recurrence of the odontogenic keratocyst ranges from  $2.5\%$  to  $62.5\%$  in various studies [19]. This wide variation may be related to the total number of cases studied, the length of follow-up periods, and the inclusion or exclusion of orthokera

tinized cysts in the study group. Several reports that include large numbers of cases indicate a recurrence rate of approximately  $30\%$  [3]. Regezi and colleagues point out that the recurrence rate for solitary odontogenic keratocysts is  $10 - 30\%$  [30]. They indicated that approximately  $5\%$  of patients with odontogenic keratocysts have multiple sporadic jaw cysts (nonsyndromic) and that their recurrence rate is greater than that for solitary lesions [25]. Brannon has suggested three mechanisms responsible for recurrence: (1) remnants of dental lamina within the jaws not associated with the original odontogenic keratocyst being responsible for de novo cyst formation; (2) incomplete removal (persistence) of the original cyst secondary to a thin friable lining and cortical perforation with adherence to adjacent soft tissue; and (3) remaining rests of dental lamina and satellite cysts following enucleation [31]. Vedtofte and Praetorius reviewed 72 patients with 75 odontogenic keratocysts and observed remnants of dental lamina between the cyst membrane and overlying mucosa [32]. As such, they advocated the excision of overlying mucosa in conjunction with removal of the cyst. Williams and Connor recommended a primary enucleation and curettage surgery for odontogenic keratocysts, including the

use of methylene blue as a marking agent, followed by a 3-min application of Carnoy's solution [19]. They indicated that resection should be considered for the treatment of a recurrent odontogenic keratocyst, with inclusion of appropriate bone and soft tissue margins.

Pathogenetically, the odontogenic keratocyst expresses cell cycle phenomena that support its proliferation [30]. These include the release of the cytokines interleukin 1a (IL-1a) and IL-6 as well as parathyroid hormone-related protein that encourages resorption of bone [30, 33]. Moreover, the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in odontogenic cysts has been assessed. It is hypothesized that the identification of the proliferative activity in odontogenic cysts and tumors may be useful to predict their biologic behavior. The same may be true of the Ki-67 antigen. In fact, two studies have been performed that have quantified these parameters [34, 35]. The conclusion of both studies is that an increased proliferative activity for the odontogenic keratocyst in comparison with the dentigerous cyst is consistently noted. These results substantiate the more aggressive behavior seen with the odontogenic keratocyst compared to the dentigerous cyst.

The orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst, once thought to be a variant of the odontogenic keratocyst, is now generally well accepted as being a different clinicopathologic entity from the more common parakeratinized odontogenic keratocyst. The orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst should therefore be placed in a different category, consistent with the 2017 WHO classification. These cysts usually appear as unilocular radiolucencies, but occasional examples have been multilocular. A majority of these cysts are encountered in a lesion that appears clinically and radiographically to represent a dentigerous cyst, most often involving an unerupted mandibular third molar tooth. Histologically, the epithelium is thin and orthokeratinized, and a prominent palisaded basal layer, characteristic of the odontogenic keratocyst, is not present. Enucleation and curettage of the orthokeratinized cyst is curative in most cases. The reported rate of recurrence of  $2\%$  is far lower than the previously quoted statistics for recurrence of the odontogenic keratocyst [3].

# Key Points

The odontogenic keratocyst is parakeratinized. The orthokeratinized cyst is not an odontogenic keratocyst, but rather a distinct entity.  
Odontogenic keratocysts may present as either unilocular or multilocular radiolucent lesions.  
Large odontogenic keratocysts may be initially treated by marsupialization, but all marsupialized

OKCs ultimately require secondary enucleation and curettage procedures with curative intent.

Odontogenic keratocysts have a higher persistence rate than dentigerous cysts such that clinical and radiographic follow-up of patients should be scheduled accordingly.

# 31.2.2.1 Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome

The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (basal cell nevus syndrome, Gorlin's syndrome) is an autosomal-dominant inherited condition that exhibits high penetrance and variable expressivity. It is caused by mutations in the PTCH tumor suppressor gene, mapped to chromosome 9q22.3-q31. Affected patients (Fig. 31.11) may demonstrate frontal and temporoparietal bossing, hyper

$\square$  Fig. 31.11 This 12-year-old boy shows some of the clinical features of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome including mandibular prognathism, hypertelorism, and an antimongoloid slant of the eyes

telorism, and mandibular prognathism (▶ Box 31.2) [22]. Other frequent skeletal anomalies include bifid ribs, lamellar calcification of the falx cerebri, and multiple odontogenic keratocysts (■ Fig. 31.12) [22]. The most significant clinical feature is the tendency to develop multiple basal cell carcinomas that may affect both exposed and nonsun-exposed areas of the skin (■ Fig. 31.13). Pitting defects on the palms and soles can be found in nearly two-thirds of affected patients (■ Fig. 31.14). The discovery of two or more synchronous or metachronous odontogenic keratocysts is usually the first manifestation of the syndrome that leads to its diagnosis. For this reason, any patient with an odontogenic keratocyst should be evaluated for this condition and the panoramic radiograph should be carefully scrutinized for the possibility of a second radiolucent lesion. Although the cysts in patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome cannot be conclusively distinguished microscopically from those not associated with the syndrome, they often demonstrate more epithelial proliferation and daughter cyst formation in the cyst wall.

The treatment of the odontogenic keratocyst in patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome can be difficult owing to the large number of "recurrences" in these patients. As a matter of point, we choose to

of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. The father had previously undergone the removal of multiple odontogenic keratocysts of the anterior maxilla

refer to these "recurrences" as new primary cysts owing to the autosomal-dominant penetrance of the syndrome and cyst development. It is certainly possible that many of these cysts represent true persistences, particularly considering how common it can be to incompletely remove rests of the dental lamina when enucleating an odontogenic keratocyst, especially when not removing the overlying oral mucosa. Whatever the mechanism, a resection hardly seems to be warranted when managing a syndromic cyst. Marsupialization is a more desirable procedure (Fig. 31.15) and has been shown to result in complete resolution of the sporadic cyst, with no histologic signs of cystic remnants, daughter cysts, or budding of the basal layer of the epithelium [36]. Although all of the eight cases in the series by Pogrel and Jordan were sporadic cysts [36], a similar approach to syndrome patients with odontogenic keratocysts that had been operated on multiple times has been performed with success in a small sample size [27]. Practically speaking, the marsupialization procedure should be undertaken with the intention of ultimately surgically removing a smaller odontogenic keratocyst once radiographs demonstrate a significant decrease in the size of the cyst (Fig. 31.15).

# Tips

A 14 French red rubber catheter represents the ideal mechanism for decompression of an odontogenic cyst. The catheter is pliable, well tolerated by surrounding oral mucosa, and of sufficient size to permit shrinkage of the cyst in preparation for future enucleation and curettage surgery.

Carlson et al. [26] performed a study of 16 patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome for whom 49 OKCs were treated with 61 procedures. These 16 patients presented with 32 OKCs at the time of their original diagnosis, 19 of which were located in the mandible and 13 of which were diagnosed in the maxilla. Of the 19 presenting mandibular OKCs, 12 were treated with primary enucleation and curettage surgeries and six were treated with marsupialization followed by secondary enucleation and curettage surgeries. Of the 13 OKCs diagnosed in the maxilla, seven were treated with enucleation and curettage and six were treated with marsupialization and secondary enucleation and curettage. Of the 19 primary enucleation and curettage procedures, 15 cysts showed

no persistence of disease and four cysts showed persistence thereby requiring repeat enucleation and curettage. One patient demonstrated persistence following repeat enucleation and curettage surgery and required a third enucleation and curettage surgery. Secondary enucleation and curettage following primary marsupialization of 12 OKCs resulted in no cases of persistent disease. Thirteen new primary OKCs were identified during the study period, all were treated with enucleation and curettage surgeries, and no persistent cysts developed. Microscopic analysis of the 32 presenting or new primary cysts showed daughter cysts in 25 cases. Thirty of the 48  $(62.5\%)$  total enucleation and curettage specimens revealed daughter cysts. Eleven of the 12 marsupialization procedures included an incisional biopsy and five OKCs were diagnosed with daughter cysts  $(46\%)$ . Of the five OKCs with daughter cysts, only one OKC no longer demonstrated daughter cysts at the time of secondary

enucleation and curettage. The 5-year disease-free estimate after primary enucleation and curettage was  $86\%$  (95% confidence interval, 74.8-97.4). The 5-year disease-free estimate after marsupialization with secondary enucleation and curettage was  $100\%$ .

# Key Points

- Nevoid basal cell carcinoma is highly penetrated due to its autosomal-dominant character, but variably expressed.  
- Offspring of patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma should undergo an MRI of the brain at age 2 to disclose a possible medulloblastoma and a panoramic radiograph by age 5 to investigate for odontogenic keratocysts.  
Patients with two or more synchronous or metachronous odontogenic keratocysts should be evaluated for nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.

# 31.2.3 Glandular Odontogenic Cyst

The glandular odontogenic cyst is a rare and recently described cyst of the jaws that is capable of aggressive behavior and recurrence. Although it is generally accepted as being of odontogenic origin, it shows glandular or salivary features that seem to point to the pluripotentiality of odontogenic epithelium as cuboidal/ columnar cells, mucin production, and cilia are noted in these cysts. Glandular odontogenic cysts occur most commonly in middle-aged adults, with a mean age of 49 years at the time of diagnosis [3]. Eighty percent of cases occur in the mandible [30], and a strong predilection for the anterior region of the jaws has been reported, with many mandibular lesions crossing the midline (Fig. 31.16). These cysts may appear either unilocular or multilocular radiographically.

There is a histologic similarity between the glandular odontogenic cyst and the predominantly cystic intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma. However, the epithelial lining of the glandular odontogenic cyst is typically thinner and does not show evidence of the more solid or microcystic epithelial proliferations seen in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (Fig. 31.17). Waldron and Koh reviewed the similarities between the two lesions and concluded that it is entirely possible that some cases previously diagnosed as central mucoepidermoid tumors may be reclassified as examples of glandular odontogenic cysts [37].

Most glandular odontogenic cysts are treated with enucleation and curettage (Fig. 31.18). Some authors, however, point to a recurrence rate of approximately  $30\%$  and therefore recommend resection [38].

tion procedure permitted effective decrease in the size of the cyst c, d that permitted retention of the teeth and removal of the smaller, residual cyst after 9 months

The glandular odontogenic cyst can be mistaken for a central mucoepidermoid carcinoma and a central mucoepidermoid carcinoma may be incorrectly diagnosed as a glandular odontogenic cyst. Either diagnosis of an anterior mandibular lesion should be

reviewed by a pathologist who specializes in oral and maxillofacial pathology. Stated differently, the diagnosis of glandular odontogenic cyst must be established cautiously to avoid misdiagnosing and mistreating a central mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

# 31.2.4 Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst

The calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC), or Gorlin's cyst, is an uncommon lesion that demonstrates considerable histopathologic diversity and variable clinical behavior.

Although designated as a cyst, some investigators provide evidence for subclassification as a neoplasm as well [39, 40]. This notwithstanding, the WHO proclaims this entity as a cyst in its 2017 classification [4]. In addition, the COC may be associated with odontogenic tumors, most commonly the odontoma. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors and ameloblastomas have also been associated with the COC. Ghost cell keratinization, the characteristic microscopic feature of this cyst, is also a defining feature of the cutaneous lesion known as the calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe or pilomatrixoma. The World Health Organization's 2017 classification of odontogenic tumors, cysts, and allied lesions groups the COC and all its variants as an odontogenic cyst (▶ Box 31.1). The commentary on the World Health Organization's second edition by Kramer, Pindborg, and Shear pointed out that some COCs appear to be nonneoplastic, but others show an infiltrative pattern of growth [41]. They further indicated that more experience with the COC may provide reliable criteria for their reclassification. The review by Hong and colleagues designated 79 of 92 cases of COC as cysts with the remaining 13 cases being neoplastic in nature [39].

The COC is predominantly an intraosseous lesion, although  $13 - 30\%$  of reported cases occur as peripheral lesions [3]. Both the peripheral and central lesions occur with about equal frequency in the maxilla and mandible. There appears to be a predilection for the incisor and canine areas. Patients range in age from infant to elderly, with a mean age of occurrence of about 30 years. COCs that are associated with odontomas tend to occur in younger patients, with a mean age of 17 years [3]. The more rare neoplastic variant of the COC appears to occur in elderly patients. Most COCs appear radiographically as unilocular well-defined lesions (Fig. 31.19). The radiopaque structures within the lesions have been described as either irregular calcifications or tooth-like densities.

The standard treatment for the COC is enucleation and curettage (Fig. 31.20). A limited number of recurrences have been reported after such treatment. When a COC is associated with another recognized odontogenic tumor such as an ameloblastoma, the treatment and prognosis are likely to be the same as for the associated tumor. Although only a few cases have been reported [40], a carcinoma arising in a COC may occur. One such reported case resulted in multiple pulmonary metastases and was referred to as an odontogenic ghost cell carcinoma by the authors [42]. It has not been demonstrated whether the malignant COC arose from previously benign lesions and, if so, whether that precursor was the cystic or neoplastic type. The rare neoplastic variant of the COC should be treated with resection (Fig. 31.21).

# Key Points

The calcifying odontogenic cyst should be considered on a differential diagnosis of a mixed radiolucent/radiopaque lesion of the jaws.

# 31.3 Odontogenic Tumors

Odontogenic tumors comprise a complex group of lesions of great importance to oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Many of these lesions are true tumors, whereas some are hamartomas, and the lesions are disproportionately benign (▶ Box 31.3). Like normal odontogenesis, odontogenic tumors demonstrate varying inductive interactions between odontogenic epithelium and odontogenic ectomesenchyme. This ectomesenchyme was formerly referred to as mesenchyme because it was thought to be derived from the mesodermal layer of the embryo. It is now accepted that this tissue differentiates from the ectodermal layer in the cephalic portion of the embryo; hence, the designation ectomesenchyme. This notwithstanding, the use of these terms in the 2005 classification has been discarded in the 2017 classification of odontogenic tumors.

The frequency of odontogenic tumors seems to be geographically determined (Table 31.1). Studies from North America seem to indicate that odontogenic tumors represent approximately  $1\%$  of all accessions in oral pathology laboratories [43, 44], whereas African studies have a much higher incidence of odontogenic tumors [45-50]. Moreover, the ameloblastoma is more commonly encountered in African and other underdeveloped countries than in North America.

the combined total of all other odontogenic tumors. These tumors may arise from rests of the dental lamina, a developing enamel organ, the epithelial lining of an odontogenic cyst, or the basal cells of the oral mucosa [3]. The ameloblastoma, classified by the WHO in their 2005 classification as solid/multicystic, desmoplastic, unicycstic, and extraosseous/peripheral types is now narrowed to conventional, unicycstic, and extraosseous/peripheral types. The adjective solid/multicystic for the conventional ameloblastoma was deleted because it has no biologic significance and can lead to confusion with unicycstic ameloblastoma [15]. The desmoplastic ameloblastoma was reclassified as a histologic subtype rather than a distinct clinicopathologic entity. Despite its unique clinical and radiographic features, the behavior of the desmoplastic ameloblastoma is noted to be identical to any conventional ameloblastoma [15]. According to the 2005 classification, often still utilized by some surgeons unfamiliar with the 2017 classification, an analysis of the international literature showed 3677 cases of ameloblastoma of which  $92\%$  were solid or multicystic,  $6\%$  were unicystic, and  $2\%$  were peripheral [51].

The year 2014 represented a change in our understanding of the ameloblastoma, particularly regarding the identification of highly recurrent somatic, activating mutations in the signaling pathways of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Hedgehog [15]. These two pathways are important as mutations in MAPK components (BRAF, KRAS, and FGFR2) have been identified in benign and malignant tumors [15]. Within the MAPK pathway, BRAF has the role of a serine-threonine kinase. The V600E mutation is the most frequent type and has been demonstrated in many human cancers including melanoma, hairy cell leukemia, papillary thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer [52]. The incidence of the BRAFV600E mutation ranges from  $43\%$  [53] to  $82\%$  [54] in ameloblastomas with a combined frequency of all studies of  $59\%$  [15]. The SMO mutation in ameloblastoma has been found between  $17\%$  [55] and  $39\%$  [53] with a combined incidence of  $22\%$  [15]. BRAFV600E mutations and SMO mutations have demonstrated mutual exclusivity except in two cases suggesting that the genetic alterations may define two independent genetic etiologies for ameloblastoma [15]. Knowledge regarding the activated molecular pathways conjures targeted therapy opportunities in the adjuvant setting or as definitive therapy. It has been demonstrated in the AM-1 ameloblastoma cell line, associated with the BRAFV600E mutation, that the abnormally activated MAPK pathway has been abolished by pharmacological inhibition of BRAF [55].

# 31.3.1.1 Ameloblastoma

This variant of the ameloblastoma, occasionally referred to as the conventional ameloblastoma, and formerly referred to as the solid/multicystic ameloblastoma, is encountered in patients over a wide age range [56]. It is rare in children in their first decade of life and relatively uncommon in the second decade [57]. The tumor shows a relatively equal rate of occurrence in the third through seventh decades. There is no gender predilection, and racial predilection is most controversial. About  $85\%$  of this variant of the ameloblastoma occurs in the mandible, most commonly in the molar/ramus region [58]. About  $15\%$  of these ameloblastomas occur in the maxilla, usually in the posterior regions [59-62]. A painless expansion of the jaws is the most common clinical presentation; neurosensory changes are uncommon, even with large tumors (Fig. 31.22). Slow growth is the rule, with untreated tumors leading to substantial facial disfigurement (Fig. 31.23) [63].

The most common radiographic feature of the ameloblastoma is that of a multilocular radiolucency. Buccal and lingual cortical expansion is common, frequently to the point of perforation. Resorption of adjacent tooth roots is common. Histologic patterns include follicular, in which the stellate reticulum is located within the center of the odontogenic island (Fig. 31.24); plexiform, in which the stellate reticulum is located outside of the odontogenic rest; acanthomatous, in which squamous differentiation of the odontogenic epithelium is present; granular cell, in which the tumor islands exhibit cells that demonstrate abundant granular eosinophilic cyto

plasm; desmoplastic owing to extremely dense collagenized stroma that supports the tumor; and the least common basal cell variant, in which nests of uniform basaloid cells are present, with a strong resemblance to basal cell carcinoma. In this latter tumor stellate reticulum is not present in the central portions of the nests. One additional exception surrounds the desmoplastic variant, which is generally not a radiolucent tumor radiographically owing to its high content of collagenized stroma.

Pathogenetically, the proliferative capacity of ameloblastomas has been studied. As might be assumed, the recurrent ameloblastoma is associated with the highest number of PCNA-positive cells, followed by the previously unoperated ameloblastomas [35]. The nuclear PCNA positivity of the unicycstic ameloblastoma was notably lower than the positivity of the conventional ameloblastoma [35]. Other cell cycle features supporting the aggressive behavior of the ameloblastoma include the overexpression of  $BCL2$  and  $BCLX$ , as well as the expression of IL-1 and IL-6 [64].

The ameloblastoma continues to be a subject of fascination in the international literature. Unfortunately, although most agree that aggressive treatment is essential for cure of this tumor, an historical review of the international literature reveals that a consensus has not been reached on the biologic behavior of this neoplasm and how best to treat it [65]. The literature is therefore paradoxically a source of both information and misinformation. Conflicting opinion, extending backward in time, has served both to educate and to confuse, and it has been

left to generations of surgeons to sift and interpret what they consider to be clinically valid. It is our strong opinion that this neoplasm is both highly aggressive and curable [66, 67]. This notwithstanding, numerous methods of treatment have been recommended, ranging from simple enucleation and curettage to resection [68-74]. The conventional ameloblastoma tends to infiltrate between intact cancellous bone trabeculae at the periphery of the tumor before bone resorption becomes radiographically evident. Therefore, the actual margin of the tumor often

extends beyond its apparent radiographic or clinical margin [75]. Attempts to remove the tumor by curettage, therefore, predictably leave behind small islands of tumor within the bone, which are later determined to be recurrent disease. These must be realized as persistent disease as the tumor was never completely removed from the outset. When a small burden of tumor is left behind, it may be decades before this persistent disease becomes clinically and radiographically evident, and long after a surgeon falsely proclaimed the patient to be cured.

$\square$  Fig. 31.24 The incisional biopsy of the patient in  $\square$  Fig. 31.22 shows follicular variant of the conventional ameloblastoma (hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification  $\times 60$ )

Owing to the highly infiltrative and aggressive nature of the conventional ameloblastoma, we recommend resection of the tumor with  $1.0\mathrm{-cm}$  linear bony margins (Fig. 31.25a). This linear bony margin should be confirmed by intraoperative specimen radiographs (Fig. 31.25b). Soft tissue margins are best managed according to the anatomic barrier margin principles whereby one uninvolved surrounding anatomic barrier is sacrificed on the periphery of the specimen [76]. When all soft and hard tissue margins are histologically negative, the patient is likely to be cured of this neoplasm. Unfortunately, any less aggressive treatment modality may be fraught with inevitable persistence discovered at variable times postoperatively [77]. Moreover, although the persistent and occasionally nonresectable ameloblastoma is radiosensitive, once this tumor defies curative surgical therapy, radiation is of questionable use in salvaging these patients [78-80]. Shatkin and Hoffmeister

[81] have aptly condemned the utility and performance of conservative curettage of the ameloblastoma indicating that its justification is an illusion that is often dispelled by the disfigurement and occasionally the death of the patient.

One very important question that has surfaced in the literature is whether or not the conventional ameloblastoma is malignant. Discussions by Willis [82] and Carr and Halperin [83] exemplify this debate. Willis stated that attempts to distinguish between benign and malignant ameloblastoma are futile in that they are all malignant in that they are locally invasive and prone to recur. Carr and Halperin [83] stated that malignant and benign are poor terms when applied generally to the ameloblastoma. Furthermore, they stated that the use of one term versus the other seems secondary to an understanding of how the tumor may behave and to an approach to treatment based upon this understanding. Gold justified his belief that all ameloblastomas are malignant in drawing an analogy between basal cell carcinoma of skin and the ameloblastoma [84]. He indicated that the basal cell carcinoma is slow growing, infiltrative, capable of great destruction of soft tissue and bone, recurrent when not completely eradicated, capable of invading vital structures, seldom metastatic but capable of metastasis, presenting as various histologic patterns, and arising from the epithelial skin surface and skin adnexa. He rationalized that one would be describing the ameloblastoma if one substitutes oral epithelium for skin surface and dental lamina/enamel organ for skin adnexa. Despite his argument, Gold lamented that the long-held traditional belief that the ameloblastoma is benign will be difficult to reverse. Finally, as agreed by most surgeons and pathologists, the ameloblastoma is distinctly aggressive, infiltrative, and unpredictable in its behavior.

# Key Points

The conventional ameloblastoma is paradoxically slow growing but aggressive.  
The conventional ameloblastoma must be treated with resection observing 1-cm linear margins in bone regardless of its size or location in the jaws.  
The conventional ameloblastoma persists at variable times following subtherapeutic conservative therapy. Decades can be required for persistent disease to be noted clinically and radiographically, and long after the patient might have been falsely proclaimed cured.

# 31.3.1.2 Unicystic Ameloblastoma

In 1970, Vickers and Gorlin published their findings regarding the histologic alterations associated with neoplastic transformation of ameloblastomatous epithelium [85]. These histologic changes were (1) hyperchromatism of basal cell nuclei of the epithelium lining the cystic cavities, (2) palisading and polarization of basal cell nuclei of the epithelium lining the cystic cavities, and (3) cytoplasmic vacuolization, particularly of basal cells of cystic linings. They referred to these changes as early histopathologic features of neoplasia. Unicystic ameloblastoma refers to a pattern of epithelial proliferation that has been described in dentigerous cysts of the jaws that does not exhibit the histologic criteria for ameloblastoma published by Vickers and Gorlin [86-89]. This entity deserves separate consideration based on its clinical, radiographic, and pathologic

Fig. 31.26 This unilocular radiolucency associated with tooth no. 17 should generate a differential diagnosis of dentigerous and other odontogenic cysts, as well as a unicystic ameloblastoma

features. Moreover, in many cases it may be treated more conservatively than the conventional ameloblastoma with the same degree of cure [90].

Unicystic ameloblastomas are most commonly seen in young patients, with about  $50\%$  of these tumors being diagnosed during the second decade of life. The average age of patients with unicystic ameloblastomas has been reported as 22.1 years, compared with 40.2 years for the conventional variant [51]. More than  $90\%$  of these

![](images/439b48c584d1cd1c82175f61303261d158290d593b3e242e889e72364d485ee1.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 31.27 The histopathology of the lesion in  $\square$  Fig. 31.26 shows luminal unicystic ameloblastoma (hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification  $\times 40$ )

tumors are found in the mandible, usually in the molar/ ramus region [91]. A unilocular radiolucency, mimicking a dentigerous cyst, is the most common radiographic presentation for the unicystic ameloblastoma (Fig. 31.26). Most, if not all, unicystic ameloblastomas are unilocular radiolucencies [3]. Three histopathologic variants of unicystic ameloblastoma have been described that impact treatment and prognosis. In the luminal unicystic ameloblastoma, the tumor is confined to the luminal surface of the cyst (Fig. 31.27). The lesion consists of a fibrous cyst wall with a lining that consists totally or partially of ameloblastic epithelium. The intraluminal unicystic ameloblastoma contains one or more nodules of ameloblastoma projecting from the cystic lining into the lumen of the cyst. These nodules may be relatively small or largely fill the cystic lumen, and are noted to show a plexiform pattern that resembles the plexiform pattern seen in conventional ameloblastomas. As such, these tumors are referred to as plexiform unicystic ameloblastomas. In the third variant, known as mural unicystic ameloblastoma, the fibrous wall of the cyst is infiltrated by typical follicular or plexiform ameloblastoma. The extent and depth of the ameloblastic infiltration may vary considerably. Pathogenetically, the unicystic ameloblastoma seems to have a proliferative capacity between that of the odontogenic keratocyst and the conventional ameloblastoma [35].

The clinical and radiographic findings in most cases of unicystic ameloblastoma suggest that the lesion is an odontogenic cyst, most commonly a dentigerous cyst. Under the circumstances, the surgeon should routinely bivalve a "cystic" lesion and inspect the specimen for luminal proliferation of tumor. When able, histopathologic examination of such a process should occur with frozen sections. This is particularly important when dealing with large cystic lesions. With a histologic diagnosis of unicystic ameloblastoma, the surgeon should request the pathologist to obtain multiple sections through many levels of the specimen to properly sub

![](images/364569a3cb86648a1ee4f3ea0231d88537a2058d68141fd51b55697e83b8110d.jpg)

classify the variant of unicycstic ameloblastoma. When the ameloblastic elements are confined to the lumen of the cyst with or without intraluminal tumor extension, the enucleation has probably been curative treatment. When the cyst wall has been violated by the tumor as in a mural variant of unicycstic ameloblastoma, the most appropriate surgical management is quite controversial. If this diagnosis is established postoperatively, the surgeon may wish to adopt close indefinite follow-up examinations of the patient. If a preoperative incisional biopsy provides a diagnosis of mural unicycstic ameloblastoma, the surgeon might recommend a resection of the tumor since this variant of the unicycstic ameloblastoma has a higher rate of persistence than do the luminal or intraluminal unicycstic ameloblastomas.

The treatment of a luminal or intraluminal variant of the unicystic ameloblastoma is essentially noncontroversial and involves enucleation and curettage (Fig. 31.28). In a collective sense, the persistence rate of all unicystic ameloblastomas has been reported as  $10 - 20\%$  following enucleation and curettage [90]. This is

significantly lower than that of enucleation and curettage of the conventional ameloblastoma. The question then arises as to when to resect a unicycstic ameloblastoma. Three instances are likely to require such treatment. The first is the persistent unicycstic ameloblastoma. A tumor that recurs following a well-performed enucleation and curettage should probably be approached with the more aggressive resection. Second is the mural ameloblastoma. This variant of the unicycstic ameloblas

toma is probably more aggressive than the luminal and intraluminal variants of the unicycstic ameloblastoma owing to the presence of tumor in the cyst wall and therefore closer to the surrounding bone. It seems logical to approach these tumors with a surgery similar to that for the conventional ameloblastoma (Fig. 31.29). The final indication for resection of a unicycstic ameloblastoma is in the management of very large tumors (see Fig. 31.29) with significant expansion such that an

enucleation and curettage surgery would effectively result in a resection of the involved jaw.

# Key Points

The luminal and intraluminal unicystic ameloblastomas are effectively treated with a precisely executed enucleation and curettage.  
The mural unicystic ameloblastoma is not straight forward in terms of its treatment. Some can probably be effectively managed with enucleation and curettage surgeries and some require resection for effective management.  
The mural subtype of the unicystic ameloblastoma represents an enigmatic tumor whose treatment likely depends on when its diagnosis is established.

# 31.3.1.3 Extraosseous/Peripheral Ameloblastoma

The extraosseous/peripheral ameloblastoma is the most rare variant of the ameloblastoma. This tumor probably arises from rests of dental lamina or the basal epithelial cells of the surface epithelium and shows the same features of the intraosseous form of the tumor [92]. Clinically, these tumors present as nonulcerated sessile or pedunculated gingival lesions (Fig. 31.30). Most examples are  $< 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  and usually occur over a wide age range, with an average reported age of 52 years. Although these tumors do not infiltrate bone, they may be seen to "cup out" bone in the jaws (Fig. 31.31). The peripheral ameloblastoma is most appropriately treated with a wide local excision. When surgical margins are negative for tumor, cure is the likely consequence. Malignant transformation of a peripheral ameloblastoma is very rare [93].

Fig. 31.32 Histologically benign ameloblastoma is noted in the lung. This finding satisfies the definition of metastasizing ameloblastoma (hematoxylin and eosin; original magnification  $\times 20$ )

# Key Points

The extraosseous/peripheral ameloblastoma is treated with a wide local excision of soft tissue without the need for bone resection.

# 31.3.1.4 Metastasizing Ameloblastoma

Metastasizing ameloblastomas are best described as neoplasms that have the histologic features of benign ameloblastoma as shown by the primary growth in the jaws and by any metastatic growth [94]. These rare tumors are classified as benign odontogenic tumors in the 2017 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors, cysts, and allied lesions [4]. The most common sites of metastatic disease are the lungs (Fig. 31.32), followed by the cervical lymph nodes, and visceral organs [95-97]. Lung metastases have sometimes been regarded as aspiration phenomena, yet the peripheral location of many of these deposits supports hematogenous spread. MacIntosh [98] has pointed out that the aspiration hypothesis leaves unanswered the questions of why other aggressive oral lesions generally considered to be benign, such as the odontogenic myxoma or calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, have not been encountered in the lungs, particularly since many of these tumors have also been treated with conservative surgeries such as the enucleation and curettage. In addition, he stated that the aspiration hypothesis should be supported by the observation of a greater probability of tumor growth in the middle or lower lobe of the right lung, which is not the case. Eversole points out that instances of metastasis have arisen from the previously designated solid or multicystic ameloblastomas rather than unicystic tumors [99].

# Key Points

The metastasizing ameloblastoma is a benign tumor located in a distant site, most commonly the lungs.

# 31.3.2 Malignant Odontogenic Tumors

Malignant odontogenic tumors are very rare. They may arise from the epithelial components of the odontogenic apparatus. The rests of Malassez, the reduced enamel epithelium surrounding the crown of an impacted tooth, the rests of Serres in the gingiva, and the linings of odontogenic cysts represent the precursor cells for malignant transformation. Malignant odontogenic tumors are classified in  $\triangleright$  Box 31.4. In general, all of these tumors exhibit typical microscopic features of malignancy, with the exception of the previously discussed metastasizing ameloblastoma. Behaviorally, all of these tumors have the potential for either regional nodal or distant metas

tases, although cervical lymph node metastases are very rare when clinical or radiographic evidence of cervical lymph node metastases exists [100].

# 31.3.2.1 Ameloblastic Carcinoma

Ameloblastic carcinomas are malignant epithelial odontogenic tumors that exist in the background of benign ameloblastomas. This designation is reserved for an ameloblastoma that has cytologic features of malignancy in the primary tumor (Fig. 31.33), in a recurrence, or in any metastatic deposit. Although ameloblastic carcinomas have been reported to metastasize to the lungs and distant organs [101, 102], many cases do not metastasize. In Corio and colleagues' series of eight cases of ameloblastic carcinoma, rapid growth and pain were common symptoms [103]. These symptoms are recognized as being uncommon in patients with benign ameloblastomas. Treatment involves composite resection although the incidence of occult cervical metastases is rare in the N0 neck [100].

# 31.3.2.2 Primary Intraosseous Carcinoma

Squamous cell carcinomas that are encountered in the jaws, lack any continuity with the oral or antral mucosa, and occur in the absence of a primary carcinoma located elsewhere are termed primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinomas. These cases are assumed to arise from odontogenic epithelium. They typically occur in elderly patients and tend to occur in the mandibular body region. The 5-year survival rate is  $30 - 40\%$  [99]. Squamous cell carcinomas may also arise from the linings of odontogenic cysts. Cystogenic carcinomas are seen in patients older than 50 years of age and typically occur in the mandible. Finally, dentigerous cysts can undergo glandular metaplasia, and there are rare instances of central mucoepidermoid carcinomas reported to arise from odontogenic cyst lining. Treatment of the primary intraosseous carcinoma involves composite resection (Fig. 31.34), although, like ameloblastic carcinoma, the incidence of occult cervical metastases is low in the N0 neck.

# 31.3.2.3 Clear Cell Odontogenic Carcinoma

Although the clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is of putative odontogenic origin, histologic similarities to the developing tooth germ are lacking in many instances [99]. The differential diagnosis includes metastasis from a distant site, especially the kidney. The clear cell variant of renal cell carcinoma is the chief entity to consider and rule out. The clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is generally seen in elderly women, with the maxilla and mandible being affected equally (Fig. 31.35).

# Key Points

The ameloblastic carcinoma is a malignant odontogenic tumor that is cytologically malignant whether or not it has metastasized while the metas

tasizing ameloblastoma is a cytologically benign tumor that has metastasized.

The malignant odontogenic tumors are exceedingly rare.  
In the absence of clinically or radiographically apparent cervical lymph node metastases, the incidence of cervical lymph node metastases is very rare in patients with malignant odontogenic tumors.

resent developmental stages of the same hamartomatous lesion [104, 105]. The ameloblastic fibroma tends to occur in young patients in the first two decades of life. The posterior mandible is affected in  $70\%$  of cases (Fig. 31.36). Radiographically, either a unilocular or multilocular lesion is observed. The ameloblastic fibroma is recognized as an indolent tumor that is effectively treated by an enucleation and curettage surgery (Fig. 31.37). Although recurrence is rare under the circumstances, resection should be reserved for recurrent lesions. Approximately  $45\%$  of ameloblastic fibrosarcomas develop in the setting of a recurrent ameloblastic fibroma [3].

# 31.3.4 Ameloblastic Fibro-Odontoma

The ameloblastic fibro-odontoma, as previously discussed, probably represents a hamartoma, and is therefore not categorized in the 2017 World Health Organization's classification of benign odontogenic tumors. Moreover, some investigators believe that this lesion is only a stage in the development of an odontoma and does not represent a separate entity. This notwithstanding, we believe the ameloblastic fibro-odontoma is sufficiently interesting, aggressive, and common to warrant commentary and illustration in this section devoted to benign odontogenic tumors. Slootweg points out that

when one considers the data on age, site, and sex, it seems that the ameloblastic fibro-odontoma is an immature complex odontoma [104]. As with ameloblastic fibromas, the ameloblastic fibro-odontoma occurs more frequently in the posterior regions of the jaws. This lesion is commonly asymptomatic and may be discovered serendipitously when radiographs are exposed to provide a diagnosis for asymmetric eruption of the dentition in children. Larger lesions may produce facial swelling (Fig. 31.38). These lesions are distinctly well circumscribed and appear as mixed radiopaque/radiolucent masses. The ameloblastic fibro-odontoma is treated effectively with an enucleation and curettage surgery (Fig. 31.39). Recurrence after this approach is very rare. Malignant transformation of ameloblastic fibro-odontoma has been reported but is exceedingly rare [106].

# 31.3.5 Odontoma

Odontomas are the most frequently occurring odontogenic tumors, with prevalence exceeding that of all other odontogenic tumors combined. As stated previously, these lesions are generally well accepted as representing hamartomas. Odontomas present centrally within the jaws in one of two forms: compound, in which multiple small tooth-like structures exist; and complex, in which irregular masses of dentin and enamel are present with no anatomic resemblance to a tooth. Compound odontomas are predominantly seen in the anterior maxilla (Fig. 31.40), whereas complex odontomas are typically seen in the posterior maxilla or mandible (Fig. 31.41). Odontomas are treated with simple enu

# Key Points

The ameloblastic fibroma is a neoplasm.  
The ameloblastic fibro-odontoma and odontoma are hamartomas.

# 31.3.6 Odontogenic Myxoma

The odontogenic myxoma is an uncommon benign neoplasm of the jaws that was historically thought to be derived from ectomesenchyme and histologically resembles the dental papilla of the developing tooth. These tumors are slow growing with a potential for aggressive behavior (Fig. 31.42) and a high persistence rate after subtherapeutic removal [107]. They occur over a wide age range but seem to occur most commonly in the third decade of life. Although the tumor can occur anywhere in the jaws, the posterior mandible is most common location. Histologically, the tumor is composed of haphazardly arranged stellate, spindle-shaped, and round cells in an abundant loose myxoid stroma that contains only a few collagen fibrils (Fig. 31.42f). Radiographically, the odontogenic myxoma appears as a unilocular or multilocular radiolucency that may displace or cause root resorption of teeth in the area of the tumor. Although not pathognomonic of the odontogenic myxoma, the radiolucent defect may contain thin wispy trabeculae of residual bone, which are often arranged at right angles to one another in a "stepladder" pattern (see Fig. 31.42c). In some patients, the tumor may have a greater tendency to form collagen fibers; such lesions are designated fibromyxomas. Pathogenetically, the proliferation and aggressive behavior of the odontogenic myxoma may be related to overexpression of antiapoptotic cytokines BCL2 and BCLX [108].

Odontogenic myxomas should be treated with resection with  $1.0\mathrm{-cm}$  bony linear margins as confirmed with a specimen radiograph (Fig. 31.43). While the utility of resection is typically not disputed by authors reporting on the treatment of this tumor, a  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  linear margin has been suggested as an effective margin, albeit in a retrospective review of only 12 patients [109]. These tumors are not encapsulated and tend to infiltrate the surrounding bone such that complete removal by curettage is nearly impossible. Resection of the tumor with a normal surrounding margin of bone and soft tissue that shows negative margins should be curative [67]. Chrcanovic and Gomez [110] performed a literature of 377 publications regarding odontogenic myxoma that identified 1692 tumors. Six hundred ninety-five tumors were included for an analysis of recurrent disease devel

opment. The tumor's anatomic location, cortical perforation, and tooth resorption were not associated with recurrent disease. Treatment with curettage showed the highest recurrence rate  $(31.3\%)$ , and marginal resection  $(1.3\%)$  and segmental resection  $(3.1\%)$  demonstrated the lowest rates of recurrent disease.

# 31.3.7 Calcifying Epithelial Odontogenic Tumor

The calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, also known as the Pindborg tumor, is an uncommon lesion that accounts for  $< 1\%$  of all odontogenic tumors. It is particularly noteworthy that the three studies depicted in Table 31.1 reported only 15 cases of this odontogenic tumor among a collective series of 1440 odontogenic tumors. As of 2016, a verifiable 339 cases have been reported in the international literature [111]. Although this tumor has been reported over a wide age range, it is most often encountered in patients between 30 and 50 years of age [112]. Approximately two-thirds of these neoplasms occur in the mandible although they certainly may be observed in the maxilla [113] (Fig. 31.44). A painless slow-growing mass is the most common presenting sign. Radiographically, the most common presentation is a mixed radiopaque/radiolucent lesion, frequently associated with an impacted tooth.

likely diagnosis owing to the patient's age as well as the radiographic character of the lesion. An incisional biopsy was therefore not performed prior to definitive surgical management of this lesion

Histologically, the Pindborg tumor is quite unique. Discrete islands, strands, or sheets of polyhedral epithelial cells in a fibrous stroma are noted. Large areas of amorphous eosinophilic hyalinized (amyloid-like) material are also present. Calcifications, which are a distinctive feature of the tumor, develop within the amyloid-like material and form concentric rings, known as Liesegang rings. The precise nature of the amyloid-like material is unknown. The material does stain as amyloid when stained with Congo red or thioflavine T. After Congo red staining, the amyloid exhibits apple-green birefringence when viewed with polarized light. It has been illustrated that the amyloid-like material may actually represent amelogenins or other enamel proteins secreted by the tumor cells [114].

Although slow growing, the Pindborg tumor is highly infiltrative and destructive and is capable of aggressive behavior [113, 114]. Owing to the small number of reported cases and lack of consistent follow-up, evidence-based recommendations for treatment are not available. Nonetheless, the tumor is generally recommended to be treated identically to the ameloblastoma and odontogenic myxoma, with  $1.0\mathrm{-cm}$  bony linear margins and the appropriate attention to soft tissue anatomic barriers (Fig. 31.45). When this treatment was undertaken for Franklin and Pindborg's series of tumors, only one patient undergoing resection experienced recurrence [112].

# Key Points

The odontogenic myxoma and Pindborg tumor are aggressive odontogenic tumors that require resection with 1-cm linear margins in bone for effective management.

# 31.3.8 Adenomatoid Odontogenic Tumor

The adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, regarded by many as a hamartoma, is an uncommon odontogenic lesion, accounting for  $3 - 7\%$  of all odontogenic tumors. This lesion was once believed to be a variant of ameloblastoma and was previously designated adenoameloblastoma [115, 116]. Its clinical features and biologic behavior permit distinction from the ameloblastoma (Fig. 31.46). These lesions are limited to young

patients, and two-thirds of all cases are diagnosed in the second decade [117-120]. The tumor is extremely uncommon in patients  $>30$  years. It has a predilection for the anterior region of the jaws and is found twice as often in the maxilla than in the mandible. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Most adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are small, rarely exceeding  $3\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter. In about  $75\%$  of cases, the lesion appears as a well-circumscribed unilocular radiolucency that involves the crown of an erupted tooth, frequently a canine.

Histologically, the adenomatoid odontogenic tumor is a well-defined lesion that is usually surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule (Fig. 31.46d). When the lesion is bisected, the central portion of the tumor may be essentially solid or may show varying degrees of cystic change with intraluminal proliferation of tissue. The lesion is composed of spindle-shaped epithelial cells that form sheets, strands, or whorled masses of cells in a scant fibrous stroma. The epithelial cells may form rosette-like structures about a central space that may be empty or contain small amounts of eosinophilic material that may stain for amyloid [121-123]. Tubular or duct-like structures are characteristic for the adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (see Fig. 31.46e). These consist of a central space surrounded by a layer of columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells whose nuclei exhibit reverse polarization.

Owing to this lesion being encapsulated, it separates easily from the surrounding bone. As such, an enucleation and curettage surgery is curative (see Fig. 31.46). Of the 499 cases of adenomatoid odontogenic tumor reported in the literature, only one acceptable case of recurrence has been documented [124].

# 31.4 Conclusion

Odontogenic cysts and tumors are relatively rare pathologic entities of the head and neck that require precise microscopic diagnosis to permit the execution of surgical procedures with curative intent. Collectively, these lesions range from hamartomas to benign and malignant tumors. Complete surgical removal, performed in a variety of different ways for these cysts and tumors, typically predicts uncomplicated postoperative courses. Complete surgical removal of many benign odontogenic tumors may resemble surgical resection of malignant tumors. Therein, cosmetic deformity may be realized otherwise conservative enucleation and curettage procedures resulting in incomplete removal of aggressive benign odontogenic tumors may be associated with high rates of persistent tumor. Regimented clinical and radiographic follow-up routines are required to ensure durable cure and favorable functional outcomes.
