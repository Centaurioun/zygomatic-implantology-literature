# 6.1 Introduction

Individuals with complete edentulism have difficulty masticating certain hard-to-chew foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and meats, even when wearing well-made dentures. This leads to diet modification to compensate for loss of oral function, making maintenance of good general health difficult due to compromised nutrition. It has been suggested that due to masticatory dysfunction, edentulous individuals lack specific nutrients and, as a result, may be at risk for various health disorders [1]. Individuals with self-perceived ill-fitting dentures are even more prone to even poorer dietary quality and intake of certain nutrients than those wearing adequate dentures or with natural teeth [2]. The original intention was to provide improvement in masticatory and speech function in combination with dental and facial esthetics for complete removable dentures. This requires maximum preservation or development of alveolar hard and soft tissues of the alveolar base to minimize the adverse changes in the denture-bearing areas due normal alveolar osseous remodeling that may otherwise result in ill-fitting and painful removable dental prostheses. While this is still relevant, introduction of endosteal dental implants has changed the focus of contemporary preprosthetic surgery largely to pre-implant surgery in that implant-supported or implant-borne prosthetic devices have become the state of the art [3].

Osseointegrated dental implants have become the standard for oral rehabilitation, which effectively decreased the necessity for pre-prosthetic surgery [4]. However, pre-prosthetic surgical techniques may still be required when modifying hard and soft tissues, such as lack of keratinized gingiva and decreased vestibular depth, to support the flange of a mandibular overdenture. The principles of pre-prosthetic surgery in these situations enhance or, in some cases, are required to facilitate removable dental implant-supported prosthesis insertion, retention, and stability. Implant overdentures significantly improve masticatory function and muscle coordination [5] and improve oral health-related quality of life [6] in edentulous patients compared to

conventional removable dentures. The impetus therefore in contemporary oral pre-prosthetic surgery is to preserve hard and soft tissue after tooth extraction to maximize a base foundation for either a conventional denture or eventual dental implant placement for a dental implant-supported or implant-retained denture. Treatment planning for a patient undergoing tooth extraction in preparation for a dental prosthesis must involve consideration for either type of dental prosthesis, as different requirements and procedures are generally required.

# 6.1.1 Workup and Evaluation

The criteria for a suitable edentulous ridge for conventional removable denture prosthesis are as follows [7]:

1. Alveolar bone should have adequate width and height to support a denture base.  
2. U-shaped is preferable for a more retentive removable denture.  
3. Oral mucosa with adequate uniform thickness.  
4. Elimination of undercuts, sharp ridges, or bony or soft tissue protuberances.  
5. Adequate buccal and lingual/palatal vestibular depth.

Detailed clinical and radiographic analysis of local oral anatomy is a vital component of pre-prosthetic treatment planning. The development of office-based cone beam CT (CBCT) scans has become invaluable in preprosthetic treatment planning as it allows three-dimensional anatomical visualization. CBCT allows for detailed and focused evaluation of anatomic features such as neurovascular anatomy, alveolar ridge height and width, thickness of the lateral maxillary sinus wall, presence of the alveolar antral artery and its diameter, maxillary sinus floor width and angulation, irregularity of sinus floor, intimate relation of the Schneiderian membrane with the roots of adjacent teeth, sinus septum, and quality of subantral bone [8].

As with any bone in the body, Wolff's law plays an important role in both healthy and pathologic bone remodeling. The biomechanical principle of Wolff's law states that bone growth and remodeling occur in response to the forces placed upon it in a healthy individual through functional adaptation. According to Wolff's law, bone is stimulated, strengthened, and continually renewed directly by a tooth or dental implant. Following teeth extraction, the alveolar ridge resorbs throughout an individual's life in a chronic, progressive, irreversible process. The phenomenon of bone resorption of the jaws involves changes or elimination in loading direction and force from tooth loss [9] (Figs. 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3). Loss of bone stimulation after tooth removal

results in change in the direction of principal strains on the maxilla and mandible, causing the cancellous bone lamellae [10] and Haversian systems of cortical bone [11] to realign with the new principal strain directions. This ultimately results in attenuation of jaw bone mass and volume with different alveolar ridge resorption patterns, which are earlier and more dramatic in the mandible. Dissimilar from the maxilla, the mandible has a differential pace of bone loss, where the distal residual ridge resorbs faster than the anterior ridge and proceeds

more in the labiolingual and vertical directions. Maxillary bone resorption occurs evenly around the dental arch but more on buccal and labial side than palatal side. These changes result in the most rapid ridge flattening with greatest loss within 12-18 months after extraction [12]. The differential resorption comparisons between posterior maxillary and mandibular arch widths, reductions in mandibular height, and edentulous age accompanied by denture wearing have shown that the mandible and maxilla progressively resorb at

different rates, resulting in different arch width relationships. This progressive and irreversible mandibular alveolar resorption rate is greatest in the earlier stages of edentulism and slows with loss of bone, longevity of edentulism, and attendant wearing of dentures [13]. Consequently, the resulting edentulous maxillary arch is, mostly, internal or at the same vertical level with the edentulous mandibular arch. This interarch spatial relationship needs to be taken into consideration for the position of the artificial teeth and any need for ridge augmentation procedures at or after teeth extraction, or for dental implant placement.

Resorptive Pattern of the Edentulous Ridge [14]

Type I - Minor ridge modeling. The ridge is wide enough at its crest to accommodate the recently extracted teeth.

Type II - Sharp atrophic residual ridge. The ridge becomes thin and pointed.

Type III - Basal bone ridge. The pointed ridge flattens to the level of the basal bone.

Type IV - Basal bone resorption. The flattened ridge becomes concave as the basal bone resorbs.

Residual ridge form has been described and classified by Cawood and Howell (  $\text{口}$  Fig. 6.3) as follows [15]:

Class I - Dentate

Class II - Post-extraction

Class III - Convex ridge form, with adequate height and width of alveolar process

Class IV - Knife edge form with adequate height but inadequate width of alveolar process

Class V - Flat ridge form with loss of alveolar process

Class VI - Loss of basal bone that may be extensive but follows no predictable pattern

Maintenance of the existing alveolar ridge is important for both conventional and implant-retained dentures. Augmentation at the time of extraction to either improve the denture-bearing area or in preparation for dental implant placement is an important adjunct to pre-prosthetic surgery.

Therefore, the goals of pre-prosthetic surgery, whether for conventional removable or implant overdentures, should be to:

1. Provide a stable base through either augmentation or maintenance of the alveolar ridge at the time of surgery or alveolar ridge reconstruction after surgery.  
2. Remove hard and/or soft tissue protuberances, such as frenum, tori, or hyperplastic tissue, that may interfere with either insertion, retention, or stability.  
3. Establish or maintain a sufficient vestibular depth to allow for denture flange for stability and retention.

3. Performance of proper techniques for required preprosthetic procedures.

# 6.2 Alveoloplasty (Figs. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11)

Alveoloplasty is a surgical procedure performed to trim and remove the labiobuccal alveolar bone along with some interdental and interradicular bone either at the time of or after extraction of teeth in preparation for conventional removable dentures or dental implant placement. Properly performed alveoloplasty at the time of teeth extraction may significantly decrease the occurrence of bony prominences, undercuts, and sharp ridges, which may develop once the overly soft tissue has healed. The intended purpose of alveoloplasty is to prepare the alveolus for smooth and atraumatic insertion, retention, and removal of dental prosthesis.

and limited to those areas that require reintouring to decrease added bone resorption from periosteal stripping, which has been known to increase bone resorption by 1-2 millimeters. Bony contouring is then accomplished with bone files, rongeurs, rotary burs, or a power rasp. Edematous and diseased interdental papilla frequently seen in periodontally involved dentition should be removed with sharp scissors to the extent that it does not interfere with flap closure. Once completed, the soft tissue flap should be returned with digital palpation over the flap to determine the appropriate uniformity and smoothness of the ridge in anticipation of supporting a CRD. The soft tissue flap is then sutured, and a healing/provisional denture may be placed to act as a surgical dressing, maintain vestibular height, provide some masticatory function, and offer esthetic coverage during the healing period.

Alveoloplasty in preparation for an implant denture depends largely on the type of prosthesis that is planned. A fixed implant prosthesis will generally not require significant, or possibly even any, contouring of alveolar undercuts, prominences, or tori as the prosthesis will be entirely supported by dental implants. This option will generally require a more aggressive alveolectomy to level the alveolar bone to an appropriate height above the smile line and to provide sufficient space for the required restorative materials (Figs. 6.12, 6.13, and 6.14). An implant-retained soft tissue-supported prosthesis will still require alveoloplasty as that used in preparation of a CRD.

# Key Points

1. Proper performance of alveoloplasty prepares the alveolus to fit a removable dental prosthesis.  
2. By maximizing both the hard and soft tissue bases for a removable denture, alveoloplasty allows for improvement of denture stability.  
3. Satisfactory alveoloplasty is vital to the success of removable dental prosthetic.

# 6.2.1 Genial Tubercle Reduction

Genial tubercles are the bony projections located on the lingual aspect of the mandible and are attached to the genial muscles. The genial tubercles are extremely prominent as a result of advanced ridge reduction in the anterior part of the body of the mandible. While there does not appear to be sexual dimorphism involved with the prominence of genial tubercles, it does appear genial tubercles may be more pronounced in individuals with Class III malocclusions [16]. Consisting of two prominences on either side of the midline, the two genial tubercles located superiorly tend to be more prominent than the inferior genial tubercles. This may elevate the ridge lingually and cause a stepped deformity that will make the anterior lingual seal of a mandibular conventional removable denture impossible. Additionally, as the activity of the genioglossus muscle tends to displace a conventional removable lower denture, genial tubercle removal with genioglossus muscle detachment may be required to improve denture retention and stability.

Exposed by blunt subperiosteal dissection, chisel, rongeurs, rotary drill, or power rasp may be used to remove tubercles with residual rough bony margins smoothened with a file. As with any floor of mouth pro

cedure, caution must be exercised to prevent hematoma formation or airway obstruction from aggressive muscle detachment.

# 6.2.2 Vestibuloplasty Procedures and Floor of Mouth Lowering

Vestibuloplasty [17, 18] is a surgical procedure intended to deepen the oral vestibule through one or a combination of soft tissue/muscle attachment alteration, local tissue rearrangement, or soft tissue grafting on either the labial or lingual/palatal aspects of the mandible or maxilla. The goals of vestibuloplasty are to provide mechanical resistance to displacement forces, provide a stable denture-bearing area, and provide a more robust load-bearing soft tissue base for both conventional removable dentures and implant-supported tissue-retained overdentures. An inadequate and shallow labial vestibule can impede the construction of both conventional and implant-retained tissue-supported overdentures by restricting the buccal denture flange used to provide stability and needed lip support. Additionally, restricting movement of the mentalis muscle with a high insertion in relation to the crest of the alveolar ridge may lead to displacement of both conventional mandibular prosthesis and implant-retained tissue-supported overdentures. Repositioning of the mentalis muscle in conjunction with vestibuloplasty is also an important consideration in denture construction. Vestibuloplasty techniques aimed at eliminating mentalis muscle insertions, repositioning the mucosa, and increasing the denture base area to provide added stability by producing a broader denture base for both conventional and implant-retained mandibular overdentures. Techniques to deepen the vestibule include submucosal (mucosal advancement) vestibuloplasty, secondary epithelialization vestibuloplasty, and grafting vestibuloplasty with either autogenous (mucosal or split-thickness skin grafts (STSG)) [19, 20] or allogeneic materials (collagen matrix grafts) [21, 22].

Submucosal (mucosal advancement) vestibuloplasty involves undermining the mucous membrane of the vestibule with advancement to line both sides of the extended vestibule, may be performed either closed or open, and is indicated where sufficient bone exists but muscle attachments closer to the alveolar crest are present that prevent proper seating of a denture. The purpose of the closed submucosal vestibuloplasty is to extend the vestibule to provide additional ridge height and for local connective tissue and muscle repositioning from the alveolar ridge to prevent relapse. The procedure has a greater effect in the maxillary vestibule

with success dependent on the availability of bone and the amount of freely moveable mucosa. The procedure involves a vertical midline mucosal-only incision that extends from the mucogingival junction into the lip. Scissors are introduced through the incision with the lip everted and blunt dissection used to separate the mucosa from the submucosa over the intended area of extension. A tunnel is formed between these two planes extending from the mucogingival junction into the cheek and lip to create a submucosal tunnel that may extend to the zygomatic buttresses. The underlying muscle and connective tissue are freed from the periosteum and the incision closed with stent placement to adapt the mucosa to the extended vestibule and removed after 10-14 days. The open submucous vestibuloplasty (Obwegeser technique) is intended to diminish the relapse observed in the closed technique. The open technique involves a horizontal mucogingival junction incision with a thin mucosal flap elevation. Supraperiosteal dissection is then completed with the release of local muscle and connective tissue. The elevated flap is then sutured to the depth of the extended vestibule while returning and suturing the free flap to its original position.

Secondary epithelialization vestibuloplasty is indicated when sufficient bone is present, but the overlying mucosa is either insufficient or in poor quality, such as inflammatory hyperplasia. This procedure involves using the mucosa of the vestibule to line one side of the extended vestibule, while the exposed side heals by secondary intention. These procedures include the Edlantype (lip switch) procedure, Kazanjian's technique vestibuloplasty, Godwin's vestibuloplasty, and Clark's vestibuloplasty.

The Edlan-type procedure [23] involves transposition of lip or cheek mucosa onto the labial alveolar ridge after excision of periosteum from the mandibular crest and sutured into the lip or cheek wound. This provides increased vestibular depth but has the deficiency of placing mobile, nonkeratinized lip or cheek mucosa onto the denture-bearing portion of the mandibular ridge. Like all oral mucosa, this tissue has the weakness of ulceration and wounding during heavy loading. Moreover, the periosteal blood supply to the edentulous mandible is removed.

In Kazanjian's technique [20] (Fig. 6.15), an incision is made in the mucosa of the lip, and a large flap of labial and vestibular mucosa is retracted. The mentalis muscle is detached from the periosteum to the required depth, and the vestibule is deepened by supraperiosteal dissection. A flap of the mucosa is turned downward from the attachment of the alveolar ridge and is placed and sutured directly against the underlying periosteum.

A surgical splint to secure the flap may be placed in the deepened sulcus and secured with either percutaneous sutures or circummandibular wires. The splints' purpose is to maintain vestibular depth while the labial donor site surface heals by granulation and secondary epithelialization, which will cause some contracture of the wound margins and should be removed after 7 days. Godwin's technique is similar to Kazanjian's method but employs subperiosteal dissection rather than supraperiosteal. The periosteum is placed at the depth of the vestibule against bone and sutured to the connective tissue in the deepened vestibule. A rubber catheter is secured at the depth of the vestibule with percutaneous sutures and left in place for 11 days. Both of these techniques are prone to losing a significant percentage of the initial surgical depth obtained due to labial scar contracture. Clark's procedure is the reverse technique of Kazanjian technique, in which a flap of the lip is pedicled rather than the alveolar process, where a supraperiosteal dissection is performed to the desired vestibular depth. The lip mucosa is undermined to the vermilion border so that the free edge of the mucosal flap is secured to the periosteum deep in the sulcus. This allows the exposed bone surface to granulate and epithelize without contracture. While less initial contracture may occur, migrating lip musculature overtime may obliterate the sulcus.

Grafting vestibuloplasty may be completed with autogenous or non-autogenous materials. The autogenous STSG vestibuloplasty is a well-established successful pre-prosthetic procedure with rare donor site complications [24], such as infection, scarring, and prolonged healing [25]. STSG vestibuloplasty is indicated when inadequate bone volume exists to compensate for relapse after vestibuloplasty, when a previous bone graft has been placed that decreased the vestibular depth, or when an otherwise large surgical defect would be present. The increased use of dental implants has all but eliminated the routine performance of vestibuloplasty. There are situations, however, where vestibuloplasty is beneficial or, in some cases, required to allow for optimal retention and stability of implant-retained tissue-supported mandibular overdentures where insufficient vestibular depth precludes the placement of a denture flange. Reconstruction of the severely resorbed mandible with a soft tissue matrix expansion graft (tent pole technique) frequently requires the undermining and obliteration of the mandibular vestibule to accommodate placement of both dental implants and bone graft with almost a quarter requiring vestibuloplasty [26]. Vestibuloplasty in a preexisting shallow vestibule mandible with simultaneous dental implant placement to facilitate a dental implant-retained tissue-supported mandibular overden

ture is slightly different from the procedure for conventional removable dentures ( Figs. 6.16, 6.17, and 6.18). When combined with simultaneous dental implant placement, vestibuloplasty should involve a minimal flap reflection at the anterior mandible at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the mental foramens first completed. In cases of sharp and/or thin contours of the edentulous mandible that impeded the placement of implants, limited alveoloplasty is performed in the area of the planned implant placement to provide sufficient bone for implant placement and denture material while preventing periosteal stripping in the area of the planned STSG. The incision for the vestibuloplasty is then completed at an oblique angle between retromolar triangles at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the implant sites. Supraperiosteal dissection is critical to provide a nutrient bed for the STSG. Once the buccal mucosa flap has been successfully elevated and the recipient graft bed prepared, the superior portion of the buccal mucosa flap is sutured to the depth of the vestibule along with mentalis muscle repositioning and bilateral mental nerve skeletonization. A 0.017-inch-thick STSG is harvested, usually from the right upper lateral thigh, with a dermatome, placed with the dermal surface against the periosteum, and sutured to the superior and inferior vestibular incisions. Intimate contact with periosteum

must be maintained to allow for eventual affixation to the periosteum of the alveolar ridge. Once a viable periosteum is established, intimate contact between STSG and periosteum can be accomplished either with a custom fabricated splint [27, 28] or by suturing the STSG to the margins of the vestibuloplasty and the judicious use of basting sutures to secure the graft to the periosteum [29]. When a splint is used, it should be retained ideally with transmandibular wires and applied no longer than 3 weeks. This will allow for prevention of the deleterious effects of hematoma formation and sufficient time for graft neovascularization.

A STSG provides both increased vestibular depth and keratinized epidermis on the denture-bearing portion of the mandible and may be the only procedure to sufficiently attain a stable denture supporting area. It provides a firm, immobile, and stable base that is capable of withstanding the functional stresses both conventional denture and implant-retained overdenture wear. The process of frictional keratosis of the STSG enables the graft to accommodate to differing functional demands. Dermal substitutes have shown them to be a suitable replacement for STSG with acceptable outcomes and some advantages over STSG, including lack of donor site morbidity and unlimited availability.

Careful patient selection is required as not every patient will require or be a candidate for the simultaneous placement of endosteal dental implants and STSG vestibuloplasty. One contraindication to this combined procedure is the need for extensive alveoloplasty that will require subperiosteal dissection, thus being unable to provide sufficient nutrients through

ambibition to allow for graft survival. As the STSG requires a viable periosteum, subperiosteal dissection precludes simultaneous alveoloplasty. In cases where the mandibular alveolar crest width is too narrow to accommodate dental implants, an alveoloplasty with

vertical alveolar reduction to provide a crestal width to accommodate the appropriate implant diameter should be completed 4-6 weeks prior to simultaneous STSG and implant placement. The issue of the need and amount of increased vestibular depth will primarily be determined by the experience and skill of the restorative dentist and the demands placed by the patient for the prosthesis. STSG vestibuloplasty has been found to be advantageous with dental implant placement, especially in comparison with both Edlanplastsy, which showed a small amount of bone resorption, and Kazanjianplasty techniques, which showed a significant loss of attached mucosa [30]. However, one advantage of the Edlan technique is the ability to perform the procedure in the clinic setting as opposed to the STSG, which usually requires a general anesthetic.

# Key Points

1. Vestibuloplasty may be a beneficial and sometimes essential part of pre-prosthetic surgery to increase the denture-bearing area of both removable and implant overdentures.  
2. Increased vestibular depth may improve both removable and implant overdenture stability and support.  
3. Tissue repositioning procedures or autogenous graft materials, such as split-thickness skin grafts, may be utilized to optimize vestibular depth and denture retention.

# 6.2.3 Mylohyoid Ridge Reduction

The mylohyoid ridge is an oblique ridge on the lingual surface of the lower jaw, which extends from the level of the roots of the last molar as a bony attachment for the mylohyoid muscles which form the floor of the mouth. Mylohyoid ridge reduction is needed when the gum ridge is sharp and denture pressure can cause significant pain in this area.

# 6.2.4 Mandibular and Maxillary Tori Reduction

Torus mandibularis, or the plural tori mandibularis or mandibular tori, is a benign protrusion of mostly cortical bone commonly present on the lingual aspect of the alveolus in the vicinity of the premolar teeth and above mylohyoid muscle attachment to the mandible [31]. Formation of mandibular tori is a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic and parafunctional sources. Parafunctional activity, such as bruxism [32], may be the

causative agent due to mechanical stress concentration in the lingual premolar regions with favorable stress concentration mandibular geometries, such as square-shaped mandibles, being more prevalent [33]. While the presence of mandibular tori commonly produces no deleterious effects and generally requires no treatment, tori that develop extensively may contribute to traumatic ulcer formation, speech and masticatory dysfunction [34] and even obstructive sleep apnea [35]. Their presence may inhibit the fabrication and path of insertion of a removable denture or oral sleep appliance due to their location on the alveolus, making their reduction an occasional necessity.

Mandibular tori reduction is not without potential complications. Given the nature and location of this procedure, the potential for hematoma formation is possible [35]. This may lead to life-threatening airway obstruction and should be completed with caution and observation. Application of a custom oral surgical splint or immediate prosthesis may aid in decreasing the severity of this potential life-threatening complication.

The size and shape of the lingual tori will generally dictate the surgical procedure required to recounture the alveolus to allow for denture insertion and retention. Once a subperiosteal lingual flap is carefully elevated and reflected without tearing the delicate tissues of the lingual mucosa, the tori may then be reduced. Small and non-pedunculated tori will tend to do well with a rotary bur or power rasp as the cortical bone of the mandible is too thick to allow for hand instruments such as a rasp. Large and pedunculated tori are easily removed with a rotary instrument, chisels, and hand files. Once exposed, a trough is created on the portion of the torus that connects to the alveolus. A chisel is then inserted into the trough and directed parallel to the alveolus. Lingual inclination of the chisel blade may cause a fracture line to extend to the portion of the torus attached to the underlying mylohyoid muscle which may increase the risks of bleeding and increased pain. Inclination too buccal may fracture too much of the inferior alveolus and may increase the risk of mandible fracture. Proper alignment of the chisel with the alveolus with firm and controlled force of the hammer should allow for a clean fracture of the torus off of the alveolus without complications. Any remaining rough bone may then be simply recounted with a handheld bone file ( Figs. 6.19, 6.20, 6.21, 6.22, 6.23, 6.24, 6.25, 6.26, 6.27, and 6.28).

Torus palatinus, or the plural tori palatini or palatal tori, is a benign bony protrusion on the maxillary hard palate usually present on the midline [31]. Most palatal tori are small, less than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter, but may change throughout life. The prevalence of palatal tori ranges from  $9\%$  to  $60\%$  with a female predilection. Much like the etiology of mandibular tori, palatal tori may also be an autosomal dominant trait and multifactorial.

Fig. 6.22 Creating a trough between the torus and alveolus in preparation for osteotome

Palatal tori tend to vary in shape from flat, spindle, or nodular to lobular. Broad-based flat tori are generally located on the palatal midline and extend symmetrically to either side. Spindle-shaped palatal tori have a ridge located at their midline, while nodular tori have multiple bony growths where each has their own base and lobular tori have multiple bony growths with a common base.

Indications for surgical removal of palatal tori include [36] speech disturbance, masticatory dysfunction, chronic traumatic ulceration over the torus, food retention and hygiene issues, and inability to construct stable removable prosthesis.

Techniques recommended for removal of palatal tori include a straight-line incision on the torus with Y-shaped releasing incisions, a full palatal flap, and the modified palatal flap [37]. Smaller and non-pedunculated torus may be reintoured with a bone file or rotary instrument and the adjacent tissue sutured. Larger and multilobu

lated torus may require sectioning and removal in pieces before reintouring. Application of a surgical splint is generally recommended for hematoma formation and breakdown of the highly friable and thin overlying tissue [39]. (Figs. 6.29, 6.30, 6.31, 6.32, and 6.33).

# Key Points

1. Adequate reduction of excessive bone at select locations will allow for better removable denture insertion and stability.  
2. Careful soft tissue management with removal is important to prevent dehiscence and complicated postoperative recovery.  
3. Rotary or hand instruments may be equally effective in removal depending on the anatomy and location.

# 6.2.5 Maxillary Labial Frenectomy

Figs. 6.34, 6.35, 6.36, 6.37,

and 6.38)

The labial maxillary frenum is a fibrous attachment located in the midline of the maxillary vestibule. An excessive maxillary frenum will generally require that a maxillary conventional removable denture have a midline anterior notch to accommodate denture placement; otherwise, stability and proper fit may be compromised. A deep labial frenal notch in maxillary conventional removable denture will exhibit very high compressive strain that will cause midline fractures [40]. The labial frenal notch geometry of a maxillary complete removable denture, if excessive, may weaken the denture and lead to fracture in strain because it is shallow and smooth. A maxillary labial frenectomy is indicated in various clinical situations, such as when prominent teeth may not allow proper seating of or weaken the structure of a maxillary complete removable denture.

Several methods may be used to achieve the intended result of maxillary labial frenectomy. The simplest method is to create an elliptical incision of the excessive fibrous attachment. Two hemostats are used to clamp the superior and inferior aspects of the frenum. A blade or scissors are then used to remove the excess tissue between the two. A periosteal elevator is then used to detach any muscle attachment from the underlying bone that may be associ-

ated with the frenum. The adjacent tissue is then undermined and sutures closed with deep interrupted sutures. One of the major concerns with this approach is the chance of relapse due to scar formation. A more predictable and relatively more complicated procedure is a z-plasty tissue rearrangement. This procedure will reposition the adjacent tissue to allow for less scar contracture and better maintenance of the obtained space from the frenectomy.

# Key Points

1. Maxillary labial frenum may weaken denture structure and should be removed if excessive.  
2. Frenectomies may allow for better seating and retention of maxillary dentures.  
3. Rotation flap frenectomies may provide better results and less scar contracture.

# 6.2.6 Epulis Removal

Epulis may form on tissues that have ill-fitting dentures. These are usually found in the maxilla (Fig. 6.39). When new or replacement dentures are to be constructed or the epulis causes existing dentures to become ill-fitting and/or uncomfortable, they should be removed. The excess tissue may be successfully removed with a supraperiosteal dissection with either a blade or electrocautery which may aid in hemostasis (Fig. 6.40). Once the excess tissue is removed (Figs. 6.41 and 6.42), options include allowing the

area to heal by secondary intention, which causes the most amount of relapse. Conversely, a split thickness skin graft or maxillary soft lined splint may be used to preserve the depth of vestibule gained with minimal relapse due to scarring from secondary intention

(  $\text{口}$  Fig. 6.43).

# Key Points

1. Epulis may form from ill fitting dentures and most commonly occur in the maxillary vestibule.  
2. Removal is required when the epulis becomes painful or causes an ill-fitting prosthesis.  
3. Complete removal is recommended with supratheriosteal dissection with a soft-lined splint to prevent relapse and vestibule shallowing.

a. Rongeurs (side and end cutting)  
b. Bone files  
c. Rotary burs  
d. Chisels  
e. Soft tissue forceps  
f. Scissors

# Conclusion

Pre-prosthetic surgery has for the most part remained the same for the past several decades, in which its purpose is to prepare the mouth for conventional removable dentures. As their prevalence has increased, the contemporary use of dental implants has somewhat diminished the role of pre-prosthetic procedures. However, many of the previously used pre-prosthetic procedures may still be applicable in preparing the jaws for dental implants. As dental implantology is a prosthetically driven surgical procedure, the type and design of the final dental prosthesis will determine the number of implants used and the pre-prosthetic surgical procedures that will be required to provide it to the patient. Proficiency in these procedures will benefit the patient who will require either a conventional or implant dental prosthesis.
