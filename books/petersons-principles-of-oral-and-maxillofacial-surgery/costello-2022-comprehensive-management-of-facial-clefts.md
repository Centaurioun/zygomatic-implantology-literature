# 46.1 Introduction

The comprehensive treatment of cleft lip and palate deformities requires thoughtful consideration of the anatomic complexities of the deformity and the delicate balance between intervention and growth. Comprehensive, coordinated, and interdisciplinary care from infancy through, and including, the adult years is essential to achieve the best outcome, and surgeons with formal training and experience in all the phases of care must be actively involved in the planning and treatment [1-3]. Specific goals of surgical care for children born with cleft lip and palate include the following:

- Normalized aesthetic appearance of the lip and nose  
Intact primary and secondary palate  
Normal speech, language, and hearing  
- Nasal airway patency  
Class I occlusion with normal masticatory function  
- Optimized dental and periodontal health  
Normal psychosocial development

Successful management of the child born with a cleft lip and palate requires coordinated care provided by a number of different disciplines, including oral and maxillofacial surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, genetics/dysmorphology, speech-language pathology, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, psychology, and prosthodontics [4]. In most cases, care of patients with congenital clefts has become a subspecialty area of clinical practice within these different professions. In addition to the primary cleft repairs in infancy, treatment plans routinely involve multiple treatment interventions to achieve the above goals staged throughout childhood. Because care is provided over the entire course of the child's development, long-term follow-up is essential under the care of these different health care providers.

The formation of interdisciplinary cleft palate teams, as per the standards established by the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association via the Commission on Team Care, has served two key objectives of successful cleft care: (1) coordinated care provided by all the necessary disciplines, and (2) continuity of care with close-interval follow-up of the patient throughout periods of active growth and ongoing stages of reconstruction. The best outcomes are achieved when the team's care is centered on the patient, family, and community rather than a particular surgeon, specialty, hospital, or health system. The idea of having an objective team that does not revolve around the desires of one particular individual or discipline is sometimes impeded by competitive interactions between surgical specialties or other factors that introduce bias. Battles over surgical domains between surgical specialties and economic factors contribute to these conflicts and negatively affect the work of the team. Healthy team dynamics and optimal patient care are achieved when all members are active participants, when team protocols and referral patterns are equitable, and when the needs of the child are placed above the needs of the team or individual members. Surgical treatment should be based on the surgeon's formal training—rather than specialty identity.

The surgical reconstruction of clefts requires that the surgeon undertaking this important work maintain a cognitive understanding of the complex malformation itself, the varied operative techniques used, facial growth considerations, and the psychosocial health of the patient and family. This chapter presents the overall staged reconstructive approach for repair of cleft lip and palate from infancy through the time of skeletal maturity as well as a discussion of the surgical procedures involved in primary cleft lip and palate repair. Controversies in cleft repair, secondary revision procedures, bone graft reconstruction of the cleft maxilla, and orthognathic surgery for cleft-related dysmorphology are more thoroughly discussed in other areas of this text and referenced below from the literature.

# 46.2 History of Cleft Lip and Palate Repair

Cleft care has had a long history within dentistry and oral surgery.  
Contributions from many specialties have provided today's general consensus on team care.  
Interdisciplinary care models were developed largely in cleft and craniofacial teams and practiced worldwide prior to most other areas of health care.

The history of cleft lip and palate care has been closely linked to dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery. The birth of what is now the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association is strongly rooted in dentistry, and its further development has always had various aspects of the dental profession at its center.

The first documented cleft lip repair was performed in 390 AD on a patient who later became the governor general of several regions in China, although nothing is known about the actual surgeon [5, 6]. Jehan Yperman is believed to have been the first to describe unilateral and bilateral cleft lip repair [6, 7]. The first diagrammatic representation of cleft lip repair and cleft palate obturator use is credited to Ambrose Pare in the fourteenth century [6, 8]. Much later, the first documented successful cleft palate repair was performed by a dentist, Le Monnier, in 1766 in Paris [6, 9]. The concepts of cleft lip and palate repair have evolved from straight-line repairs to a variety of techniques using various cutbacks, triangles, and Z-plasties [6-14]. During the 1950s, Asensio, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon from Guatemala, developed a novel technique for cleft lip repair that involved the rotation of the philtral segment inferiorly and advancement of the lateral segment medially with a quadrangular flap. Although he used this approach in Guatemala throughout the 1950s, he did not report it until much later [15, 16]. Ralph Millard described his classic rotational advancement technique in the mid-1950s, and his concepts changed cleft repair forever [17, 18]. Millard is credited with perhaps the most important technical development related to cleft lip repair, and today, the majority of surgeons use his original technique or some close modification of it.

In the mid-nineteenth century, Hullihen [19], recognized as the father of American oral and maxillofacial surgery, published a treatise on comprehensive care of cleft lip and palate deformities. Another pioneer, Truman Brophy, was the professor of oral surgery and dean of the Chicago College of Dentistry and contributed greatly to the care of many patients with clefts. Brophy [20] published a text detailing his experiences with the management of various malformations of the mouth and their surgical repairs, including the details of cleft repair. One of his pupils was Chalmers Lyons, who started a residency program in oral surgery at the University of Michigan in 1917 [20]. Lyons developed the largest cleft practice in America and contributed extensively to the literature [20].

Many of the concepts related to interdisciplinary care with a cleft palate team were introduced by Robert Ivy, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who later became dually qualified in plastic surgery [20]. Ivy trained in both dentistry and medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. After his training in dentistry, Ivy further

developed his interests in maxillofacial surgery as an assistant to his uncle, Matthew Cryer, who was a professor of oral surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. Robert Ivy became interested in clefts during his training as the first dental intern at Philadelphia General Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. His interests in maxillofacial injury led him to serve in France in World War I as an assistant to Vilray Blair. After the war, Ivy and Blair's collaboration resulted in two landmark publications by Ivy, Essentials of Oral Surgery and Fractures of the Jaws. Through work with his state representatives in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he was able to start the first cleft palate clinics in Lancaster, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Erie, and Scranton, which provided interdisciplinary care to children in those regions for cleft lip and palate deformities. When Reed Dingman put forth a resolution of the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons condemning oral and maxillofacial surgeons practicing in the hospital setting, Ivy resigned his membership and sent a letter of protest in support of his dental colleagues to the organization that he helped build [20].

In the 1950s, the concept of primary or early bone grafting of the cleft maxillary defect was introduced by Schmid [21]. Although the concept initially was met with enthusiasm from a number of surgeons, primary bone grafting eventually was abandoned because of unfavorable outcomes. During the decades that followed, the negative skeletal, dental, and growth-related consequences of primary bone grafting became better understood [22, 23]. During the early 1970s, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Phillip Boyne, was the first to publish his favorable outcomes using autogenous particulate bone grafts for reconstruction of the cleft maxilla/alveolus later in childhood during the mixed dentition rather than earlier in life [24]. Although Boyne's work and results represented a landmark discovery in the field of cleft reconstruction, cleft palate teams were slow to integrate his approach into their treatment protocols because of the negative associations that lingered after the days of primary bone grafting. Today Boyne's principles of secondary bone grafting represent the standard approach for most of the world's cleft centers [24, 25].

Orthognathic reconstruction of the patient with cleft deformities has been discussed by many authors [26-36]. Early techniques limited some surgeons' options to procedures centered on mandibular setback [37]. During the 1970s, the use of total maxillary osteotomy was pioneered by Bell [38]. His novel ideas provided oral and maxillofacial surgeons with an understanding of the biologic basis for maxillary osteotomy, described the vascular supply that allowed the procedures to be safely performed, and, as a result, incorporated the Le Fort I

osteotomy into modern practice [38]. Since that time a number of technical refinements have been described for use of the Le Fort I osteotomy specifically in patients with clefts. Much of this work has been done by two of Bell's former pupils, Fonseca and Turvey [39], who went on to make substantial contributions to the skeletal reconstruction of patients with clefts. Another dually qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Posnick, has published the most complete descriptions of surgical technique modifications for patients undergoing midfacial advancement in the absence of prior bone graft reconstruction and his extensive experiences with the long-term stability of midfacial advancement after correction of various types of cleft deformities with orthognathic techniques [26-30]. Distraction osteogenesis has gained popularity for correction of midfacial hypoplasia but has yet to show significant advantages over traditional techniques for the majority of patients—in fact, a number of limitations and drawbacks have subsequently dampened the initial enthusiasm for this technique [32, 33, 40-42].

Comprehensive and coordinated care has become more prevalent across the world, involving many different types of specialty care for children with clefts. Evidenced-based care is becoming more prevalent, with pooled data and continued research worldwide. The days of performing procedures purely based on a particular surgeon's clinical experience and opinion are passing. Posnick, Shaw, and others have provided comprehensive, succinct, and evidenced-based discussions on the topics of cleft lip and palate reconstruction from infancy through adolescence that are beginning to take hold in the form of evidenced-based treatment protocols, rather than those projected by thought leaders without substantial evidence [26]. Previous protocols with poor outcomes are being largely discarded, and international data sets are contributing to this discussion. Dentistry and the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery have had significant roles in analyzing data and putting forth new standards of care. These efforts as well as craniofacial training programs associated with oral and maxillofacial surgery units have helped solidify the role of oral and maxillofacial surgery in the comprehensive care of patients with clefts.

# 46.3 Embryology

- Development and growth are key areas to understand so treatment is sequenced while respecting the biology of growth.  
Etiology and genetics continue to be explored by population geneticists and others.

To understand the goals of lip and palate repair from an anatomic standpoint, the cleft surgeon must have an appreciation for the failure of embryogenesis that results in clefting. Critical points in the development of the fetus occur when the fusion of various prominences creates continuity and form to the lip, nose, and palate. Anomalies occur when the normal developmental process is disturbed between these components. Each prominence is composed of ectomesenchyme derived from neural crest tissue of the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Mesoderm also is present within these prominences as mesenchymal tissue. The prescribed destiny of each of these cells and tissues is controlled by various genes to alter the migration, development, and apoptosis and form the normal facial tissues of the fetus. At the molecular level, many interdependent factors exist, such as signal transduction, mechanical stress, and growth factor production, that affect the development of these tissues. Currently, only portions of this complex interplay of growth, development, and apoptosis are clear.

At approximately 6 weeks of human embryologic development, the median nasal prominence fuses with the lateral nasal prominences and maxillary prominences to form the base of the nose, nostrils, and upper lip. The confluence of these anterior components becomes the primary palate. When this mechanism fails, clefts of the lips and/or maxilla occur. At approximately 8 weeks' gestation, the palatal shelves elevate and fuse with the septum to form the intact secondary palate. When one palatal shelf fails to fuse with the other components, a unilateral cleft of the secondary palate occurs. If both palatal shelves fail to fuse with each other and the midline septum, a bilateral cleft of the palate occurs.

Fusion occurs when programmed cell death (apoptosis) occurs at the edges of the palatal shelves. The ectodermal component disintegrates and the mesenchyme fuses to form the intact palate. Soon after this, the anterior primary palate fuses with the secondary palate and ossification occurs. If failure of fusion occurs with any of the above components at any point, a cleft of the primary and/or secondary palates occurs. Clefts may be complete or incomplete based on the degree of this failure of fusion, and this contributes to the variety of clefts that are observed.

# 46.4 Genetics and Etiology

Clefts of the upper lip and palate are the most common major congenital craniofacial abnormality and are present in approximately 1 in 700 live births [43]. Although inheritance may play a role, cleft lip and palate is not considered a single-gene disease. Instead, clefts are

thought to be of a multifactorial etiology with a number of potential contributing factors. These factors may include chemical exposures, radiation, maternal hypoxia, teratogenic drugs, nutritional deficiencies, physical obstruction, and genetic influences. One prevailing theory relates the process of clefting as a point when multiple factors come together to raise the individual above a threshold, at which time the mechanism of fusion fails [44, 45]. Multiple genes recently have been implicated in the etiology of clefting [46-48]. Some of these genes include the FOXE1, IRF6, MSX, LHX, goosecoid, and DLX genes. Additional disturbances in growth factors or their receptors that may be involved in the failure of fusion include fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor.

Clefts of the lip occur more commonly in males than in females [49]. In addition, left-sided cleft lips are more common than right-sided cleft lips, and unilateral cleft lips are more common than bilateral cleft lips [50]. Bilateral clefts of the lip are most often associated with clefting of both the primary and secondary palates. Cleft palate alone is seen in approximately 1 in 2000 live births, an incidence similar in all racial groups [51]. Significant differences in the prevalence of clefts exist when specific ethnic and racial populations are examined. For example, African Americans have a birth prevalence that is less common than the total population, and Asians tend to have a higher prevalence.

In the majority of cases, unilateral cleft lip and palate is an isolated nonsyndromic birth anomaly not associated with any other major anomalies [43, 52, 53]. By comparison, a much greater proportion of patients with an isolated cleft palate have an associated syndrome or sequence [43, 53]. Some of the more common syndromes seen in this group include Stickler, van der Woude, and DiGeorge syndromes. Early diagnosis is important because functional issues may arise early in life and go unnoticed. For example, patients with an isolated cleft palate should be evaluated early by an experienced pediatric ophthalmologist to evaluate the possibility of Stickler syndrome. Patients with Stickler syndrome may have ocular abnormalities that lead to retinal detachment. In an otherwise healthy-appearing child, these findings may be difficult to diagnose, so early visual loss may go unnoticed. In many cases, long-term genetic follow-up is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and provide genetic counseling.

The chances of a recurrence of clefting within a family depend on many factors, including family history, severity, gender, degree of relationship to the affected individual, and the expression of a syndrome. Predicting

the inheritance patterns of families with a history of cleft lip and/or palate can be complicated. A skilled practitioner trained in genetics or dysmorphologist is best equipped to make these determinations based on pedigree analysis and the benefit of particular types of genetic testing. Because most clefts are sporadic, the chances of a family having another child with a cleft after having a child with a unilateral cleft lip and palate in which no family history of clefting is present are approximately  $2 - 4\%$ . The chances are higher if additional family history is present or if the cleft is bilateral [54, 55]. The nature of any genetic influence will have an effect on the presence of a cleft. Such is the case in patients with autosomal-dominant syndromes such as Stickler syndrome, in which  $50\%$  of the children may express the syndrome if one of the parents carries the altered gene.

# 46.5 Classification

The typical classification system used clinically to describe standard clefts of the lip and palate is based on careful anatomic description. Clefts can be unilateral or bilateral; microform, incomplete, or complete; and may involve the lip, nose, primary palate, and/or secondary palates (Fig. 46.1). The presentation of clefts is extremely variable, and the individual repairs are custom tailored to achieve the best symmetry and balance. More severe facial clefting is most commonly described by using Paul Tessier's orbitocentric system of numbering (Fig. 46.2) [56]. Other systems are based on embryologic fusion planes, but these are cumbersome to use in routine clinical practice [57].

# 46.6 Prenatal Counseling

Prenatal counseling should be a part of most all teams, if possible.  
Fetal diagnosis and treatment teams have become more sophisticated in recent years, allowing for diagnosis and significant planning for birth.

Advances in imaging have revolutionized prenatal care and maternal-fetal medicine. Ultrasound images of clefts of the lip currently can be visualized at approximately 16 weeks of gestation [58-60]. Diagnostic images of the palate are more difficult to acquire, making an accurate prenatal diagnosis of a cleft palate less predictable. Anterior palatal structures may be visualized by

using sagittal and coronal views, but this currently requires the latest technology and a skilled ultrasonographer with experience performing this type of study.

When the diagnosis of cleft lip is made during pregnancy, the family can be referred to an experienced surgeon for a prenatal discussion. A prenatal consultation provides an excellent opportunity to explain the diagnosis, review the different stages of cleft lip and palate reconstruction that may be necessary, and prepare the parents for practical considerations such as feeding a child with a cleft palate. This gives the family the opportunity to ask questions, calm fears, and learn about feeding techniques that will be important during the first week of life for their baby. Parents are empowered with this new knowledge, and the preparations made during a prenatal consultation allow them to anticipate the delivery of their baby with a greater comfort level regarding the necessary care of the infant during the early postnatal period. The family is then referred to a cleft and craniofacial team to begin a more thorough interdisciplinary approach, and gain additional specific information that will be important for their neonatal care.

Critical to this process is consultation with a geneticist or dysmorphologist to discuss the issues associated with the birth and the possibility of other

associated deformities. Additional testing may be warranted to evaluate the possibility of associated deformities, syndromes, or sequences that could affect the birthing process. Exceptionally skilled ultrasonographers can visualize airway development and other abnormalities that may require early intervention with fetal surgery, exit procedures, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or surgical airway management (tracheotomy) at the time of delivery. Magnetic resonance imaging often is helpful in determining the more definitive morphology and helping guide the need for intervention early in life, although these events are somewhat rare.

In some health systems, fetal diagnosis and treatment teams are in place to assess issues associated with various deformities diagnosed in the prenatal period. These teams should foster a cohesive environment in which information is exchanged through consultation. Much like the environment of a cleft and craniofacial team, families can get the best information available to consider their baby's treatment decisions with an interdisciplinary care model that is patient (mother and fetus), family, and community oriented. Occasionally, fetal or perinatal intervention may be helpful in specific circumstances, but not for typical cleft lip and palate issues.

# 46.7 Feeding the Child with a Cleft Palate

- Practitioners must understand the feeding principles, and they are critical for early health of the newborn.  
A variety of techniques and bottles are available and designed to address the lack of suction capability.

Children born with isolated cleft lip can feed quite well and even have the opportunity to breastfeed in most instances. However, infants with cleft palate can have difficulty feeding because of the inability to form an adequate seal between the tongue and palate to create sufficient negative pressure to suck fluid from a bottle. Nasal regurgitation and inefficient handling of secretions and foods also may be observed during early development. Specialized nipples and bottles are necessary to improve feeding immediately after birth. The most useful devices combine oversized nipples with reservoir spaces and large openings, a squeezable bottle to push fluid into the nipple assembly, and a one-way valve that allows the bolus of fluid to pass from the bottle to the nipple only to minimize the amount of work the child must perform to feed. These include a variety of nipples with reservoirs that collect a variable volume of liquid that can be expressed more easily when sucking is inefficient or not possible. Bottles that can be squeezed to allow manual flow of liquid to the infant are helpful for improving feeding. No single bottle and nipple combination works better than another; trials with a variety of types using different techniques are helpful to optimize feeding early in life.

Close attention to weight variation is necessary for these children. In general, in  $24\mathrm{h}$ , each infant should ingest approximately 2-3 oz of milk for each pound of weight. Feeding sessions should generally last no longer than  $35\mathrm{min}$  because longer sessions are fatiguing and burn more calories than the baby can consume. Infants should be weighed at least weekly on the same scale, preferably at the pediatrician's office.

The subject of breastfeeding an infant with a cleft palate is controversial, with some practitioners encouraging the practice and others strongly opposed to it. Breastfeeding a newborn has clear advantages, including passive immunologic contribution of the mother to the child in the form of secretory immunoglobulin A, and an experience that enhances bonding between the mother and child during such a critical period [61, 62]. At the same time, the infant's inability to create negative oral pressure often makes successful nursing difficult, and in most instances impossible. Exclusively breast-fed infants with severe dehydration and failure to thrive are relatively common to encounter because of these difficulties. This is especially a concern in infants with a wide

cleft of the secondary palate, a condition in which breastfeeding is usually not be possible. The authors' approach with regard to breastfeeding in the presence of a cleft palate is to use a combined protocol that includes intermittent feeding with the use of a specialized bottle (as described above) and attempts at nursing. Breast milk may be pumped for use with the specialized nipple and bottle that will provide the nutritional and immunologic benefits desired. This also allows the parents to keep a more quantitative record of how many ounces have been ingested over the course of the day; this normally is difficult with breastfeeding alone. At the same time, the mother and baby are not deprived of an opportunity to incorporate breastfeeding into the daily regimen. This approach obviously requires rigorous documentation of the child's weight, consultation with a lactation consultant and infant feeding specialist, and frequent follow-up evaluations through the surgeon and/or pediatrician.

# 46.8 Surgical Treatment Planning and Timing

Proper timing is critical to long-term success.  
- Timing is based upon growth characteristics and individual factors.  
Function is a critical driver but should be balanced against the biological consequences of early intervention.

The timing of cleft lip and palate repair is controversial. Despite a number of meaningful advancements in the care of patients with cleft lip and palate, a lack of consensus exists regarding the timing and specific techniques used during each stage of cleft reconstruction. Surgeons must continue to balance the functional needs, aesthetic concerns, and the issue of ongoing growth carefully when deciding how and when to intervene. In no other type of surgical problem is the issue of early surgery's effect on growth more apparent than in the treatment of cleft lip and palate deformities. The decision to manipulate the tissues of the growing child surgically should not be made lightly and should consider the possible growth restriction that can occur with early surgery. Nevertheless, many patients with congenital deformities benefit from surgical intervention based on functional or psychosocial reasons. Understanding the growth and development of the craniofacial skeleton is critical to the treatment planning process [33]. In many cases, waiting for a greater degree of growth to occur is advantageous unless compelling functional or aesthetic issues are present that cannot or should not wait.

Because of the many different treatment philosophies, the timing of treatment interventions varies considerably among cleft centers. Therefore, producing a timing regimen that everyone agrees on is difficult. Each stage of surgical reconstruction and the suggested timing based on the patient's age are presented in Table 46.1. Special considerations may alter the sequencing or timing of the various procedures based on individual functional or aesthetic needs. Significant differences exist worldwide regarding the timing of different repairs. As of yet, timing of repair cannot be guided by truly definitive level I outcome research.

Cleft lip repair generally is undertaken at some point after 10 weeks of age. Waiting until the child is 10-12 weeks of age permits enough time for a complete medical evaluation of the patient so that any associated congenital defects affecting other organ systems (e.g., cardiac or renal anomalies) may be uncovered. The surgical procedure itself may be easier when the child is slightly larger, and the anatomic landmarks are more prominent and well defined. Historically, the anesthetic risk-related data have suggested that the safest time for surgery in this population of infants could be outlined simply by using the "rule of 10's." This referred to the idea of delaying lip repair until the child was at least 10 weeks old, 10 pounds in weight, and with a minimum hemoglobin level of  $10\mathrm{mg / dL}$  [63, 64]. Today, more sophisticated pediatric anesthetic techniques, advances in intraoperative monitoring, and improved anesthetic agents have all resulted in the ability to provide safe gen

eral anesthesia much earlier in life [65]. Despite this ability, no measurable benefit exists to performing lip repair before 3 months of age [64, 66, 67]. Some surgeons have advocated that lip repair be carried out in the first days of infancy based on the idea of capitalizing on early "fetal-like" healing. Unfortunately, these hoped-for benefits have not been observed, and problems with excessive scarring and less-favorable outcomes have been encountered [68-70]. Children may have more scarring at this early age, and their tissues are smaller and more difficult to manipulate. Consequently, the aesthetic outcomes may be worse if surgery is performed at an earlier age. Because no clear benefits exist for earlier repair, the recommendations for repair remain at approximately 3 months of age or later.

Cleft palate repair usually is performed at approximately 9-18 months of age. In deciding the timing of the repair, the surgeon must consider the delicate balance between facial growth restriction after early surgery and speech development that requires an intact palate. Most children require an intact palate to produce certain speech sounds by 18 months of age. If developmental delay is present and speech will not likely develop until later, then the repair can be delayed further. Little evidence suggests any benefit to palate repair before 9 months of age [71-73]. Repairs before this time are associated with a much higher incidence of maxillary hypoplasia later in life and show no improvements in speech. For these reasons, most surgeons perform primary palate repair at approximately 9-18 months of age.

As these children continue to develop, a significant percentage will have inadequate closure of the velopharyngeal mechanism (e.g., velopharyngeal insufficiency [VPI]) even after successful palate repair, which may produce hypernasal and less intelligible speech [74]. These children usually are diagnosed at 3-5 years of age when a detailed speech examination can be obtained by a skilled speech pathologist familiar with craniofacial speech care. When VPI is shown to be consistent and caused by a definable anatomic defect, surgery may be helpful. A pharyngeal flap or sphincter pharyngoplasty may be used to treat VPI, with the goal of improving closure between the oral and nasal cavities and reducing nasal air escape during the production of certain sounds. In some select cases, when muscular reconfiguration has not been optimized during the primary palate repair, repeat palate rerepair may be considered with a two-flap palatoplasty with intravelar veloplasty or double-opposing Z-plasty technique.

Approximately  $75\%$  of patients with any type of cleft have clefting of the maxilla and alveolus [24-26]. Bone graft reconstruction of this site is performed during the mixed dentition before the eruption of the per

manent canine and/or the permanent lateral incisor. The timing of this procedure is based on dental development and not chronologic age. On the basis of work by Boyne, most surgeons reconstruct this area during the mixed dentition before eruption of the permanent canine. Earlier reconstruction of this area has been associated with a high degree of maxillary growth restriction, requiring orthognathic treatment later in life in a much higher percentage of patients [22, 24]. The gold standard for reconstruction in this area is autogenous bone from the anterior iliac crest. Cranial bone, rib, tibia, symphysis of the mandible, zygoma, bone-morphogenic protein, and allogeneic bone have all been studied, but none has been shown to be appreciably better than the iliac crest [26, 75, 76]. Bone morphogenic protein is not approved by the FDA for that indication in children.

Orthognathic reconstruction of maxillary and mandibular discrepancies is performed at 14-18 years of age based on individual growth characteristics [26-36, 38]. This is done in conjunction with orthodontics before and after surgery. However, in some cases of severe maxillary hypoplasia, early Le Fort I osteotomy may be performed to optimize facial aesthetics and occlusion with the supposition that revision osteotomies will likely be necessary. These early osteotomies may complicate later treatment. Early orthognathic maxillary advancement is reserved for the most severe dysmorphology, and in most cases, the authors prefer standard orthognathic techniques timed in the standard fashion [31-33]. Attempts at using distraction osteogenesis have been associated with a higher complication rate than standard orthognathic techniques—particularly in those individuals who are not skeletally mature [32, 42, 77].

As with the timing of other interventions, lip and nasal revision is best reserved for after the majority of growth is complete. Most of the lip and nasal growth is complete after age 5 years. Lip revision may be considered just before school begins, at approximately 5 years of age or later. However, this may be performed earlier if the deformity is severe. For similar reasons, nasal revision is performed after age 5 years because most of the nasal growth is complete by this time. If orthognathic reconstruction is likely, then rhinoplasty usually is best performed after orthognathic surgery because maxillary advancement improves many characteristics of nasal support. However, when nasal deformity is particularly severe, rhinoplasty can be considered earlier even if orthognathic surgery is expected. Multiple early revisions of the lip or nose should be avoided so that excess scarring does not potentially impair ongoing growth.

# 46.9 Technical Considerations for Cleft Lip and Palate Repair

Presurgical manipulation techniques are controversial.  
Differences between repair techniques for lip and palate repairs are theoretical based on the available literature to date such that no one repair is clearly superior to another for most patients.

# 46.10Presurgical Taping and Presurgical Orthopedics

Facial taping with elastic devices may be used for application of selective external pressure and may improve lip and nasal position before the lip repair procedure. In the authors' opinions, these techniques often have greater impact in cases of wide bilateral cleft lip and palate in which manipulation of the premaxillary segment may make primary repair technically easier. Although one of the basic surgical tenets of wound repair is to close wounds under minimal tension, attempts at improving the arrangement of the segments by using taping methods have not shown a measurable improvement [78-80].

Some surgeons prefer presurgical orthopedic (PSO) appliances, such as the nasoalveolar molding (NAM) appliance, rather than lip taping to achieve similar goals [81, 82]. PSO appliances are composed of a custom-made acrylic base plate that provides improved anchorage in the molding of lip, nasal, and alveolar structures during the presurgical phase of treatment (Fig. 46.3).

$\bullet$  Fig. 46.3 Frontal and lateral views of the Grayson nasoalveolar molding appliance showing the nasal projections that theoretically help mold the nasal cartilages and maxillary segments into a more appropriate configuration before repair

Although the use of appliances probably allows an easier surgical repair by placing the components closer prior to surgery, clinical evidence is lacking to demonstrate any measurable improvement in aesthetics of the nose or lip, dental arch relation, tooth survival, or occlusion of the patient. Studies have looked at the dental arch relations and other outcomes in patients who have infant presurgical orthopedic devices, and no improvement was seen [83, 84]. In addition, no long-term improvement in speech outcome has been demonstrated in patients who had PSOs [85]. The majority of the evidence also refutes the early claim that feeding appliances are helpful over the long term. Furthermore, concerns regarding potential negative consequences of these types of appliances have been raised [86]. PSOs also add significant cost and time to treatment early in the child's life, including additional travel expenses and time away from work or home for the family. Many appliances require a general anesthetic for the initial impression used to fabricate the device. Frequent appointments are necessary to monitor the anatomic changes and periodic appliance adjustment.

The Latham appliance was popular for expanding and aligning the maxillary segments of the patient with a cleft palate [87]. It is a pin-retained device inserted into the palate with acrylic extensions onto the alveolar ridges. A screw mechanism is then used to manipulate the segments as desired. The Latham appliance used with gingivoperiosteoplasty has been shown to be associated with significant growth restriction of the midface when used in infancy to approximate the segments for repair [86]. Children who have had Latham appliances have been shown to have significant midfacial growth restriction in adolescence  $100\%$  of the time, whereas children who have not had the Latham appliance have midface hypoplasia  $25 - 35\%$  of the time [42, 80, 86].

The Grayson nasoalveolar molding (NAM) appliance has become popular with some centers in attempts to manipulate the segments without pin retention before lip and nose repair (see  $\triangleright$  Fig. 35.3). The nasoalveolar molding appliance is adjustable by removing or adding acrylic and manipulating protrusive elements that attempt to mold the nasal cartilages. This device attempts to align the alveolar segments, lip structures, and nasal cartilages to optimize repair. Unfortunately, the hoped-for advantages of this appliance have not been realized. In addition, no long-term data are available regarding growth in the craniofacial skeleton after using this protocol. The limited short-term data that are available cannot be extrapolated to determine the ultimate outcome on growth, function, or aesthetics. Many surgeons use gingivoperiosteoplasty in conjunction with

the PSO, using limited flaps to close the alveolus cleft during the primary repair of the lip or palate. Many surgeons who use this appliance in conjunction with their primary lip repairs perform a gingivoperiosteoplasty in attempts to have bone form at the alveolus. This is more easily performed with the segments aligned in close proximity because the flaps are small [82]. Experiences with similar protocols in the 1960s involving primary bone grafting had poor results regarding growth [22, 23]. Subsequent studies have confirmed the high incidence of growth restriction in this population. In addition, no convincing, long-term, objective data have shown improvement in either lip or nose aesthetics.

In their current state of technical refinement, no evidence exists that any of the PSOs offer an improved outcome with regarding aesthetics, function, or growth in patients with cleft lip and palate. Coupled with the fact that appliances are time consuming and have a high cost of fabrication and utilization, advocating their uniform use is difficult. As with other interventions considered for patients with clefts, costly and unproven interventions should be avoided, although they may prove to be helpful in select cases [88]. A subset of more severe clefts does benefit from the devices. Perhaps long-term data will be forthcoming and positive to help determine which patients may benefit from PSO appliance treatment.

# 46.11 Lip Adhesion

Some surgeons attempt to surgically approximate the segments of the cleft lip before definitive lip repair in an attempt to achieve a better relation of both the lip structures and the dental arches [89-91]. This is achieved by advancing small flaps of tissue across the cleft site. Some surgeons advocate the use of this technique in wide bilateral clefts, but it rarely is performed in unilateral cases. The lip adhesion usually is completed at 3 months of age. In most cases, this will convert a wide, complete cleft into a wide, incomplete cleft because the scar eventually will be excised from the cleft site, recreating a similar wide deformity. The definitive lip repair is then completed 3-9 months later by excising the scar and reapproximating the remaining lip structures. Furthermore, at the second procedure, the tissue to work with when performing the definitive repair usually is less supple. As with most endeavors in cleft surgery, repeated early interventions tend to complicate later refinements because of excessive scarring. In general, adequate mobilization of the flaps in one stage will make tension-free skin closure possible in most cases without

the need for taping, presurgical orthopedic appliances, and/or lip adhesion.

# 46.12 Primary Unilateral Cleft Lip Repair

Unilateral clefts of the lip and nose present with a high degree of variability; thus, each repair design is unique (see  $\triangleright$  Fig. 35.1) [26, 92]. The repair technique preferred by the authors for cleft lip and nasal deformities is shown in Figs. 46.4 and 46.5 and usually is performed after 10 weeks of age [17, 18, 26, 63]. The basic premise

of the repair is to create a three-layered closure of skin, muscle, and mucosa that approximates normal tissue and excises hypoplastic tissue at the cleft margins. Critical in the process is the reconstruction of the orbicularis oris musculature into a continuous sphincter. The Millard rotation advancement technique has the advantage of allowing each of the incision lines to fall within the natural contours of the lip and nose. This is an advantage because achieving mirror-image symmetry in the unilateral cleft lip and nose is difficult with the normal side immediately adjacent to the surgical site. A Z-plasty technique such as the Tennison-Randall repair

$\square$  Fig. 46.6 A typical scar that may result from a Z-plasty lengthening repair. Although the length and symmetry of the lip are good, an unnatural contour can occur because of the Z shape of the closure

may not achieve this level of symmetry because the Z-shaped scar is directly adjacent to the linear nonclefted philtrum (Fig. 46.6). Also, achieving symmetry is more difficult when the rotation portion of the cleft is quite short compared with the advancement segment.

Primary nasal reconstruction is often considered at the time of lip repair to reposition the displaced lower lateral cartilages and alar tissues. Several techniques are advocated, and considerable variation exists regarding the exact nasal reconstruction performed by each surgeon [93, 94]. The primary nasal repair may be achieved by releasing the alar base, augmenting the area with allogeneic dermal grafts, or even performing a more aggressive version of an open rhinoplasty. Because lip repair is performed at such an early point in growth and development, the authors prefer minimal surgical dissection because of the effects of scarring on the subsequent growth of these tissues. McComb described a technique that has become popular which consists of dissecting the lower lateral cartilages free from the alar base and the surrounding attachments through an alar crease incision [93, 95-97]. This allows the nose to be bolstered and/or stented from within the nostril to improve symmetry. Individuals, who favor the functional repair described by Dellaire, often consider septal repositioning and

direct repair of the perinasal musculature to encourage symmetry of the nose and lip system as the structures continue additional growth to maturity in the teen years.

# 46.13Primary Bilateral Lip Repair

Bilateral cleft lip repair can be one of the most challenging technical procedures performed in children with clefts. The lack of quality tissue present and the widely displaced segments are major challenges to achieving exceptional results, but superior technique and complete mobilization of the tissue flaps usually yield excellent aesthetic results (Figs. 46.7, 46.8, 46.9, and 46.10). In addition, the columella may be quite short in length, and the premaxillary segment may be significantly rotated. Adequate mobilization of the segments and attention to the details of using only appropriately developed tissue will yield excellent results even in the face of significant asymmetry.

Some surgeons have used techniques to lengthen the columella surgically and preserve hypoplastic tissue with banked fork flaps [98, 99]. Early and aggressive tissue flaps in the nostril and columella areas do not look natural after significant growth has occurred and result in abnormal tissue contours. Although surgical attempts at lengthening the columella initially may look good, they frequently look abnormally long and excessively angular later in life (Fig. 46.11). Revision of these iatrogenic deformities is difficult, and some of the contour irregularities cannot be adequately revised. If the hypoplastic tissue is excised and incisions within the medial nasal base and columella are avoided, the long-term aesthetic results usually are excellent.

The authors prefer a primary nasal reconstruction that can be performed in a similar fashion to the technique described by McComb [100]. This allows release and repositioning of the lower lateral cartilages and alar base on both sides without aggressive degloving of the entire nasal complex. Other open rhinoplasty techniques have been suggested that use direct incision on the nasal tip or prolabial unwinding techniques [100-103]. As with most early maneuvers, aggressive rhinoplasty at this time may incur early scarring that affects growth potential of the surrounding tissues, making revision more difficult and long-term aesthetics less than ideal. Good results can be achieved with a number of different techniques.

musculature is approximated in the midline with multiple interrupted and/or mattress sutures. This is a critical step in the total reconstruction of the functional lip. No musculature is present in the premaxillary segment, which must be brought to the midline from each lateral advancement flap. The nasal floor flaps are sutured at this time as well.

# 46.14Cleft Palate Repair

The term primary palate is used to describe the anatomic structures anterior to the incisive foramen (e.g., the alveolar ridge, maxilla, piriform rim). The term secondary palate refers to structures posterior to the incisive foramen. Therefore, when surgeons refer to the initial or primary cleft palate repair, they are in fact describing the closure of the secondary palate structures, which include the hard palate, soft palate, and uvula. The structures of the embryologic primary palate are reconstructed later in childhood during the cleft maxillary/alveolar bone graft procedure.

Cleft palate repair during infancy has two main goals: (1) the water-tight closure of the entire oronasal communication involving the hard and soft palates, and (2) the anatomic repair of the musculature within the soft palate, which is critical for normal creation of speech. The soft palate, or velum, is part of the complex coupling and decoupling of the oral and nasal cavities involved in the production of speech. When a cleft of the soft palate is present, abnormal muscle insertions are located at the posterior edge of the hard palate. Surgery

must be aimed at the release of abnormal muscle insertions, not simply closing the palatal defect. Muscle continuity with correct orientation should be established so that the velum may serve as a dynamic structure.

The exact timing of repair of a palate cleft is controversial. In general, the velum should be closed before the development of speech sounds that require an intact palate. On average, this level of speech production is observed by approximately 18 months of age in the normally developing child. If the repair is completed after this time, compensatory speech articulations may result. Repair completed before this time allows the intact velum to close effectively, appropriately separating the nasopharynx from the oropharynx during certain speech sounds [104-107].

In patients with cleft palate, concerns for normal speech development frequently are balanced with the known biologic consequences of surgery during infancy, namely, the problem of surgery during the growth phase resulting in maxillary growth restriction [33, 72, 73, 108]. When repair of the palate is performed between 9 and 18 months of age, the incidence of associated growth restriction affecting the maxillary development

is approximately  $25\%$  [31, 33, 109-111]. If repair is carried out earlier than 9 months of age, severe growth restriction requiring future orthognathic surgery is seen with greater frequency [22, 26, 31, 33, 109, 112-114]. At the same time, proceeding with palatoplasty before 9 months of age is not associated with any increased benefit in terms of speech development, so the result is an increase in growth-related problems with an absence

columella lengthening and banked fork flaps during his initial repair.  
c Lateral view of the patient from b with a columella that is long and has a tip oriented downward

of any functional benefit [115, 116]. When using only chronologic age, carrying out the operation during the 9- to 18-month timeline seems to best balance the need to address functional concerns such as speech development with the potential negative impact on growth. To date, no case-controlled, rigorous clinical trial has examined what is likely the most critical factor in dictating the exact timing of cleft repair—the individual child's true

language age. In cases in which significant developmental delay is present, surgery should be delayed because speech formation is not yet an issue, and benefit in terms of growth of the maxilla is likely. Delaying palatal closure is relevant in situations in which the cleft palate is associated with other complex medical conditions, neurodevelopmental delay, complex craniofacial anomalies, and/or the presence of a tracheotomy.

Another approach used to balance speech issues with growth-related concerns is to stage the closure of the secondary palate with two operations. In general, this involves the repair of the soft palate early in life as an initial step followed by closure of the hard palate later in infancy with or without the use of an obturator. The idea is that timely repair of the soft palate, which is critical for speech, is accomplished, whereas hard palate repair with mucoperiosteal stripping is delayed until growth is further along [117, 118]. Although this technique is not advocated by the majority of surgeons in the United States, some surgeons may believe that repairing the hard palate later may offer the advantages of less growth restriction, easier repair of larger clefts, and less chance for fistula formation. No convincing definitive data exist to favor this approach over a single-stage repair, but the practice is continued by some centers when evidence suggests some benefit—particularly regarding growth. In contrast, most speech-language pathologists prefer closure of the palate as a single operation [117].

Cleft palate reconstruction requires the mobilization of multilayered flaps to reconstruct the defect because of the failure of fusion of the palatal shelves. In general, when the initial palate closure is performed, this refers to closure of the tissues posterior to the incisive foramen. This is done in a layered fashion by first closing the nasal mucosa and then the oral mucosa. Because the main function of the palate is to close the space between the nasopharynx and oropharynx during certain speech sounds, the surgeon also must reconstruct the musculature of the velopharyngeal mechanism. The musculature of the levator palatini is abnormally inserted and invested within the tissue near the posterior aspect of the hard palate. The musculature therefore must be deinserted and reconstructed in the midline to create an adequately functional velum [26, 119]. Therefore, the soft palate is closed in three layers by approximating the nasal mucosa, levator musculature, and the oral mucosa. The hard palate portion is closed in two layers by using nasal mucosa flaps and then oral mucosa flaps. Both the hard and soft palate repairs must be done in a tension-free manner to avoid wound breakdown and fistula formation. Adequate mobilization of the flaps during the dissection is essential to achieve tension-free closure. At times, some surgeons may elect to incorporate vomer

flaps or acellular dermal matrix into the repair if mobilization of the lateral flaps to the midline is difficult.

Many techniques have been described for repair of the palate, and the controversies among these techniques are described later in this text [120-127]. The Bardach two-flap palatoplasty uses two large, full-thickness flaps that are mobilized with layered dissection of the soft palate and brought to the midline for closure (Fig. 46.12) [26, 120]. This technique preserves the palatal neurovascular bundle as well as a lateral pedicle for adequate blood supply. The von Langenbeck technique is similar to the Bardach palatoplasty but preserves an anterior pedicle for increased blood supply to the flaps [26, 121]. This technique also is successful in achieving a layered closure but may be more difficult when suturing the nasal mucosa near the anteriorly based pedicle attachments. The authors do not favor push-back techniques because they may incur more palatal scarring, restrict growth, and do not show a measurable benefit in speech.

Another common technique is the Furlow double-opposing Z-plasty, which attempts to lengthen the palate by taking advantage of a Z-plasty technique on both the nasal mucosa and the oral mucosa (Fig. 46.13) [26, 124-127]. This technique can be effective at closing the palate but has been reported by some to have a higher rate of fistula formation at the junction of the soft and hard palates, where theoretical lengthening of the soft palate may compromise the closure [26, 128-133]. Some surgeons use interpositional acellular dermal matrix at the time of primary repair to combat this often-seen complication.

No benefit has been convincingly demonstrated with any particular repair technique when looking at dental arch form, speech outcome, feeding, or any other functional variable. At this point in our understanding, surgeons often consider their own experiences and training when repairing clefts because definitive data suggesting that one repair is preferable over another are lacking.

In very wide clefts, some surgeons advocate considering a pharyngeal flap at the primary palatoplasty procedure to assist in closure because revision palatoplasty is sometimes unsuccessful in eradicating fistulas. Those who use this technique usually perform it in extremely wide clefts and do so quite selectively. This allows the central portion of the closure to be filled with posterior pharyngeal wall tissue, making the closure of the nasal and palatal mucosa easier. Patients with Pierre Robin sequence or Treacher Collins syndrome may have exceptionally wide clefts that are difficult to close with no tension, and this technique may be considered for them. The drawbacks of using a pharyngeal flap during the repair of the palate include an increased risk for complications such as bleeding, snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, and hyponasality.

The anterior portion (anterior to the incisive foramen) of the cleft is not reconstructed until the mixed dentition stage. c A layered closure is performed in the Bardach palatoplasty by reapproximating the nasal mucosa.

palate. They are then reapproximated in the midline to create a dynamic functional sling for speech purposes. d Once the nasal mucosa and musculature of the soft palate are approximated, the oral mucosa is closed in the midline. The lateral releasing incisions are quite easily closed primarily because of the length gained from the depth of the palate. In rare cases, in very wide clefts, a portion of the lateral incisions may remain open and granulate by secondary intention

# 46.15 Complex Facial Clefting

Clefting of the facial structures other than the typical nasolabial region is rare and often presents difficult challenges to the reconstructive cleft surgeon. Therefore, consideration should be given to referring patients with

complex facial clefting to surgeons with experience in this particular area. Comprehensive interdisciplinary care is important to achieve the best results, including involvement of neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthodontics, speech pathology, and other members of the craniofacial team. Some interventions such as eye lubri

Note the cutbacks creating the nasal side flaps, highlighted in blue. c The flaps are then transposed to theoretically lengthen the soft palate. A nasal  
side closure is completed in the standard fashion anterior to the junction of the hard and soft palates. In general, this junction is the highest area of tension and can be difficult to close. This contributes to the higher fistula rate in this type of repair at this location. d The oral side flaps are then transposed and closed in a similar fashion, completing the palate closure

cation may be necessary within hours after birth, and accurate prenatal diagnosis of severe facial clefting is helpful in planning for early care.

The etiology of the various facial clefts may be related to failure of embryologic fusion, physical obstruction in fetal life, association with an encephalocele or tumor, amniotic bands, or other anatomic disruptions during fetal life [55]. The majority of complex facial clefts are sporadic events not related to a single-gene disease. Many complex facial clefts involve the orbit, and the classification system most often used is orbitocentric in design (see Fig. 46.2). Tessier [56] described a numbering system for facial clefting phenomenon to make description and surgical planning more easily discussed. Other systems exist but have a more cumbersome nomenclature [57].

Primary repair of severe facial clefts often is more difficult than even the most difficult standard bilateral clefts [134-136]. Although mobilization of the lip and nose structures is rather straightforward, the closure of clefts in the orbital region can be challenging because of the lack of eyelid and adjacent tissue for advancement and/or rotation. Revision surgery is the norm in this group and may include a skilled ophthalmologic surgeon early in the process for the best functional and aesthetic results.

The staged reconstruction of these types of severe facial clefts is similar to the more common cleft lip and palate protocols. However, several functional issues are present in patients with complex facial clefting that require more immediate attention. For example, patients with large Tessier 7 clefts may have problems with retaining food in their oral cavities because of the discontinuity at the orbicularis oris and modiolus (Fig. 46.14). This may prompt early repair and reestablishment of the musculature for functional concerns. An attempt to reposition the elevators, depressors, and risorius (if present) is helpful, rather than just focusing on the orbicularis oris. Similar to a functional lip repair, these elements will support the region better if completely reconstructed.

For patients with orbital clefts, a skilled pediatric ophthalmologist should evaluate the child very early to avoid severe corneal abrasion and desiccation. Immediate lubrication of the globes is necessary to prevent severe, irreversible corneal damage until eyelid structures can be mobilized to cover the globe adequately. Early after birth, tarsorrhaphy stitches can be used to gain adequate closure of the lids for corneal protection. Ignoring the need for eye protection may result in severe corneal scarring that may cause blindness and prompt consideration for corneal transplantation. Corneal transplantation in infants often is not successful but is possible in patients with severe orbito

facial clefts. Another concern is the support of the globes at the orbit floor that may be involved in some facial clefts. The timing of orbital reconstruction depends on the functional needs of the cleft area in each patient. These are some of the concerns present in complex facial clefting, and an individualized and customized treatment plan must be formulated.

# 46.16Outcome Assessment

Heterogeneous patient populations make level I evidence very difficult to produce.  
Outcome assessment must occur over long periods of time due to growth characteristic and also involve very large numbers of patients to attempt to account for many confounding variables.

Decision making in cleft care should involve evidenced-based research and a critical look at outcomes. It should also include outcomes that are important to the patient—not just those that are prescribed by clinicians. Unfortunately, little high-quality, evidenced-based research is available to guide clinicians through the many treatment protocols for cleft care [113]. Most studies are not level I evidence because of the high degree of heterogeneity of the population being studied and that population's tendency to migrate in many countries. This typically requires very large patient numbers to attempt to control for a number of variables, including the individual surgeon's capabilities.

Although the clinical experience of the surgeon certainly has value, this must be integrated with a constant review of evidence-based research. Enthusiasm by a surgeon or a particular group of surgeons regarding a specific intervention because of personal experiences may help popularize that intervention, but typically little outcome data support its use. Too frequently the long-term results are not forthcoming, and the treatment regimen may still persist. Unfortunately, some of the treatment protocols used today are based on individual enthusiasm, poor outcomes, and mishaps rather than regimens chosen as a consequence of statistically valid and published evidence of the actual success of a particular treatment. The United Kingdom and other European centers have collaborated to pool data and provide more meaningful assessments of outcome. The continued study should help teams understand interventions and their potential consequences in greater detail.

In addition, the pressures of a costly health care system have made treatment decision questions even harder to investigate than ever before [88]. A need to understand the outcome differences of various treatment phi

losophies will be critical to help determine which protocols will be most beneficial to the patient without extending valuable health care resources on unproven or ineffective methods. For this reason, among many others, the need to abandon unproven and unnecessary interventions has never been greater. Outcomes studies based on results such as appearance, facial growth, occlusion, patient satisfaction, and psychosocial development are all critical in this process. Cleft care that is value-based, in the broadest sense of the term, is an important goal for every team and individual clinician who works in this subdiscipline. Surgeons involved in the care of patients with clefts must critically review the literature on a regular basis and not be tempted by poorly evaluated techniques popularized by clinical reports—particularly those that incur added cost and are not value-based decisions.

# Conclusion

The comprehensive care of patients with clefts requires an interdisciplinary approach that demands precise surgical execution of the various procedures necessary to treat cleft deformities effectively. Long-term follow-up with an interdisciplinary team is an essential component of this process so that complete and efficient care is provided. Furthermore, clinicians experienced in and dedicated to the comprehensive interdisciplinary care of patients with clefts are best equipped to deal with these concerns. The treatment of patients with cleft and craniofacial deformities should be free of bias and demand team care that is patient, family, and community-oriented, rather than surgeon, specialty, or health system-centered. Only in this fashion can the overall treatment be optimally successful. This type of care maximizes the patient's ability to grow into adulthood and succeed in life without focusing on his or her deformity.
