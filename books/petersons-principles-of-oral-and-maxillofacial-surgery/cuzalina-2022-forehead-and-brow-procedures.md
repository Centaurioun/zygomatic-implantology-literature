# Learning Objectives

To obtain a thorough understanding of the detailed surgical anatomy of the upper facial third  
To learn which patients would benefit most from a forehead and brow lift  
To acquire an excellent knowledge of various brow lifting techniques  
- To learn how to treat one brow lift technique over another based on diagnosis  
To learn how to prevent the most common complications with brow lifting

# Important Points

- Adequate release of specific adherent tissues adjacent to the orbital ligament is key to long-term brow elevation  
Over-elevation of the medial brow is the key reason for creating an undesirable surprised looking postoperative appearance  
- Lateral brow elevation immediately above the orbital rim is attractive for most females but too feminizing for the male patient  
- Transection of glabellar depressor muscles can decrease dynamic wrinkles, but over resection can potentially produce unwanted forehead atrophy

Upper facial cosmetic surgery is a pivotal focus point in the art of facial rejuvenation. More than ever, a large percentage of the population desire to look and feel rejuvenated. Endoscopic techniques among other fast healing options are aimed at creating a more youthful and natural appearance [1-3]. While some older techniques, such as an open coronal brow lift, are still used for boney manipulation such as in gender reassignment patients with frontal bossing, other options are now more common in comparison with routine brow lifting. Variations on the hairline or trichophytic open brow lift may be the perfect treatment for a patient with an extremely high highline, deep horizontal forehead lines, or simply brow ptosis. The ultimate goal of improving a person's appearance remains unchanged. Society shapes our views of what looks attractive, and no mathematical formula can ever be used to determine an ideal eyebrow position (Fig. 75.1). Each individual has his or her own unique perception of facial beauty. For most people, the upper face and eyes impart more emotion than does any other parts of the human body; it is clear that rejuvenation of this vital area can provide an aesthetically pleasing result.

Aesthetic concerns of the forehead and brow regions of the face affect a wide range of age groups. Unlike the standard lower face and neck rhytidectomy, which more

commonly affects patients over the age of 45 years, cosmetic concerns in the upper third of the face may be evident for patients in their 20s and 30s owing to genetic predisposition. The forehead and brow area must be entirely evaluated for a wide range of interlacing diagnoses. Matching the problem(s) to the ideal rejuvenation technique(s) is essential for maximum aesthetic benefits. For example, old deep and scarred in lines in the glabella typically cannot be adequately treated with a brow lift alone and may require fillers, fat grafting, resurfacing, or even direct excision in some instances. Another example is hollowing in the lateral brow of temple area that requires filling by various methods such as temple implants, filler, or fat versus brow lifting. Simple laxity and brow ptosis due to age and gravity encompass only a portion of the forehead and brow dilemmas that must be addressed when planning rejuvenation procedures (  $\square$  Fig. 75.2).

Genetic brow ptosis is more common than many realize. Patients in their early 20s may complain of lower than desired brow position and that one of both parents had similar issues. A family predisposition plus the general aging process typically leads to significant forehead and brow ptosis. It is important to distinguish whether the ptosis above the eyes in the forehead and brow region is due to problems with brow position, upper eyelid laxity, or a combination of the two (Fig. 75.3). Other problems such as dynamic lines caused by muscle activity in the glabellar region, variable hairline patterns, bony abnormalities, and asymmetries, as well as skin texture itself, must also be assessed in relation to one another. Achieving the patient's desired expectation depends on sound surgical skill and judgment as well as communication between the surgeon and the patient. Truthful disclosure of what can reasonably be attained is prudent and helps to prevent patient dissatisfaction.

Rejuvenation of the upper third of the face is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling procedures a surgeon can offer to selected patients. Selective elevation and correction of lateral hooding should remain natural yet impart a tremendous improvement to the patient's overall beauty and youthful appearance (Fig. 75.4). The goal of this chapter is to review the anatomy of the upper facial third specific to forehead and brow rejuvenation techniques and to discuss in detail how to perform a variety of the most common techniques for rejuvenating the forehead and brow region.

# 75.1 Anatomic and Aesthetic Considerations

It is generally accepted that a youthful forehead is roughly one-third of the overall facial height [4-9]. Essentially, the distance from the hairline to the glabella is equal to the distance from the glabella to the point at the base of the columella or subnasale (Fig. 75.5). A youthful-appearing eyebrow is notably different for men and women. The female eyebrow should be arched with the highest point of the brow on a sagittal line from the lateral canthus [10, 11]. The entire brow itself should be just above the orbital rim. In general, the medial brow of the female is located ideally  $1 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  above the orbital rim and the lateral third of the brow  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  above the rim [12]. This is in contrast to a typical male eyebrow that should lie at or only slightly above the orbital rim in a more horizontal or uniform arch fashion (Fig. 75.6). Elevating the lateral third of the male eyebrow disproportionately more than the remaining brow will create a feminine appearance. Elevation of the medial brow well above the orbital rim or proportionately more than the

texture must also be evaluated. b One month after a coronal brow lift, upper blepharoplasties, and full-face laser resurfacing

outer brow creates a very unnatural and very "operated" appearance. Over elevation of the medial brow creates an odd surprised look that should be avoided at all cost.

The detailed anatomy of individual areas has been well described in the literature and often relates to the specific procedure being performed [13-25]. Therefore,

the following anatomic discussion is simplified by separating the specific regions into bony landmarks, muscle and fascial anatomy, vessel and nerve anatomy, and specific endoscopic anatomy; each anatomic region is addressed individually as it relates to specific surgical procedures.

# 75.2 Bony Landmarks

The Frontal bone in the forehead and brow region makes up most of the bone in the upper third of the face. The connections to the frontal bone (suture lines such as the nasofrontal, zygomaticofrontal, and coronal) are important landmarks because they can be clinically relevant

for limits of dissection and can help surgeons determine their location during dissection. For instance, the zygomaticofrontal suture line is a common location to end the most basic brow lift dissections (Fig. 75.7). Additional dissection can be performed if midface lifting is also planned or if the patient desires more elevation at the lateral canthal region. Overaggressive dissection especially along the inside edge of the orbital rim in this area can create an unnatural cat-eye appearance. Likewise, the nasofrontal suture line is a nice landmark to note during dissection for a few reasons. First, dissection usually needs to proceed only a few millimeters below this suture level onto the nasal bones for adequate release. Second, the paired procerus muscles can be identified here and transection performed if required. Third, depending on the level of horizontal transection in this area, the nasofrontal angle point of take-off can be altered slightly if desired. Last, nasal tip rotation can be achieved if wanted, especially with significant dissection below the nasofrontal suture line.

Another general bony landmark is the orbital rim, which limits inferior dissection but must be well visualized and free of periosteal attachments to lift the brow and brow fat pads for long-term results. Important muscle and fascial attachments are also located at the level of the orbital rim medially and laterally. The tenacious temporal fusion line (zone of fixation) that exists along the temporal ridge must be identified during dissection

[26, 27]. It is also important to know its location preoperatively so that proper incision placement can be made to facilitate a clean dissection under this area that enhances visualization endoscopically (Fig. 75.8).

Bony thickness varies in different areas of the skull. In addition, venous lakes present on the inside surface of the skull tend to be more centralized around the sagittal suture line. If bone tunnels or screws are planned for fixation purposes, the midline should be avoided, if possible, because of the sagittal sinus and higher-density venous lakes in this area (Fig. 75.9). Thickness does increase posteriorly near the occiput, but screw or bone

![](images/a403e7d6404065053b0d207fe10b563b5bdf93d1c02a915a00dbc672e6a59677.jpg)  
Fig. 75.7 Periosteal elevator shown at a more aggressive level of dissection to elevate the lateral canthus slightly, if desired. Fascial and muscle attachments are labeled. Elevation at this level detaches only the superficial layer of the lateral canthal tendon. (The deep portion of the lateral canthus is  $5\mathrm{mm}$  within the orbital rim attached to Whitnall's tubercle)

tunnel fixation here is more challenging and is not required. Caution must be taken also to avoid lateral placement because of thinness of the lateral skull and the middle meningeal arteries. Knowledge of average thickness for a given location and internal anatomy indicates that the safest location for bone tunnels or screws is located along a parasagittal line approximately at the midpupil or lateral limbus line and just anterior to the coronal suture (see Fig. 75.9).

# 75.3 Muscle and Fascial Anatomy

Paired muscles of the forehead and brow region are often thought of as elevators and depressors. Although several depressor muscles can pull the brow down or obliquely, the only true elevator of the forehead, the frontalis, moves upward to raise the brow. This movement, along with some static tone, not only maintains brow position but also can lead to horizontal creases over time. The frontalis originates from the deep galeal plane (galea aponeurotica that connects to the occipitalis posteriorly). It inserts into the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi, which inserts into the dermis immediately below the eyebrow. Its lateral extension fuses into the dense collection of fascia almost  $1\mathrm{cm}$  wide, called the zone of adherence, which extends along the superior temporal line and ends inferiorly just above the zygomaticofrontal suture.

The fascial attachments, known as the orbital ligament (see Fig. 75.7), are the inferior termination point of the zone of adherence near the orbital rim where connective tissue fibers of the temporoparietal fascia are fixated to the bone at the superolateral orbital rim (Fig. 75.10). Lateral and posterior along a near-horizontal line from the orbital ligament is the orbicularis-temporal ligament, which is the transverse

Fig. 75.10 Layers of fascia are seen on each side of the zone of fixation (blue). The layers must be elevated and connected to a uniform sliding plane surgically to achieve pleasing and long-lasting brow lift results while not damaging the associated motor and sensory nerves

fusion zone of fibers from the lateral orbicularis, the temporoparietal fascia, and the temporalis fascia. These are important clinical anatomic areas because freeing the zones of adherence is necessary to achieve long-term results with lift procedures. Failure to achieve adequate release in this area can lead to a totally inadequate lift even as early as the day following surgery. Aggressive release may well be required in this area, but caution must be used in this region to avoid overzealous stretching and injury to the facial nerve, which lies immediately above.

The acronym  $SCALP$  applies for the standard layers in the forehead: skin, subcutaneous tissue, aponeurosis (the thick galeal fascia), loose areolar (subgaleal) plane, and periosteum [28-30]; however, the galeal fascia fuses into the frontalis muscle and its midline fascial attachments at this level. This allows a sliding movement over the scalp with contraction of the muscle. The frontalis and galea together can also be thought of as an extension of the temporoparietal fascia in the temporal region

and the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) below the level of the zygomatic arch [31-33]. The temporoparietal fascia appears somewhat loose or spongy clinically and houses the temporal nerve within its undersurface.

Many other paired forehead and brow muscles thought of as depressors are present along the brow to facilitate facial expression [34-41]. The two most well known are the procerus and the corrugator supercilii, which are present in the glabella (Fig. 75.11). The procerus muscles are paired superiorly but fuse inferiorly into one muscle belly that originates from the nasal bones and cartilage. Superiorly, procerus fibers insert into the medial frontalis and the overlying dermis. The procerus is responsible for depression and frowning in the midline, which often creates a horizontal crease ("bunny lines") across the upper portion of the nose. The corrugator supercilii are depressors that act obliquely across the glabella and produce the classic vertical lines seen when squinting (Fig. 75.12). The cor

![](images/4d617b0609e399077e9ee2309f3ba64d2964c90dbe822d0c543cd006afad2e4e.jpg)

rugator originates from the frontal bone just above the nasal bones and inserts in the dermis of the medial brow. The corrugator has two heads, the oblique and the transverse, that act to pull the medial brow in respective locations. The corrugator muscles for the classic vertical glabellar line that some people call the "elevens." Together, the paired procerus muscles and corrugator are the main depressors of the medial brow and are the most common muscles treated with Botulinum toxin

type A to help alleviate frown lines in the glabella. These same two muscles are also most often transected during a brow or forehead lift to achieve a smoother and longer-lasting result (Fig. 75.13).

Another depressor muscle of importance is the depressor supercilii, which originates on the frontal process of the maxilla just below the corrugator supercilii and inserts in the medial frontalis fibers and dermis just above the medial brow. Because it lies superficial to the corrugator, it can be easily paralyzed inadvertently by botulinum toxin. It is also important to note because it lies behind the corrugator and can be transected by aggressive dissection through the corrugator during a brow lift. Although patients with a very low medial brow position may occasionally benefit from this maneuver, it often gives rise to overelevation of the medial brow after surgery, which causes the patient to look somewhat surprised (Fig. 75.14). Superficial to the depressor supercilii is the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi that inserts into portions of the adjacent depressors, the superficial surface of the inferior frontalis, and the dermis below the brow [42, 43]. The orbital portion of the orbicularis muscle originates in part from the medial canthal tendon and adjacent bone. Deep to all the depressors is the galeal fat pad, which lies immediately below the transverse head of the corrugator and helps in identification of muscular landmarks [44]. The galeal fat is usually exposed clinically instantly after transection through the periosteum along the orbital rim (Fig. 75.15).

Finally, paired temporalis muscles are located in each temporal fossa, where they originate and then insert on the coronoid process of the mandible. The importance of these muscles during upper facial rejuvenation chiefly pertains to their overlying fascia, which can be used to delineate surgical planes and aid in fixa

tion. The spongy temporoparietal fascia is superficial to the dense and shiny white temporalis fascia. The temporalis fascia adheres to the temporalis muscles below and splits into a superficial and deep layer in the lower half of the fossa. For consistency, the superficial layer of deep temporalis fascia (which really describes only that

portion of deep temporalis fascia at the level of the split and below) is subsequently referred to simply as temporalis fascia. In essence, this term will be used to describe any of this deep thick fascial layers that is seen clinically as the shiny white investing the temporalis muscle from the temporal crest down to the zygomatic arch (Fig. 75.16).

One method of fixation during brow lifting is the use of suture to fixate the temporoparietal fascia from below a skin incision to the dense and adherent temporalis fascia above the incision to elevate the lateral brow. Some surgeons advocate removing a window of temporalis fascia and exposing the underlying temporalis muscle in hopes of creating scarification in this region and improving fixation longevity [12].

# 75.4 Vessel and Nerve Anatomy

Blood supply to the upper face and scalp is plentiful and comes from multiple sources. Several major vessels of the upper face originate from the external carotid artery including the superficial temporal artery and the facial artery. These give rise to the blood supply in the medial canthal region via the angular artery and in the lateral canthal region by way of the frontal or anterior branch of the superficial temporal artery. The internal carotid artery gives way to the middle meningeal artery and the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery then gives rise to the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries, which exit their respective foramina and supply the majority of the forehead and midscalp with blood. The terminal arterial branches of the upper face have major anastomoses with adjacent vessels (  $\bullet$  Fig. 75.17).

Venous drainage of the upper face follows the respective arterial supply but can be somewhat more variable. However, one particular vein, known as the sentinel vein

(medial zygomaticotemporal vein), runs perpendicular through the temporalis fascia connecting the superficial and middle temporal veins (Fig. 75.18) [45]. The sentinel vein can most often be found approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral or posterior to the zygomaticofrontal suture line (Figs. 75.19 and 75.20). It is clinically significant during endoscopic procedures because, if injured, it can result in impaired field visualization and significant bruising. Aggressive cautery should be avoided in this area because of the proximity of branches (frontal branches) of the facial nerve.

Nerve supply parallels arterial supply to some degree. The supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves, which are responsible for the majority of sensation in the forehead, exit via the same foramina or general location as the supraorbital and supratrochlear blood vessels. The sensory nerves originate from the first division of the trigeminal nerve. The supraorbital nerve has two divisions after exiting its foramen: the deep (or lateral) division supplies the more lateral and posterior portion of the forehead and scalp, and the superficial (or medial) division pierces the frontalis and runs superficially to the muscle, supplying sensation to the forehead along the midpupil line (Fig. 75.21). The location of the supraorbital nerve's exit is relatively consistent. The supraorbital foramen or notch is typically found within  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of a line drawn in a sagittal plane tangential to the medial limbus (Fig. 75.22) [46]. The deep division has been known to exit as often as  $10\%$  from another foramen that can be as high as  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  above the orbital rim. However, this was may be inaccurate. A review of over 500 endoscopic brow lifts did not demonstrate any obvious supraorbital nerve over  $0.5\mathrm{cm}$  from the rim. Further study of 40 cadaveric head dissections also failed to demonstrate any significant size foramen beyond  $0.5\mathrm{cm}$  above the orbital rim at the level of the supraorbital notch or foramen. Admittedly, microsize foramen can be seen in various locations on the forehead skull but are

most consistent with tiny perforating vessels or microscopic accessory nerve branches and would not support any notable sensation.

The supratrochlear nerves exit from around the orbital rim at an average of  $9\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the exit of the supraorbital nerve [46]. The nerves supply sensation to the midforehead with some overlap from the supraorbital nerves. Infratrochlear nerves, also from division I of the trigeminal nerve, exit just below the supratrochlear nerves around the medial orbital rim to supply sensation to the upper nose and medial orbit.

Zygomaticofrontal and zygomaticotemporal nerves are from the orbital rim and zygomatic arch. They exit their respective small foramina and supply sensation to the lateral orbit and temporal regions of the face. Elevation of the deep tissues in this "safe zone" is essentially performed blindly through each of the small scalp incisions initially because the nerves are very consistent and can be avoided easily until dissection gets within  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  of their classic locations. Of course, brow lift incisions and specific tissue release and fixation techniques are highly variable among surgeons [52-59].

Fig. 75.19 The sentinel vein, shown here in blue latex, runs perpendicular to the temporalis fascia. The cadaver dissection also demonstrates the location of the temporal nerve, which runs obliquely just superficially to the sentinel vein in the deep temporoparietal fascia

The facial nerve supplies motor innervation to the forehead and glabella [47-51]. The frontal (or temporal) branch of the facial nerve supplies the frontalis muscle, the superior portion of the orbicularis oculi, the superior portion of the procerus, and the transverse head of the corrugator supercilii. The zygomatic branch of the facial nerve supplies the medial head of the orbicularis oculi, the oblique head of the corrugator supercilii, the inferior portion of the procerus, and the depressor supercilii (Fig. 75.23).

The auriculotemporal nerve, from the third division of the trigeminal nerve, supplies sensation in front of the ear to the temporal skin above the zygomatic arch and along the course of the superficial artery. It may be confused clinically during a facelift with the frontal branch of the facial nerve. It can, however, be distinguished from the facial motor nerve because it runs within  $1\mathrm{cm}$  anterior to the tragus of the ear and parallel to the superficial temporal artery. The much more significant frontal branch of the facial nerve runs an average of  $2\mathrm{cm}$  anterior to the tragus when crossing the zygomatic arch. The temporal branch of the facial nerve crosses the arch at an oblique angle at an average of  $2\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the orbital rim. The depth of the temporal nerve is just below the SMAS at the arch and below the temporoparietal fascia immediately above the arch (Fig. 75.24).

# 75.4.1 Forehead Dissection

Initial dissection must be performed to gain adequate space for the endoscopic equipment. This early dissection is performed in the posterior forehead and temporal regions; endoscopy-guided dissection is used for the last  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above a completely subperiosteal plane medially to the temporal crest and in the plane immediately above the temporalis fascia below the temporal line on each side. Subperiosteal dissection in the lateral forehead helps to avoid injury to the deep or lateral division of the supraorbital nerve, which runs in the subgaleal plane near the zone of fixation. Some surgeons begin their dissection in a subgaleal plane in the posterior scalp [59, 60]. Regardless, a space is created in the safer posterior areas of the scalp to allow room for placement of an endoscope, which aids dissection in the more risky areas of the forehead.

The first anatomic landmark the surgeon must consider is the zone of fixation along the superior temporal crest. Its inferior edge is found near the superior lateral orbital rim. A convergence of fibers from the periosteum, galea, temporalis, and temporoparietal fascia interlace and fuse to form the zone of adherence, in much the same way the layers of tissue planes come together at the level of the zygomatic arch. The zone of fixation can be elevated bluntly at the hairline level and a couple of centimeters below, but as the surgeon approaches the lateral brow beginning approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above brow level, the use of an endoscope aids dissection. At this point, the ligament has branches of the temporal nerve within it, and care must be taken to remain against the bone and temporalis fascia below to avoid nerve injury. Another fibrous attachment, the orbicularis-temporal ligament, is also present here and contains motor nerve fibers (see Fig. 75.18); it is the decussation of fibers from the temporoparietal fascia and of the temporal fascia that extends laterally from the orbital ligament. The zone of adherence becomes even more tenacious as the orbital ligament (see Fig. 75.7) at the orbital rim level is approached. Slow meticulous dissection is required at this point to avoid nerve injury and injury to the sentinel vein that is located within the orbicularis-temporal ligament approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  laterally to the zygomatico-frontal suture. Careful dissection exposes an intact sentinel vein that can be seen piercing through the temporal fascia at a perpendicular angle and entering the temporoparietal fascia above (see Fig. 75.18).

Dissection above the orbital rims in the subperiosteal plane should expose the entire superior orbital rim from each zygomaticofrontal suture. The curvature of the rims should be visualized so that transection

Fig. 75.24 The temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve divide into multiple branches by the time they reach the zygomatic arch. The nerve branches are deep to the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) in the midface and deep to the temporoparietal fascia above the arch. In face-lift and forehead lift

through the periosteum can be made at the level of the rims. The nasofrontal suture may not always be seen but can be felt by the periosteal elevator used to lift tissue. When transecting through the periosteum across the entire orbital rim, subgaleal fat is often encountered initially, except when the transection is directly behind the supraorbital nerve at the rim level where the deep (or lateral) division of the nerve is closely adherent to periosteum (see Fig. 75.15). Preoperatively marking a point on the brow at a level tangential to the medial limbus iris helps the surgeon to easily identify the location of the supraorbital vessels and nerves [46]. Dissection through the periosteum in this region should be performed slowly and superficially to avoid injury to these structures (Fig. 75.25). The transverse head of the corrugator supercilii is seen at the orbital rim level behind the supraorbital vessels and nerves. The corrugator supercilii can be carefully transected or partially excised [61]. Medially, the oblique head of the corrugator is encountered, and by a transection through this portion of muscle, the supratroch

ing, the surgeon must be either above or below the nerve branches and be most careful in the midzygomatic arch region because the tissues are all very condensed around the nerve in this location. Typically, there is a relatively safe area the first  $2\mathrm{cm}$  in front of the ear canal because the frontal nerve is not found in this region along the arch

lear nerve and depressor supercilii muscle may be seen and protected from injury. Medially, in the glabella, the procerus muscle, which is variable in thickness, is seen. Care should be taken to avoid overaggressive muscle resection in thin patients because this can result in an atrophic defect in the glabella. Deeper dissection toward the skin level under the brow will lead to the orbicularis oculi but is typically not necessary to gain the desired effect (except with regard to the lateral orbicularis, where limited transection of orbicularis fibers here can improve lateral brow elevation) [62, 63]. In addition, one or more incisions through the periosteum at higher levels under the frontalis muscle in the midline can be performed, but this is required only if deep horizontal lines are present [64]. It is more important to gain complete release of the retaining lateral ligaments, transection of those muscles causing glabellar lines, and adequate separation of the periosteum along the orbital rim to get the elevation of brow and forehead tissues for the most pleasing and long-term aesthetic result [65-75].

# 75.5 Preoperative Evaluation and Surgical Preparation

Determining whether a patient will benefit from a brow or forehead lift and which procedure will work best is critical to avoid an unhappy patient. Some surgeons may focus on horizontal forehead lines during an exam as an indication for a brow lift. But horizontal lines may best be treated with botulinum toxin for some patients. Often, horizontal lines are compensation for visual impairment created by brow ptosis or eyelid ptosis or both. The key is to identify the reason and explain this to the patient. Typically, once the ptosis of any cause is corrected, the patient no longer needs to flex their frontalis muscle to see and the horizontal lines diminish. In general, the most common forehead and brow aesthetic

problem for most patients is a low lateral brow position (hooding) (see Fig. 75.3). Deep glabellar creases tend to be the second most common issue followed by forehead rhytids as a distant third in order of common complaints. As discussed previously, the ideal female brow position is above the orbital rim at a level that varies among individuals. An average distance of  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  of brow elevation above the rim in the lateral third generally looks most pleasing. Men require a straight-up elevation of the entire brow to avoid feminizing their appearance by overelevation of the lateral brow. In addition, men may benefit more from a standard upper blepharoplasty and local transpalpebral brow lift if the brow ptosis is minimal. As with any cosmetic surgery, a decision regarding the risks and benefits must be made and must conform to the patient's desires. Patient educa

laxity, pseudoelevation of the brows due to frontalis compensation for severe eyelid ptosis, and severe actinic skin damage.

tion is required so that they know the risks and what can realistically be achieved (Fig. 75.26). Even with fairly aggressive muscle resection and forehead elevation, patients often form new dynamic lines in the upper face after surgery. A subcutaneous brow lift, which maintains a surgical plane above the frontalis muscle, may be required if heavy horizontal forehead lines exist and the patient wants them significantly reduced in appearance. Comparatively, subgaleal and subperiosteal dissection planes during forehead and brow lifting allow treatment of the depressors muscles but do not allow major affective treatment of the frontalis muscle and horizontal forehead creases (Fig. 75.27). The depressor muscles and their resulting creases in the glabellar region can be adequately treated from a subperiosteal, subgaleal, or subcutaneous plane. Lateral crow's feet owing to the action of the orbicularis oculi when smiling may appear improved after a brow lift because the muscle is unfolded. However, they are not completely eliminated by brow lifting alone, and the patient must understand that botulinum toxin therapy may be required to treat these particular lines on an ongoing basis [76].

In addition to lines on the forehead, lines in the glabella, brow ptosis, and the condition of the patient's

skin must also be evaluated. Intrinsic skin and collagen damage from the effects of sun, age, and smoking are not treated by lifting alone. Topical skin care (e.g., retinoic acid, microdermabrasion, pulsed-light therapy, and sunblocks) along with possible surgical resurfacing must be considered [77-79]. In general, the forehead can be treated safely with chemical peels or laser skin resurfacing into the dermal level simultaneously with brow lifting procedures, provided the lifting is performed with a subgaleal or subperiosteal technique rather than a subcutaneous one. Finally, bony irregularities or hypertrophic bony orbital rims can be evaluated for treatment by means of a cephalometric radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan as required. Bony contouring can be performed on a limited basis endoscopically, but a major reduction for significant bone hypertrophy such as a frontal boss is best treated with an open (coronal) approach. The amount of bone reduction is limited by the pneumatization of the frontal sinus, which is best evaluated by CT. Although treatment planning for placement of bone tunnels does not require a preoperative CT, a standard cephalometric radiograph may help to reassure the surgeon regarding the thickness of corticocancellous bone available.

Trichophytic Brow Lift

As with any surgical procedure, appropriate preoperative laboratory and other indicated tests must be performed. Written instructions are given to the patient regarding pre- and postoperative care, including instructions for shampooing hair with antibacterial soap or other antiseptic shampoo and avoidance of the use of hair spray or other hair products immediately before surgery. The patient should be thoroughly instructed on the critical need to avoid all medications that may cause platelet dysfunction 14 days before surgery (including aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fish oil, omega 3, vitamin E, and many over-the-counter herbal supplements). Endoscopic techniques require a very dry operating field that necessitates strict avoidance of these medications and proper preoperative injection of vasoconstrictive agents.

Before induction of anesthesia, photographs are taken, and the patient is marked while awake and sitting up. Following the introduction of general anesthesia or intravenous sedation, the patient is prepared and carefully injected with local anesthetic with epinephrine. The author prefers to use a local anesthetic with 1:100,000 epinephrine along the entire orbital rim and a tumescent anesthesia solution (250 mL of normal saline mixed with 1 mL of 1:1000 epinephrine and 20 mL of 2% lidocaine) in the remaining upper forehead, temple, and posterior scalp. Careful injection in the desired tissue planes helps to avoid the formation of a hematoma during the injection and allows for a nearly bloodless procedure. Minor shaving of hair along the marked incision lines is performed if desired immediately before the final preparation and draping of the area.

# 75.6 Coronal Forehead and Brow Lift

Coronal brow lift was once the work-horse of forehead and brow lifts. Today, however, it has largely been replaced by endoscopic and trichophytic/pretrichial approaches [80, 81]. The advantages of the coronal brow lift, however, are not to be overlooked. The coronal brow lift provides excellent surgical exposure allowing direct visualization and treatment of the depressor musculature, and the surgical results have a remarkable long track record of stability. That is the reason some surgeons continue to regard coronal brow lift as a mainstay treatment for the upper face. It remains common modality for boney prominence reduction in male to female transgender patients who need major exposure to reduce frontal bossing.

The surgical approach is typically done by making a coronal incision  $6 - 8\mathrm{cm}$  behind the hairline. The distance is used as rough guide, as incision can be made anywhere behind the hairline while taking care to endure at least  $4\mathrm{cm}$  of hair is left on anterior flap after scalp resection. The incision can be carried closer to the hairline if the surgeon wants to avoid a lengthy dissection, or kept closer to the vertex if the goal is to minimize risk of sensory nerve injury or patients with a receding hairline [82-84].

The dissection is typically carried in the subgaleal or the subperiosteal plane, of which the latter is more commonly preferred due to easier access to the glabellar musculature. The dissection is carried to the orbital rims. At this time, the glabellar musculature is addressed. The musculature can be treated with resection or myoto

mies. Care must be taken to avoid overly aggressive muscle resection in order to avoid excessive midline brow elevation and minimize risk of injury to the perforating sensory nerves.

Flap is then elevated in the superior-lateral vector until desired brow position is achieved. The scalp resection is then carried out. One to two centimeter of scalp is a commonly excised laterally with minimal excision centrally to avoid excessive medial elevation, although some surgeons advocate for additional fixation of the flap that is typically not necessary.

Regrettably, the coronal lift also has the disadvantages of a long incision and a significant elevation of the hairline, potential for hair loss and significant scalp anesthesia. Patients with a high hairline are not good candidates for this technique because a significant amount of scalp excision is required. Nevertheless, many surgeons believe this scalp excision is a reasonable tradeoff because they feel that the technique gives a more stable, predictable, and lasting result than do the newer endoscopic techniques [85].

# 75.7 Trichophytic or Pretrichial Forehead and Brow Lift

Trichophytic and pretrichial lifts are an alternative to the coronal lift. Pretrichial incision is carried in front of the hairline, while the trichophytic incision is carried  $\sim 5\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the hairline. Main advantages of both anterior hairline approach compared with the coronal counterpart is that they involve less extensive dissection and can instead lower the patient's hairline.

Pretrichial incision is easier to carry out, but this can often leave a visible scare just in front of the hairline. A trichophytic incision, on the other hand, relies on beveling the incision anteriorly, which transects the hair follicles. Although the incision is more technically demanding, the resulting hair ingrowth via the bisected follicles camouflages the scar and significantly improves the aesthetic outcome. Some surgeons elect to further improve scaring by making an irregular pattern incision along the hairline for a more natural postoperative appearance compared with a straight-line scar [86-90].

Dissection can then follow in subperiosteal, subgleal, or a now more favored subcutaneous plane. Despite being more timely dissection, subcutaneous plane grants direct access to the glabellar musculature and had the ability to address the horizontal forehead rhytids. Anterior dissection and eventual treatment of the glabellar musculature is proceeded similarly to the coronal approach [91]. The skin excision cut is made using a similar beveling technique as the initial incision if a trichophytic approach is made.

Overall, the trichophytic or pretrichial techniques of forehead and brow lifting are an invaluable tool for any surgeon performing facial cosmetic surgery. When a patient presents with a high forehead and low brow position, the trichophytic approach is the procedure of choice to correct both problems. The main disadvantage is the potential for a visible incision despite best efforts. All prospective patients considering this technique must be informed of the chance that there may be a visible scar at the hairline. Surprisingly, when presented with the potential problems and given the choice, many patients prefer to undergo an endoscopic approach with a slight elevation in hairline rather than risk a visible hairline scar. Still, the patient with an extremely high hairline is often thrilled with the lower hairline obtainable only with the trichophytic approach [92, 93]. Attention to detail and gentle soft tissue management are essential in attaining a natural hairline and hidden scar with this popular technique.

# 75.8 Endoscopic Forehead and Brow Lift

Early attempts at endoscopic surgery began over a century ago with Nietze's description of a crude cystoscope. A few decades ago, endoscopic surgery progressed through use in upper gastrointestinal examinations and then intra-abdominal surgery. However, facial endoscopic cosmetic surgery did not blossom until the early 1990s. Over the past decade, the endoscopic forehead and brow lift procedure has been considered by many to be the state-of-the-art technique for upper facial rejuvenation [94-96]. It is versatile and can be combined with many other procedures. The most noted benefits of the endoscopic technique are the smaller scars hidden in the hairline and selective brow elevation without the need for removal of any hair or skin (  $\bullet$  Fig. 75.28).

The technique involves several incisions placed strategically behind the hairline to gain access for early blunt dissection and insertion of the endoscope and tissue retractor. Other incisions can be used as ports for dissecting tools such as periosteal elevators, electrocautery, lasers, tissue graspers, and suction instruments. Among surgeons, a variety of incision (port) designs are used. Fixation points are usually placed at these incision sites; therefore, the author prefers five separate 3-cm-long incisions placed for easy access but mostly for ideal fixation placement. Each of the five incisions begins approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the hairline. One is placed in the midline in the sagittal plane and two in the parasagittal plane tangential to the lateral third of the brow (where maximum lift is typically desired in females). This same incision can be moved slightly medially in male patients to give a more even brow elevation.

![](images/01cdc57bd981e199711e6d343e75f50554b077b1db708f0bfb7123bce1bec783.jpg)  
Fig. 75.28 Sequential appearance after endoscopic forehead and brow lifting (eyelid and skin resurfacing procedures were also performed). Slight overelevation of the brow is noted for 6 days after

The midline incision plus the two parasagittal incisions are aligned vertically to avoid unnecessary transection of sensory nerves originating from the supraorbital nerves below. The two parasagittal incisions are placed medial to the temporal crest to gain access to skull bone rather than the more lateral temporalis fascia. Bone fixation from this parasagittal incision is used to hold the elevated outer brow in an ideal and symmetric location [97-99].

It is important to access the subperiosteal plane easily for a clean future endoscopic view. Accidental placement of the parasagittal incisions too far laterally over the zone of fixation or temporalis muscle makes pocket development difficult and obscures future endoscopic visualization. Moreover, the parasagittal incisions are located in a thick area of the frontal bone where there is a low density of venous lakes. Placing the incision here helps to prevent accidental intracranial injury during bone tunnel creation or placement of bone screws.

Finally, two temporal incisions are made, one on each side of the head, for direct access to the thick temporal fascia. These incisions are placed perpendicular to the desired elevation vector from the lateral canthal region. Coincidently, the temporal incision parallels the course of the temporal branch of the facial nerve that is located  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to this incision. It also parallels the superficial temporal artery and vein. Arranging the three medial incisions on a vertical axis and the two temporal incisions in an oblique position to parallel the nerve and blood supply in each area can reduce interference with sensation and vascular supply to the scalp.

Dissection is performed through the above incisions down through periosteum medial to the temporal crest and down to the temporalis fascia lateral to the crest. Some surgeons may elect to use a subgaleal rather than a subperiosteal placement of the incision medially. Total subperiosteal dissection medial to the temporal lines rather than subgaleal dissection leads to better fixation and long-term stabilization (see Fig. 75.28).

Blunt and blind dissection can be carried out after reaching the subperiosteal and subtemporoparietal

![](images/a83de13ba3ac2585c68debbc88f7c8c48ef52dfe7b602ecb180cadb79b306cd5.jpg)  
surgery, as expected. The brow position remains very stable from 2 weeks to 7 years after the surgery. Adequate tissue release is the key to long-term stability of brow lifting  
Fig. 75.29 Blind finger dissection is performed initially, avoiding overzealous dissection inferiorly. Dissection proceeds from the subtemporoparietal plane laterally to the already elevated subperiosteal plane medially. The opposite direction of elevation (medial to lateral) may produce false tunnels in the temporoparietal tissue, which impair future endoscopic vision

planes through the five incisions. Finger dissection and long curved endoscopic periosteal elevators are used to lift the tissue anteriorly to a point  $2\mathrm{cm}$  above the orbital rims and zygomatic arch. Posteriorly, blunt dissection should elevate the temporal tissues a few centimeters behind the ear, where the temporal fossa becomes self-limiting. The subperiosteal dissection above needs to elevate the scalp at least  $10\mathrm{cm}$  posteriorly but can extend as far back as the lambdoid suture. Once these areas are freed, a connection can be made from the temporal region to the subperiosteal dissection through the upper portion of the zone of fixation at the temporal crest by finger dissection (Fig. 75.29). Blind release of the more inferior portion of the temporal line where the

facial nerve crosses should be avoided. Endoscope-guided dissection here helps to prevent nerve injury. Using finger dissection, the upper zone of fixation is broken through, proceeding from the temporal incision toward the medial scalp, rather than vice versa, to prevent creation of a false tunnel in the spongy or foamy temporoparietal fascia. False tunnels along the temporal crest create problems when the endoscope is inserted through the parasagittal port to visualize the lateral forehead; the tunnels force the placement of the endoscope in a more superficial plane within the temporoparietal fascia, which greatly increases the chance of nerve injury. Therefore, it is critical to stay firmly against the periosteum and the temporalis fascia when initially elevating the scalp and forehead.

Following blunt elevation of the scalp from each incision for complete flap elevation, the endoscope is normally inserted through one of the three more medial incisions. Poor initial blunt dissection makes the initial endoscopic dissection feel very tight, and care must be taken not to perforate the skin by excessive retraction. Medial dissection over the nasofrontal suture and orbital rims is performed under direct endoscopic vision with a curved and smooth elevator to avoid inadvertent tearing of the periosteum. The periosteum may be thin in some patients in whom a straighter elevator may be used to transect the periosteum at the level of the rim (arcus marginalis). However, the entire rolled edge of

first view and the supraorbital nerve and vein in the next view after excising through the periosteum

the orbital rim must be visualized before proceeding with periosteal incision (Fig. 75.30). Typically, the periosteum is more precisely incised with a needle tip cautery or laser set at low power. The supraorbital nerves and vessels as described earlier are at a level tangential to the medial limbus and are immediately behind (superficial to) the periosteum from the internal endoscopic view [46, 100]. This necessitates meticulous cautery dissection here to avoid injury to these structures (see Fig. 75.25). Suction placed by an assistant from another port is required to maintain a clear view when using cautery or laser. Temporal incisions work well for suction ports during dissection over the rims because the endoscope and cautery take up most of the room through any of the middle three incision sites. With clear and near bloodless dissection at this point, transection can be performed through the corrugator supercilii and procerus. If unwanted bleeding is encountered and cannot be controlled easily with pinpoint accurate cautery, pressure should be applied externally over the rim until improved visualization allows for control of bleeding without nerve damage.

Vertical rhytids in the glabella created by the corrugators can be improved greatly by transection through these muscles. Likewise, horizontal glabellar lines are treated by transection of the procerus muscle that creates these particular facial wrinkles. Some surgeons advocate more aggressive surgical avulsion of these

muscles with endoscopic biopsy forceps. Aggressive muscle removal may lead to a more permanent treatment of glabellar lines compared with isolated transection only, but it should be avoided in most cases owing to an increased risk of significant postoperative irregularities and abnormal facial expression. As a rule, patients prefer a more natural appearance with some minor return of frown lines to risking a bizarre facial expression and glabellar depression.

Once the periosteum is completely freed across the orbital rims and appropriate muscles have been treated, the cut periosteal edges are spread apart (periosteal elevators work well for this) by at least  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to aid the release at the arcus marginalis. This allows significant and long-term brow elevation. The periosteum just deep to the supraorbital nerve can be left intact and release performed on each side of the nerve. Next, the lateral orbital rim must be exposed in the subperiosteal plane after careful release below the zone of fixation and orbital ligament. Dissection along the anterior and inferior aspects of the temporal crest must be performed cautiously to avoid temporal nerve injury. Overzealous retraction of the dense tissue here that contains the nerve can result in nerve damage. Staying snuggly against periosteum and the temporalis fascia helps to prevent nerve damage and produces a much cleaner dissection. Slowly creating a distinct plane of dissection down to the zygomaticofrontal suture line and avoiding excess retraction help to prevent unwanted bleeding from the sentinel vein (zygomaticotemporal vein), which needs not be sacrificed for a standard endoscopic forehead and brow lift.

Dissection for a standard endoscopic brow lift should not proceed all the way to the zygomatic arch but should stop approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above this level. If an extended midface lift is planned and there is a desire to elevate tissue over the zygomatic arch itself, dissection must go below the superficial layer of deep temporal fascia just above the arch. Abbreviated midface-lifts performed simultaneously with endoscopic brow lifts may simply stay in the subperiosteal plane along the lateral orbital rim and avoid the more risky full arch release. The beauty of the classic endoscopic brow lift is its versatility and the ease with which additional procedures can be combined simultaneously with this elegant cosmetic surgery. For instance, the temporal incision of an endoscopic forehead lift can easily be extended inferiorly to meet up with the preauricular incision from a standard lower face-lift. Also, midface lifting (with intraoral dissection) can connect the intraoral subperiosteal dissection over the zygoma to the subperiosteal plane from the endoscopic brow lift through a tunnel near the lateral orbital rim (Fig. 75.31).

After all dissection is complete, appropriate elevation and fixation are required (Fig. 75.32). Many techniques have been described such as tissue suture only, bone screws and plates, resorbable screws, bone tunnels, local skin excision, temporalis muscle exposure for added scarification, tissue glue, and tight head wraps [101]. Regardless of any specific fixation technique, the key to long-term fixation is adequate lower forehead tissue release during endoscopic dissection. Failure to adequately release internal tissue results in a relapse of brow ptosis; even with heavy fixation and the appearance of a

"nice" lift during surgery, the relapse will occur if the release is not performed well enough.

Once complete internal release of the forehead is obtained, the specific lifting vectors must be determined for the most pleasing aesthetic effect. The lateral third of the female brow is elevated to the greatest extent, which is up to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above the orbital rim. The medial brow should be at the rim or at the most only slightly above the rim level and definitely below the middle and lateral brow levels to avoid a surprised or bewildered expression (see Fig. 75.14). Typically, the glabellar region is elevated on its own without the need for midline fixation, which helps to avoid overelevation medially. The lateral third of the brow is lifted straight up and fixated at the level of the hairline. The galeal tissue is typically secured to bone at this point, while the lateral brow is held at the desired height or  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  above the desired level [12]. Very little relapse if any occurs with proper technique and averages only  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  after 2 weeks. Measurements can also be made with clear circular templates from the pupil to the brow to help improve symmetry. The brow position remains very stable after this early recovery period (see Fig. 75.28). A question remains as to the time required for complete fixation of the periosteum. Some animal studies suggest a full 12 weeks are required for what is termed full histologic periosteal refixation [102]. However, some clinical evidence suggests that adequate fixation occurs in as little as 7 days. An example is the common fixation technique used by many surgeons who place a single transcutaneous bone screw at each parasagittal incision, which is removed after only 1 week. The 1-week fixation technique has been used with success for many years. It has been suggested that longer bony fixation may provide longer-term retention and less early relapse that some have considered normal. The key to long-term

fixation seems for now to be determined usually by proper tissue dissection and release (Fig. 75.33).

Although there are many fixation techniques, the use of bone tunnels at the parasagittal incisions appears to be one of the most ideal and stable methods for fixating the galea and periosteum near the hairline to a bone tunnel created posteriorly under the incision using a single heavy suture (see  $\square$  Fig. 75.32). Fixation of the lateral tail of the brow can also be performed if desired at each temporal incision, where an isolated heavy suture plicates the temporoparietal fascia in a posterior and superior vector to the thick temporalis fascia. Optional creation of a small window of exposed temporalis muscle in this area may aid in internal scar formation and fixation. The vector of lift at this outer tail of the brow follows a line drawn at an angle from the outer nasal ala that passes just beside the lateral canthus (see  $\square$  Fig. 75.31).

Final closure of the hair-bearing scalp incisions can be performed with skin staples only with excellent scar formation because no skin is excised and no pressure exists at the incision sites. Redundant tissue (forehead skin) created by an average of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  of brow elevation is easily distributed evenly over the posterior  $15 - 20\mathrm{cm}$  of elevated scalp, which essentially absorbs or redistributes this excess tissue with few to no signs of bunching. Because of this phenomenon, the endoscopic forehead and brow lift tends to elevate the hairline only a very small amount compared with the open skin excising coronal technique.

Interestingly, in a survey performed in 1998 of American Society of Plastic Surgeons members, of the total of 6951 brow lifts performed by 570 members who returned the questionnaire, 3534 were involved in a coronal technique and incision and 3417 were performed endoscopically. The most noted difference was the higher risk of hair loss with the coronal technique; however, both techniques enjoyed very low overall complication rates. Since 2010, more surgeons have abandoned the coronal technique for either the endoscopic technique or the trychophytic or both. The lead author personally using the endoscopic technique for the majority of cases if the hairline is normal, while using the trychophytic for higher hairline patients or if major horizontal rhytids exist and require a subcutaneous lift. The coronal lift is used for many cases where a transgender male to female patient requires frontal bossing reduction.

# 75.9 Temporal Lift

The rationale for lifting from a temporal approach alone is the potential to lift the outer brow and midface through a relatively conservative incision and with minimal dissection. Realistically, the procedure has a few potential problems that have kept the procedure from becoming extremely popular. The most worrisome problem is that the vector of dissection runs precisely per

![](images/755a141c99548ed2a6c270493a20050156ff32f0996dda74e78b9eaa1ba78c11.jpg)

pendicular to the path of the frontal nerve making the potential for motor nerve injury possible if in the wrong plane. Also, the attempt to achieve significant lift in this tenacious area of tissue adhesion can be challenging and result in early relapse or inadequate lifting. Albeit challenging, a well-performed temporal lift may be the ideal procedure for the right patient. The key is being in the proper plane and achieving proper release. A lighted retractor can be helpful for this procedure if an endoscope is not available. Scissor tip scan even be used to release the arcus marginalis via direct vision a prying or rocking motion with the scissors at the orbital rim.

The ideal patient for an isolate temporal brow lift has lateral brow hooding and mild midface ptosis but very

little problems in the forehead or glabellar regions. For this patient, a temporal incision is made perpendicular to the desired vector of lift followed by dissection directly on top of temporalis fascia or in a very superficial subcutaneous plane (Fig. 75.34a). Deep dissection below the nerve is inherently safer but requires more release of retaining ligament to obtain adequate lateral brow and cheek lift. A subcutaneous flap above the frontal nerve is more likely to damage hair follicles or nerves, but obtaining adequate release for brow elevation is much easier and can be performed with the use of endoscopes or lighted retractors. Selection of the specific technique is operator dependent and based on the surgeon's comfort level. If adequate tissue release is

Fig. 75.34 Representative incisions for typical brow lifting procedures: (1) direct brow lift, (2) midforehead lift, (3) trichophytic brow lift, (4) coronal brow lift, and (5) endoscopic brow lift

achieved through the compact surgical region, good results can be obtained (see  $\boxed{\mathbf{0}}$  Fig. 75.34b).

# 75.10 Direct Brow Lift

The direct brow lift involves excision of an ellipse of skin adjacent to and just above the eyebrow (see Fig. 75.34). A beveled incision is used to parallel the hair follicles of the brow or so that some follicles remain at the base of the bevel to grow later above the scar. The dissection remains in the subcutaneous plane to avoid muscle or nerve injury.

Advantages of the direct brow lift are that it is a simple procedure (with an easy two-layer closure), it can be performed under local anesthesia, and it can treat brow position asymmetries. It remains a good alternative technique that may be an excellent option for an elderly patient who has severe brow ptosis and heavy wrinkles but cannot tolerate more extensive surgery and would benefit from a short procedure under local anesthesia. The main disadvantage is the potentially visible scar immediately above the brow.

# 75.11 Midforehead and Brow Lift

Incisions made in the middle or upper forehead regions have similar advantages and disadvantages to the direct brow lift [103-106]. The incisions are made on each side

of the forehead in an elliptical fashion so that the resulting scar follows a horizontal line already present in the forehead. Although this is probably the least used of all the techniques described, it may be a practical alternative for the elderly patient with thin eyebrows and deep horizontal rhytids who requires a short procedure under local anesthesia.

# 75.12 Transpalpebral and Other Local Brow Procedures

There has been a significant increase in the movement toward minimally invasive techniques to perform cosmetic surgery. New techniques for forehead and brow rejuvenation fill the literature and offer potentially exciting methods to gain aesthetic improvement with less risk than with current procedures. A few such procedures include lateral brow lifting with temporal incisions only, denervation techniques through small punctures around the brow, and direct approaches through an upper blepharoplasty incision. It should be noted that, although procedures such as making small punctures to destroy medial portions of facial nerve innervating medial depressors may seem minimally invasive, they are certainly not without risk.

Many of the "minimally invasive" procedures take advantage of the proximity of the local depressor muscle. For instance, the transpalpebral or transblepharoplasty approach for forehead rejuvenation gains access to the local depressors through an upper eyelid incision [107]. Dissection through this incision involves a short distance to the corrugator supercilii, the procerus, and depressor supercilii of the glabella, which can each be selectively transected from this incision to reduced unwanted wrinkles and elevate the medial brow (see Fig. 75.11). Likewise, the orbicularis can be incised and subperiosteal dissection performed above the orbital rim to elevate the lateral brow through this same local incision. Suture plication of the periosteum above the rim may further elevate the lateral brow.

Another adjunctive technique in the upper third of the face is that of fat grafting in areas of age-related fat atrophy. Fat can essentially be grafted anywhere; however, caution is required in the glabellar region where occasional local necrosis can occur from fat infiltration. This also occurs occasionally after collagen injections in the same region [108]. There are a great number of alternative techniques, and each must be evaluated for safety, efficacy, and longevity on an individual basis [109].

# 75.13 Botulinum Toxin-Assisted Brow Lift

Botulinum toxin has been used for nearly two decades to improve the aesthetic appearance of the upper third of the face by reducing wrinkles of the forehead (horizontal lines), glabella (frown and bunny lines), and lateral orbital crow's feet (laugh lines) [110]. More recently, it has been used specifically to elevate certain regions of the brow to obtain a "chemical brow lift." [111] The depressor muscles are paralyzed with botulinum toxin not only to reduce the wrinkles they create but also to allow the frontalis muscle to elevate the brow farther because of the decrease in muscular antagonism. By decreasing the tone and downward pull of the orbicularis immediately below the brow, the lateral third of the eyebrow elevates approximately  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  from the result of botulinum toxin placed in the upper crow's feet area. Such treatment of depressor muscles in the glabellar region can help elevate the medial brow. Of course, as with surgical brow lifting, overcorrection in the medial brow may result in an abnormal facial expression.

Dosages used vary with individuals. Botox® comes in a 100-unit vial to be mixed with  $1 - 10\mathrm{mL}$  normal saline. More dilute solutions  $(6 - 10~\mathrm{mL} / 100$  units) begin to lose efficacy and can distort the tissue, whereas high concentration mixtures  $(1 - 2\mathrm{mL} / 100$  units) may be wasteful and imprecise. Regardless of dilution, the total dosage in units of botulinum toxin and its proper placement determine the outcome. For most individuals, 5-10 units are all that is required for each lateral crow's foot region. However, the larger muscles of the glabella (procerus and corrugators) often require at least 15 units of the toxin and occasionally up to 50 units for maximum results. Appropriate dosage in the glabella is the most variable. Treatment of horizontal forehead lines typically requires between 15 and 25 units. It should be noted that simultaneous treatment of horizontal forehead lines from the frontalis may decrease or eliminate brow elevation that otherwise may have been created by botulinum toxin treatment of the depressor muscles. Moreover, excessive toxin treatment of horizontal lines close to the eyebrows (within  $1\mathrm{cm}$ ) should often be avoided owing to the risk of true ptosis of the forehead, brow, and upper eyelids.

Botulinum toxin has also been recommended to aid long-term stability of the surgical forehead and brow lift. The theory involved is that control of the downward pull of the depressors (by temporarily paralyzing them chemically) gives the periosteum time to attach securely in an elevated position. The injection can be done during surgery, but there is an increased risk of eyelid ptosis and an unwanted delay because botulinum toxin typically takes 3-5 days to take full effect. Therefore, ideally

botulinum toxin is injected 1-2 weeks before surgery. Regardless of any benefit this may give to long-term surgical fixation, the resulting reduction in wrinkles of the forehead and glabella and in crow's feet is almost always popular with patients, even though the results last for only 3 to 6 months.

# 75.14 Adjunctive Procedures: Skin Care and Micropigmentation

A variety of procedures can be used for the superficial treatment of poor skin texture and are covered more completely in  $\triangleright$  Chap. 70. For complete rejuvenation of the upper third of the face, skin resurfacing techniques may be required to address aging problems, especially those related to sun exposure that cannot be adequately treated with lifting methods alone.

Prior to any resurfacing procedure such as laser skin resurfacing, chemical peels, or dermabrasion, the patient should be treated with topical skin medications to decrease the risk of scarring and pigment problems. Retinoic acid-type preparations used for ideally six weeks before resurfacing and  $4\%$  hydroquinone for patients with darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick 3 or higher) are two possibilities (see  $\triangleright$  Chap. 70). Simultaneous resurfacing procedures can be accomplished with brow lifting, provided the surgical plane of dissection is subperiosteal or subgaleal and not subcutaneous.

Another adjunctive procedure growing in popularity is medical micropigmentation. The use of new skin pigments that do not contain iron oxide has improved the appearance of tattoos placed to enhance a thin eyebrow or as permanently applied eyeliner. The ink is relatively permanent but often requires touch-ups owing to some fading over the first three to five years. Patients who have poor hand motor skills can greatly benefit from this procedure. A certified technician under a doctor's supervision usually performs the micropigmentation. However, consultation with a surgeon before micropigmentation is important because placement of a permanent brow tattoo in a more elevated position may create problems if the patient desires a surgical brow lift later. Therefore, if a patient is seeking brow lifting in addition to the micropigmentation, it is advisable to perform the surgical brow lift before the permanent makeup if feasible.

# 75.15 Postoperative Care

Following surgical forehead and brow lifting, although not required, a compression bandage is commonly applied using material such as Coban, Ace wraps, or

custom spandex type head wraps. The pressure helps limit edema where applied. Typically, a drain is not required if a very dry field has been maintained. The patient should be instructed to limit activity and to use cold compresses over the eyes and brows. Head elevation is also recommended for the first several days. Avoidance of antiplatelet drugs preoperatively, a careful surgical technique, and the immediate postoperative use of cold compresses, elevation, and limited strenuous activity significantly decrease postoperative healing time.

The relatively snug postoperative dressing may be removed on postoperative day 1 to visually inspect the surgical site for any problems. The lead author uses no compression after the first 12-24 hours, but a less constrictive Velcro-type head wrap can then be used if desired for up to a week. Patients are allowed to gently shampoo their hair after 24 hours but must be cautioned to avoid water pressure directly over any incision sites. Each incision is then cleaned twice a day with a dilute peroxide solution, and a thin layer of antibiotic ointment is applied for the first week. Staples are removed at the end of 1 week. Chemical treatments of hair such as "perms" should be delayed for at least 2 weeks to avoid possible hair loss as a reaction to the harsh chemicals. Hot curling irons or other similar devices must be used with caution because areas of scalp anesthesia may be present for months and can predispose a patient to an accidental self-inflicted burn.

# 75.16 Complications

Fortunately, major complications are rare with properly performed forehead and brow rejuvenation procedures. Good patient selection, diligent preoperative planning, meticulous surgical technique, and thorough postoperative care are all required to help limit the chance for complications [112-115]. Minor complications can always occur despite a surgeon's best efforts. No matter how minor the problem, the patient must be treated with concern and compassion. Typically, patients who undergo cosmetic surgery are expecting to look better as soon as possible and are not always as tolerant of perioperative problems as are trauma patients. Extensive edema and ecchymoses are not normally considered complications but may warrant appropriate reassurance and even simple suggestions to hasten recovery when feasible. Suggestions regarding makeup from a well-trained staff member may greatly improve a postoperative patient's mood when shown how to better hide persistent erythema or ecchymosis.

True complications include poor scar appearance, wound dehiscence, hematoma, skin sloughs or perfora

tions, asymmetries, sensory disturbances, facial paralysis, eyelid ptosis, corneal abrasions, dry eye syndrome, hair loss (alopecia), infection, relapse, irregular facial expressions, and contour irregularities. Atrophic areas over the lateral orbital rim is one of the most common long term complication that may be easily missed by the surgeon if they do not follow their patients long term. The thinning over the rim often does not become obvious for 6-12 months following the procedure and requires fillers or fat grafting to correct. Of all the potential problems, permanent facial paralysis and major tissue loss are the most devastating. Fortunately, these particular complications are rare (<0.3%, which is less than that for a standard lower face-lift). Regardless, it is critical to know the precise anatomy and to avoid improper or excessive retraction, overzealous cautery, and overthinning of the flaps when transecting the depressors. In addition, hematomas must be diagnosed and treated without delay.

Some problems such as corneal abrasions can be very concerning to the patient owing to the severe pain and can be nearly eliminated by proper technique and perioperative attention to detail. For instance, an eye lubricant should always be used. Also, thought should be given to the placement of temporary tape strips, such as Steri-Strips, over the eyelids or a tarsorrhaphy suture to help prevent inadvertent scratching of the cornea by gauze or tubing, for example, during the procedure (see Fig. 75.16). All severe pain requires immediate evaluation, and suspected abrasion should be treated by appropriate ophthalmic drops for pain and patching of the affected eye for 12-24 hours. Appropriate ophthalmologic consultation is required for persistent or uncontrollable eye pain, persistent dry eye symptoms, or unusual changes in vision. Minor blurred vision for the first 12 hours is not unusual owing to chemosis and use of ophthalmic ointments.

Alopecia and sensory disturbances can be bothersome to the patient and often are not permanent. The problem is the inability to predict whether the numbness a patient has will partially, fully, or not go away, and just how soon it might be alleviated. With proper technique, an endoscopic forehead and brow lift has a high rate of sensory nerve recovery, but full recovery may take several months and require patient reassurance. Although exact numbers are not known, empirical observation of the last 300 endoscopic brow lifts suggests that sensory disturbances are an occasional early concern but an unusual complaint after 6-12 months. Most patients have early sensation of the forehead but numbness in the posterior scalp supplied by the deep branch of the supraorbital nerve. This is typically not a major concern to the patient and slowly improves over a period of 8 months. Alopecia, conversely, is a significant

concern, especially if it persists longer than 6-12 months. Hair may return after an average 4- to 8-month dormancy period of the hair follicle (Fig. 75.35). The "shock" period of hair loss is called telogen effluvium and can be dramatic, but fortunately, it is temporary. However, excessive tension on the flaps, rough handling of wound margins, or excessive use of cautery near follicles may lead to permanent hair loss that requires treatment [116].

Proper planning, technique, and postoperative care help to reduce the incidence of complications. Immediate and appropriate treatment along with sincere concern for the patient's well-being should help to reduce the chance of the situation worsening or the patient being dissatisfied.

# Summary and Conclusions

An explosion in the number of rejuvenation techniques for the upper face in the past decade, led by the use of endoscopes and botulinum toxin, has revolutionized the treatment of aging in this area. Cosmetic surgery treatment of the upper third of the face is frequently an essential component for complete facial rejuvenation. Procedures are highly variable and can offer improvement to both young and old. Matching the problems to the ideal rejuvenation techniques is essential for maximum aesthetic benefits. Even the best surgical technique can result in inadequate or even poor results if improper patient selection or incorrect diagnoses are made; for this reason, the forehead and brow area must be evaluated critically for a wide range of interlacing diagnoses.

Specific skin problems vary with a patient's age and sex, but gravity remains consistent and nonselective; therefore, the only issues regarding the occurrence of brow ptosis are when it will occur and how severe it will be. Wrinkles are also inevitable but may be dynamic or static in nature. Thanks to botulinum toxin, the previously difficult treatment of dynamic upper facial lines can be effected at low risk with a simple injection. The common and consistent finding of brow ptosis, especially in the lateral third of the brow, may now be selectively treated endoscopically to achieve a more youthful appearance. Society's idea of beauty at any one moment in time will ultimately help to guide the patient and surgeon to choose where the brow should be placed as opposed to merely raising it higher. True rejuvenation is likely more complex and involves multiple modalities and including replacement such as fat grafting. Fat grafting is can be one of the most rejuvenating procedures of the face when used appropriately. The use of PRP or stem cells to enhance fat grafting results is other possible options. Time and persistence will prove what best restores youth to the upper face as techniques evolve and new fillers and new energy devices are created.

Facial cosmetic surgery continues to rise in popularity. The aging population wants to feel and look more youthful while keeping a natural looking appearance. Today's discerning patient is often very knowledgeable on the subject of the cosmetic surgery options and may insist on a specific technique. The advice of a well-trained surgeon and diagnostician may make or break the ultimate result and prevent a cosmetic disaster. It is vital that the surgeon refuse to perform treatment that is not in the best interest of the patient. Cosmetic surgery is a luxury and is an optional procedure, no matter how much of an emergency some patient believes it is at the time. It is the surgeon's responsibility to provide the patient with the most beneficial and safest options available to achieve realistic goals.
