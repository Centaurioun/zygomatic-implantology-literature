# Learning Aims

1. No specialty "owns" the face. Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgeons are well adept and equipped to manage the aging face.  
2. Thorough evaluation and diagnosis is essential.  
3. Multiple nonsurgical modalities exist to augment or defer surgical intervention.  
4. Intimate understanding of materials and techniques improve outcomes.  
5. Cosmetic surgical and nonsurgical procedures can augment orthognathic and reconstructive procedures.  
6. Complications can be avoided but inevitably will arise. Identification and management improve patient safety and satisfaction.

# Foreword

If one were to look at timeline of cosmetic surgery, there would be a big blip in the 1990s. Although facelift, blepharoplasty, chemical peeling, and brow lifting were mainstays prior to this time, a revolution occurred in multiple fronts, including technology, biomaterial, digital interaction, and new therapies and medications. These innovations included the following:

SMAS procedures in facelift  
Anesthesia progress such as LMA (laryngeal mask airway), propofol, new anesthetic gasses, TIVA (total intravenous anesthesia) and of course tumescent liposuction  
Endoscopic brow and forehead lift  
Laser and light technologies, which included resurfacing, incisions, IPL (intense pulsed light), vascular lasers, and laser hair removal  
Liposuction  
Anatomic silicone implants  
Neuromodulators  
Facial fillers

This truly represented more than a blip. Surgeons already in practice were tasked in learning new techniques, and surgeons in training had these procedures integrated into their core curriculum.

Another paradigm shift occurred in that many of these new procedures and techniques that could be performed by numerous specialties; many of which traditionally did not perform a significant amount of cosmetic procedures.

This was an ecumenical period where numerous specialties including plastic surgery, ENT, oral and maxillofacial surgery, dermatology, oculoplastic surgery, anesthesia, and Ob/Gyn developed many of the newer techniques. Given the aforementioned, it was selfish and undermining that some specialties adapted these advances but legislated against other specialties (inclu

ing those that pioneered the innovations) from legally performing them! Politics always permeates progress.

In the mid-1990s, I began performing cosmetic facial surgical procedures and luckily was able to take advantage of this cornucopia of progress. I was on the forefront of this progress and a soldier in the struggle for OMSs to perform these procedures.

I attended a meeting of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery around 1997 and had the pleasure of meeting Jean and Alastair Carruthers from Vancouver, BC. About 10 years prior to this, Jean was performing an oculoplastic strabismus fellowship with Dr. Allen Scott in San Francisco. Botulinum toxin A (BTA) had been used in strabismus studies, and some of these patients noticed a coincidental improvement of crow's feet wrinkles from the injections. Alastair, a progressive dermatologist, took interest in this phenomenon and injected an employee in the glabella region with this then, mysterious drug. It safely worked and ushered in one of the greatest periods of new-found progress in cosmetic surgery history.

I became friends with the doctors Carruthers and was lucky to be the only OMS included in the pioneer multispecialty group, taught by Allergan to introduce this product to the masses. From this nucleus of multispecialty doctors (and a single OMS), the teaching arm of Botox was established. This made me one of the first OMS to use, teach, and publish on neuromodulators and propelled me to the top  $3\%$  of injectors of Botox in the United States. I consider this one of the most fortuitous happenings in my professional life. This led to my knowing the vast majorities of movers and shakers in the major cosmetic specialties in the United States and abroad. I also feel that this helped more key players understand the training and capabilities of OMS.

Due to the notoriety and brilliance of the Carruthers, it only made sense that they would chair the introduction of injectable fillers into the same arena. I was once again fortunate to be the sole OMS in this technology and became both an early adapter, teacher, and author. Injectable treatments (neuromodulators and fillers) quickly became a mainstay of my practice.

The remainder of this chapter will deal with neuromodulators (the more medically correct term for neurotoxins), injectable fillers, and other surgical and nonsurgical modalities.

With the early introduction of Botox for cosmetic procedures, most treatments were off label and consisted of glabella, frontalis, and lateral canthal treatments. Who would think of injecting it elsewhere, it was the deadliest toxin in the universe! Also, contemporarily to those times was the goal of complete paralysis of those areas, what today is less desired.

Prior to the introduction of hyaluronic acid fillers, I was injecting (as was everyone) bovine collagen preparations. This required an allergy test a month prior to treatment and rarely lasted more than several months. It was primarily injected in nasolabial folds and lips. No one ever came into my practice requesting "tear trough," chin, cheek, mandibular, temporal, etc. filling with bovine collagen. Also, it was not reversible.

The hyaluronic acid fillers were game changers and allowed safe, nonallergenic, panfacial treatments that were reversible. Truly another paradigm shift.

At the time of this publication, I am entering my 22st year of performing cosmetic procedures and my 15th year of limiting my practice to cosmetic facial surgery only. I have a busy international surgical practice and have performed over 1300 facelifts, 6000 eyelid surgeries, 2000 laser resurfacing treatment, and thousands of other procedures. I am not saying this in arrogance, but rather to illustrate that these procedures, surgical and nonsurgical, are well in the training, scope and purview of OMSs. Although my practice is only cosmetic procedures, I have many OMS colleagues with thriving dento-alveolar and implant practices that also perform cosmetic procedures. We truly have an amazing and broad specialty that allows us to customize what we love, what we are good at, and what benefits our patients. If any OMS believes that cosmetic facial surgery is beyond them, they are wrong. It really is a natural fit for our specialty and can be tailored to one's interest.

I have personally authored this chapter in the last several editions of the wonderful textbook series and have also written three major textbooks on cosmetic surgery and authored hundreds of articles. I have to admit I am a bit tired of typing! Germane to this is the fact that author diversity is a requirement of publishing, teaching, and learning, otherwise procedures can become inbred. To that note, when I was given the honor of once again authoring this chapter, I felt it was time to see some new names, ideas, and experiences in print for our specialty. I went through a short list of OMSs that I felt had the same fire in their belly and brain that I did when I began immersion in cosmetic facial surgery. I know a lot of younger docs who are innovators and authors, but Dr. Ryan Diepenbrock topped the list. Ryan is becoming a respected surgeon, author, and teacher and a loud and proud proponent of our specialty. He has the volume of patients, the teaching and authoring experience, and the energy and enthusiasm to become a leader in our specialty and the field in general.

Although I have authored this introduction and will serve as a coauthor for this chapter, I have asked Dr. Diepenbrock to write the lion's share.

# 77.1 Introduction

No one specialty "owns" the face, but oral and maxillofacial surgeons are uniquely qualified through formal training, both didactic and surgical, to make a strong argument as the masters of the region. Facial cosmetic surgery continues and will continue to grow in popularity not only for the public but also for surgeons looking to either expand or focus one's practice. The days of offering only a handful of procedures on the menu are gone. Contemporary facial cosmetic surgeons must be able to offer a smorgasbord of surgical and nonsurgical procedures.

Many surgical procedures were previously covered in this book. This chapter will focus on both surgical and nonsurgical facial cosmetic surgery procedures, which may be used in-lieu-of or in addition to common surgical modalities. Additionally, many adjunctive procedures may be incorporated with orthognathic surgery and reconstructive surgery. The term adjunctive means; "To add something else as a supplement rather than as an essential part." I think a better title to describe this chapter would be "Additional Facial Cosmetic Procedures" because often, and probably more frequently, these procedures are either used as a primary mode of facial rejuvenation or a complementary modality for larger surgical procedures.

In 2017, 17.5 million surgical and minimally invasive cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States. This is an increase of over  $100\%$  in the past 15 years [1]. In 2017, 1.8 million surgical cosmetic procedures were completed. In terms of surgical procedures, rhinoplasties and blepharoplasties rank among the top five most commonly performed with breast augmentation and liposuction topping the list. In terms of nonsurgical procedures, there were 15.7 million procedures completed with chemical peels and microdermabrasion among the top 5 minimally invasive procedures. Neuromodulators (Botox/Dysport/Xeomin) and soft tissue fillers topped the list [1, 2]. As these procedures continue to grow, it is evident that contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgeons will continue to increase cosmetic procedures into his or her practice.

# 77.2 Facial Evaluation

Proper facial evaluation is imperative prior to completing any cosmetic procedure. Although previously discussed in this text, it is worthy to give a brief overview. High quality, standardized facial photos are essential. Lighting, shadowing, resolution, and backgrounds are important not only for record management but also for marketing and promotion.

Standard facial evaluation begins by analyzing the facial thirds. In the upper facial third, the hairline is evaluated as well as forehead length. Horizontal and vertical rhytids are annotated as well as frontal bossing. Next, the middle facial 1/3 is reviewed paying special attention to the position and shape of the eyebrows and the position and character (ptosis vs. dermatochalasis vs. fat herniation) of the eyelids and periorbital structures. The volume of the infraorbital region to include the tear troughs should be annotated. The malar and submalar projection, otic projection, and nasal characteristics are also evaluated. In the lower facial 1/3, lip volume and architecture, mandibular asymmetries, jowling, genial projection, cervicometal definition, thyromental distance, submandibular gland ptosis, and platysmal banding are evaluated.

It is important to characterize the skin tone (Fitzpatrick 1-VI) [3] (Table 77.1) and the degree of rhytids and photoaging (Glogau 1-4). The Fitzpatrick score is the most widely used scale for classifying patients skin tone prior to resurfacing. It is based on skin response to sunlight as well as the amount of melanin. Although not an exact system, the scale also incorporates patient subjective response to sun exposure in terms of frequency of sunburns. Additionally, the patient's hair and eye color can help further delineate and aid in classification.

Type I—Fair skin (pale), with red or light blonde hair and blue/green eyes, that always burn and never tan  
Type II—Fair or white skin, with blonde hair and blue/green eyes, that usually burn and have difficulty tanning  
Type III—Dark-haired and brown eyed patients that sometimes burn and tan gradually  
Type IV-- Asians, Hispanics, Middle Eastern decent, and light skin African descent who rarely burn and tan easily  
Type V— Brown skinned of African descent who rarely burn and tan very easily  
Type VI—Very dark skin of African descent who never burn and tan very fast

The Fitzpatrick score is relevant because it provides guidance on the degree of risks associated with skin resurfacing. The darker the skin tone, the less forgiving skin resurfacing can be due to an increased risk of complications. Novice resurfacing surgeons are advised to hone their skills on Fitzpatrick I and II because these are the most stable skin tones and generally heal much better than darker tones. Darker tones must be approached with caution! [4]

The Glogau classification (Table 77.2) is used as an objective measure of rhytids and photoaging [5].

Table 77.2 Glogau grading system for wrinkles and skin damage  

<table><tr><td colspan="5">Glogau classification of photoaging</td></tr><tr><td>Group</td><td>Classification</td><td>Typical age</td><td>Description</td><td>Skin characteristics</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>Mild</td><td>28–35</td><td>No wrinkles</td><td>Early photoaging: mild pigment changes, no keratosis, minimal wrinkles, minimal or no makeup</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>Moderate</td><td>35–50</td><td>Wrinkles in motion</td><td>Early to moderate photoaging: early brown spots visible, keratosis palpable, but not visible, parallel smile lines begin to appear, wears some foundation</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>Advanced</td><td>50–65</td><td>Wrinkles at rest</td><td>Advanced photoaging: obvious discolorations, visible capillaries (telangiectasias), visible keratosis, wears heavier foundation always</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>Severe</td><td>60–75</td><td>Only wrinkles</td><td>Severe photoaging: yellow-gray skin color, prior skin malignancies, wrinkles throughout-no normal skin, cannot wear makeup because it cakes and cracks</td></tr></table>

Table 77.3 Hamilton grading system for treatment options based on type, location, and etiology of the aging face  

<table><tr><td colspan="6">Hamilton&#x27;s classification of contour changes of facial skin</td></tr><tr><td>Facial aging</td><td>Clinical morphology</td><td>Tissue location</td><td>Clinical location</td><td>Etiology</td><td>Optimal treatment</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Folds</td><td>Muscular</td><td>Nasolabial folds, neck, eyelids</td><td>Loss of tone, gravity</td><td>Rhytidectomy, blepharo-plasty</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Furrows</td><td>Musculocutaneous</td><td>Forehead, smile lines</td><td>Repeated facial expression</td><td>Fillers, implants</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Wrinkles</td><td>Cutaneous</td><td>Cheeks, crow&#x27;s feet, perioral</td><td>Intrinsic aging, photoaging</td><td>Resurfacing, laser, chemical peels</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Combination</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Combined approach</td></tr></table>

Using this system, the surgeon is better able to choose procedures, which will most effectively provide optimal results. For example, a Glogau I patient who has mild pigment changes and dynamic rhytids may be best treated with topical skin care and neuromodulators, while a Glogau IV patient would be far better managed with ablative skin resurfacing and surgical intervention.

Hamilton's classification (Table 77.3) categorizes facial aging as well as optimal treatment for such conditions. His classification is based on the clinical morphology and location as well as the etiology [6].

Used in combination, the grading scales are useful for evaluation and treatment planning. It is essential that the surgeon is able to properly evaluate the patient and understand the etiology of facial aging. Only with a firm grasp of the facial anatomy to include the skeletal substructure, muscles of facial expression, and skin health can the surgeon select the optimal procedures and adjuncts to best treat each patient.

# 77.3 Neuromodulators

The bulk of any facial cosmetic practice has to be minimally invasive procedures (MIPs). Whether to treat mild solar dyschromias or dynamic rhytids, to stave off surgical intervention, or add the "icing on the cake" to surgical treatment, MIPs provide an option for patients from all age ranges. Of all the MIPs, neuromodulators are the workhorse. Before the mid-1990s, there were no predictable procedures to stop unwanted mimetic muscle movement and associated skin rhytids. The first medical application of Botulinum toxin A (BTAs) was in 1977 when Dr. Alan Scott used it for the treatment of strabismus. The cosmetic application of Botulinum toxin A exploded when Drs. Jean and Alistair Carruthers observed effacement of periorbital and glabellar rhytids in patients treated for blepharospasm. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved Botox Cosmetic for temporary improvement of moderate to severe glabellar

upper facial thirds neuromodulator injections in number of units of Botox or Xeomin

lines. Today, Botox (Allergan), Dysport (Galerma), Xeomin (Merz), and newly approved Jeuveau (Evolus) are all FDA approved neuromodulators.

Botulinum toxin A produces temporary muscle paralysis by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Here, it prevents calcium-dependent release of acetylcholine, thus producing denervation of the muscle. This denervation persists until new fibrils grow from the nerve and produce new junctions on muscle cell walls. By having a thorough understanding of the muscles of facial expression, the injector can selectively weaken or paralyze muscles while retaining the action of others to obtain the desired effect.

The frontalis, procerus, corrugators, and orbicularis oculi are the most commonly injected muscles for cosmetic indications. Additionally, contemporary injectors also treat the masseter muscles to achieve a slimmer, more tapered lower facial third. The orbicularis oris muscles may be selectively treated for perioral rhytids and excessive gingival display as can the depressor anguli oris to elevate the commissures of the mouth. The chin is also commonly injected to relax a hyperdynamic mentalis muscle in order to relieve an "orange peel "or "golf ball" appearance of the chin. The platysma is occasionally injected to decrease the presence of anterior cervical banding.

It is important for novice surgeons to be familiar with anatomical landmarks prior to injections. Injections should remain  $10\mathrm{mm}$  above and/or lateral to the supraorbital rim to prevent denervation of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (Fig. 77.1a). Inadvertent injection to this muscle may result in lid ptosis.

Prior to injection, the site must first be cleaned. An isopropyl alcohol wipe is sufficient. After the neuromodulator of choice has been reconstituted per manu

facture's recommendations, the sites may be marked with surgical ink. Marking may not be necessary for experienced injectors, but those new to BTAs should measure and mark the planned sites.

Injection sites and amount placed are variable among patients.  $\square$  Figure 77.1b shows common injection sites for upper facial third neuromodulator injection and the number of units of Botox, Jeuveau, or Xeomin commonly injected per site. Males frequently require higher dosing. Because Dysport (Abobotulinumtoxin A) is different molecularly than Xeomin (Incobotulinumtoxin A), Jeuveau (Prabotulinumtoxin A) and Botox (Onabotulinumtoxin A), the dosing is also different. As a general rule of thumb, dosing for Dysport is 2.5-3 times the number of units required for its competitors.

After injection, it takes roughly 3 days for the effect of the BTA to begin. This generally presents a mild feeling of weakness. The patients typically say, "My forehead feels different" or "slightly heavy." After three weeks, the BTAs have fully blocked the reuptake of acetylcholine resulting in paresis. The effects generally last 3-4 months. It is important to for patients new to BTAs truly understand that the results are not immediate and typically take a few weeks to "work" (Fig. 77.2).

Complications, although uncommon, may occur. Probably the most frequent complication is ecchymosis at the injection site. The lateral orbit tends to be the most common area affected likely due to the superficial location of the vasculature as well at the thin nature of the skin and subcutaneous layers. Overelevation or peeking of the lateral brow may occur if the lateral frontalis muscle is not treated or inadequately treated. A "chemical" brow lift is completed by significantly weakening the lateral brow depressor action by injecting the superior lateral orbicularis muscle. If the middle portion of the frontalis muscle is treated, but the lateral frontalis

$\square$  Fig. 77.2 Patient one month after injection of neuromodulator. (a) horizontal rhytids prior to injection of neuromodulators. (b) resolution of rhytids one month after treatment

(at the junction of the lateral and middle 1/3 of the brow) is not treated, then the unopposed action of the lateral frontalis will result in over elevation and an unnatural "peaked" appearance (Fig. 77.3a). If this occurs, two units of Botox/Xeomin/Jeuveau or five units of Dysport may be placed to relax the muscles but still afford a small amount of elevation to the lateral brow to achieve an aesthetic arched appearance (Fig. 77.3d).

Inadvertent or over injecting muscles may lead to ptosis, diplopia (extraocular muscle is affected), lip incompetence, asymmetric smile, or even dysphagia from errant platysma injections. Although complications are always possible, the astute injector should be able to significantly decrease the chance of inadvertent muscle paralysis.

# 77.3.1 Injectable Facial Fillers

In addition to Botulinum toxin A, facial fillers have been a game changer. Although facial fillers are nothing new, non-animal derived hyaluronic acid fillers are new players and

![](images/5dfbe87b4e952fe0f28b5fadcd6c71354730949a9c5d12b7d57f6dc17b627584.jpg)

have revolutionized the nonsurgical facial rejuvenation market. Prior to the mid-2000s, facial volume restoration was restricted to fat transfer, bovine collagen, facial implants, and silicone. Hyaluronic acid fillers (HA) have captured a major percentage of the market because of their long-term stability compared with collagen and the fact they are relatively inert. HAs are natural polysaccharides, which means, unlike bovine collagen, no allergy testing is necessary. The Restylane and Juvederm lines of hyaluronic filler make up the largest portion of the American facial filler market. Additionally, FDA approved hydroxylapatite (Radiesse), L-polylactic acid (Sculptra), and silicone oil (Silikon 1000) are major players in the contemporary practice. Unlike HA and hydroxylapatite fillers, which exert affect via bulk fill and water retention, Sculptra and Silicon stimulate foreign body reactions that induce collagen encapsulation resulting in volume augmentation. Injections of platelet-rich plasma are also showing promise for volume restoration via stimulation of collagen production.

Facial fillers can be placed virtually anywhere on the face. Although the nasolabial folds and lips are probably the most common sites of injection, other frequently treated areas include the tear troughs, cheeks, infraorbital region, temples, marionette lines, mandibular angle, acne scars, eyebrows, and nose. Unlike 30 years ago, facial cosmetic surgeons have a better appreciation for the effects of volume loss and its intimate tie with facial aging. Filler may be placed anywhere where volume is lost. The placement and depth of the filler is dependent on the defect being treated as well as the filler being used. Due to the brevity of this chapter, only HA fillers will be discussed.

Lip augmentation is an extremely common procedure. It is first important to listen to each patient's chief complaint and desires. As we age, the upper lip length often lengthens. As the soft tissue losses laxity, there frequently is a loss of upper lip volume and delineation of

the vermilion border. Many older patients simply want recreation of the white roll and definition of the architecture of the lip, while younger patients, who still have good definition and architecture, request plumper and fuller lips (  $\text{口}$  Fig. 77.4).

There are multiple techniques for placing filler in the lips. First the lips are anesthetized with either local or topical anesthetic. As mentioned earlier, older women generally have both volume loss and flattening of the architecture of the lip. For these patients, I generally begin by recreating the white roll or vermilion border. For thin and flattened lips, the middle 2/3 of the lip is injected along the vermilion borders of the upper and lower lip. Filler is not generally placed laterally to the commissures in order to avoid an "duck" like lip. The white roll is injected in the mid dermal plane. This allows the injector to accentuate cupid's bow and refine the definition of the lips.

Next, volume is added. For younger patients and those who have an existing aesthetic shape, volume is used to create fullness or pout. Beginning along the wet/ dry line, filler is placed in either a horizontal or vertical fashion. Again, care must be taken not to overfill the lateral one-third of the lip to avoid an artificial appearance. Most younger patients can afford roughly 0.4-  $0.5\mathrm{ml}$  of filler per lip. Older patients, or those desiring significant volume, may tolerate much more.

It is important to remember that the upper lip is generally one-third of the total lip volume while the lower lip makes up roughly two-thirds. In today's society, these proportions are leaning more to a one-to-one ratio where the upper and lower lip are close to  $50\%$  each of the total volume. I find this especially true in today's younger patients. It is also important to keep in mind that an aesthetic upper lip forms a smooth "M" with the tubercle of the upper lip forming a point caudal to the parasagittal lip. Conversely, the lower lip should match

nicely in a "W" fashion. Volume is added to the parasagittal midline to create "pillows" (Fig. 77.5a-c).

The nasolabial folds and the pre-jowl sulci/marionette lines are a much more forgiving locations for facial fillers. These areas require generally  $0.5 - 1\mathrm{ml}$  per anatomical site. It is often preferable to layer fillers with different properties in these areas. Doing so, affords the opportunity for a more natural look. By using fillers with different particle sizes, multiple planes can be treated. By layering a filler with larger particle size in the deep dermis or superficial subcutaneous layer, bulk fill can be utilized to "pop out" deep folds. Layering in the dermis and subdermal plane with a medium particle-sized filler allows for more control and precision with moderate to even fine rhytids. It is important to understand the properties of each HA filler in your armamentarium and to use each one accordingly for optimal results.  $\square$  Figure 77.6 shows the results of layering two Restylane products with different particle sizes to achieve optimal results. Restylane Defyne was placed in the deep dermal and subcutaneous

layer. It is key to carefully inject to avoid migration lateral to the marionette line and nasolabial fold. Restylane Defyne provided the bulk of the fill. Restylane Refyne was then placed in the mid dermal layer to efface moderate to shallow rhytids.

One of the most common areas injected today is the tear trough and infraorbital region. The aging process not only affects the elasticity of the skin but also affects facial supporting structures such as the orbital malar ligament and the zygomatic-cutaneous ligament [7]. Younger patients may have structurally intact ligamentous tone but may have a hypoplastic maxilla or malar/ submalar deficiency. Older patients may have hypertrophic orbicularis oculi muscles, orbital septum laxity, and pseudoherniation of the lower lid fat pads. Any of these changes alone, or in combination, may result in dark, linear grooves extending from the lateral nasal wall to the lateral orbital rim to include the palpebromalar groove. Significant tissue laxity is best treated with surgical intervention, while minor cases may be treated with

filler. Techniques are usually multimodal an include layering the filler from the periosteum to the dermal layer. Just as in other areas, a layering technique using fillers with different particle sizes often results in the best outcome (Fig. 77.7).

Another indication for filler, which has been gaining widespread attention, is nasal augmentation. Dramatic results may be accomplished using larger particle sized filler for dorsal and subnasal augmentation. It is key for the injector and the patient to understand the limita

tions of nasal augmentation. It should be obvious to the injector, but the indications are not always obvious to the patient. HA filler will not treat a bulbous tip, decrease nasal projection or narrow a nasal dorsum. It is useful for patients who have a dorsal hump secondary to a low radix take-off and projection and with an exaggerated supratip break. Camouflaging nasal deformities can only be done at the sacrifice of adding additional volume. Under rotated nasal tips may be camouflaged by injecting in the subnasal region while adding small aliquots in the nasal tip to give the illusion of rotation (Fig. 77.8).

HA fillers are not without potential complications. The most common filler complication is probably postinjection edema and ecchymosis. This is easily treated with ice postoperatively and tincture of time. Hematoma formation or excessive bleeding may occur, and it is frequently in the lips. Inadvertent perforation into the superior or inferior labial artery or vein may cause significant bleeding. If a hematoma is encountered during injection, it is advisable to postpone additional filler to the region until the edema an ecchymosis has resolved. Slight asymmetry is not uncommon especially after large volumes of HA and is usually managed with a minor "touch-up." Contour irregularities or "lumps and bumps" occur with filler placed too superficially. This may also be compounded by placing a high viscosity filler in a less forgiving area such as the infraorbital region. Lower viscosity fillers such as Restylane Silk or Belotero are recommended for superficial injections.

Infections are extremely uncommon and are managed as any other cutaneous infection. Overfilling and

underfilling may occur. It is important to access the patients' desired outcome prior to proceeding with filler. It is important to remain conservative yet effective. It is good practice to treat one side or region first, then allow the patient to view the results. This not only helps to prevent over or under treatment but also allows the patient to see the progress in real time.

Significant complications such as vascular compromise leading to tissue necrosis, blindness, and stroke have been reported in the literature and are occurring much more frequently today due to the large uptick in filler placement over the past 15 years. Almost always the culprit is direct injection of filler material into the vasculature, which can cause antegrade flow leading to total obstruction. Retrograde and then antegrade movement of a filler within the facial arterial system can occlude the ophthalmic and/or central retinal artery leading to blindness. Although antegrade movement from intra-arterial injection may occur anywhere, complications are most often associated with infiltration of the distal branches of the ophthalmic artery to include the dorsal nasal, angular, supraorbital, and supratrochlear arteries. The venous drainage of the face via the internal and external jugular veins can lead to the cavernous sinus and the pulmonary system embolisms. Documented cases of pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest resulting from intravascular injection of materials into the middle temporal vein have been reported.

Every office that injects hyaluronic acid fillers should have hyaluronidase readily available. Hyaluronidase works by hydrolyzing the HA filler. The majority of the HA is dissolved within the first few minutes of place

ment of hyaluronidase. The remaining usually takes a day or two to complete. Repeated reversal may be needed for large volume HA filler.

# 77.4 Fat Transfer

As the facial cosmetic surgery paradigm continues to shift from tissue resection and resuspension to volume rejuvenation, no text on this subject matter would be complete without a section on autologous fat transfer. Volume loss is readily noticeable as we age. Loss of skin elasticity, resorption of the infraorbital region and malar process of the maxilla, and fat atrophy lead to a deflated and hollowed look. The combination of these factors leads to periorbital and temporal hollowing, tear-trough and A-frame deformities, deepened nasolabial folds, thin lips, and creation of a pre-jowl sulcus.

Contemporary facial cosmetic surgery relies as much on volume replacement as conventional lifting and repositioning. Current modalities for volume replacement include facial implants (silicone or porous polyethylene), injectable fillers, or autologous fat. There are multiple variables that must be considered when deciding the type of augmentation and technique best suited to replace volume. Often times, multiple modalities may be needed to get the ideal result. Factors such as the degree of volume loss, thickness and quality of overlying skin, the patient's financial means, and his or her desire for surgical vs. nonsurgical treatment all play a role in treatment planning. When considering volume rejuvenation, the surgeon must also take into account large shifts in the patient's BMI or anticipated weight loss. This is especially important when considering fat transfer.

Autologous fat transfer can be used as a solo procedure or to compliment other procedures. I often describe fat transfer to my patients as "an icing on the cake procedure." In my practice, autologous fat transfer is useful when treating small to moderate degrees of volume loss. It can work very well in the periorbital area to diminish hollowing or provide a small amount of brow lifting. It is very useful to efface temporal hollowing and tear trough deformities. For patients with mild to moderate pseudoherniation of the lower orbital fat pads with associated lateral orbital and nasojugal hollowing, fat transfer is useful in camouflaging the prolapsed fat and may alleviate the necessity to do a lower lid blepharoplasty. This is in contrast to a patient with significant malar/submalar deficiency who may benefit more from an implant. Additionally, a patient with deep jowling may benefit more from a face lift than fat transfer.

Many opponents to fat transfer will reference older literature citing only a  $30\%$  "take" rate of grafted fat. Although this may have been the case with older techniques, contemporary fat separation systems and the

addition of platelet-rich plasma show promise in increasing the survivability and "take" rate of grafted fat [8, 9]. I have tried nearly all of the traditional and contemporary separation techniques to include gravity separation, closed membrane filtration, fat washing, and multiple centrifuge techniques. My best results thus far are with the AdiPrep System (Harvest Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO) and platelet-rich plasma in a 10:1 fat/PRP ratio.

Multiple factors seem to influence the survivability of transferred fat. These factors include excessive negative pressure when harvesting, the amount of unseparated fatty acids, blood products, tumescent anesthesia, aggressive and excessive fat manipulation, bulk and unlayered injection technique, and injection into highly animated facial regions. Advanced fat processing systems such as AdiPrep and Puregraft have shown promise in increasing long-term fat retention rates. It is believed that these systems are superior compared with simple centrifuging or gravity separation because they remove more oils, blood products, and tumescent anesthesia.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been readily used in the fields of oral and maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and orthopedic surgery since the 1990s. PRP is blood plasma with a concentrated source of autologous platelets. Growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2, vascular endothelial growth factors, and connective tissue growth factors are released via the degranulation of alpha granules. This theoretically stimulates both bony and soft tissue healing [10]. PRP has gained popularity recently in the fields of wound care, sports medicine, and cosmetic surgery.

PRP may be beneficial when combined with autologous fat transfer because it may aid in wound healing and graft survival. One of the downsides of fat transfer is the inability to place large volumes of fat and expect survival. Grafted fat must have a blood supply in order to survive. Without a blood supply, the grafted fat will undergo central necrosis leaving only the adipocytes which were able to obtain a blood supply via neoangiogenesis. It is believed that PRP will increase the survivability of transferred fat because the activated growth factors will bind to the mesenchymal cells such as endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, epidermal cells, adipoblasts, and osteoblast. The result of this binding is cellular proliferation and angiogenesis leading to graft survival.

# 77.5 Patient Selection

Although there is a paradigm shift in facial cosmetic surgery from resection/suspension to volume rejuvenation, fat is not the Holy Grail. There are many doctors

promoting liquid lifts, full face fat grafting, and other nonsurgical modalities. As stated earlier, there is a time and a place for fat transfer, but patients with significant jowling, deficient genial projection, submental laxity and platysmal banding, moderate to severe brow ptosis, and deficient midface projection will require more than fat grafting can offer.

Patients with a history of fluctuating weight may not be good candidates for autologous fat. Fat is frequently transferred from the abdomen or thighs. Consequently, these are often the first locations to gain size when a person gains weight. Since fat maintains its properties when transferred, if a patient has large shifts in weight after transfer, there may be significant asymmetries, and cosmetic deformities [11].

Very thin patients with extremely thin, friable skin, significant photo damage, and deep static rhytids (Glogau 4) may also be questionable candidates. These patients are prone to postoperative topographical irregularities due to lack of subcutaneous tissue volume (every little bit shows), prolonged erythema, tissue breakdown, and resorption.

Caution should also be taken with the young adult population. What a young patient perceives as a cosmetic defect in his or her 20s or 30s may continue to worsen as the patient matures. As the patient ages, continued changes in skin elasticity, fat volume, and underlying bone architecture will progress. A better option may be hyaluronic acid or other fillers.

In my practice, I most commonly transfer fat to the lower lids and tear troughs. This is followed by the cheek and malar region, the upper lid and brow, and temples. Next most common are the pre-jowl sulcus and mandibular border. I less commonly will inject in the lips and nasolabial folds. I feel these areas are usually better treated with injectable fillers. Due to the high mobility in these regions, I feel that the percentage of fat that "takes" is less than other areas of the face.

When preparing for a case, it is extremely important to estimate the volume of fat needed.  $\square$  Figure 77.9 shows the most commonly grafted sites and the typical amount of fat transferred in milliliters. The transferrable fat yield will vary based on the fat preparation system used. For standard centrifuge separation at  $3000\mathrm{rpm}$  for 3 minutes, the general fat to lipoaspirate yield is roughly 1:3. For AdiPrep, the yield is generally 1:4 or 1:5. This would infer that a larger portion of waste product is being removed with the more advanced separation systems. When planning the amount of lipoaspirate to harvest, it is always advantageous to remove slightly more than estimated to avoid the need to reharvest.

![](images/fa933c33e7af6eb2bc8366af142ca581d1a1228cbc871428959d892e6696dc1e.jpg)

# 77.6 Harvesting

Common harvesting sites include the abdomen, flanks, lateral, and medial thighs and medial knees. I prefer to harvest fat from the medial thigh and knee. When following basic liposuction techniques, the medial thigh and knee are relatively safe locations due to the absence of vital structures. Even the thinnest patient will generally have enough fat to harvest in these areas. This is not always the case with the abdomen. It is important to note that when harvesting from the abdomen it is essential to ask about any history of abdominal surgery and to evaluate for untreated hernias.

In the preoperative holding, both the harvest and recipient sites are marked with the patient standing. Although I do not do body liposculpting in my practice, I still mark out a topographical map of the harvest site to ensure an even and aesthetic harvest. Once in the OR, small aliquots of  $1\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine are injected at the incision sites. Next, using either an 18-gauge needle or an 11

![](images/0d66cc8b1db457814291d86f8d6e8df33977fc572e06c2625a6c09bf653146c4.jpg)

blade, stab incisions are made. Using a blunt tipped harvester cannula (Sorensen or Tonnard; Tulip Medical, Inc., San Diego, CA), the harvesting sites are infiltrated with tumescent anesthesia in the lipocutaneous plane. Once the harvest site is blanched due to vasoconstriction (10-20 minutes), the harvesting cannulas are attached to a  $20\mathrm{ml}$  syringe and harvesting is began. Keeping in mind the fat to lipoaspirate yield, I will harvest roughly four times more lipoaspirate than the intended volume of fat needed to graft. This means for most patients, I will harvest roughly  $50 - 100\mathrm{ml}$  of lipoaspirate. I prefer to harvest bilaterally to ensure symmetry. Although a relatively small amount of fat is being harvested compared with a formal body liposuction procedure, the surgeon must still ensure a smooth tissue contour without dimpling. When harvesting fat, manual negative pressure, roughly  $2 - 3\mathrm{ml}$  (Fig. 77.10) has been shown to be less traumatic on harvested adipocytes [12]. Standard liposuction techniques are then applied to harvest the desired amount of fat.

After the fat is harvested, it is separated from the fatty acids, oils, blood, and tumescent anesthesia. There are multiple methods which have been discussed previously, but detailed description is beyond the scope of this text. In my practice, platelet-rich plasma is collected using either the SmartPrep system (Harvest Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO) or Eclipse PRP system (Eclipse, The Colony, Tx) and is then mixed with the purified fat in a 1-part PRP to 10-parts fat ratio via a Leur-Leur transfer technique. It is important to have a homogenous mix of PRP and fat.

![](images/02f6b85f9d924328bda4ec79f2095877f16b0769cf886c609dde2cbf38e0fa65.jpg)

It is important to understand that the lumen size of these cannulas and the harvesting cannulas are manufactured to a precise size. The optimal size of grafted fat should be roughly  $1\mathrm{mm}$  in size. This is related to the size needed to promote graft survival. Since fat initially survives by imbibition followed by inocultation, fat lobules greater than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter have a decreased chance of survival due to central necrosis. The Tulip system uses lumen sizes of 1.2, 0.9, and  $0.7\mathrm{mm}$  to transfer fat (Fig. 77.11).

# 77.7 Fat Transfer Procedure

Fat is then transferred via stab incisions located adjacent to facial subunits. In my practice, the periorbital region is the most commonly grafted subunit of the face. Using the injection sites shown in  $\square$  Fig. 77.12, the entire bilateral periorbital complex can be grafted with five or six stab incisions. The incision sites are located in a fashion to promote multidirectional access to specific sites. This promotes cross-hatching and uniform distribution and fill. Each injection site is anesthetized with a small aliquot of local anesthetic. An 18-gauge needle is then used at each of the required entry sites. Using a blunt tip cannula (Fig. 77.12), a multiplanar dissection is completed. These are the same blunt tip cannulas that will be used to inject the fat. To ensure success, fat must be injected into multiple facial planes. Fat is injected into the supraperiosteal, mid-facial to deep subcutaneous, and subcutaneous plane. The fat is placed in a layered fashion to ensure uniform volume and to maximize survival rate. Overfilling one plane (especially the subcutaneous plane) will lead to graft resorption, lumpiness, and asymmetry. Fat should always be placed upon withdrawal of the cannula. Injection upon advancing of a

A 1cc Monoject (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) is preferred because it affords the operator precise volume control (Fig. 77.13). A novice mistake is injecting the entire

length of the cannula. This will lead to excessive fat at the entry site. There are those who promote overfilling the transferred areas. I personally do not overfill. With contemporary harvesting, preparation, and surgical techniques, I feel that overfilling in anticipation of resorption is a thing of the past. During the preoperative consultation, I do explain that not all of the fat will "take" and occasionally we need to perform additional grafting. Using this technique, I regraft less than  $5\%$  of my patients.

After the completion of the procedure, the incision sites are closed with adhesive strips. The harvest sites are closed with resorbable gut suture and wrapped with 6" ACE bandages. Patients are sent home on antibiotic

# Case Presentation

Autologous fat transfer is an essential part of the contemporary cosmetic surgery practice. Volume is the key to a youthful appearance. Fat transfer may be used as an excellent stand-alone procedure for patients with mild to moderate volume loss or as an adjunct to more invasive procedures. The key is proper patient selection and evaluation.  
Figure 77.14 shows a patient with infraorbital hollowing with brow ptosis and asymmetry, deep set eyes, tear trough deformities, static and dynamic forehead and glabellar rhytids, deep nasolabial folds, and deficient lip volume and architecture. She was treated with a trichophytic brow lift to address the brow ptosis. Fat grafting for brow elevation alone would not have addressed this as a solo procedure, but complementary fat transfer in the brow, lateral canthal

region, and glabella helped to reduce the appreciable hollowing. Without fat grafting, a brow lift alone would have accentuated the deep-set appearance of the eyes. Fat grafting to the lower lids, nasojugal folds, and cheeks corrected the double convexity deformity and promoted a smooth transition at the lid/cheek junction. Another example of multimodality treatment was the use of hyaluronic acid filler in the lips and nasolabial folds.

Fat transfer also provides an excellent option for facial reconstruction. The same premise used for volume restoration in the facial cosmetic patient may be applied to patients status post ablative surgery for benign or malignant pathology as well as post trauma. Fat with PRP not only adds volume but also has unique properties of stimulating elas

tin and collagen production in the skin. This results supple, healthier looking skin over the grafted region.

Figure 77.15 shows is a 59-year-old female with a history of C6/7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion one year prior. After hardware failure, a second neurosurgical procedure was required. After the second surgical approach, a significant depressed and tethered scar resulted. She presented with a chief complaint of "I have a scar on my neck which is tight."

The extent of the scar tethering was outlined, tumescent anesthesia was injected, and subcision of the scar in multiple vectors and planes was completed until the overlying skin was freely movable. After  $120\mathrm{ml}$  of fat was collected and separated via Harvest® AdiPrep® (Harvest, Terumo, Lakewood, CO), platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was

collected using Harvest® SmartPrep® (Harvest, Terumo, Lakewood, CO). PRP was added to the fat in a 1:10 ratio of PRP/adipose.

A total of  $8\mathrm{ml}$  of fat and  $0.8\mathrm{ml}$  of PRP was injected via multiple stab incisions to the depressed region. A  $1.2\mathrm{mm}$  (18ga) SuperluerlokTM (Tulip Medical® San Diego CA) cannula was used to efface the defect. Fat was placed in multiple planes and vectors (Fig. 77.16).

Due to the significant defect preoperatively (Fig. 77.15a, c), it is important for the surgeon and the patient to have realistic expectations. The larger the volume deficiency, the further distance the grafted adipose tissue is from the native vasculature. In order for fat to survive, angiogenesis must take place. It is important to note that central necrosis of adipose occurs in fat lobules greater

and wound healing. Stimulating vascular ingrowth to the newly transferred fat will aid in survivability. Even when depositing fat in  $1\mathrm{mm}$  diameter lobules and adding PRP, large defects will usually require additional fat transfer. Waiting at least 4-6 months will give the surgeon and the patient a good prospective for what fat will survive [13].

As noted in the 6-month follow-up photos, there is good effacement and correction of the depressed scar (Fig. 77.15b, d). The skin is freely movable superficial to the platysma muscle. Due to some resorption of fat, a second procedure would further benefit the patient cosmetically.

Fat transfer is an ever changing and evolving discipline. It enables to surgeon to truly sculpt the face. Although there is a fairly steep learning curve, once mastered, the surgeon has artistic liberty to diligently build and refine a face from the base up. Over the next decade, research in the field of biomedical science and tissue engineering will continue to expand our knowledge and surely will influence our techniques and results. I am excited for this research and look forward to the future of fat transfer.

# 77.8 Facial Implants

Facial implants play an integral part in the authors' practices. Implants are fabricated from porous polyethylene, silicone, or calcium hydroxyapatite injections or blocks. Unlike "lifting procedures" such as mid-face lifts, which are often transient, implants provide permanent volume and are suitable for large defects. It is imperative to ensure there is adequate soft tissue bulk over the proposed implant site to decrease the risk of dehiscence of the overlying soft tissue. They are available as stock implants in an ever-increasing variety of shapes and sizes but also may be customized for individual defects using computed tomography.

Silicone implants are the authors' preferred implant of choice. Silicone implants (Implantech, Ventura, CA) are soft, pliable, natural feeling, easily sculpted and modified, nonresorbable, and easily fixated. One major advantage over porous polyethylene implants is that silicone implants do not promote soft tissue integration like porous polyethylene. The silicone becomes encapsulated, thus making their removal, if indicated, much

easier. One common misconception of facial implants is that they promote bony resorption over time. Although this may have been true early on, proper dissection and fixation has all but alleviated this issue. Micromovement of the implant overtime can lead to bone resorption and infection. It is essential to fixate the implants to the underlying bone. A subperiosteal dissection is completed in the desired location. The dissection should just be large enough to fit the implant. Sizers are available to use intraoperatively to facilitate proper size. Once the appropriate implant size is determined, the implant is positioned and fixated with screws. Some surgeons suture the implant to the overlying soft tissue. This technique does not adequately secure the implant and may result in an unnatural appearance and long-term complications.

Midface and chin augmentation are the two most common regions treated in the authors' practices. Additionally, the mandibular angle and border, temples, pyriform rim, and nasal dorsum are commonly augmented. In accessing the midface region, the surgeon must appreciate the malar projection, submalar volume, and infraorbital volume. The most common implant used is for submalar augmentation. These implants rest along the anterior maxilla with extensions along the zygoma. They are suited for augmentation of the sub

![](images/8a633db774ae2dd76c82599a1e34f632451482286d3986e1c94c5d0bab593d71.jpg)

malar area to include the infraorbital region. They may be placed as laterally or medially as needed to provide volume where needed. Additionally, malar implants may be used to augment isolated malar deficiencies. Combination malar/submalar implants may also be utilized to augment both areas simultaneously [14].

The youthful face shows a gentle "S" curve in the cheeks. This encompasses the middle facial one-third extending from the orbital rim to the to lower facial one-third. It should be evaluated using right and left  $\frac{3}{4}$  photos. Deficiencies present as a flattened malar prominence extending from the lateral canthus to the chin in the same view. The classically taught Hinderer's lines are used to access the point of maximum volume and projection of the cheeks. Two intersecting lines are drawn. The first from the ala to the tragus and a second from the commissure of the lip to the lateral canthus. The region posterior and superior to the intersection designates the region of maximum projection (Fig. 77.17). Although not an absolute, Hinderer's lines do provide

an estimation for the novice surgeon. Experienced surgeons understand the limitations and possess a three-dimensional conceptualization of what a youthful face should look like.

Malar and submalar implants provide an exceptional adjunct to orthognatic surgery. Maxillary hypoplastic patients often present with some degree of malar deficiency and infraorbital hollowing. Although the Le Fort I osteotomy advances the maxilla, thus advancing the caudal portion of the maxilla and anterior nasal spine, it does not augment the more cephalic regions of the midface.  $\bullet$  Figure 77.18 shows a male patient 6 months after Le Fort I advancement surgery with placement of silicone submalar implants.

Facial implants may be placed under local anesthetic, moderate to deep sedation, or with general anesthesia. If completing an intraoral approach (malar/submalar, some chin, and mandibular angle implants), the mucosa is anesthetized with  $3 - 5\mathrm{ml}$  of  $1 - 2\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000 epi via local infiltration and nerve blocks. Next, a mucosal incision is made in the sulcus, and a subperiosteal dissection is completed. The pocket should be just large enough to allow the implant to passively fit.

For malar and submalar implants, the subperiosteal dissection is completed, and the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle, perineural fat, and foramen are identified. The dissection along the arch is completed in a sweeping and tenting motion to create a pocket just wide and long enough to fit the tail of the implant. Next, the sizers are placed, and the desired final implant size is chosen. The lips are redrapped and symmetry and position accessed. Finally, the implants are held in place and secured with a  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  self-drilling screw in the maxillary buttress. The sites are irrigated and closed with chromic gut suture  $\blacksquare$  Fig. 77.19.

Chin implants may be placed either via an extraoral or intraoral approach. The decision is made on patient preference and other concomitant surgeries. One advantage of the intraoral approach is obviously no visible scar. Disadvantages are a slightly higher incidence of paresthesia and an increased infection rate. Extraoral approaches probably have a decreased rate of infection and temporary or permanent sensory disturbance but will leave a visible scar. The risks and benefits of each procedure must be discussed with the patient prior to surgery.

For intraoral approaches, I have the patient began using a chlorhexidine mouth rinse 3-4 days prior to the procedure and for one week postoperatively.

In the mandible, regardless of the approach, the mental nerves are identified after completion of a subperiosteal dissection. The muscle is stripped from the inferior border of the mandible to allow the implant to

Finally, the mentalis muscle is reapproximate and the incision is closed in a layered fashion.  $\square$  Figure 77.20 shows a genial implant placement intraorally as well as a prejowl implant placed via an extraoral approach.

Patients should be aware of certain potential risks and complications associated with facial implants. The most common being temporary or permanent paresthesia is caused from traction or direct injury to the infraorbital nerve or mental nerve. The vast majority of postoperative paresthesia is secondary to traction and is transient. Perioperative bleeding is often associated with muscle injury. The mentalis and masseter muscle are highly vascularized and bleed when injured. The mentalis muscle is usually transected with electrocautery during the surgical approach, thus decreasing the bleeding potential, while the masseter muscle may be traumatized from overly aggressive and careless dissection along the zygoma. These bleeds can be challenging to control especially with the relatively small access normally required to place the implant.

Other potential complications include an unaesthetic result requiring removal and buckling of the tail (Fig. 77.21) or wing of the implant resulting in a lump or bulge. Infection rate is historically quoted at  $10\%$ . An educated assumption may be made that intraoral placement probably has a higher infection rate due to the route of insertion.

# 77.9 Surgical Lip Lift

As mentioned previously in this chapter, the aging process results in the loss of volume and laxity of the skin and supporting structures. Aging leads to distinct changes in the lip as well. Older individuals tend to have flat, long upper lips devoid of volume and eversion. The nasolabial angle tends to become more acute. Sometimes the changes are so significant that an aesthetic result is beyond that of a filler (  $\square$  Fig. 77.22).

When analyzing preoperative photos for orthognathic, cosmetic, or dental implant patients, the surgeon must examine the position of the maxillary incisal edges and gingival display (or lack thereof) on animation. An aesthetic tooth-to-lip position is accessed with the lips in repose. By having the patient phonate a work such as

"Emma," the lips are placed in their natural position at the end of the last vowel. By touching the lips together (Em-) and parting (--ma), the lips are positioned without elevation from hypermobile levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle, levator anguli oris, or orbicularis muscle. A male patient should display  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$ $(1.9\mathrm{mm}$  average) of the incisal edges of the maxillary central incisors, while a female should show  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$ $(3.4\mathrm{mm}$  average) in repose (Fig. 77.23a) [14]. During animation, the upper lip should be roughly at the cervical margins of the maxillary central incisor teeth, or about  $10\mathrm{mm}$  the maxillary central teeth should show (Fig. 77.23b) [15]. Upper lip length is measured from subnasale to stomion of the upper lip. In females, this generally is around  $20\mathrm{mm}$ $(19 - 21\mathrm{mm})$  and in males about  $23\mathrm{mm}(21 - 22\mathrm{mm})$

![](images/20fa5a87fc2946b0476b466fb0e6de0191e0b0a1b5e92b620881bcd958d5ecb7.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 77.24 Upon examination, the patient showed an asymmetric upper lip with a negative tooth to lip distance in repose,  $60\%$  of incisal show on animation and an upper lip length of  $24\mathrm{mm}$

![](images/ebffbedafa288e43e6d1c3f2a94d10969e838b11de38fb9b3a4a6ed78cb9f928.jpg)

Pending the patient does not have a skeletal malformation or is not interested in orthognathic surgery, there are a few options to address malposition of the lips. For patients who are hyperactive lip elevators or have vertical perioral rhytids from puckering their lips (smokers), neuromodulators may be used to relax the lip elevator and contracting muscles. One to two units of Botox/ Xeomin/Jeuveau or 2.5-5 units of Dysport placed in 2-4 sites of the upper lip may provide enough relaxation to reduce a hyperactive smile. Patients with significant gingival display on animation secondary to vertical maxillary excess may be treated to some degree with neuromodulators, but not nearly to the same aesthetic result as maxillary impaction surgery. One must also consider the tooth length and the need for crown lengthening and gingivectomy surgery.

Many older patients do not fit these criteria and present with a complaint of a flat and long upper lip. For these patients, filler may add volume, but they will not address the long upper lip and may actually lead to very poor aesthetic result. These patients may require a lip lift. A lip lift not only will shorten the distance from stomion to subnasale but also will result in aesthetic

counterclockwise roll of the lip and increase the volume of the upper lip.

The patient in  $\boxed{\mathbb{O}}$  Fig. 77.24 is presented for lip filler to address her perceived loss of volume in the upper lip.

Upon examination, the patient showed  $-2\mathrm{mm}$  tooth-to-lip in repose;  $60\%$  of incisal is shown on animation and an upper lip length of  $24\mathrm{mm}$  with less fullness in the right upper lip. She is elected to undergo a lip lift procedure.

When planning a lip lift, a "bull-horn" like incision is designed so that after excision of the skin and muscles, the philtral columns and cupids bow of the lip will be elevated at predetermined level. It is important to not place the superior portion of the incision directly in the alar-nasal crease. Doing so will deepen the sulcus and leave a more pronounced scar. After the alar-subnasal incision is drawn, the surgeon then needs to determine the amount of the skin to excise. This is most often related to the amount of tooth-to-lip (incisal edge of the central incisors in repose) and the amount of tooth display on animation. The patient in Fig. 77.24 has  $-2\mathrm{mm}$  of incisal display in repose. As mentioned previously,  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of incisal display is considered the aes

thetic norm. With simple math, the upper lip must be raised  $6\mathrm{mm}$ . Reviewing her animation, she showed roughly  $60\%$  or  $6.5\mathrm{mm}$  of her  $11\mathrm{mm}$  total central incisor height is visible in full animation. As a result, raising

![](images/93b67b1d9d075a7cd7ce8d4da7f8ce143fb369e45e2506ad1d230f0069c1a1b8.jpg)  
Fig. 77.25 Planned incision design for a  $6\mathrm{mm}$  lip lift

the lip  $6\mathrm{mm}$  will show the entire upper incisor. A  $6\mathrm{mm}$  skin excision will leave  $18\mathrm{mm}$  of upper lip length, which is within the aesthetic limits.  $\square$  Figure 77.25 shows the planned incision design.

In order to obtain stability, not only the skin but also the underlying muscle must be excised. By removing a portion of the orbicularis oris muscle and depressor septi muscle, the lip will not only elevate but also evert and roll. Failure to remove the muscle may result in relapse, hypertrophic scaring, or depression of the nasal tip. Meticulous closure, especially deep suturing, will help to eliminate relapse, scaring, and nasal tip depression.

One year after lip lift, one can appreciate the fuller and more symmetrical upper lip. The patient now has  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of tooth-to-lip and shows roughly  $90\%$  of her upper incisors on animation. The upper lip length decreased from  $24\mathrm{mm}$  to  $18\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 77.24). In the profile view, the upper lip has rolled in a counterclockwise fashion and is fuller and more youthful (Figs. 77.26 and 77.27).

# 77.10 Skin Resurfacing

Skin resurfacing is a major component of today's cosmetic surgery practice. Skin resurfacing may range from periodic maintenance procedures (like changing the oil in your car) to fully ablative resurfacing (like popping out the dents and repainting). Many offices and spas offer "maintenance" procedures such as facials, microdermabrasion, microneedling, superficial chemical peels, and fractionated lasers. These modalities range in purpose and efficacy from simply cleaning out pores, removing dead skin, treating fine lines and wrinkles, to treatment of very minor acne scaring. The advantages are very little to no downtime, no anesthetic or topical anesthetic only, delegable to mid-level providers or estheticians, and very minimally invasive. The downside is that they will not give dramatic results for severe skin aging (Glogau 3 and 4). More aggressive resurfacing procedures such as moderate to deep chemical peels and ablative lasering offer the most impressive results but often require a much longer recovery time and anesthesia.

Skin resurfacing truly provides the "icing on the cake" for facial rejuvenation. Often completed simultaneously with surgical procedures, skin resurfacing evens out skin tone and texture, effaces rhytids, and thickens and promotes healthy skin. It is important to begin patients on medical grade skin care to include hydroquinone and tretinoin. For many patients, when these prescription medications are combined with daily cleansers, toners, exfoliators, moisturizers, and sunscreens, they

may often reach their desired result without more aggressive intervention. This is especially true or Glogau 1 and 2 patients. These patients may benefit from less invasive procedures described earlier as a way to maintain their results. For patients who need more aggressive treatment, preconditioning the skin with  $4\%$  hydroquinone and  $0.05 - 0.1\%$  tretinoin is needed to decrease the chance of postoperative complications such as hyper and hypopigmentation following medium to deep depth chemical peels and ablative laser resurfacing.

Chemical peels are a time-honored modality for the treatment of mild to moderate static rhytids and dyschromias. The authors use trichloroacetic acid (TCA) routinely in their practices and thus will focus on this type of peel. The depth of the peel is dependent on the agent(s) used, concentration of the agent, the number of passes or coats applied, and the physical properties to the skin. Superficial peels are limited to the epidermis. Medium-depth peels are considered those that reach to papillary dermis, while deep peels penetrate into the reticular dermis [4].

TCA exerts its actions by coagulating skin protein. Most frequently used in my practice are  $30\%$  and  $20\%$  TCA. These can be purchased relatively inexpensively from vendors or may be compounded by a local pharmacy. Beginning peelers are recommended to begin by using  $15 - 20\%$  TCA as a single pass to gain comfort prior to using  $30\%$  in multiple passes. Fifteen percent TCA can be formulated by mixing  $2\mathrm{ml}$  o  $30\%$  TCA and  $2\mathrm{ml}$  of sterile water. Patients who are classified as Fitzpatrick 1-3 are generally treated first with 4-6 weeks of hydroquinone  $(4\%)$  and tretinoin  $(0.05\%)$ .

Hydroquinone works by suppressing melanocytes. This is a reversible process and, sun exposure will cause repigmentation. Tretinoin works by modifying epithelial growth and differentiation. It increases mitotic activity, thus promoting turnover of the follicular epithelial cells. Patients of darker skin tone (Fitzpatrick 4-6) benefit from pretreatment duration of 8-12 weeks.

Although debatable, patients are prescribed antiviral medications (acyclovir/valacyclovir) and antibiotics to cover staphylococcus such as cephalexin (clindamycin for penicillin allergic patients) beginning 2 days prior to treatment. They continue these medications the day of the procedure and 4 days postoperatively. Patients undergoing superficial depth peels generally can forgo pretreatment antivirals and antibiotics unless they have a history of recurring herpes simplex infections. On the day of the procedures, the face is washed and cleansed with a hypoallergenic cleanser. Acetone is used to clean the skin of oils prior to application of TCA.

TCA is then applied to the face in even coats using a cotton ball,  $2 \times 2$  gauze, cotton tip applicator, or a gloved finger. Because the results are not immediate, the surgeon should plan the application per facial zones and not apply a second coat until the entire area or face has been treated. After 3-5 minutes, the treated skin will begin to become erythematous followed by a slightly frosted appearance. Water should always be available. Even though TCA cannot be neutralized, water can dilute the chemical especially if inadvertently dropped in the eye. Inadvertent application or dripping can be avoided by ensuring that the chemical or applicator will never passed over the eye, the container with TCA is never removed from the table, eye protection is worn, and the applicator is not "dripping" wet.

Multiple passes may be applied by experienced peelers. A single pass of  $15 - 20\%$  TCA results in generalized erythema to a patchy white frost. A medium depth peel (2-3 passes with  $30\%$  TCA) has an end point of a homogenous white frosting indicative of penetration to the papillary dermis. Another end point used for medium depth peel end points is a phenomenon referred to "epithelial sliding." This occurs when the TCA has penetrated into the papillary dermis and the overlying epithelium "slides" over the dermis.

The periorbital region and neck are often treated as separate treatment zones. Due to the thin tissue characteristics of the lids, the authors frequently complete one to two passes with  $20\%$  TCA for the upper and lower lids. Care is to be taken to avoid accidental placement in the eye. The neck, due to the lack of dense pilosebaceous units, is not for the novice injector. It should be treated very cautiously with a  $15 - 20\%$  TCA as a single pass.

![](images/20ba714926783f1d696523ac421fb58f2c1aedc44176481aa801f6dde239c6ed.jpg)  
Fig. 77.28 The difference between fractioned and ablative laser is apparent on the tongue depressor. On the left is fully ablative laser with no unaffected area between the laser. On the right, it shows a fractionated laser with columns of laser ablation with surrounding unaffected skin

After completion of the peel, a liberal application of Vaseline or Aquaphor is applied. The patient is instructed to begin gently washing his or her face with a hypoallergenic cleanser such as Cetaphil beginning the evening of the procedure and three to four times daily for one week. Aquaphor is applied after cleansing to keep the skin moist. Patients are advised at the one-week follow-up to discontinue Aquaphor and begin using a hypoallergenic moisturizer. Two to three weeks after the peel, tretinoin and hydroquinone are restarted. Protection from UV exposure is essential, and patients are to apply sunscreen as soon as the epithelium has completely sloughed. Retreatments may be accomplished 3- to 4-month intervals.

The work horse for the authors' skin resurfacing practice is without a doubt  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser. Laser skin resurfacing (LSR) is a predictable modality or treating fine, moderate, and deep static rhytids, solar dyschromias, acne scars, benign tissue pathology (sebaceous hyperplasia, syringomas, lentigines, and nevi), and premalignant conditions such as actinic keratosis.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  lasers offer both ablative and fractionated modes. Fractionated laser technology differs from ablative therapy in terms of the surface area of skin treated (density of laser columns per area of skin). In ablative lasering,  $100\%$  of the skin surface is treated. Dr. Niamtu uses the analogy of using a roller to paint a wall. In fractionated lasering, only selective sections per unit area of skin are treated. Essentially there remains untreated areas of skin between columns of lasered skin. This is like painting a wall with polka dots. Fractionated and ablative lasers rely on the process of epiboly where new epithelium migrates along the pilosebaceous subunits to heal surrounding tissue (Fig. 77.28).

Fractioned lasering has the advantage of much faster healing and recovery, but the drawback is the

![](images/38ffd587efd6f614bfb29661cb6b685f9de1f447c286710a20690e0cb3d58c43.jpg)

overall effect. Fractioned lasering works well for solar dyschromias, skin tightening, and stimulation of collagen. It is not overly effective on moderate to deep static rhytids. These conditions are better addressed with ablative lasering. Some may advocate multipass fractionated lasers; in theory, this may be possible, but in reality, it is not. Unless the operator can focus, the laser energy on the exact same columns, which were previously treated, technically, would no longer be a fractionated treatment. Since this precision is impossible, it is obvious that multiple low-density passes would inevitably affect the unaffected skin, thus making it an ablative laser.

Preoperatively, the antiviral and antibiotic course is the same as for a medium depth chemical peel. The primary author uses platelet-rich plasma as a postopera

tive dressing. If one chooses not to use PRP, then Aquaphor or Vaseline may be used as appropriate dressings. There are many opinions on dressing and post op care, which are beyond the scope of this chapter.

Figure 77.29 shows the postoperative results after one treatment of high energy, high density laser skin resurfacing.

Complications are a significant risk with skin resurfacing. Hyper and hypopigmentation are concerns especially with Fitzpatrick 4-6 patients. It is the recommendation of the authors to pretreat patients with appropriate antibiotics and antivirals prior to the procedure. Infections may range from minor and isolated pustules to fulminant bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. It is always important to work within your experience and comfort zone.

# Conclusion

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons have a fundamental understanding of the face and neck beyond that of virtually any other medical or dental specialty. OMSs possess a thorough understanding of anatomy and physiology of the head and neck and have the surgical acumen needed for reconstruction, manipulation, and correction of the skeletal and musculocutaneous structures involved. Many OMS residencies provide significant facial cosmetic training and the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery accredited fellowships have the most ridged requirements of any training platform in terms of surgical and nonsurgical competency. Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery is more than teeth and titanium. Our ever-expanding scope is possible because we are able to safely and effectively diagnose, treat, and manage our patients. Cosmetic surgery continuing education allows for aspiring surgeons to expand his or her scope of practice, and responsible application of this knowledge will continue to provide our patients with optimal care.
