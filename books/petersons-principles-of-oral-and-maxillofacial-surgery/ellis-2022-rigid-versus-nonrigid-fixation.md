Internal fixation simply implies the placement of wires, screws, plates, rods, pins, and other hardware directly to the bones to help stabilize a fracture. Internal fixation can be rigid or nonrigid, depending on the nature of the fracture and the type, strength, size, and location of the hardware placed. Because various degrees and many types of nonrigid fixation exist, it is useful to first define rigid internal fixation. By default, any technique that does not satisfy this definition can then be considered nonrigid.

# 18.1 Rigid Internal Fixation

The term rigid internal fixation has many definitions. For instance, one definition is "any form of bone fixation in which otherwise deforming biomechanical forces are either countered or used to advantage to stabilize the fracture fragments and to permit loading of the bone so far as to permit active motion" [1]. This definition, although admittedly long and perhaps confusing, encompasses the essence of the technique as practiced today and includes clues to the methods of applying the appropriate hardware. A more basic definition that includes the same objectives is "any form of fixation applied directly to the bones which is strong enough to prevent interfragmentary motion across the fracture when actively using the skeletal structure" [2]. Most of the differences in technique are in the application of the fixation. Inherent in these definitions is the prerequisite for surgical exposure to anatomically align the fragments (open reduction) and secure the fixation hardware. To rigidly stabilize fractures, an operative procedure is necessary.

Examples of rigid fixation in the mandible are the use of two lag screws or bone plates across a fracture, the use of a reconstruction bone plate with at least three screws on each side of the fracture, and the use of a large compression plate across a fracture (Fig. 18.1). Properly applied, these fixation schemes are of sufficient rigidity to prevent interfragmentary mobility during the healing period.

An inseparable corollary to the prevention of interfragmentary mobility by rigid internal fixation is a peculiar type of bone healing in which no callus forms. The bones instead go on to heal by a process of haversian

remodeling. Histologically, osteoclasts cross the fracture gap and are followed by blood vessels and osteoblasts (Fig. 18.2). New bone is laid down by the osteoblasts, forming osteons that cross the gap and impart microscopic points of bony union to the fracture [3]. A remodeling phase then converts the entire area to morphologically normal bone. This type of bone healing is termed primary or direct bone union, and it requires absolute immobilization between the osseous fragments, that is, rigid fixation, and minimal distance (gap) between them.

# Key Points

- Completely Stable - no interfragmentary mobility  
- Contact (primary) Bone Healing

# 18.2 Nonrigid Internal Fixation

Any form of bone fixation that is not strong (rigid) enough to prevent interfragmentary motion across the fracture when actively using the skeletal structure is considered nonrigid. The basic difference between rigid and nonrigid fixation centers on interfragmentary mobility. If there is mobility of the osseous fragments during active use of the skeletal structure after application of internal fixation devices, internal fixation is nonrigid. An example of nonrigid fixation is a transosseous wire placed across a mandibular fracture. The wire can provide stability only by virtue of its (limited) ability to prevent spreading of the gap, but by itself, the wire cannot neutralize torsion and/or shear forces. Additional fixation measures then become necessary, such as the use of maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) (Fig. 18.3).

However, various forms of nonrigid fixation are recognized, and there is a continuum between rigid fixation and no fixation at all. Some forms of nonrigid fixation are strong enough to allow active use of the skeleton during the healing phase but not of sufficient strength to prevent interfragmentary mobility. These types of fixation have been called functionally stable fixation, indicating that there is adequate stability to allow function even though there is not adequate stability to allow direct bone union. Many of the fixation schemes that are being used clinically in the maxillofacial area are not truly rigid fixation, but functionally stable fixation. Functionally stable fixation in maxillofacial surgery is a spectrum that varies from one region of the facial skeleton to another, from one fracture to the next, and from one patient to the next. Examples of functionally stable fixation include the single miniplate technique of treating mandibular angle or body fractures (Fig. 18.4) [4]. In spite of the interfragmentary motion that these

techniques may permit, the clinical outcomes are excellent, indicating that absolute immobility of the fragments is unnecessary for satisfactory recovery.

In the late 1950s, the Swiss Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) promulgated four biomechanical principles in fracture management [5]:

1. Accurate anatomic reduction

2. Atraumatic operative technique preserving the vitality of bone and soft tissues  
3. Rigid internal fixation that produces a mechanically stable skeletal unit  
4. Avoidance of soft tissue damage and "fracture disease" by allowing early, active, pain-free mobilization of the skeletal unit

Fig. 18.2 Types of primary bone healing. a When there is minimal distance between the fragments and the fragments are rigidly immobilized, osteoclasts from one fragment "drill" their way into the fracture gap and into the opposite fragment. Behind them come fibrovascular tissue and osteoblasts, which begin to lay down new bone. With maturation, these become new haversian canals. This process is usually called contact healing. b When a small gap exists

![](images/1537ed72ef18120c836be792bf7069babc17d424b52d919c86d96a925ce32cc8.jpg)  
between the rigidly immobilized fragments, lamellar bone is laid down within the fracture gap. Then the process described in a occurs, with new haversian canals crossing the gap. This process is sometimes called gap healing. With either of these types of primary bone healing, no external callus would be found along the outside of the fragments if they were rigidly immobilized. (a and b, Adapted from Schenk and Willenegger [3])

Fig. 18.3 Internal wire fixation of symphysis and left angle fractures. Note that these wires are not sufficiently stable to allow use of the mandible during the healing process, so maxillomandibular fixation is applied for at least 5 weeks (in an adult) to maintain stability

These principles had as their aim the rigid fixation of fractures. In recognition of the finding that functionally stable fixation is very effective clinically, in 1994, the AO/

ASIF changed its third biomechanical principle from rigid internal fixation to functionally stable fixation.

Bone healing under the condition of mobility between the osseous fragments is termed indirect or secondary bone healing. In such circumstances, there are deposition of periosteal callus, resorption of the fragment ends, and tissue differentiation through various stages from fibrous to osseous (Fig. 18.5). Bone cannot form across a mobile gap. The formation of a callus can be thought of as nature's internal fixation, providing stability to the osseous fragments so that bone union can proceed. The appearance of a callus on a radiograph indicates that there is mobility between the fragments, requiring the deposition of the callus to "immobilize" the fragments to allow ossification to proceed.

# Key Points

Healing by secondary (gap) bone healing  
- May be functionally stable

Fig. 18.4 The Champy method of treating angle fractures using a single, noncompression miniplate attached with  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  monocortical screws. Because this plate is placed in the most biomechanically advantageous area for this region (superior border), a small plate can neutralize the functional forces and permit active use of the mandible during the healing process. However, although this technique is functionally stable, interfragmentary motion probably occurs to some extent during function. It is therefore not rigid fixation. (Adapted from Champy et al. [4])

# 18.3 Selection of Fixation Schemes: How Much Fixation (Rigidity) Is Enough?

With that prelude into definitions of fixation types, the remainder of this chapter discusses some of the variables in the selection of fixation schemes for fractures of the mandible. Because the mandible is the only bone in the face that is mobile and subjected to deforming forces from powerful muscles, not much will be said about the midface. However, whether in trauma or orthognathic surgery, the type of fixation that is required in the midface is functionally stable "adaptation" osteosynthesis. The bones are simply placed into a certain position, and the fixation devices are applied to maintain that position. One would, therefore, not use compression plates in the midface (with the possible exception of the frontozygomatic suture area) because of their ability to change the spatial relationship of the bones by applying an active force across the fracture or osteotomy. However, bone plates of sufficient strength must be applied across a fracture or osteotomy gap to allow the transmission of functional forces across the gap without an alteration in the occlusion. Very thin bone plating systems seem to be able to provide such stability in most fractures or osteotomies when placed in multiple locations. For instance, at the Le

intercellular matrix. Small finger-like extensions of vessels penetrate these columns. The cartilage is replaced with woven bone. d As the osseous matrix matures, remodeling and replacement of woven bone continue until a lamellar pattern is present. (a-d, Adapted from Müller et al. [5])

$\square$  Fig. 18.6 Use of four bone plates across the Le Fort I level of a fracture. These plates can be quite thin (e.g.,  $1.2 - 1.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) if four are used. However, stronger plates (e.g.,  $2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) should be used where bone interfaces are less favorable or when the maxilla is placed into a position that is resisted by soft tissue forces (e.g., maxillary advancement or inferior repositioning).

Fort I level, four thin bone plates (1.2-1.5-mm systems) provide functionally stable fixation under most circumstances. However, when there has been a large movement of the maxilla such as in a maxillary advancement or inferior repositioning procedure, thicker and stronger bone plates would usually be required (Fig. 18.6).

# 18.4 Biomechanic Studies Versus Clinical Outcomes

When selecting a fixation scheme for a given fracture, one has to consider many things, such as the size and number of fixation devices, their location, the surgical approach, and the amount of soft tissue disruption necessary to expose the fracture and place the fixation devices. In choosing the fixation scheme for the fracture, one might

intuitively believe that more rigid fixation is better than less rigid fixation. However, it is clear from the literature on outcomes of mandibular fractures that the stability of the fracture construct is only one variable in determining a successful outcome for the patient. The results from every study ever performed in the laboratory or with computer modeling have shown that two bone plates applied to a fracture are more stable than one [6-8]. However, there has never been any statistically significant evidence from clinical studies that two plates perform better than one. In fact, the results of the author's own studies for fractures of the angle of the mandible show that two plates perform more poorly than does one plate in that location [9-14]. One must, therefore, be very careful in applying treatment recommendations from laboratory studies to the patient. Fracture stability is only one factor in the treatment equation. There are many others, such as maintenance of blood supply, that must also be considered when determining treatment recommendations.

# Key Points

Complete stability does not necessarily equal better clinical outcomes

# 18.5 Load-Bearing Versus Load-Sharing Fixation

The most simplistic way to discuss fixation schemes for fractures is to break them down into those fixation devices that are load-bearing and those that share the loads with the bone on each side of the fracture (load-sharing). Load-bearing fixation is a device that is of sufficient strength and rigidity that it can bear the entire load applied to the mandible during functional activities. Injuries that require load-bearing fixation are comminuted fractures of the mandible, those fractures in which there is very little bony interface because of atrophy, or those injuries that have resulted in a loss of a portion of the mandible (defect fractures). In such cases, the fixation device must bridge the area of comminution, minimal bone contact, or bone loss and bear all of the forces transmitted across the injured area that are generated by the masticatory system. Load-bearing fixation is sometimes called bridging fixation because it bridges areas of comminution or bone loss. The most commonly used load-bearing device is a mandibular reconstruction bone plate (Fig. 18.7). Such plates are relatively large, thick, and stiff. They use screws that are generally greater than  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter (most commonly 2.3, 2.4, or  $2.7\mathrm{mm}$ ). When secured to the fragments on each side of the injured area by a minimum of three bone screws, reconstruction bone plates can provide temporary stabil

![](images/9919e252b255739255d945c704fc6430cdd6c4ec25dc7eb449913c82f431d9ce.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 18.7 Example of load-bearing fixation. The application of a large reconstruction bone plate across an area of comminution or bone loss allows active use of the mandible. The plate bears all of the loads applied across the fracture. It, therefore, is unnecessary for the intervening bony fragments to share any of the load

ity to the bone fragments. The bone plates are not prosthetic devices and will usually fail in time (several months to years later) by either loosening of the screws or fracture of the plate, but they can provide stability until the comminuted fragments have consolidated and/or the missing bone has been replaced with grafts.

Load-sharing fixation is any form of internal fixation that is of insufficient stability to bear all of the functional loads applied across the fracture by the masticatory system. Such fixation device(s) requires solid bony fragments on each side of the fracture that can bear some of the functional loads. Fractures that can be stabilized adequately with load-sharing fixation devices are simple linear fractures, and these constitute the majority of mandibular fractures. Fixation devices that are considered load-sharing include the variety of  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  mini- plating systems that are available from a number of manufacturers. Examples of load-sharing fixation for angle fractures are demonstrated in  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 18.1a-h. Lag screw techniques are also load-sharing in that the bone that is compressed is sharing the functional loads with the screws. Simple linear fractures can also be treated by load-bearing fixation. Conversely, comminuted or defect fractures, or those in which a minimum of bone contact is present, cannot be treated by load-sharing fixation because there is insufficient bone stock adjacent to the fracture to resist displacement by functional forces.

# Key Points

- Load-Bearing fixation stabilizes across bone gaps and/or comminution  
- Load-Bearing fixation can always be used on any fracture  
- Load-Sharing fixation shares load with bone fragments  
- Load-Sharing fixation cannot be used on all fractures

# 18.6 Regional Dynamic Forces

Different regions of the mandible undergo different magnitudes and direction of forces. In simplistic terms, fractures of the angle under most functional situations tend to "open" at the superior border (Fig. 18.8a, b). Therefore, the application of fixation devices at the superior border is more effective in preventing this separation of fragments under function than applying them at the inferior border (see Fig. 18.8c, d). There is little tendency for isolated fractures of the angle to have medial or lateral displacement during function, so the fixation requirement is mainly to prevent separation of the superior border. Relatively small plates can, therefore, adequately control this fracture. The Champy miniplate technique functions extremely well for this fracture and consists of a  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate applied with monocortical screws along the superior border (see Fig. 18.4) [4]. Because metallic plates have high tensile strength, even thin plates work adequately at the angle to prevent the tendency for a gap to form at the superior border under function [13].

Isolated fractures of the mandibular body behave similarly under function, with a tendency for a gap to form at the superior surface, but the more anterior the fracture, the more tendency for torquing of the fragments to occur, causing mediolateral misalignment of the inferior border. Whereas the arch bar may provide sufficient resistance to the tendency for a gap to form between the teeth under function, a plate or lag screws somewhere else on the body of the mandible are necessary to prevent the mediolateral displacement that accompanies the torquing motion under function. For isolated body fractures, this can be a relatively small plate, such as a  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate or even a single lag screw combined with a solid arch bar (Fig. 18.9).

Note that a gap tends to form at the superior border of a fractured mandibular angle secondary to muscle and occlusal forces. The superior border is, therefore, called the zone of tension (separation), whereas the inferior border is under compressive force during function (compression

zone). c A small bone plate applied along the zone of tension (separation) is very effective in countering the forces of mastication and effectively neutralizes the forces, maintaining closure of the fracture gap. d A small plate applied in the zone of compression (inferior border) is very ineffective in neutralizing the muscle forces, and a gap will easily form superiorly in the zone of tension

$\square$  Fig. 18.9 Example of a simple isolated mandibular body fracture treated by the application of arch bars and a single 2.0 miniplate

The directions of forces that are distributed through the anterior mandible vary with the activity of the mandible. This means that the classic zones of tension

on the superior and compression on the inferior surfaces of the mandible are not absolute [7, 8]. Instead, the anterior mandible undergoes shearing and torsional (twisting) forces during functional activities [4, 14]. Application of fixation devices must, therefore, take these factors into consideration. This is why most surgeons advocate two points of fixation in the symphysis: either two bone plates, two lag screws, or possibly one plate or lag screw combined with an arch bar (see Fig. 18.1a-h) [15].

The construct with a greater vertical dimension d is much more stable because of the greater buttressing effect provided by the longer moment arm of the increased vertical dimension of bone

# 18.7 One-Point Versus Two-Point Fixation

Mandibular fractures can be treated by the application of fixation devices at one place along the fracture or at more than one point, generally two. There is no doubt that the addition of a second point of fixation provides more stability to the fracture. However, to take mechanical advantage of more than one point of fixation, the fixation devices should be placed as far apart as possible. Because fixation devices are applied to the lateral surface of the mandible, the ability to use two-point fixation requires that there be sufficient height of bone so that the fixation devices can be placed far apart. For instance, an atrophic mandibular fracture, in which there is a vertical height of only  $15\mathrm{mm}$ , would not gain much mechanical advantage from placing two bone plates on the lateral surface (Fig. 18.10). In such instances, a single stronger bone plate should be applied

below the inferior alveolar canal (Fig. 18.11). For the majority of fractures in the dentulous mandibular body and symphysis, there is sufficient height of bone to place one load-sharing plate along the inferior and one along the superior aspect of the lateral cortex. However, the ability to do so will depend on the local anatomy. If one chooses to use two load-sharing bone plates to provide rigid fixation, one must be cognizant of the position of the tooth roots and the inferior alveolar/mental nerves. If there is insufficient room between the roots of the teeth and the inferior alveolar/mental nerves, one might choose to use a single bone plate along the inferior border rather than to risk injury to the tooth roots or inferior alveolar/mental nerves when placing the second bone plate (see Fig. 18.1f). Depending on the size of the plate and whether or not an arch bar will also be used to provide another point of fixation, the fixation could be rigid or functionally stable.

# 18.8 Compression Versus Noncompression Plate Osteosynthesis

Many types of bone plates are available for clinical use. In their most simplistic forms, plates are either compression plates or noncompression plates. Compression plates have the ability to compress the fractured bony margins, helping to bring them closer together and imparting additional stability by increasing the frictional interlocking between them (Fig. 18.12). Although these properties might be advantageous, the application of compression by a plate creates a dynamic force that can work to one's disadvantage if the plate is not perfectly applied. Compression plates are safest to use in fractures in which there is minimal obliquity and in which there are sound bony buttresses on each side of the fracture that can be compressed by the plate.

One should only use compression plates if one desires absolute rigidity across the fracture. If micromotion across the fracture occurs, compression plate osteosynthesis will often fail by becoming loose. Therefore, if compression plate osteosynthesis is desired, rigid fixation must also be desired. If this means that two plates are necessary to achieve absolute rigidity, they should be used. If it means that a larger compression plate need be applied, that should also be done.

![](images/3d5f5ba4ccf3017bfc2f0363f8dafb08f593068c8861bc1bb34f7553fe2518bd.jpg)  
were room to place two smaller bone plates on the lateral cortex, they would be so close to one another that their mechanical effectiveness would be minimal

Compression decreases fracture gap  
- Compression increases frictional interlock between bone fragments

# 18.9 Locking Plate-Screw Systems

Over the past 20 years, there has been an introduction of locking plate-screw systems into maxillofacial surgery. These plates function as internal fixators, achieving stability by locking the screw to the plate. There are several potential advantages to such fixation devices. Conventional bone plate-screw systems require precise adaptation of the plate to the underlying bone. Without this intimate contact, tightening of the screws will draw the bone segments toward the plate, resulting in alterations in the position of the osseous segments and the occlusal relationship. Locking plate-screw systems offer certain advantages over other plates in this regard. The most significant advantage may be that it becomes unnecessary for the plate to intimately contact the underlying bone in all areas. As the screws are tightened, they "lock" to the plate, thus stabilizing the segments without the need to compress the bone to the plate (Fig. 18.13). This makes it impossible for the screw insertion to alter the reduction. This theoretical advantage is certainly

Fig. 18.12 Compression plates help to minimize the fracture gap and to impart stability by the frictional interlock they induce. The screw holes in at least one of the oval bone plate holes are drilled eccentrically, that is, away from the fracture, so that as the screw(s) is

Fig. 18.13 A locking plate-screw system. Note the second set of threads just under the head of the screw that will lock into receptacle threads inside the hole of the bone plate

more important when using large bone plates, such as reconstruction plates, which can be very difficult to perfectly adapt to the contours of the bone. Another theo

retical advantage to the use of locking bone plate-screw systems is that the screws are unlikely to loosen from the bone. This means that even if a screw is inserted into a fracture gap, loosening of the screw will not occur. The possible advantage to this property of a locking plate-screw system is a decreased incidence of inflammatory complications from loosening of the hardware. It is known that loose hardware propagates an inflammatory response and promotes infection. For the hardware or a locking plate-screw system to loosen, loosening of a screw from the plate or loosening of all of the screws from their bony insertions would have to occur. Both of these are unlikely. A third advantage to a locking screw-plate system is that the amount of stability provided across the fracture gap is greater than when standard nonlocking screws are used [16, 17].

Whereas the possible advantages to a locking plate-screw fixation system are theoretical, whether clinical results can be improved is not clear from the literature. However, given the potential advantages that locking plate-screw systems provide, such systems should be considered whenever noncompression plates are chosen for a fracture.

# Key Points

The screw locks into the bone plate  
Less chance of screw loosening  
- Does not require precise adaptation of bone plate to bone

# 18.10 Lag Screw Fixation

The lag screw fixation technique consists of using screws to compress fracture fragments without the use of bone plates. To apply the lag screw technique, two sound bony cortices are required because this technique shares the loads with the bone. The hole in the cortex under the head of the screw is called the gliding hole. It is the same diameter as the external diameter of the screw threads, so the threads will not engage this cortex. The screw threads on the terminal end of the screw engage the opposite cortex. By tightening the screw, a tensile force is created within the screw that compresses the bony cortices together, tightly reducing the fracture (Fig. 18.14).

As with using compression bone plates, lag screw fixation is a technique that should be used only to provide absolute rigid fixation. Micromotion across a fracture secured with lag screws will likely result in dissolution of the bone around the screws, with loss of stability. Therefore, lag screws should be selected only when there is sufficient bone available to place at least two screws into sound bone that can, in all likelihood, create rigidity across the fracture.

The use of lag screws has several advantages over the use of bone plates. It uses less hardware when compared with the use of plates, thus making it more cost-effective. When properly applied, lag screws are a very rigid method of internal fixation. Because there is no plate to be bent, the insertion of a lag screw is quicker and easier and the reduction more accurate than when bone plates

Fig. 18.15 Improper a and proper b methods of placing lag screws. The screw should always be drilled perpendicular to the line of fracture to prevent sliding of the fragments during tightening of the screws

are used. One must understand completely that the lag screw technique of fixation is one that relies on compression of bone fragments. If the intervening bone is unstable due to comminution or is missing, compressing across this area will cause displacement of the bone fragments, overriding of segments, and/or shortening of the fracture gap, resulting in problems with the occlusion. One should always place the lag screw in a direction that is perpendicular to the line of fracture to prevent overriding and displacement during tightening of the screws (Fig. 18.15).

These plates have very good tensile strength but readily fracture under cyclic loading because of their thin cross section

# 18.11 Plate Fatigue

Bone plates may break under function, resulting in possible loss of fixation, infection, nonunion, and/or malunion. Plates break for a number of reasons, but most fracture in vivo because of fatigue. Plates used in maxillofacial surgery today are usually made of titanium. Titanium is a relatively biocompatible material and has material properties that are considered adequate for internal fixation when appropriate plates are selected. One of the undesirable properties of titanium is its brittleness (or lack of ductility) when compared with bone. One only has to bend a miniplate back and forth a couple of times to see how readily it will fracture. Placement of bone plates on areas of the mandible that are constantly and repeatedly deformed under function can result in fatigue fracture of the plates. Examples are  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplates or  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  adaptation plates applied to the condylar process or similar plates applied to the atrophic mandible (Fig. 18.16). The condylar process is constantly undergoing mediolateral tilting during opening and closing movements of the mandible. The atrophic mandible similarly undergoes "wishboning" during function (Fig. 18.17) [17]. The less the amount of bone stock present, the higher the magnitude of these movements. Thus, atrophic mandibles undergo much more wishboning than do large dentulous mandibles. Because of the small cross-sectional area of the condylar process, this area of the mandible similarly flexes during function.

Bone plates applied to such areas of the fractured mandible not only have to be able to acutely withstand the deforming forces applied but also must withstand the chronically applied cyclic loading until such time that the bone has healed. This is why several authors have recommended thicker, stronger  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  plates (minidynamic compression plates) (Fig. 18.18) or two

This plate has a thicker cross-sectional area and a broader strap between the holes. This plate is useful for fractures of the mandibular condylar process and rarely fractures for that application

2.0-mm miniplates for condylar process fractures and reconstruction bone plates for atrophic mandibular fractures [18-21]. This problem with the atrophic mandible is the reason the AO/ASIF has recommended "The weaker the bone, the stronger the plate must be" [22].

# Key Points

Bone is viscoelastic and can flex without breaking  
Titanium is brittle  
Plates break under cyclic loading

# 18.12 Single Versus Multiple Mandibular Fractures

Because of the shape of the mandible, fractures of the mandible are often multiple. Most surveys show that just under  $50\%$  are isolated, the same amount are doubly fractured, and a small percentage have more than two fractures. Fixation requirements for double (or multiple)

fractures differ from isolated fractures. One can use less rigid forms of fixation on isolated fractures, because the forces generated during function are less complex than when a second or third fracture is present. For instance, there is minimal tendency for fractures of the symphysis, body, or angle to result in widening of the mandible unless fixation devices are incorrectly applied. The application of a single  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate along the lower border of the mandible combined with an arch bar is usually adequate fixation for isolated simple linear fractures of the symphysis and body regions (two-point fixation). If an arch bar is not used or the teeth are not sound, one should either use a stronger plate at the inferior border or add another  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate more superiorly along the lateral cortex. The application of a single  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate along the superior border is also adequate fixation for most isolated simple linear fractures of the angle region [4]. Lag screws can also be used instead of or in addition to plates, where appropriate.

When two fractures are present, there is a greater tendency for the segments to displace because of the bilateral loss of support that occurs. Widening of the mandible must be prevented by applying adequate internal fixation to resist that tendency. With bilateral simple linear fractures, one should always consider using a more rigid form of fixation on at least one of the fractures [23, 24]. For instance, when an angle fracture is combined with a contralateral body or symphysis fracture, one should consider treating the body or symphysis fracture with either two  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplates or a stronger bone plate at the inferior border, as well as using the arch bar as another point of fixation (Fig. 18.19). The angle fracture can then be treated with a single superior border  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate. Similarly, if an angle fracture is combined with a contralateral condylar process fracture, one should consider the application of more stable fixation at the angle if the condylar process is going to be treated closed using no MMF and functional therapy (Fig. 18.20). In that case, two  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplates (or an alternative rigid treatment) should be considered. If the condylar process were going to undergo open reduction and internal fixation, or if several weeks of MMF were going to be used, the angle fracture could be treated with a single superior border  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate (functionally stable but not rigid fixation) [4].

The fracture pattern that has the most tendency for widening is the midsymphysis fracture combined with condylar process fractures, especially when both condyles are fractured. In such cases, the musculature attached to the lingual surface of the mandible pulls the mandible posteriorly, and because there is no posterior support via the temporomandibular joints, the lateral mandibular fragments open like a book. Such

$\square$  Fig. 18.19 Possible fixation scheme for right-angle and left body fractures of the mandible. The more accessible body fracture is treated with a more rigid form of fixation (e.g., a thicker bone plate at the inferior border or two miniplates). The angle fracture can then be treated with a functionally stable form of fixation, which is easier to apply than would be a rigid technique at the angle. The angle fracture is thus treated as if it were an isolated fracture, with a single four-hole  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate

fractures must be carefully managed to first restore the mandibular width and then to maintain it. A short thin bone plate, such as a  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate, or even two  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplates may not offer sufficient resistance to the tendency to widen (Fig. 18.21a). If one chooses to treat the condylar process fracture(s) closed, very stable fixation must be applied across the reduced mandibular symphysis to retain the normal width of the mandible. This can be achieved by several techniques, but the most stable is to use either a reconstruction plate applied across the symphysis (see Fig. 18.21b) or, if the fracture is linear, two well-placed lag screws (see Fig. 18.1b). The application of two thicker  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  bone plates (thicker than miniplates) would also suffice (see Fig. 18.1c). If one chose to open the condylar process fractures, the symphysis fracture can be treated as an isolated symphysis fracture, with whatever technique the surgeon usually chooses.

# Key Points

Fixation requirement may differ when 2 or more fractures present.

Fig. 18.20 Demonstration of how widening of the mandible can occur after an angle fracture treated without rigid fixation is combined with closed treatment of a contralateral condylar process fracture. The single four-hole  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplate that works very well in this location for isolated fractures of the mandibular angle may not  
be able to prevent the tendency for widening. With the loss of the articulation at the temporomandibular joint on the right side, the entire right side of the mandible can also cause torquing at the left angle fracture under function, leading to displacement and malocclusion

mechanical disadvantage in preventing widening of the mandible. b To prevent this, a longer, thicker, stronger plate should be applied that "yolks" the mandible

# Summary

Although the number of plating sets and fixation schemes is numerous, one can usually treat most fractures with very few instrument sets. It is possible to treat the majority of fractures of the mandible either with lag screws,  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  miniplates, or reconstruction bone plates. There are, however, fractures in which one may wish to use  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  screws but thicker plates than miniplates, for instance, condylar process fractures or fractures of the atrophic mandible. In those cases, one can use thicker and stronger bone plates that accommodate  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  screws. For these situations, a locking  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  bone plating set that has plates of varying lengths and thicknesses allows one to choose the appropriate bone plate for almost any location.
