# Learning Aims

1. Condylar fractures are common, while treatment recommendations are highly controversial.  
2. The anatomy and surgical approaches of the temporomandibular region are intricate and require fundamental knowledge and skillset.  
3. Early mobilization and physiotherapy are critical for both closed and open methods of treatment of condylar fractures.  
4. Pediatric management is a unique subset with the concern of long-term effect on facial growth and symmetry.

# 21.1 Introduction

Management of mandibular condylar fractures remains a highly controversial topic in comparison to other fractures of the mandible. Although a trained surgeon has the ability to reposition the condyle to the pre-injury state with an open surgical approach, the associated disadvantages of injury to the facial nerve, bleeding, scarring, and others remain a valid concern. Changes in condylar position can result in a multitude of functional derangements secondary to the malocclusion these patients can develop. Whether precise alignment of the fractured bone segments is necessary or not to address these functional deficits is a point of debate in many cases. There are cases where the choice between open versus closed reduction is clear, however, in many situations it is not as apparent and the clinician must weigh the benefits and risks of their decision. To amplify the controversy of selecting the correct management of these fractures, the associated complications that might occur from inappropriate decisions such as persistent malocclusion, loss of ramus height, ankylosis, and facial asymmetry are challenging and difficult to address secondarily. Understanding the complex anatomy of the temporomandibular joint region, fracture patterns, functional challenges of each individual patient, knowledge of the available surgical techniques/approaches and the available fixating methods is crucial to obtain favorable results. In addition, current improvements in imaging, fixation methods/materials, and the introduction of virtual surgical planning provide us with novel and valuable tools to appropriately manage such injuries.

# 21.2 Etiology

Progression of time will lead to changes in socioeconomic, cultural, and behavioral factors that undoubtedly influence the etiology of mandibular fractures. Presently, motor vehicle accidents and assaults account for the majority of mandibular fractures in the United States [1, 2]. Current literature states that condylar frac

tures account for  $25 - 35\%$  of all mandibular fractures [3]. Early reports in the literature revealed the incidence of  $8\%$  while later reports stating  $76\%$  [4, 5]. Irrespective of the exact number, fractures of the mandibular condyle are common.

# 21.3 Anatomy

Knowledge of functional anatomy is key for appropriate management. The condyle articulates with the temporal bone and, while in passive position, rests within a concavity termed the glenoid fossa. The articular surface of the condylar head and the glenoid fossa are both covered by dense fibrocartilage connective tissue that permits the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) to move in rotation and translation within this space. The biconcave disk is an important anatomical landmark that lies between the fossa and condylar head, separating the TMJ space into a superior and inferior compartment (Fig. 21.1). The disk has three zones, notably a thick anterior component attaches superiorly to the articular eminence and lateral pterygoid muscle while the inferior connection is to the condylar neck. From a surgical perspective, this anatomical area is vascular with vessel supply from the auriculotemporal, masseteric, and deep temporal to the joint and lateral pterygoid muscle. The middle component of the disk is thin and avascular but contributes predominantly to the function between the condyle and temporal bone. The posterior component is also thick in nature that blends to form the retrodiscal tissue, which

![](images/86a1de825b1b5f6b9f6b225e97d194592e9ad51708a1a7b1119e71815d4dbed7.jpg)  
Fig.21.1 The temporomandibular joint (coronal view). (Adapted from Pieuch and Lieblich [86])

is vascular and innervated. The medial and lateral portions of the disk attach to the medial and lateral poles of the condyle with collateral ligaments.

A fibrous capsule encloses the entire joint. The lateral aspect of the capsule, which forms the temporomandibular ligament, aids in stability of the condyle and limits the lateral displacement of the fractured segments in many injuries, while the thin medial capsule allows for a more likely medial displacement. There are two non-capsular ligaments, named sphenomandibular and stylomandibular, helping in stability and movement in lateral directions.

It is critical for the surgeon to recognize the proximity of specific vessels and nerves to the TMJ to safely manage the fractured condyle. Arterial supply to the TMJ is from the two terminal branches of the external carotid, which are the superficial temporal and the maxillary arteries. The superficial temporal artery is usually retracted anteriorly within the skin flap and if visualized is usually dissected and tied during the skin approach to the condyle. Branches of the maxillary artery are essential to acknowledge, such as the middle meningeal and masseteric arteries. The middle meningeal artery passes medial to the condyle and may be a source of injury due to displacement of the condylar head or surgical approach. The masseteric artery courses over the coronoid notch before entering deep into the masseter muscle. Other vascular supply to the condyle includes transverse facial, posterior tympanic, and posterior deep temporal arteries in addition to medullary bone, periosteum, and the muscular attachment from the lateral pterygoid. Disturbed landmarks due to trauma and the potential for aggressive dissection of muscle and periosteum may compromise the blood supply to the condyle.

Venus return transpires by the retrodiscal plexus in addition to both the superficial temporal and maxillary veins that ultimately pass to the external jugular through the retromandibular vein.

Facial nerve integrity is at risk with condylar fractures. The surgeon must know the course of the facial nerve and its branches. In the landmark 1979 article, Al-Kayat and Bramley measured the location of the main trunk of the facial nerve and found the pathway is at least  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  (or further) from the inferior margin of the bony external auditory meatus [6]. Also in this study, the temporal branch of the nerve crosses the zygomatic arch anterior to the bony external auditory meatus at a minimum distance of  $0.8\mathrm{cm}$  and a mean of  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$ . A high-resolution MRI study of live subjects measured a minimum distance of  $1.7\mathrm{cm}$  and a mean of  $2.1\mathrm{cm}$  [7] (Fig. 21.2).

The temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve lie within or deep to the temporoparietal fascia and can be injured or transected during dissection techniques. The parotideomasseteric fascia overlies the temporomandibular ligament and capsule. This fascia attaches tightly to the inferior zygomatic arch border. The superficial investing fascia forms a separate layer superficial to this parotideomasseteric fascia. The temporalis fascia superiorly is one thick layer, taking origin from the aponeurotic tendon on the temporalis muscle. This fascia continues inferiorly toward the zygomatic arch and splits into two well-defined layers roughly at the level of the supraorbital rim. The temporal fat pad separates the superficial and deep components of the temporalis fascia at this point. The thicker superficial layer after this split attaches to the lateral surface of the zygomatic arch while the thin deep layer fuses with the periosteum on the medial surface of the arch (Fig. 21.3).

# Key Points

Vessels such as the superficial temporal, middle meningeal, and masseteric as well as branches of the facial nerve are often encountered and at risk for injury in the open management of condylar fractures

# 21.4 Fracture Patterns

# 21.4.1 Biomechanics

The mandible is comparable to a class III lever during function. A study by Ellis demonstrates the force applied to the mandible is between the TMJ (fulcrum or axis) and the occlusal load [8] (Fig. 21.4). This concept applied to the U-shape mandibular force distribution pattern ultimately proves the condyle as a weak bony component. Fractures seen in the condyle are often the result of tensile stress from indirect forces applied elsewhere, typically the contralateral parasym

physis region [9]. A review of 749 condylar fractures by Zhou supports this statement as well as provides a summary of the other associated injuries commonly found with condylar fractures [10] (Table 21.1). A review by Zachariades concludes that  $72\%$  of condylar fractures are associated with concurrent mandibular fractures [11]. Literature reveals that when the force applied to the mandible produces concomitant mandible fractures, it is often noted that diacapitular (intracapsular) fractures occur with  $75\%$  frequency and condylar base (subcondylar) at  $25\%$  [12]. The narrow condylar neck that requires less force magnitude to fracture than other areas of the body of the mandible is considered by many as an anatomic protective mechanism. The fragility of the condylar neck is more likely to break dissipating the traumatic energy before fracturing the glenoid fossa. Multiple case reports have shown displaced condylar heads in the middle cranial fossa when the propagated trauma did not fracture the condylar neck [13-15].

# 21.4.2 Classification

Despite the numerous classification systems that inevitably imply a specific treatment, the maxillofacial surgeon should choose an applicable and clinically relevant method to understand the fracture pattern of the condyle. Recognition of the subtle anatomical variances of the fractured condyle in addition to clinical components such as age of the patient, dentate vs. edentate, and

radiographic exam will assist the surgeon in diagnosis and management.

Currently there is no universal system used among oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Reports vary in detail as early from Wassmund in the 1920s, who categorized fractures of the condyle as either head or neck to the 1972 report from Spiessl and Schroll, whose system involved the addition of displacement [16, 17] (Table 21.2). Lindahl published a comprehensive paper describing the location of the fracture, deviation, and displacement of the condylar head within the fossa. Although highly accurate, it is difficult to use and recall this system in both a practical and clinical setting [18, 19].

Loukota and his research team proposed one common system in 2005 [20]. After an additional report

with minor clarifications, eventually the Strasbourg Osteosynthesis Research Group (SORG) adopted this system [21]. To comprehend they described a landmark "line A," which is a perpendicular line through the lowest extension of the sigmoid notch to the tangent of the ramus (Fig. 21.5).

- Diacapitular fracture - through the head of the condyle. Fracture line starts in the condylar head and may extend outside the capsule (Fig. 21.6).  
- Condylar neck - more than  $1/2$  of the fracture is superior to an imaginary line extending from the inferior portion of the sigmoid notch perpendicular to the tangent of the ramus, line A (Fig. 21.7).  
- Condylar base - more than  $\frac{1}{2}$  of the fracture is inferior to line A (Fig. 21.8).  
- Minimal displacement - displacement of less than  $10^{\circ}$  or ramus height shortening of  $2\mathrm{mm}$  or less.

Another classification is described by Ellis and his team researchers [22]. A radiographic interpretation of his system notes the location of the fracture and the degree of dislocation and/or displacement (Fig. 21.9).

# Key Points

There is no agreement for a universal classification system and most are not practical for clinical purposes.

# 21.5 Diagnosis and Assessment

# 21.5.1 Clinical Findings

It is important that a maxillofacial trauma patient should be in stable condition before addressing a condylar fracture. Consultation for a mandibular injury occurs after completion of the secondary survey by the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) team [23].

Comparable to the decision to adopt a relevant classification system for condylar fractures, the surgeon must also have an organized systematic plan for assessment and diagnosis. Common clinical features are malocclusion, open bite, swelling, and pain around the temporomandibular joint region, reduced mandibular function, and deviation or asymmetry of the chin [24]. Key clinical features that will assist with the diagnosis of a condylar fracture include:

1. Skin of the maxillofacial region - contusions, abrasions, laceration of the chin, and/or ecchymosis or hematoma of the midface and TMJ region.  
2. Bleeding from the oral cavity or external auditory canal - may indicate trauma to the TMJ or mandible.

3. Asymmetry of the face - fracture of the condylar segment may lead to shortening of the ipsilateral ramus in addition to swelling from a hematoma or edema due to dislocation of the condylar head.  
4. Malocclusion - a unilateral condylar fracture will result in ipsilateral premature contact of the posterior dentition and/or contralateral posterior open bite (Fig. 21.10). Bilateral condylar fractures may result in a distinct anterior open bite (Fig. 21.11).  
5. Midline deviation – at rest and while opening, the mandible will deviate to the ipsilateral side in case of unilateral condylar fractures.

# 21.5.2 Radiographic Evaluation

After a patient presents with a history suggestive of a mandibular or condylar fracture, it is fundamental to obtain appropriate imaging for diagnosis and assessment. To identify a fracture through plain radiographic films, this technique mandates that two of the films must be at right angles to each other [25]. This series of plain film images (often known as a "mandible series") consist of posteranterior skull view, two lateral oblique, and a Towne's view. It is helpful to obtain a panoramic image as well. With the ease and regularity of computed

tomography (CT) in most hospital trauma centers, a maxillofacial CT scan is adequate and preferred for the diagnosis of condylar fractures. It provides high-quality images in multiple planes and can three-dimensionally assess the fracture site and the degree of displacement [25-27] (Fig. 21.12).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist the surgeon for soft tissue detail, but less bony resolution is

![](images/30b0a4bb1bd709e31bbd77ad55d81a52ddfd789cd1ee4e3bb0f8e944fa5003c9.jpg)  
Fig. 21.11 Skeletal illustration of anterior open bite from bilateral condylar fractures

available in comparison to the CT [28]. In the urgency of maxillofacial trauma, the associated risk of time to complete an MRI study likely outweighs the acute diagnostic view of the condyle that is beneficial from maxillofacial CT imaging. Another benefit to CT imaging is the ability to be used for computer-assisted preoperative virtual surgical planning software. Software such as Mimics (Materialise, Leven, Belgium) and SimPlant TM (Materialise NV) can assist the maxillofacial surgeon in the virtual repositioning of the fractured condylar segment and hardware planning in complex cases [29, 30].

# 21.6 Treatment

# 21.6.1 General Principles

As with any fracture of the maxillofacial complex, the goal of treatment should be to reestablish function and form. A poignant letter written in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery by RV Walker in 1988 stated that all surgeons should focus on three main objectives: return of the TMJ and mandible to a normal, pain-free range of function, acceptable occlusion, and lastly restoration of symmetry [31]. Traditionally, nonsurgical treatment of condylar fractures has been the preferred method of management among oral and maxillofacial surgeons [32]. Rationally, to accomplish the goals stated by RV Walker, closed treatment has less burden than

![](images/0b36d17d3595254576b27eab2a0591afae0087c094d8200781697d4c55a43485.jpg)

open management. In a study by Kommers in 2015, three unilateral condylar fracture cases were submitted as an online questionnaire to 3044 maxillofacial surgeons [33]. Of the 491 that replied, only one case, isolated subcondylar fracture with malocclusion treated by open reduction, had statistically significant agreement among the surgeons.

The surgical incision to expose the condyle has the inherent risk of vascular and facial nerve injury in addition to limited visibility makes the reduction and fixation of these fractures difficult for even the most experienced surgeon [34]. Condylar fractures, unlike other fractures of the mandible, do not need premorbid alignment of the segments for successful treatment. Studies have shown absolute and relative indications for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of these fractures, but there is no universal agreement on an absolute closed treatment [35-37]. This chapter will review both the benefits and risks of closed and open management in addition to postoperative management.

# 21.6.2 Closed

Closed management ranges from simple observation with a soft diet to a set period of immobilization typically followed by a period of physiotherapy. Closed therapy does not imply "closed reduction" of the fracture, as the goal of treatment is not to re-position the bone segments to premorbid anatomical location but that the treatment aids in restoring mandibular function through neuromuscular adaptation [37, 38].

Studies have reported that the advantage to closed treatment is the avoidance of injury to the vascular, muscular, and cartilaginous components of the condyle, as this will aid in regenerative healing [8, 9]. Other studies have reported that despite the potential loss of height from the non-operated condyle, the resulting skeletal and dental changes adapt and form a new articulation [39, 40]. There are numerous studies in the literature supporting closed management stating complications are uncommon and no correlations exist between radiographic findings and postoperative functional outcome [41-44].

Niezen and his research team have studied the outcomes of closed treatment for condylar fractures for many years [45, 46]. In 2010 he analyzed the relationship of patient complaints and mandibular function after closed treatment of condylar fractures [45]. Of the 114 patients assessed in their 1-year follow-up, the two main risk factors for worsening mandibular function were pain and age. Pain leads to protective factors of reduced mouth opening and therapy.

Although there is not a universal absolute indication for closed treatment, many researchers have proposed that closed treatment is beneficial for:

Non-displaced or incomplete fractures  
Isolated intracapsular fractures  
Condylar fractures in children (except for absolute indication for open treatment-discussed later)  
Reproducible occlusion without deviation upon opening

As mentioned earlier, closed treatment or also known as "conservative treatment" can happen in one of two ways. Both methods benefit from posttreatment physiotherapy, which is reviewed later in the chapter:

- Closed treatment without maxillomandibular fixation – this subset of closed treatment is permissible when the patient is able to establish and maintain normal occlusion. A patient must be compliant with a soft diet and agreeable to close supervision. The patient must acknowledge if a change in occlusion, deviation on opening, or increasing pain as this may warrant different treatment. Depending on the patient's age and systemic factors, anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks post-injury, then the patient should begin physiotherapy.  
- Closed treatment with maxillomandibular fixation - this subset of closed treatment begins with immobility via arch bars, wires, or splints and ends with a period of physiotherapy. Immobility ranges from 7 to 21 days depending on variables such as age, level of the fractures, degree of displacement, and presence of additional fractures. The goal of immobilization is to allow a union of fracture segments but prevent muscular atrophy, joint hypomobility, and ankylosis. Clinicians advocate a brief period of guiding elastics to assist with a neuromuscular adaptation to the location of the condylar segment [46].

# 21.6.3 Open

Zide and Kent recognized that not all mandibular condylar fractures benefit from the closed technique. Their landmark paper from 1983 noted that despite the inherent concerns of vascular and nerve injury, a surgeon should be able to recognize that certain fracture patterns and/or patient variables will require an open approach [35]. The current indications for open reduction are as follows:

# Absolute Indications

1. Displacement of the condyle into the middle cranial fossa.  
2. Impossibility of obtaining adequate occlusion by the closed technique.

3. Lateral extracapsular dislocation of the condyle.  
4. Foreign bodies within the capsule of the TMJ.  
5. Mechanical obstruction impending the function of the TMJ.  
6. Open injury to the TMJ that requires immediate treatment.

# Relative Indications

1. Bilateral condylar fractures in an edentulous patient when splints are unavailable or impossible due to severe ridge atrophy  
2. Unilateral or bilateral condylar fractures when splinting is not recommended because of medical conditions or when physiotherapy is not possible  
3. Bilateral fractures associated with comminuted midfacial fractures  
4. Bilateral fractures associated with other dentofacial deformities

Ellis has several key papers that support the open reduction of condylar fractures. In a study of 146 patients, 65 were treated with open reduction [47]. The 81 patients treated by closed technique had shorter posterior facial height on the side of injury, which lead to greater facial asymmetry in comparison to the open group. In a second study, he noted that the open reduction patients had better occlusal results [48].

There is common apprehension in the decision to open a condylar fracture with respect to the facial nerve. Haug examined 20 patients, half with open treatment and the other with closed, and found no statistical difference between the groups for motor or sensory function [41]. The open group did report a concern for scar while the closed group a concern for increased pain. A recent study by Danda comparing outcomes of open vs. closed groups found that  $12.5\%$  of the 16 patients in the open group experienced facial nerve weakness at 2 weeks, while a similar study by Ellis found an incidence of weakness at  $17.2\%$  at 6 weeks postoperative but  $0\%$  at 6 months [48, 49]. Separate studies by Worsaae and Chossegros reported no instances of hypertrophic scars after open approach treatment [50, 51]. Multiple reviews in the literature will support minimal concern for postoperative infection and healing for this treatment group [48, 52, 53]. The advent of endoscopy-assisted open treatment of condylar fractures within the last 15 years has shown promising results in studies. With smaller incisions and less retraction of soft tissue in comparison to traditional open techniques, lower risk of nerve injury and scar formation has been reported [54]. A recent meta-analysis by Chrcanovic found that open management of condylar fractures resulted in better clinical outcomes in the measurement of decreased complica

tions such as malocclusion and asymmetry; however, complications such as infection were higher [3].

The surgeon must choose the incision(s) that will provide adequate access to the injury, distraction of the ramus, and control and manipulation of the proximal condyle and allow for placement of hardware for fixation [55]. Diacapitular fractures can be accessed through the preauricular or retroauricular approaches. Neck fractures can be accessed through intraoral, retromandibular submandibular, and retroauricular incisions. Lastly, base fractures can be accessed through intraoral, retromandibular, and submandibular incisions [34]. All of these incisions leave both cranial nerves V and VII at risk. Specifically, the retromandibular approach will have a higher incidence for the marginal branch of VII and preauricular incision leave the temporal and zygomatic branches of VII most vulnerable for risk [56]. The surgeon must have a thorough knowledge of the regional anatomy and the variable dissection techniques to avoid these injuries.

# 21.6.4 Submandibular

This approach is appropriate when access to the base and neck is required for open reduction. A slight extension of the classic submandibular incision in both a backward and upward direction at the periangular region, will allow for improved access to the fracture site. The incision is marked  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  below the inferior border of the mandible and is approximately  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  in length. Anatomic planes dissected include skin, subcutaneous fat tissue, and platysma. After the division of the platysma, meticulous dissection through the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia is performed to avoid injury to the mandibular branch of the facial nerve and inadvertent bleeding of the facial vein and artery, which may be divided to allow soft tissue reflection. After reflection of the muscular sling and periosteum, careful retraction of the mandibular branch of the facial nerve in a superior direction is advised. With this access, mini-plate and lag screw osteosynthesis can be achieved.

# 21.6.5 Retromandibular

The advantage to this approach is the access it provides to the condylar neck region. The skin incision is marked  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  below the ear lobe and should run parallel to the posterior border of the mandible and be  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  long (Fig. 21.13). For the transparotid approach, after dissection of the platysma, the parotid capsule is carefully identified and divided horizontally through the space between the paths of the buccal and marginal mandibu

![](images/38051b82af58f43547fe6ee61c3251c29d7a8921db286a8ba194a7653f6ef297.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 21.13 Marking of skin incision for the retromandibular approach

lar branches of the facial nerve. Once nerves are safely located, they can be dissected free, and the pterygomas- seteric sling may be exposed. Next, an incision is made into the periosteum along the posterior border of the mandible and around the angle to retract superiorly and inferiorly for exposure. Finally stripping of the masseter allows visualization of the condylar neck and ramus for reduction and fixation.

A retro-parotid path of dissection can also be used to expose the fracture site without violating the parotid capsule and hence decreasing the risk of nerve injury. Following the division of the platysma and the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia, dissection proceeds toward the posterior border of the ramus behind the parotid capsule. The sling is incised, retracting the masseter muscle with overlying parotid gland anteriorly. Reflection then proceeds superiorly, exposing the fracture site.

# 21.6.6 Preauricular/Endaural

This incision is most commonly used to access diacapitular fractures. Regardless of the modification to the incision, the result allows maximum lateral and anterior exposure of the condyle. The skin incision is a 2.5-cm

curvilinear line following the tragus and helix of the ear with possible extension to the temple. This extension can help minimize unnecessary traction that may cause weakness of the facial nerve. Dissection is carried down to reach the white glistening superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia (Fig. 21.14). The auriculotemporal nerve and the superficial temporal vessels may be retracted anteriorly with the skin flap. At the root of the zygomatic arch and close to the tragus, an oblique incision is made through the superficial layer of the deep temporalis fascia exposing the fat pad and sometimes the capsular vein between the superficial and deep layers of the fascia. Using a sharp periosteal elevator in a sweeping motion, the superficial layer is undermined and dissected free above the arch, which when reached, the periosteum on the root and lateral surface can be incised (Fig. 21.15). Dissection below the arch can be extended for about  $1\mathrm{cm}$  lateral to the

$\square$  Fig. 21.15 Clinical photo showing the plane of dissection between the superficial and deep layers of temporalis fascia

joint capsule. Subperiosteal dissection can then proceed, and this layer can then be retracted anteriorly protecting the facial nerve. To expose the condylar head, the authors prefer a capsular T-shaped incision to enter the joint space. Disadvantages of this approach are the potentially unaesthetic preauricular crease scar along its entire length, as well as the possibility of bleeding from the superficial temporal artery. The endaural technique allows most of the scar to be camouflaged behind the tragus; however, there is a slight risk of perichondritis with this technique [57].

# 21.6.7 Retroauricular

The postauricular approach was originally described by Bockenheimer and later modified by Axhausen [58]. This incision has the best esthetic result because it is hidden in the postauricular crease. The disadvantages of this approach include possible stenosis of the auditory canal, an infection that can potentially lead to necrosis of the ear cartilage, and anesthesia of the auricle. This approach is not advisable in patients who must depend on wearing glasses in the early postoperative period. The closure is more time-consuming and must be meticulous to minimize complications. Using this incision allows for good posterior and lateral joint exposure, whereas anterior exposure can be limited. The incision is parallel and approximately  $3\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the postauricular flexure. The inferior portion of the incision curves over the mastoid tip, whereas superiorly it stops at the attachment of the pinna within the hairline. Once marked, the incision is carried sharply down to the postauricular muscle to the fascia overlying the mastoid bone and the temporalis fascia superiorly, dissecting anteriorly. The external auditory canal (EAC) is a landmark and is exposed on the superior and inferior aspects through this approach. Next, a complete transaction of the EAC is made at the bony cartilaginous junction. Similar to the preauricular approach, the temporal fascia is incised at the superior mark of the incision. This fascia is dissected above the temporalis muscle in an anterior-inferior direction. At the junction of the temporal fat pad, the same dissection plane is developed as the superficial layer is elevated as it approaches and attaches to the superior border of the zygomatic arch. Anterior dissection is performed in a subperiosteal plane, which protects the facial nerve. The anterior border of the temporomandibular ligament and capsule are the anterior landmarks with this dissection. Inferior dissection stops at the attachment of the temporomandibular ligament and capsule to the condyle.

# 21.6.8 Transoral

This approach is used to avoid the risk of a skin incision scar, to reduce the risk of facial nerve injury, as well as the potential reduction of postoperative facial edema that may occur. However, this access does limit visibility and has not been popular for the reduction of condylar fractures without additional measures. The transoral incision is created along the anterior aspect of the ascending mandibular ramus. Fixation techniques for this approach require intensive advanced surgical training, special instrumentation, and a steep learning curve. Advantages have included excellent functional results without the risk of facial nerve damage and visible scars.

# 21.6.9 Reduction and Fixation

As Ellis noted previously in 2000, innovations in stable internal fixation devices with either plate and/or screw fixation have increased the feasibility of open treatment of condylar fractures [48]. If the patient is dentate, application of arch bars for MMF during intraoperative reduction and postoperative physiotherapy (potentially 6-8 weeks) is beneficial [46]. It is critical that the segments return to the pre-injury position before fixation. The use of a hemostat is helpful in the minimally displaced fracture while dual distraction of the mandible in an inferior direction combined with a clamp or plate to hold the condyle is helpful in displaced fractures. In severely medially displaced condyle fractures, Mikkonen and Kannadasan have separate papers advocating for a vertical ramus osteotomy to aid in visibility and access to the condyle. In this technique, the condyle is removed from the patient (while keeping the capsule and disk intact); then fixation plate is secured ex vivo on the operating room table before returning in vivo for fixation to the lateral ramus [59, 60]. It is worth mentioning that stripping all the periosteum and muscle attachments from the condyle will technically result in using it as a free graft with the possibility of increased risk of avascular necrosis and resorption with screw loosening and hardware failure.

There are several plating methods available for the fixation of these fractures. Titanium plates and screws are standard in the hospital operating setting, and the use of single, double, or geometric plates is dependent on the surgeon, fracture pattern, and segment visibility [61]. A single plate, although will not provide the same functional stability in comparison to a two-plate fixation method, may be the only option with the limited access and space [48] (Fig. 21.16). Studies have shown when a single plate is chosen, a minimum of two screws

![](images/6f872c1d0e48f5fed41b3fa0bd3ecea6a689ed5af29b35c705902160de5944d1.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 21.17 Clinical photo of single bone plate with  $2.00\mathrm{-mm}$  fixation screws  
$\square$  Fig. 21.18 Illustration of geometric plate for ORIF condylar process fracture

on each side of the fracture must be in place [62, 63]. If possible, bi-cortical screws have an advantage and/or a single strong bone plate with  $2.00\mathrm{mm}$  screws [46] (Fig. 21.17).

The added benefit of the second fixation plate is the stabilization of the condyle with resistance of torsional forces that may not be opposed with a single plate. A study by Choi noted 37 patients with single mini-plate used for ORIF of a condylar fracture had a higher inci

![](images/83c11000ec4888962f4bf25e0e7a3e1737379211fb6c5009b1a89019e017283a.jpg)

dence of screw loosening and plate fracture in comparison to the group with two mini-plate fixation [62].

Several companies have designed geometric plates that in theory have the same ease of placing a single plate but provide the improved stability achieved by the second fixation plate [64]. There is a lack of standardized clinical studies to show the significance at this time, but the perceived notion of less periosteal striping combined with the use of minimal monocorical screws to approximate these fixation plates will provide an optimum biomechanical advantage when placed along the ideal osteosynthesis lines (Fig. 21.18).

# 21.6.10 Endoscopy-Assisted Reduction

A hallmark study from 2001 by Schon and colleagues demonstrates the use of either a submandibular or a transoral approach for open reduction and internal fixation of a displaced condylar fracture with the assistance of an endoscope [65]. The endoscopy-assisted technique allowed the surgeons to use angulated drills and screwdrivers, which are uncommon in traditional surgical methods. Nine patients in the pilot study did not need an extraoral incision for reduction and fixation, and all patients had no residual facial nerve injury and/or scarring often seen in other conventional approaches. Other authors promote the use of both submandibular and transoral incisions, as the latter can assist with endoscope technique and visualization [66] (Fig. 21.19).

![](images/2b6b2f18adb6a7ff8a502c11617e29dbaa34ef4ba82d713eed680953dde4f02b.jpg)

Surgeons trained in this technique report advantages of both anatomic reduction with rigid fixation without the increased risk of nerve injury that results from incisions and retraction. Advocates hope with the continual advancement of technology and instrumentation available in hospitals; this treatment methodology will be mainstream [67].

# 21.6.11 Virtual Surgical Planning

In the last 10 years, the benefit of computer-aided design and computer-aided modeling (CAD/CAM) software has become customary in the management of maxillofacial trauma injuries. The advantage of this software is not only to assist in preoperative surgical planning but also for intraoperative navigation and intraoperative CT imaging [29, 68]. Klatt and colleagues' study from 2010 utilized intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging to assess for adequate reduction of condylar fractures [25]. Although four of the thirty-four patients did not have

an optimal reduction, the overall conclusion is the surgeon can use intraoperative three-dimensional imaging to correct errors for prevention of postoperative complications and potential need for secondary surgical intervention. Albeit, the use of this technology may not be as common for isolated condylar fracture repair, but the benefit of virtual surgical planning (VSP) with other midface injuries as well as TMJ reconstruction for pathology, degenerative disease, and orthognathic surgery is a tremendous addition to our field. Specific to this chapter, an example is the use of this software can assist the surgeon in creating a custom alloplastic temporomandibular joint replacement (TMJ TJR) for the unwanted complication of ankylosis from a condylar fracture treatment.

# Key Points

- Although debate exists, there are critical components to factor when deciding closed versus open management.

Absolute and relative indications for open management are a useful tool to assist with treatment management decision-making.  
The use of endoscope-assisted technique to limit incision only to intraoral is a proven benefit, but advanced training is necessary.  
Recent advances such as the use of VSP and intraoperative navigation can be useful for complex fracture management.

# 21.7 Postoperative Treatment

Whether the patient is in the closed or open treatment group, all benefit from early mobilization and rehabilitation, typically in a period of 6-12 weeks. Concerns for joint hypomobility and/or ankylosis aftertreatment of the fractured condyle should alarm all surgeons. A report by Throckmorton has shown that the target maximum incisal opening is  $40\mathrm{mm}$  before 12 weeks, and once met, maintenance should continue for several more months [69].

Occlusal guidance through elastic bands is simple and effective for postoperative management of both closed and open treatment. Arch bars are a necessity for this technique. One to two elastics only on the ipsilateral side in a Class II pattern worn for  $24\mathrm{h}$  a day over a 2-week period prove helpful for return to normal muscular function [46] (Fig. 21.20). Functional exercises are helpful during this 2-week period, as well. The use of the thumb-finger technique, tongue depressor, and jaw motion in protrusive and lateral movements is critical to teach [33, 70]. Pain can limit the patient from performance, so encouraging the use of moist heat packs before exercise and cold packs after can assist in conjunction with an appropriate non-steroid anti-inflammatory course as needed. Ellis has advocated maintaining the arch bars for 6-8 weeks in a unilateral fracture and 3-4 months for bilateral condylar

process fractures to allow future opportunities for guiding elastics as needed [46]. As with any postoperative physiotherapy routine, patient compliance and routine follow-up are necessary for optimal results.

# Key Points

- Maintenance of arch bars beyond treatment time to allow placement of elastics can be beneficial.  
Patient compliance and surgeon follow-up are critical for overall surgical outcome.

# 21.8 Complications

Any maxillofacial surgeon that treats trauma understands that despite satisfactory operative results, postoperative complications can occur. Specific to the treatment of the fractured condyle, concern for both the closed and open management will be malocclusion, hypomobility, ankylosis, asymmetry, degeneration, and/or pain [71].

# 21.8.1 Malocclusion

Fractures that result in affecting the growth center of the condyle will lead to disturbed growth pattern with associated malocclusion and facial asymmetry. However, Ellis reports that assumption of malocclusion due to poor surgical technique or treatment is not typically the case [71]. Adaptions to the neuromuscular system and loss of posterior vertical dimension with eventual reestablishment of new articulation can lead to this undesirable outcome. Physiotherapy and elastics may assist in the immediate postoperative phase while late treatment may require orthognathic surgery or TMJ reconstruction. In the edentulous patient, correction with a new prosthesis may be helpful [22, 33, 70, 71].

# 21.8.2 Mandibular Hypomobility

Hypomobility can range from a maximum incisional opening (MIO) of less than  $40~\mathrm{mm}$  to ankylosis. While limited opening is traditionally a post-treatment concern of these fractures, a MIO of less than  $35~\mathrm{mm}$  occurs in  $8 - 10\%$  of patients in reported studies. This limitation is likely the result of delayed physiotherapy and is more common if the patient is subjected to longer periods of MMF for closed treatment [71]. Prevention of this complication is critical in the postoperative phase in the management of condylar fractures.

# 21.8.3 Ankylosis

Condylar fractures and ankylosis are synonymous to the maxillofacial surgeon. Fortunately, literature reports this complication in only  $0.2 - 0.4\%$  of condylar fractures. Often seen in children, the unwanted result is related to severe meniscal disruption with inappropriate physiotherapy [71]. Ankylosis in adults typically is the result from the widening of the mandible forcing the superior lateral displacement of the condyle [72, 73]. Before treatment, adequate clinical and radiographic imaging is obtained (Fig. 21.21). Repair can range from gap arthroplasty to replacement with a total joint prosthesis.

# 21.8.4 Asymmetry

This is common after the treatment of condylar fractures. Asymmetry in adults is seen during deviation in opening toward the injured side in case of unilateral fractures. This outcome has been reported as high as  $50\%$  in patients,

![](images/4f39c693d7b70b7fc0cac701511818503679228d4c1e77e4dbff35e6f5c753c3.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 21.21 Clinical picture of ankylosis of the left TMJ from complication of condylar process fracture

likely due to the lateral pterygoid malfunction [71]. In children,  $25\%$  of affected patients will show growth disturbances in the injured condyle [71]. These results may lead to either mandibular hypertrophy or hypotrophy [71, 74]. The key to the prevention of this undesirable outcome is early mobilization and physiotherapy.

# 21.8.5 Dysfunction/Degeneration

Not only is the injured condyle susceptible to dysfunction and condylar degeneration but also the nonfractured side. Dislocated fractures typically cause more dysfunction in comparison to non-displaced fractures. Prolonged periods of MMF and increased age can contribute to this outcome. Condylar degeneration has been linked to both closed and open methods of treatment [75]. Patients may have asymptomatic TMJ clicking, popping, and locking after the fracture is healed [71, 75, 76]. Unfortunately, these outcomes have a high potential after treatment, so patient education and follow-up are necessary to address these conditions.

# 21.8.6 Chronic Pain

This often results when management is through the closed approach. In comparison to open reduction that allows for proper anatomical alignment, closed reduction patients must use proper physiotherapy to adapt to the new condylar segment union [46, 70]. Paradoxically, acute post-trauma pain often prevents the strict adherence to a physiotherapy program. Insufficient or delayed rehabilitation in the immediate posttreatment phase may lead to malocclusion and arthritis [24]. Good patient selection for closed treatment is critical for the surgeon to prevent a potential chronic pain outcome.

# 21.9 Pediatric Condylar Fractures

The management of pediatric condylar fractures presents with distinct challenges. Although fractures involving the pediatric population are relatively uncommon, condylar fractures are the most common of all facial fractures in children [77]. A report by Imhara and colleagues note that mandibular fractures account for  $32.7\%$  of all facial fractures [78].

# 21.9.1 Craniofacial Growth

The condyle is an important area of growth in the developing mandible. Trauma to the condyle has the potential

for long-term adverse outcomes, such as malocclusion, facial asymmetry, reduced mandibular mobility, temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), hypomobility, and ankylosis [79, 80]. The maxillofacial trauma surgeon should understand the background of craniofacial growth and development to assist in the treatment decision for the pediatric population.

# 21.9.2 Diagnosis

Diagnosis of a condylar fracture in the pediatric population is similar to adults. A clinical and radiographic examination is mandatory. Clinical examination may be limited due to the perception of pain, anxiety, and fear of the pediatric patient [81]. Although this will improve with age, it is critical that the clinician evaluates for malocclusion and deviation of the mandible on opening. Small subtle changes may dictate treatment choice. Common clinical findings in the pediatric population can include one or more of the following:

Malocclusion  
- Chin deviation toward the affected side on a unilateral fracture  
Shortening of the ramus on the affected side on a unilateral fracture  
Submental ecchymosis  
Floor of mouth ecchymosis  
- Anterior open bite due to a bilateral fracture

Although there are studies citing concern of overexposure to radiation in the pediatric population and increased risk for thyroid cancer in adulthood, in some cases a CT scan is unavoidable to adequately diagnose and correctly manage [82]. Panoramic and common plain films are other diagnostic tools, but sometimes are difficult to interpret due to the short condylar-ramus complex [81] (Fig. 21.22).

# 21.9.3 Treatment Options

# Closed

Certainly most maxillofacial surgeons believe the closed technique is the treatment of choice for the pediatric population. Conservative treatment such as observation, soft diet, and opening exercises may be adequate for the patient without malocclusion and likely to be compliant. If clinical and radiographic findings dictate a period of MMF, literature has consistently stated a period of 7 to 14 days is appropriate [83, 84]. The use of arch bars and ivy loops as in adults may be challenging in the primary or mixed dentition. Risdon cables may be a useful alternative to allow for appropriate MMF in the younger pediatric population [81]. A prospective

![](images/7d9150aec5f0151a341e5298f293a2151d4dc74628f646d475f8db2dff8bf1ae.jpg)  
Fig. 21.22 Coronal view of pediatric condylar fracture on CT scan

study by Tabrizi divided 61 children under the age of 12 into two groups. One treated with tightwire MMF and the other with guiding elastics, both for 7 to 12 days [84]. There was no statistical difference in outcome based on tight MMF or elastics; however, children tolerated the elastics from a social perspective better. Since the pediatric mandibular condyle anatomically has thin bony cortex with abundant medullary bone and relatively thick condylar necks, it is more prone to burst-type intracapsular fractures. With the resultant hematoma and the accelerated regeneration potential in this population, they are at increased risk for developing ankylosis [80]. Therefore, prolonged periods of MMF should be generally avoided in pediatric condylar fractures.

# Open

Despite the anecdotal opinion that closed treatment will result in better outcome than open treatment in the pediatric population, no studies have demonstrated any advantage of open vs closed treatment [81]. However, since closed treatment of condylar fractures yields satisfactory results, open management is rarely used. The

pediatric population should not be viewed as "small adults," and therefore absolute and relative indications for open treatment in the adult population are not mandated in the pediatric. Currently there are no universal standards for open treatment of pediatric condylar fractures, although following the principles by Zide and Kent are acceptable [35]. A study by Schiel and colleagues did recommend that displacement of a fracture greater than  $45^{\circ}$  combined with the loss of height in the ramus is a strong indication for open treatment [85]. In this study, the surgeons used a transoral endoscopic-assisted approach to reduction and fixation, thus limiting concerns of facial nerve injury and scarring. All six patients in this study had optimal outcomes with normal occlusion and pain-free function at a 2-year follow-up.

# 21.9.4 Posttreatment Management and Complications

The pediatric posttreatment standard is early mobilization and soft diet. Age and maturity pending, physiotherapy, and guiding elastics can be beneficial. Close follow-up and examination should reveal restoration of pre-injury MIO, excursive movement, and proper occlusion. Parent education and good documentation are important for the patient long-term. Complications are similar to adult with specific attention to facial asymmetry due to growth disturbances and ankylosis due to restricted posttreatment mobility.

# Key Points

- Pediatric patients should not be treated like "small adults."  
Critical to recognize the condyle is the growth center of the mandible in children and can affect long-term outcomes.  
- Shorter period of MMF is recommended compared to adults for closed management.  
Early mobilization and physiotherapy are critical for success to avoid postoperative complications.

# Conclusion

Although the controversy still exists, condylar mandibular fractures can be successfully managed using conservative and open techniques. The treating surgeon with the aid of the available diagnostic tools should be able to evaluate each patient and formulate the appropriate patient-specific treatment plan. Postoperative physiotherapy and regular follow-up appointments are an integral part of the treatment plan. Knowledge of the

possible posttreatment complications and how to manage if occurs is a critical part of the surgeon's training.
