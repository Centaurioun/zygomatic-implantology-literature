# 9.1 Introduction

Presently, dynamic navigation (DN) is used by many medical specialties. The medical specialties of ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and surgical oncology all routinely use DN to perform simple and complex procedures with increased accuracy and precision [1, 2]. Outcomes are improved and morbidity decreased as DN allows for a minimally invasive approach [3]. In the field of dentistry, DN historically has been primarily used by oral and maxillofacial and craniofacial surgeons in the hospital. The medical DN systems used were primarily designed for cranially based procedures such as orthognathic, trauma, resective, reconstructive procedures and locating foreign bodies within the head and neck [4, 5]. In the US outpatient setting of the dental office, DN system became available in 2000 with the FDA approval of a system designed to place dental implants. Subsequently, more systems have been approved for this indication.

Approved Indications for DN:  
- Placement of dental implants in adults

Implant-Related Procedures:

Ridge splitting for implant placement  
Root shield or partial root extractions  
Finding and removing loose abutment screws in implant crowns  
- Removing failed implants  
Sinus elevation utilizing osseodensification  
Nerve lateralization and transposition for implant placement

"Off Label" Uses of DN:

- Removal of foreign bodies (i.e., screws and needles)  
Deep bone biopsies  
Harvesting bone grafts

- Removal of tori  
- Extraction of difficult third molars and coronectomy  
- Extraction of supernumerary teeth  
Endodontic access of calcified canals  
Apicoectomies  
Osteotomies

In summary, DN can be used to localize any ridged instrument in complex anatomic locations in real time with high accuracy and precision.

The surgical placement and restoration of dental implants has become an important part of contemporary dental practice. This trend has been accelerated by the increased utilization of three-dimensional (3D) imaging including cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral scanning (IOS) in the office-based and academic settings. These digital imaging modalities allow the implant team to perform restoratively driven planning in a collaborative fashion using computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

CAS is defined as the general technique of using preoperative diagnostic imaging with computer-assisted planning tools to facilitate surgical and restorative planning and procedures. There are three forms of CAS:

Dynamic navigation  
Static guidance  
Robotics

Presently the majority of dental implants are placed freehand, without any form of CAS. This can lead to the inaccurate placement of implants. Many of the complications associated with the placement of dental implants can be directly related to inaccurate positioning. These include the following:

Damage to the inferior alveolar nerve  
Floor of mouth hematoma and airway obstruction  
Damage to adjacent roots  
- Sinus infections secondary to inadvertent sinus perforations  
Fractured implants due to off-axis loading  
Peri-implantitis due to food impaction and off-axis loading  
Poor esthetics secondary to thin buccal, labial bone and soft tissue  
- Interproximal bone loss secondary to placing implants close to adjacent teeth and implants

# 9.2 Principles of Dynamic Navigation

# 9.2.1 Fundamentals of DN

The dynamic navigation systems presently available in the United States are a form of CAS that use optical tracking. Light is projected from a light-emitting diode (LED) light source above the patient. The light is projected down to the patient and the surgical field. The light is reflected off tracking arrays (passive patterned arrays) attached to the patient and the surgical instrument being tracked. The reflected light is captured by a pair of stereo cameras above the patient. The DN system then calculates the position of the patient and the instruments relative to the presurgical plan. This is done live or "dynamically." A virtual image is then projected onto a monitor for the surgeon and staff (Fig. 9.1). This virtual reality device allows the surgeon to work dynamically on the patient and execute the planned implant surgery. At any time, the surgeon can change the plan based upon the clinical situation [6].

# DN requires the following steps:

Image acquisition  
Image processing and analysis  
Diagnosis  
Planning  
Surgical simulation  
Surgical implementation

# - May 24th

Image acquisition includes obtaining 3D files, usually a CBCT with a digital imaging and communications in medicine format (.dicom) and an intraoral scan in a stereolithography format (.stl). CBCTs are a volumetric 3D image that capture the soft and hard tissues. Medical fan beam CTs may also be used. The datasets consist of multiple files with various acquisition parameters.

The area of the patient imaged by the CBCT is called the CT volume.

This volume is made up of voxels or three-dimension boxes that are organized in a coordinate system. Each voxel has an X, Y and Z position. Parameters are selected based upon the area being imaged and the procedures to be performed. Examples include large field of view (FOV)  $25\mathrm{cm}$  D x 17 cm H with  $0.3\mathrm{mm}$  resolution to view the entire maxilla, mandible, or both. These might be used by maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontist, and maxillofacial radiologist. Small FOV 6 cm D X 6 cm H might be used for one to three teeth with a higher resolution of  $0.13\mathrm{mm}$ . Typically, these would be used for endodontic procedures and partially edentulous implant cases. There is a wide range of radiation doses from various manufacturers and field of views from  $19~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  to  $1073~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$ , for example, a range of  $19 - 44~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  for a small FOV,  $28 - 268~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  for a medium FOV, and  $68 - 368~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  for a large FOV [7, 8]. Once the image is acquired, it is stored in its original format .dicom for later processing in planning software. CBCTs provide excellent imaging of osseous structures but have limitations related to the dentition and soft tissue. An important point related to the acquisition of the CBCT that is often overlooked is the separation of soft tissues while taking the image. For dental implant planning purposes, a cotton roll or radiolucent material place between the dentition and the buccal/ labial mucosa will create an air contrast zone. This allows the soft tissue in the region of the free gingival margin to be visualized on the CBCT. If the buccal/labial mucosa is allowed to touch marginal tissues, there will be no contrast, and the marginal soft tissues will not be visualized.

Limitations of CBCT alone:

Limited image resolution  
Creation of streak artifacts from metal of dental restorations  
- Inability to visualize occlusion  
- Inability to visualize details of soft tissue

Intraoral scanners provide a 3D surface image of the patients' dentition and occlusion. These are not volumetric images; IOS are a surface. IOS are considered direct data capturing. Direct data capturing removes some of the inaccuracies associated with indirect data capturing, i.e., taking an elastomeric impression, pouring the model, and then using a laboratory dental scanner. IOS have a high degree of accuracy for single and quadrant impressions. When full arches are scanned, the accuracy decreases [9]. The implant team may wish to obtain IOS of the patient before teeth are extracted. If the occlusion is not going to be changed, these images can be saved for later use for planning of ideal implant position and provisional fabrication.

# 9.2.2 Image Processing, Analysis

Once the images are acquired and stored, they are loaded into treatment planning software. There are numerous software packages available, but some key features should be present related to image processing and analysis:

The ability to import and export generic file formats (.dicom and .stl)  
The ability to superimpose the 3D files  
The ability to perform dual scan DICOM superimposition  
The ability to export the images in a common coordinate system as individual or merged item

The accuracy of the superimposed datasets and their associated occlusion are the focus of treatment planning for surgical implants. The accuracy of these merged dataset using corresponding mesh points can be  $0.15 + / - 0.12\mathrm{mm}$  and for the images themselves  $0.18 + / - 0.13\mathrm{mm}$ . There are few studies describing the accuracy of these merged datasets with occlusal registrations of occlusion using IOS. Ranges for the technique used by most IOS, a buccal scan technique, are as high as  $0.41 - 0.49\mathrm{mm}$  [10]. When these clean .stl images are superimposed on the CBCT data, the combined images allow the implant team to plan with ideal 3D images. Osseous, dental, and soft tissue structures are clearly visible as well as the occlusion (Fig. 9.2).

Advantages of merged CBCT and IOS:

High resolution  
No radiographic streak artifacts  
Ability to visualize occlusion  
Ability to visualize details of soft tissue  
- Ability to visualize osseous structure

# 9.2.3 Diagnosis

The implant team can now evaluate the images for diagnostic purposes. All images must first be evaluated for pathology. Familiarity with reading the entire CBCT volume is important. Having a maxillofacial radiologist review the images may aid in diagnosing subtle pathologic conditions. Components of the software that are important for diagnostic purposes include the following:

Ability to clean artifacts from the image  
Ability to view coronal, axial, and sagittal images  
Ability to view in cross-sectional views  
Ability to view in orthogonal view  
- Ability to change surface and opacity

Fig. 9.2 DICOM only vs. superimposed DICOM/stl image

- Ability to map nerves and important anatomic structures  
- Ability to alter the orientation of the volume in the X,Y,Z planes  
Ability to estimate Hounsfield units (bone densities)  
Measurement tools for angle and length  
Grid windows for measuring anatomic structures

The team should then evaluate the osseous and soft tissue volumes in the area of the proposed implants. The attachment of the periodontal ligaments is an important structure that is often overlooked and can be viewed in the orthogonal and cross-sectional views.

# 9.2.4 Planning

Diagnosis, planning, and implant surgical implementation go hand in hand. Your ability to accurately place a dental implant is only as good as your ability to visualize and plan. The image acquisition and processing are critical to the planning process. A generic approach that is not specific to any implant system allows the implant team greater flexibility. The workflow for the planning process should be laid out in an intuitive fashion flowing left to right. Component and tools of the software that are important for planning purposes include the following:

- Ability to utilize "generic" implants  
Ability to utilize "generic" abutments  
- Ability to view from an implant centric view  
- Ability to place "halos" of varying sizes around the virtual implant  
- Implant mirroring and paralleling tools  
- Implant centric measurement grid view

The steps for planning include the following:

Mapping the arch form  
- Mapping important anatomic structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve  
IOS superimposition  
Dual scan registration  
Cleaning the image of artifacts  
Place virtual crowns  
Place virtual implants and abutment  
- Ability to export the plan for fabrication of restorations

The planning of implants should be restoratively driven. This starts with evaluating the occlusion and placing the restorative envelope of the virtual teeth in the proper

occlusal position. This can be done using virtual implants in the surgical software. Another option is to use separate prosthetic software to plan the restorations. The plan is then exported from the prosthetic software and imported as an stl into the surgical planning software. The virtual implants should be properly aligned below the virtual crowns for ideal emergence into the prosthetic space. Virtual implants can be placed in adjacent teeth and contralateral teeth. These can then be used to evaluate angle and depth. The mirroring and paralleling tools can then be used for planning of the implant to be placed.

There are a few unique aspects of treatment planning related to DN. Prior to surgery depth is often difficult to access even with the best imaging techniques. The final decision is often made at the time of surgery. The ability to change the plan at the time of surgery is unique to dynamic navigation. Choosing implant designs with long parallel walls allows the surgeon to move the implant both apically and coronally at any time. This allows the implant team to take full advantage of the flexibility of DN. If one chooses a purely tapered implant design, the implant can never be moved occlusal after the osteotomy is completed (  $\square$  Fig. 9.3). The abl

ity to see and feel an implant at the time of delivery allows the surgeon to appreciate the deviations of the implant apex caused by dense bone structures. For example, implants generally are displaced buccally and distally either by the lingual cortical plate of the mandible or by the dense palatal bone. In these cases, a tapered implant may be helpful.

# 9.2.5 Surgical Simulation

Surgical simulation for educational purposes is an important part of contemporary dental training. DN has been used since its inception for the purpose of simulation of dental implant placement and restorative dentistry with varying degrees of success [11, 12]. In medicine, the learning curve for dynamic navigation is well documented [13]. A recent simulation study comparing implant naive dental students placing dental implants with DN vs. freehand showed a statistically significant improvement using DN. [14] Additionally, the

use of DN allows for the documentation of training. The software in the systems keeps a record of the position of the surgical instrument tip relative to the patient. This is called the "pose" of the instrument tip. This can be visualized for debriefing, troubleshooting, and educational purposes.  $\square$  Figure 9.4 shows an image of the poses of a surgical procedure. Used in this fashion, surgeons could be standardized statistically to document competence. In Block's recent paper, the learning curve of three surgeons was tracked, and they became statistically equivalent and proficient after placing between 10 and 20 implants [15].

Surgical simulation includes the ability to export the surgical/restorative plan to CAD/CAM restorative software programs. This allows the implant team to fabricate provisional restorations before surgery is executed. This is termed "dynamically guided prosthetics." The navigated plan includes needed bone reduction, implant position, occlusal relationships, the vertical relationships, and the final milled hybrid prosthesis. Small vertical guidance pins milled into the prosthesis are used to

place the prosthesis into the proper position. The osteotomies for these pins are cut using the DN system. Lateral non-guided feet are added to improve the accuracy of the dynamically guided prosthesis (Fig. 9.4).

# 9.3 Accuracy and Precision of Dynamic Navigation

Presently the majority of dental implants are placed freehand, without any form of CAS. This can lead to the inaccurate placement of implants. Many of the complications associated with the placement of dental implants can be directly related to inaccurate position. These include the following:

Damage to the inferior alveolar nerve  
Floor of mouth hematoma and airway obstruction  
Damage to adjacent roots  
- Sinus infections secondary to inadvertent sinus perforations  
Fractured implants due to off-axis loading  
Peri-implantitis due to food impaction and off-axis loading  
Poor esthetics secondary to thin buccal bone and soft tissue  
Interproximal bone loss secondary to placing implants to close to adjacent teeth and implants  
- Increased prosthetic complexity and cost

Accuracy is defined as the degree of closeness between a measurement and the measurement's true value (mean deviation). Precision is the degree to which repeated measurements under the same conditions are unchanged (standard deviation from mean deviation) (Fig. 9.5) [16].

The inaccurate placement of dental implants placed freehand has been documented in the dental literature [15, 17, 18]. This has not only been documented in the clinical literature but on models and cadavers as well [19]. Vercruyssen [17] reported mean angular deviations for edentulous mucosal born guides of 2.71 degrees (SD 1.36) vs. freehand of 9.92 (SD 6.01). Block [18] reported mean angular deviations for DN placed implants of 2.97 (SD 2.08) vs. freehand of 6.50 (SD 4.21). Why does this occur? Dentists need to be able to accurately evaluate shapes, contours, proportions, color, symmetry, depth, and distance [20, 21]. One reason may be that human vision is susceptible to stereoscopic parallax error (PE). PE is defined as the perceived shift in an object's position as it is viewed from different angles. When viewing the space available within a defined edentulous area, there is a viewable or perceived space. This is the "viewable restorative space" (VRS). This VRS is always smaller, distal, and buccal from the actual restorative space. In summary, the literature is clear; any form of CAS is statistically more accurate and precise than freehand placement as they overcome the inherent inaccuracy of human vision.

# 9.4 Components of Dynamic Navigation

# 9.4.1 Important Definitions

CBCT volume (CTV): Volume imaged by the CT scanner. It has an X,Y,Z coordinate system.  
Surgical tracking volume (STV): The area imaged and tracked by the DN system. It has an X,Y,Z coordinate system.  
- Registration: Aligning the X,Y,Z coordinates of the surgical tracking volume and the CT volume with each other using the patient tracking array. This can be done using pair point-based (fiducials) or surface matching (fiducial free) routines.  
- Calibration: Measures the geometry of the device being guided relative to the tracking arrays.  
System check: Verifying calibration and registration are accurate by touching a known anatomic point on the patient and visualizing the same point on the DN monitor.

All DN systems have the following components:

Computer: Graphic processor  
Monitor: Visualization for surgeon and staff  
- Cameras: Surgical tracking volume  
Digital-analog interface: Fiducials  
Patient tracking array: Dynamic reference frame  
Instrument array: Patient effectors  
Planning software  
Tracking software  
Surgical handpiece chuck and drill extension

# 9.4.2 Computer

For any form of guided surgery, a computer is necessary. DN is unique as it is a live image and requires a high level of graphic processing. Ideally a system that is dedicated and designed to perform this purpose will be more robust. GPU (graphics processing unit)-based systems similar to "gaming" computers are preferable.

# 9.4.3 Monitor

DN is a form of "image"-guided surgery. The surgeon and staff will be looking at a computer monitor and not the patient during surgery. A large screen that is easily visualized from anywhere in the operative during surgery is ideal.

# 9.4.4 Cameras

The system tracks the patient using stereoscopic cameras. The area being tracked by the two cameras is called the surgical tracking volume (STV). This area is determined by the cameras. The same parameters used for all forms of photography are important:

Focal distance  
Depth of field  
Pixel size

Another important parameter is the distance between the stereo cameras. This is called the baseline distance or surgical baseline. Generally larger baselines produce improved three-dimensionality by increasing the disparity for a given change in depth. This means the system can measure depth with more accuracy. A fixed baseline is used for all medical and dental navigation systems. Determining the ideal components of the camera system is complex but follows a basic formula:

$$
D = \frac {f * b}{d * p s}
$$

$D =$  Depth;  $f =$  focal length;  $b =$  baseline;  $d =$  disparity value;  $ps =$  pixel size

Depth is the distance from the cameras to the surface of the object being imaged (Fig. 9.6). Disparity refers to the difference in a pixel position between two camera images. The manufactures use various hardware to optimize the DN system to establish optimal STV. [22]

# 9.4.5 Digital-Analog Interface

The DN system must relate the patient to the digital images produced by the CBCT. To do this, software matches points or "fiducials" within the CBCT image to

![](images/2d89e8a5e0177236511e7383a38836409c3be8d0ec5f0c301691be33621bcb7e.jpg)  
Fig. 9.6 Parameters used to determine ideal optical tracking during dynamic navigation

the same locations on the patient. This can be done in two ways:

Using radiopaque "fiducials" placed on the patient during the CBCT. Usually round objects or screws  
Using anatomic locations or surfaces, "organic fiducials" within the CBCT, or "a fiducial-free" approach

These fiducials represent a digital-analog interface which will be used to "register" the patient to the tracking system.

# 9.4.6 Patient Tracking Arrays

The patient tracking array (PRA) attaches directly to the patient in a ridged fashion to allow the DN system to track the patient during surgery. There are two types of arrays:

Passive arrays that reflect light projected on them from the cameras above  
Active arrays that actively project light

Figure 9.7 shows a number of patient tracking arrays. For dentate cases, PTAs are attached to the patient's teeth in an area that the dental implant will not be placed.

For edentulous cases, they can be screwed into the patient's skeleton, usually the maxilla or mandible. Tracking arrays should be large enough to allow the

DN tracking cameras to accurately track but not too large to be obstructed by the doctor or the assistant's hands or head. When the arrays cannot be visualized by the stereo cameras of the DN system, tracking is blocked. This is called optical interference (Fig. 9.8). The surgical team must learn to operate without blocking the arrays.

The number of points and the geometry of the tracking arrays is also important. In general, the more points tracked, the more accurate and robust the system will be. When the PTA is registered to the STV and CTV, the virtual construct becomes the dynamic reference frame (DRF). The DAI must be calibrated to the PTA for this to occur. Ideally, all arrays are calibrated prior to surgery. This is done by holding the array within the surgical tracking volume and activating the software. This can be done at any time during surgery should a part come loose, or a new position be desired for the array.

# 9.4.7 Instrument Tracking Array

Instruments also have arrays attached to them. They must be rigidly attached to the instrument being tracked. They have the same attributes as the patient tracking arrays. Ideally, they should be small, light, and ergonomically designed. When they are calibrated, they become the patient effector (PE).

Fig. 9.8 Optical interference

# 9.4.8 Planning Software

The software used for DN is similar to that used for all forms of CAS and is described above.

# 9.4.9 Tracking Software

The software used to guide the instrument must allow visualization in six degrees of freedom.

All ridged objects moved in three-dimensional space have their position describe in six degrees of freedom: up/down, pitch, roll, yaw, left/right, and forward and back (Fig. 9.9).

The tracking software must intuitively allow the surgeon to visualize the proper position in one window (Fig. 9.10).

When using the tracking software, the surgeon proceeds systematically:

1. Platform position is acquired; the tip of the drill is positioned in the proper point of entry (forward/back and left/right).  
2. Implant angle is acquired (pitch, roll, yaw).  
3. Depth is executed (up/down), keeping the first four parameters.

Fig. 9.9 Six degrees of freedom. (Image created by Horia Ionescu)

The DN system allows the surgeon to visualize the STV with micron accuracy and thus requires a steady hand. The utilization of finger rests is imperative for optimal control.

# 9.4.10 Surgical Handpiece Chuck and Drill Extension

Various DN systems allow the use of multiple standard slow-speed implant drills. They all require some form of attachment apparatus for the tracking arrays.

All mechanical rotating systems have some inaccuracy. This inaccuracy is call run-out. There are two components to run-out: radial and axial run-out.

It is important to understand this source of error and its clinical effect. For a standard  $13\mathrm{mm}$  drill, the error within the handpiece itself can be up to 400 microns. If a drill extension is used, the error increased up to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 9.11). Since the deflection angle increases with the use of a drill extension, they should be avoided when possible. Longer single-piece drills are preferable.

# 9.5 Basic Workflow of Dynamic Navigation

The workflow of all navigation systems available in the outpatient setting is model based. The virtual model is created with presurgical imaging and then registered to

the patient at the time of surgery. No images are acquired during the operative procedure [3]. The process of registering the patient to the virtual plan is either:

# Pair point based (Using fiducial points in the CBCT)

Place fiducial markers on patient  $>$  Take CBCT  $>$  Plan  $>$  Calibrate patient tracking array with attached fiducials.

Calibrate instruments  $>$  Place fiducials back on patient in the original position  $>$  Register patient  $>$  Navigate

# Surface Matching (Using anatomic locations or surfaces/fiducial free)

CBCT  $>$  Plan  $>$  Calibrate instruments  $>$  Pick anatomic surface or points  $>$  Place patient tracking array  $>$  Touch predetermined points or surface with a calibrated probe to register patient  $>$  Navigate

# 9.5.1 Workflow Overview

A dynamic navigation system enables the user to evaluate the images from the CT scan for virtual implant surgical planning. Prior to starting surgery, the case should be planned on the dynamic navigation system itself, or on a planning workstation. A planning workstation could be a personal computer with the planning software of the dynamic navigation system. If the case is not planned on the machine itself, then the case should be imported to the navigation system after it has been planned in computer and prior to instrument calibration.

There are two types of implant patients: the dentate patient and the edentulous patient. Depending on the type of implant case, the user should follow the steps in the table below for an overview of the process of preparing and performing planned surgery using dynamic navigation.

Navigational elements mounted to the patient are required to facilitate location registration for surgery. Either a fiducial clip attached to the patient's teeth or edentulous fiducials in the patient's bone are required to locate the patient in the CT scan.

The patient case type is based on whether the patient is dentate or edentulous on the arch where the implant is to be placed:

Dentate: The patient is fully or partially dentate. The teeth can support a fiducial clip (Fig. 9.12).  
- Edentulous: The patient has no teeth. Use an edentulous plate and edentulous fiducials (  $\square$  Fig. 9.13 and  $\square$  Table 9.1).

![](images/ab960699e28631d4c88310f34a4e7ce50061c53a9a375f17e3ce3c968b290636.jpg)

Fig. 9.13 Edentulous plate

# 9.6 Dentate Patient Work Flow

In the dentate patient, the fiducial clip allows for an impression of the patient's teeth to be taken. This impression ensures that the fiducial clip will be firmly supported by teeth and the fiducial clip will go into the same location in the patient's mouth every single time when being seated. It is important that the CT scan is taken with the fiducial clip seated properly in the patient's mouth without any movement or rocking of the fiducial clip.

# 9.6.1 Fiducial Clip Considerations

The following items must be considered when creating a fiducial clip:

- Place the tracker arm attachment section of the fiducial clip on the buccal or cheek side of the patient.

The position of the fiducial clip is determined by the surgeon prior to fabrication.  
The fiducial clip must be placed on the arch that the surgeon will be placing the implants.  
The fiducial clip must be placed in a location that does not interfere with the drilling of the implants.  
The fiducial clip should be placed to minimize optical interference by the surgeons or assistants' hands and instruments. For best results, the fiducial clip should be positioned to the opposite side of the surgeon's approach. For example, a right-handed sur

geon would prefer the fiducial clip on the patient's left side.

- Mobile dentition should not be used to fixate the fiducial clip.  
- Pontic sites of bridges should be avoided if possible. If they must be used, then wax blocking agent should be placed under the pontic to avoid locking on the fiducial clip. If it is difficult to replace a fiducial clip fabricated in a pontic site, any severe undercuts can be removed by the doctor using a lab knife.  
Patients with orthodontic wires cannot have a fiducial clip placed unless the wire and brackets are removed temporarily in the site the fiducial clip is to be placed.  
- Buttons on teeth, used for Invisalign, are generally good teeth for placement of fiducial clips. The aligner must not be "active" at the time of fiducial clip placement unless surgery is done on the same day as fiducial clip placement.  
Teeth with abfraction defect on the buccal aspects are generally good for fiducial clip placement. When removing the fiducial clip from these teeth, it should be "rolled" toward the buccal abfraction defect. When replacing, it should be "rolled" from the buccal to the lingual, thus engaging the defect for retention.

# 9.6.2 Fiducial Clip Preparations

1. Turn on hot water bath.

2. Obtain cotton forceps or tweezers.

3. Prepare cold water cups and ice for cool down process. Considerations when planning the location of the fiducial clip (with tracker arm and patient tracker attached):

Get as close to the implant area as desired but not in the way of guided drilling.  
- Facial characteristics of the patient (i.e., mouth size, lingual tori, interference of facial features).  
- Does the patient have dental work that could be compromised (i.e., crowns, bridges, and loose or unstable teeth)?

# 9.6.3 Fiducial Clip Impressions

1. Submerge the fiducial clip in a hot water bath at a temperature of  $140 - 160^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ $(60 - 71^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  for approximately 3-5 minutes. When the thermoplastic on the fiducial clip is clear, it is ready to be used.  
2. Remove the fiducial clip from the hot water bath using a mechanical device.  
3. Let the fiducial clip cool for approximately 1 minute to reach a surface temperature  $< 40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(104^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .

4. Have patient sit in a dental chair with their head resting on the headrest.  
5. The feature on the fiducial clip used to mount the tracker arm should be positioned on the buccal side.  
6. Line up the fiducial clip on the three teeth chosen, making sure there is equal distance on lingual and buccal sides. Press straight down until it bottoms out on the plastic surface.  
7. Remove the fiducial clip by pulling straight up just as inserted. Do not rock the fiducial clip.  
8. After an impression of the patient is taken, place the fiducial clip into a cold water bath until the thermoplastic color appears solid white. When placing in cold water, be certain not to touch the sides of the clear thermoplastic against the sides of the container.  
9. Remove the fiducial clip from the cold water bath, and place it back into the patient's mouth to ensure a proper fit. The fiducial clip should fit firmly and should not be easily removed.  
10. Ask the patient if they feel any discomfort on their gums where the fiducial clip is placed.  
11. If patient discomfort is noted when replacing the fiducial clip, then the fiducial clip should be removed and inspected. Look for large areas of flash on the edges near the soft tissues. This should be removed with a lab knife, avoiding any damage to the inside of the clip near where the thermoplastic attaches to the teeth.  
12. Leave the fiducial clip attached to the patient's teeth.  
13. The patient is now ready for a CT scan (  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 9.14).

# 9.6.4 Fiducial Clip Placement

A "Snap Test" helps to ensure that the fiducial clip is properly molded and has a snug fit.

1. The fiducial clip is replaced by the surgeon in the area from which it was fabricated, and an audible and tactile "snap" should be noted when it is replaced. The "snap" may not always occur if the patient does not have undercuts. If this is the case, the surgeon should take extra caution to ensure that the fiducial clip cannot be rocked or easily removed.  
2. The surgeon should then grasp the fiducial clip where the tracker arm will be attached and feel for any movement of the clip. It should not rock or move. The surgeon should be able to move the patient's jaw without dislodging the fiducial clip.  
3. If there is movement, then the fabrication should be repeated.

![](images/fc175ad5ba3929cbe7feb42163181e4bee3746c6f33ccf99d93255c7ae11e30a.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 9.14 Navigation preoperative workflow diagram for dentate patients

4. If the desired location is found to be unsuitable due to lack of undercuts or short clinical crowns, then a new location must be found, and the fabrication repeated.  
5. If the surgeon desires to increase retention, then a small amount of composite can be temporarily bonded to the buccal occlusal one-third surfaces of the teeth. The surgeon should follow the guidelines of the desired composite material. This can be removed after surgery is completed.  
6. If the fiducial clip is difficult to remove, it should be rolled toward the buccal or labial surface.  
7. If the fiducial clip should lock onto an undercut or bridge, it can be removed by cutting it in half from mesial to distal. The plastic and thermoplastic can then be removed.

# 9.6.5 Dual Arch Considerations

If multiple fiducial clips are being placed in the mouth, extra consideration is required. Best practice is to ensure that the fiducial clips do not touch. If they must touch, make sure to separate the metal fiducials. A CT scan may be taken with both fiducial clips seated in the patient's mouth. Additional considerations are required during the planning stage, the calibration stage, and the navigation stage discussed in the following chapters.

# 9.6.6 Multiple Fiducial Clips on the Same Arch

If multiple fiducial clips are being placed on the same arch in the mouth, ensure they do not touch. A CT scan may be taken with both fiducial clips seated in the patient's mouth.

# 9.7 Edentulous Patient Workflow

An edentulous patient case requires edentulous fiducials (small screws) to be placed in the patient's bone to facilitate registration in the CT scan. The fiducials can be placed through the soft tissue of the patient, through small stab incisions on apical to the mucogingival junction, or directly into the exposed bone by laying a flap. The surgeon must use careful discretion when deciding the location of the edentulous fiducials. The edentulous fiducials are also used in the preoperative process to register with the software prior to surgery. When placing the edentulous fiducials in the mandible, short  $4\mathrm{mm}$  screws should be placed to avoid damage to the inferior alveolar nerve.

# 9.7.1 Location of Edentulous Fiducials

Edentulous fiducial are small temporary bone screws placed in the bone of the patient in the arch into which implants are to be placed. The navigation software looks for this specific geometry.

Screw length is determined by the quality of the bone and the position in the maxilla or mandible. Considerations for length are as follows:

1. The  $4\mathrm{mm}$  screw is generally recommended, especially in the posterior mandible or in areas of dense cortical bone.  
2. In the maxilla or regions of immature, soft grafted bone, longer  $5\mathrm{mm}$  screws may be necessary to ensure stability.

The edentulous fiducials must be placed in the arch that the implants will be placed. If implants are to be placed in both the maxilla and the mandible, then edentulous fiducials must be placed in both arches. The fiducials must be placed in an area that will be exposed using a subperiosteal incision during surgery. They should be placed in the bone that will not be removed during surgery. For instance, if vertical bone reduction is anticipated, the edentulous fiducials must be placed apical to the area of proposed bone reduction. The inferior alveolar nerve and the infraorbital nerve must be considered and avoided when placing fiducials. The edentulous fiducials should not be placed proximal to where the edentulous plate will be placed during surgery.

The edentulous fiducials should be spread out as far as possible around the arch. Place at least one in the anterior region. Place two in the posterior near the second bicuspid teeth on both sides of the arch. One edentulous fiducial should be located close to the implant site. It is important to spread the edentulous fiducials around the mouth to ensure system accuracy. A minimum of four fiducials must be placed in the patient.

# 9.7.2 CT Acquisition

The patient is instructed to bite into the proper occlusion. If desired, bite registration material can be used to ensure proper occlusion. The CT is then taken.

# 9.7.3 Dual Scan Technique

Dual scan is the term used when a dental appliance, such as a set of dentures, is superimposed over the patient CT. This can be used to guide implant placement during planning. There is a dual scan button in the dynamic navigation system software which is used to

superimpose the scan of the dental appliance with the CT scan data of the patient.

# 9.7.4 Dual Scan Procedure Overview

1. Apply at least five temporary,  $2\mathrm{mm}$ , sticky fiducials to the dental appliance.  
2. Scan the dental appliance with the fiducials in the CT scanner. Use high resolution (0.3 voxels).  
3. Do not remove the fiducials on the dental appliance. Place the dental appliance into the patient's mouth, and ensure it is seated properly.  
4. Scan the patient with the dental appliance in his or her mouth using the CT scanner.  
5. Upload the patient DICOM to the dynamic navigation system.  
6. Use the dual scan button to superimpose the dental appliance scan over the patient DICOM.

# 9.7.5 Detailed Steps

# 1. Scanning the Appliance

If a dental appliance for both the maxilla and the mandible are being scanned, perform the following procedure for both dental appliances:

- Apply at least five sticky, temporary fiducials directly to the outside of the dental appliance. Ensure they are securely in place and will not shift during scanning or when placed in the patient's mouth.  
- Place the appliance in the CT scanner, and scan the appliance individually. If scanning both a maxillary and mandibular dental appliance, scan them separately, and ensure that each has its own individual set of DICOM files.

# 2. Scanning the Patient

- Place the dental appliance in the patient's mouth, being careful not to disturb the fiducials.  
If both the maxillary and the mandibular appliances are being used, then place both in the

patient's mouth. The patient's dentures should be in occlusion when the scan is taken.

- Scan the patient with the CT scanner.

3. Uploading DICOMs to the dynamic navigation system

- Upload the patient DICOM to the dynamic navigation system using the Add Patient DICOM button on the patient selection screen. Open the case, and ensure that the fiducials for the appliance(s) are visible in the 3D image.  
- Return to the patient selection screen. Locate the dual scan button which is located on the right of the case row, and select it.  
- When the dual scan button is selected, the user is prompted to select the set of DICOMs from the dental appliance.  
- When the correct set of DICOMs are selected, the Dual Scan Parameters window appears.  
- Select the appropriate jaw on the left of the window. The selected jaw highlights in green.  
- Use the sliders on the bottom of the window to set the opacity, and select the Appliance Isosurface HU Threshold. The 3D image may also be manipulated with the orientation buttons or clipped using the lasso tool and scissors.  
- Click OK. The registration process begins.  
The dynamic navigation system is aligning the fiducials in the appliance scan with the fiducials in the patient scan. Wait for the registration to complete before continuing.  
- When the Performing Dual Scan Registration window closes, the case may be opened.  
- Ensure that the dental appliance is placed appropriately in the 3D image. The dental appliance is also visible in some 2D views as an outline.  
If the registration fails, a warning will appear. No superimposition will appear in the patient case. The failure may be because the edentulous fiducials were not in the same position in the patient scan as they were in the appliance scan. It may be necessary to rescan the appliance or the patient (Figs. 9.15 and 9.16).

# 9.7.6 CT Scan for All Patients

When the fiducial clip or edentulous fiducials are ready, a scan of the patient is taken to provide a transform from the CT to the patient in 3D. For proper operation, the field of view (FOV) of the CT image must be large enough to include both the fiducial clip and the surgical site. If multiple fiducial clips are being used, ensure that the CT image includes all of them. A CT FOV size of at least  $6\mathrm{cm}$  diameter  $\times 6\mathrm{cm}$  height is recommended. The CT image voxel should be isotropic and should be no more than  $0.4\mathrm{mm}$ . A CT image voxel between  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  and  $0.4\mathrm{mm}$  is recommended.

Take a CT scan of the patient, and load the images from the CT scanner on the dynamic navigation system. Patient status is unplanned.

Optimizing Fiducial Detection and Soft Tissue Resolution

When taking a CBCT for the dynamic navigation system, there are additional steps that can be taken during scanning to optimize the quality of the CBCT. These steps will improve the visualization of both the hard and soft tissues, will help alleviate problems with fiducial detection that occur when the patient has a large number of metal restorations, and will overall enhance the surgeon's treatment planning abilities.

- Keep the plane of occlusion that the implant will be placed in parallel to the floor. Use the laser provided by the CBCT scanner to determine this plane of occlusion.  
- Optimize the contrast between the soft tissues. Always put cotton rolls in the buccal vestibule between the teeth and cheeks and between the teeth and the tongue. This will make an air pocket that optimizes contrast on the CBCT, allowing for greater visualization of the soft tissue in the CBCT.  
- Separate the upper teeth from the lower teeth with cotton rolls.  
- Separate the fiducial clip from the opposing jaw using cotton rolls. Teeth of the opposing jaw should not contact the metal fiducials of the fiducial clip. Contact may cause problems with fiducial clip detection.  
- Do not allow metal fiducial to touch any other metal in the mouth.

# 9.7.7 Planning Workflow

# 1. Selecting a Patient Case

Upon selecting a patient case, the planning workflow expands. The first time a case is opened on the dynamic navigation system, the software automatically detects fiducial clip or edentulous fiducials in the CT scan. If the software does not detect a fiducial clip, a warning will appear stating that the scan may only be used for edentulous navigation or for view-only purposes. If the fiducial clip is detected, then the clip will appear in green in the 3D image.

# 2. Defining Panoramic Curve

Creating the panoramic curve is one of the two mandatory steps in the planning process. The other one, which is planning implants, is discussed later. The window that opens when a case is first opened looks similar to the one displayed below. The top left window is the axial view (2D view). The mouse wheel changes the axial slice. The bottom left window is the 3D view. The views on the right are empty until the panoramic curve is drawn.

![](images/52183beb9fa94b115e64ff8cfe6fba8ba5107a707e5e54a88d674f520bf4d3ee.jpg)  
Fig.9.17 Mandibular view window

The mandible view is displayed below. To view the appropriate arch, click the appropriate icon on the left side. The active jaw is highlighted in green in the left tool bar. It is required to define an arch for each jaw into which implants will be placed (Fig. 9.17).

A minimum of three user-defined control points are selected on the axial view to create the panoramic image. These three control points are displayed as blue dots. To help guide this process, a number will hover around the cursor. This indicates the tooth number that should be selected. The number that appears depends on what jaw is selected.

# 9.7.8 Creating the Panoramic Curve Step by Step:

1. A number will hover around the cursor to indicate selection for the right second molar. Scroll to the slice in the axial view so that the roots of the teeth of the selected jaw are visible.  
2. Double-click the right second molar. The cursor will display #31 if the selected jaw is a mandible, and it will displace #2 if the maxilla was selected.

3. Once selected, the cursor number changes to indicate selection for the area between the two central incisors. The cursor will display #24/25 if the selected jaw is the mandible, and it will display #8/9 if the maxillary was selected.  
4. Double-click the gap between the central incisors.  
5. The cursor number changes to indicate the left second molar. The cursor will display #18 if the selected jaw is a mandible, and it will display #15 if the maxilla was selected.  
6. Double-click the left second molar.  
7. Additional control points will appear in pink when the pan is drawn.  
8. Double-click in the pan curve to add more control points. They also appear in a pink color. To delete a pink control point, double right click on the control point.

All control points can be adjusted until the pan view is adjusted to preference. Alter points on the arch by dragging the control point locations. The thickness of the focal trough is shown in the axial view. By default, the focal trough is spaced evenly around the arch created by the control points. The thickness of the focal trough is adjusted by the left mouse button dragging in the upper right of the reconstructed panoramic view.

# 9.7.9 Marking Nerve

Marking the nerve canal is done on the Mark Nerve screen. The 3D nerve path is generated based on user-selected points. The nerve is populated in all views as the user selects points.

1. Select the Mark Nerve icon.  
2. The Mark Nerve icon will highlight in green.  
3. Double-click to select points in the pan, cross-sections, and/or axial view to mark the nerve canal. Repeat as many times as desired.  
4. When finished, press the highlighted "Mark Nerve" icon to complete the nerve. The nerve will turn to a muted red color to indicate it has been completed.  
5. If creating another nerve, repeat steps 1 through 4.  
6. To undo a point, click the Undo button in the left tool bar.

# 9.7.10Deleting Nerves

When the Mark Nerve button is not active, a previously defined nerve may be deleted by right-clicking it. A dialog asks to confirm the deletion.

# 9.7.10.1Intra-Oral Scan Registration

The next step in the digital workflow of the dynamic navigation system is to import the optical STL files for mandible and maxilla in occlusion and merge these STL flies to the DICOM file of the patient.

# 9.7.10.2Import Intra-Oral Scan

1. Select the STL file icon in the top menu bar.  
2. Then select appropriate arch where you will be planning the implants.  
3. Click the Import button.  
4. Select folder where Intra-Oral Scan is located.  
5. Select the Intra-Oral Scan corresponding to a closed or in occlusion representation for the jaw indicated by the active arch. Note the title bar of the file dialog to confirm the correct arch to load.  
6. The software then prompts to load the opposing jaw's occlusion Intra-Oral Scan. Again, note the title bar of the file dialog to confirm the appropriate arch.

The CT extracted bone representation is displayed in the left solo bone view and the Intra-Oral Scan of the active arch in the middle view, and the right window displays the registration between the two.

# 9.7.11Marking Points on STL File (Intra-Oral Scan) and DICOM File (Bone Surface)

1. Double-click on the bone surface.  
2. Double-click the matching point on Intra-Oral Scan.

3. Repeat this process for a minimum of three pairs. Additional pairs may increase the effectiveness of the registration.

Distribution along the arch and along the length of the teeth also increases the effectiveness of the registration.

# 9.7.11.1Removing Points

Click X to remove that set of points.

# 9.7.11.2 Planning Virtually Waxed-Up Crowns

1. Open the Plan Crowns workflow page on the top tool bar menu.  
2. If no crowns are planned for the case, the overview panoramic appears automatically (Fig. 9.18). If crowns were previously defined, it can be brought up by clicking the Add Crown button.  
3. In the panoramic, select tooth number for desired crown placement.  
4. Double-click the panoramic to place the crown in the appropriate location.  
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all desired crowns.  
6. Click Close when finished.

# 9.7.12Adjusting Crown to Preferred Position

- Select a crown in the Rx panel.  
- Move the location of the crown by clicking and dragging it in any of the 2D views.  
- Tilt and rotate the crown using the circles in the 2D views.  
The crown type, mesial/distal diameter, buccal/lingual diameter, and length are noted in the Rx panel.  
Adjust the crown size in the Rx panel.  
- Zooming in on the images in the 2D and 3D views may help in making fine adjustments to the crown.

![](images/8050732d9e0a619be847873af45dc3c99c5fbf0f011ec26a8085e396b96dc348.jpg)  
Fig. 9.18 Image of Plan Crowns workflow page

# 9.7.13Crown Rx Panel

The crown Rx panel is similar to the implant Rx panel (Fig. 9.19). The size indicators display the diameter of the current virtual tooth in the buccal/lingual (B/L) direction, mesial/distal (M/D) direction, and length (top to bottom). The select crown buttons allow toggling between different crowns to be planned.

# 9.7.13.1 Planning Implant

1. Start by selecting the implant figure at the top tool bar menu.  
2. Select the Add Implant button on the left side.  
3. In the panoramic, select tooth number for desired implant placement.

4. Double-click the panoramic to place the implant in the appropriate location.  
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all desired implants.  
6. Click Close.

After closing the panoramic window, three 2D views are displayed to adjust and finalize the position of the implant (Fig. 9.20).

Top window shows the implant axial.  
Middle view shows a view that is orthogonal to both the top window and the green and purple indicator. When an implant is first selected, the green arrow points buccally.  
Bottom is orthogonal to the middle view.

![](images/ce81b903b1cfc9b9c7e2c02fd844e54a5f68192c5523150c99fb4a8d565ef148.jpg)

Fig. 9.20 Image of implant planning view

# 9.7.14 Planning Implant in 2D Views

The active/selected implant is a dark blue outline surrounded by its interactors.  
Non-active implants appear as light blue outlines.  
Crowns are filled light blue shapes.  
- Implants have a flat surface that shows the implant timing.  
The Intra-Oral Scan aligned to the active jaw shows as a magenta outline.  
The Intra-Oral Scan aligned to the opposing jaw shows as an orange outline.  
- Implant halos may appear in the three orthogonal views based on Preferences. Halos are used to visually show distances between the implant and neighboring objects. The default halos are set to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  and  $3\mathrm{mm}$  offset from the implant surfaces. These settings may be changed in the Implant tab under the Settings > Preferences window. A maximum of five halos may be set.  
The slice planes are adjusted in a number of ways. Grabbing the interactor arrow in the top view or scrolling the mouse wheel in the middle view rotates the arrow about the implant's long axis. The middle and bottom views update to reflect these rotations.  
- Scrolling the mouse wheel in the top view or grabbing the arrow in the middle view and dragging changes the height of the interactor arrow along the length of the implant. This also modifies the slice in the top view.

# 9.7.15Adjusting Implant to Preferred Position

- Select an implant in the Rx panel.  
- Move the location of the implant by clicking and dragging it in any of the 2D views.  
- Tilt and rotate the implant using the circles in the 2D views.  
The implant's type, occlusal diameter, apical diameter, and length may be changed in the Rx panel.  
The nudge tool may be used to make fine adjustments to the implant location. Click on the appropriate arrow to move the implant in the indicated direction.

- Zooming in on the image may help in making fine adjustments to the implant size (Figs. 9.21 and 9.22).

The Rx panel contains pertinent information about the implants and attachments in the plan. The information displayed is detailed below:

(a) The active implant's tooth number: this is the implant that can be modified in the top, middle, and bottom left most views.  
(b) Abutment height: can be adjusted similar to platform diameter.

(c) Abutment angle: if using an angled abutment, the value can be adjusted by directly entering a value via keyboard, scrolling the mouse wheel while over the control, or using the arrows in 1.0-degree increments.  
(d) Platform diameter: can be adjusted by directly entering a value via keyboard, scrolling the mouse wheel while over the control, or using the arrows in  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  increments.  
(e) Implant length: can be adjusted similar to platform diameter.  
(f) Apex diameter: can be adjusted similar to platform diameter.  
(g) Type of implant (generic vs. saved favorite): implant type can be changed by clicking the button to the left of the type.  
(h) Add/remove crown: if a crown does not exist for the implant, one can be added. If one is present, it can be removed. If removing a crown, a dialog will ask for confirmation.  
(i) Patient attachments: attachments may be either fiducial clips or edentulous clips. Only attachments on the currently active jaw are displayed, and the green highlighted button indicates the active attachment. Clicking an attachment button causes that attachment to become active. If the attachment is an E-clip, then the Select Attachments area of the Rx panel remains empty until at least three edentulous fiducials are marked on the Mark Edentulous Fiducials page. Once this occurs, the attachment appears as the active attachment.

(j) Implants: this lists the implants in the currently active jaw. The active implant is highlighted in green. The active implant can be changed by clicking on a non-active button. Implants may be locked (their position is unmovable and the implant size unchangeable). Locked implants are indicated by a lock icon.  
(k) Alignment tool: this tool is only available if there are multiple implants in the jaw. This tool will pivot the active implant about its occlusal end. The occlusal end will not move position. There are two modes. The mode is chosen in a pop-up that appears when using this tool.

1. Mirroring: if the active implant and aligning implant are on opposite sides of the jaw midline (e.g., the active implant is #4 and the aligning implant is #13), then the active implant will mirror the aligning implant across the midline.  
2. Paralleling: If the active implant and aligning implant are on the same side of the jaw midline (e.g., the active implant is #3 and the aligning implant is #5), then the active implant will become parallel to the aligning implant.

# 9.7.16Mark Edentulous Fiducials (Edentulous Patients Only)

The edentulous fiducials in the CT should be confirmed on the Mark Edentulous Fiducials screen.

1. Click the Mark Edentulous Fiducials button on the workflow.

2. The software detects the edentulous fiducials in the CT and should appear on the lower left hand window.  
3. Confirm that the edentulous fiducials listed in the window are the ones placed prior to the patient CT. Check the check boxes of properly marked edentulous fiducials.  
4. If the software does not properly detect an edentulous fiducial, the detection settings may be changed in the Setting > Preferences > Edentulous Fiducials tab.  
5. If the software has erroneously detected an object that is not an edentulous fiducial, click the "X" on the object's line and the line is erased.  
6. When this step is finished, the Go To Surgery button is selectable.

# 9.7.17Surgical Instruments Preparation Overview

When preparing a patient for surgery, complete the following step:

1. Select a patient on dynamic navigation system. Ensure the case has been planned.  
2. Ensure surgical suite is prepared for the patient.  
3. In the dynamic navigation system software, select what tools will be used for the case.  
4. Unpack dynamic navigation system instruments packet containing patterned parts.  
5. Calibrate the selected pieces.

- For dentate cases, calibrations can be done during surgical setup, prior to the patient being seated.  
- For edentulous cases, the patient tracker calibration must be performed while the patient is seated.

# 9.7.18Surgical Instruments Selection

The dynamic navigation system software allows the user to select what parts will be calibrated. The user may select a contra-angle handpiece, probe tool, and straight

handpiece. At a minimum, the user must select a handpiece. The workflow will adjust to allow for calibration of the selected items.

1. Click on "Tool Calibration." The workflow will expand (▶ Fig. 9.23).  
2. Click on the "Select Surgical Instruments" button in the workflow.  
3. Click on the surgical instruments that will be used during the patient surgery. The selected parts will be outlined in green. As the surgical instruments are selected, the workflow will expand to reflect the choices.  
4. Proceed to the calibration of the desired tool(s) by selecting its icon in the workflow.

# 9.7.19 Calibrate Contra-Angle Handpiece

Assemble the contra-angle handpiece using the wrench and handpiece tracker (Fig. 9.24).

# 9.7.19.1 Contra-Angle Handpiece Body Calibration

1. Click the Contra-Angle Handpiece Body Calibration icon in the workflow.  
2. Hold the tracker pattern and attachments approximately  $60 - 80\mathrm{cm}$  from the camera while keeping it entirely in the camera's field of view (FOV) (Fig. 9.25).  
3. Click the Start button.  
4. Hold the contra-angle handpiece such that the cylindrical and conical patterns are facing both of the cameras. Rotate the handpiece. The goal is for the cameras to view the tracker patterns from many different angles. If the handpiece is angled too much, the camera may be unable to locate both patterns, and the purple grid that is drawn on it disappears. The progress bar stops updating when this happens. Continue tilting and angling the handpiece until the progress bar reaches  $100\%$ . This should take approximately 10-15 seconds.

4. Click the Start button.  
5. Hold the contra-angle handpiece such that the calibration disk pattern is facing both of the cameras. Tilt and angle the tracker pattern inside the FOV while rotating the calibration disk using the drill motor at 10-25 RPM. The goal is for the cameras to view the handpiece pattern and the calibration disk pattern from many different angles. If the handpiece is angled too much, the camera is unable to locate the calibration disk pattern, and the purple grid that is drawn on it disappears. The progress bar stops updating when this happens. Continue tilting and angling the handpiece until the progress bar reaches  $100\%$ . This should take approximately 40-60 seconds.

# 9.7.20.1Surgery Preparation Procedure Overview

When preparing a dentate patient for surgery, complete the following steps:

1. Calibrate surgical instruments as previously described.  
2. Assemble fiducial clip and patient tracker.

3. Perform fiducial clip calibration.  
4. Perform presurgery calibration check.  
5. Prepare and attach fiducial clip to patient.  
6. Move cameras into position, and verify the patterns are tracking steadily.  
7. Perform system check.  
8. Perform navigation surgery.

Fig. 9.30 Patient tracker arm assembly

# 9.7.21 Choosing the Appropriate Patient Tracker Arm (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 9.29)

Optimal tracking is accomplished when the patient tracking cylinder is parallel with the plane of the navigation assembly (LEDs and cameras). Select the arm that most optimally follows this concept:

1. The universal tracker arm can be used in either arch and in any quadrant. This arm keeps the patient tracking cylinder parallel to the plan of occlusion of the arch on which the fiducial clip is placed.  
2. The right tracker arm has a bend that tilts the patient tracking cylinder toward the opposing arch when placed on the patient's right. It has a green piece to help identify it.  
3. The left tracker arm has a bend that tilts the patient tracking cylinder toward the opposing arch when placed on the patient's left. It has a blue piece to help identify it.

# 9.7.21.1 Patient Tracker Calibration

Patient Tracker Calibration - determines the geometric relationship between the patient tracker and the CT scan, which coordinates the patient anatomy.

1. Screw the patient tracker tightly into the end of tracker arm.  
2. Place the fiducial clip on the end of the patient tracker assembly.  
3. Using the dynamic navigation system screwdriver, screw the fastener tightly onto the fiducial clip (Fig. 9.30).

If multiple fiducial clips are detected in the patient's CT scan, each fiducial clip will appear in the workflow. The fiducial clips are numbered based on the tooth number they are placed on. Ensure the fiducial clip selected in the workflow is the fiducial clip being calibrated.

# 9.7.22Patient Tracker and Fiducial Clip Calibration

1. Place two fingers inside the patient tracker. Hold the tracker pattern and  
2. attachments approximately  $60 - 80\mathrm{cm}$  from the camera while keeping it entirely in the camera's field of view (FOV). Distance readings for the cameras should be between 60 and  $80~\mathrm{cm}$  on the screen.  
3. Click the Start button.  
4. Hold the patient tracker such that the three fiducials and the patient tracker calibration pattern are visible in both cameras. Tilt and angle the patient tracker within the FOV of both cameras while maintaining visibility of the fiducials and the patient tracker calibration pattern. Tilt and angle the patient tracker until the progress bar reaches  $100\%$  (40-60 seconds). If the progress bar reaches  $100\%$  too quickly, then remove any metal or other shiny surfaces from the FOV of the cameras, and recalibrate by clicking Start again.  
5. The calibration stops once the progress bar reaches  $100\%$ .  
6. A green " thumbs up" icon will appear to indicate a successful calibration. The calibration timestamp will appear in the lower corner of the screen.

# 9.7.23Drill Bit Confirmation

1. Select and insert the drill bit into the drill.  
2. Place the drill bit on the Go Plate, perpendicular (90 degrees) to the center target. Move the drill bit into the Surgi Zone FOV.  
3. The dynamic navigation system will take 3-5 seconds to verify the drill bit size.

If drill length registration fails, this is an indication that the handpiece chuck calibration may need to be executed again.

# 9.7.24Calibration Check

The purpose of the calibration check is to verify accuracy of the fiducial clip and drill calibrations prior to patient arrival. This check should be performed immediately after fiducial clip and drill calibrations are both complete (  $\square$  Fig. 9.31).

1. Ensure that the fiducial clip indicated in the Rx panel matches the physical fiducial clip being calibration checked.  
2. Register the drill bit length using the Go Plate.  
3. After the drill bit registration, touch each of the three fiducial spheres with the drill bit tip. Ensure

![](images/154f67faa9271581388eb6ef4459e442dde6f68c130d1d6b42243d59c3ff4a79.jpg)  
Fig. 9.31 Calibration check

both the patient tracker and the handpiece tracker are in the filed of view of the camera.

4. Ensure the distance measurement that appears on the screen is green while the drill tip is on the fiducial surface. The measurement on the screen indicates how far the drill tip is from the surface of the fiducial sphere. It is only present when the drill is near the fiducial clip.

- Green text indicates that the tracked location of the drill tip is on the surface of the fiducial sphere, within a  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  tolerance (Fig. 9.32).  
- Red text indicates that the drill tip is greater than  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  from the fiducial sphere. If while touching the drill tip to one of the fiducial spheres, the measurement on the screen remains red, then the calibration check fails. If the calibration check fails, see below for calibration check failure. If this stage passed, then this ensures that all calibrations are correct. Continue on to system check once the patient is in the operator (Fig. 9.33).

5. If the calibration check is not accurate, recalibrate both handpiece and patient tracker

# 9.7.25 Calibration Check Failure

If the calibration check failed, then perform both the handpiece and patient tracker calibrations again.

# 9.7.25.1 Implant Surgery with Dynamic Navigation System: Dentate

After all of the setup steps have been completed, then the Navigation Screen will be displayed by clicking the navigation icon on the top right corner of the screen.

Below is an overview of the steps to set up navigated surgery once the patient is present:

![](images/6f994e82f21a278b9c27c1c5d62e6d92bc7635ba1979243dd714df620d8ebca4.jpg)

Fig. 9.33 Red check indication

1. Check Parts - Ensure all parts are properly attached and the cameras are properly positioned.  
2. Drill Bit Confirmation - The drill bit length is calculated when the surgeon presses the drill bit on the Measurement plate.  
3. Perform System Check - System checks serve as a verification of the entire tracking system including but not limited to the fiducial clip or edentulous plate calibration, drill calibration, drill bit length estimation, fiducial clip placement, etc. This is achieved by performing a qualitative test where the user verifies that the tracked drill tip location is accurate and the handpiece movements match those of the virtual drill on the navigation screen.

A system check is required prior to surgery as well as every time the drill bit is changed during surgery.  
The system check can only be performed when the patient is present, and the fiducial clip or edentulous Clip is placed in the mouth for surgery. System checks ensure that the calibrated devices are correctly attached to the patient, as well as the calibrations themselves.

4. Perform navigation surgery.

# 9.7.25.2Performing Navigation Surgery in Dentate Patient

To perform guided navigation surgery, one has to understand the navigation screw views first. The top portion shows the drill position in various types of images and viewpoints. The bottom portion shows images from the stereo tracking cameras, overlaid with pertinent tracking information such as detected feature points and an RX panel.

The RX panel is a quick reference for the surgeon containing the following:

The Active Implant Number. The RX panel also allows for the selection of different implants in the case where multiple implants are planned.  
- Implant Specifications. These are the specifications made by the surgeon in the planning stage.  
- Depth Offset Adjustment. Used to adjust the depth of the implant along the long axis of the planned implant. If the implant is subsequently adjusted in the planning workflow, the platform depth offset will reset to 0.  
- Fiducial Clip Number. If multiple fiducial clips were placed in the jaw, then the RX panel allows for the selection of different fiducial clips.  
- Feedback messages, such as a prompt to perform a system check.

# 9.7.25.3 Understanding the 3D Target View

At the top of the 3D view, the drill depth is displayed to tenths of a millimeter. Next to it is the angular deviation of the drill bit axis from the planned implant axis, which is displayed to the tenths of a degree in numeric text. The implant timing is represented by a magenta line. During navigation, the virtual drill is also displayed in the 3D windows. It is displayed concurrently with the actual drill given its position and orientation (Fig. 9.34).

As the drill moves deeper, the depth indicator fills in a clockwise manner from an initial zero depth at 12:00 to a planned depth at 9:00. The planned depth corresponds to the length of the implant and is indicated by a thick green tic mark. The depth indicator is filled in like a circular progress bar, indicating the current drill depth with each tracker update.

At a distance of  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  before the planned depth (i.e., the implant length), the depth indicator fill changes from green to yellow in color. At any point beyond the planned depth, the depth indicator changes color to red, and an audible alert is sounded (Fig. 9.35).

# 9.7.25.4Surgery Preparation Procedure Overview for Edentulous Patients

When preparing an edentulous patient for surgery, complete the following steps. Detailed information for each of these steps is itemized in this chapter.

1. Calibrate surgical instruments as previously described.  
2. Prepare the patient for surgery.

3. Lay a flap to locate edentulous fiducials and expose the bone for edentulous plate placement.  
4. Attach edentulous clip to patient, and attach patient tracker to edentulous plate using tracker arm.  
5. Move camera into position and verify the patterns are tracking steadily.  
6. Touch edentulous fiducials with probe tool tip for software registration.  
7. Perform navigation surgery.

# 9.7.25.5 Patient Tracker and Edentulous Plate Assembly

1. After laying a soft tissue flap, place the edentulous plate on the end of the patient tracker arm without the patient tracker cylinder attached. This allows the surgeon to use the patient tracker arm as a handle during edentulous clip placement. Make sure the arm is in the correct orientation for future tracking.  
2. Using the dynamic navigation system screw driver, screw the screw fastener tightly onto the edentulous clip (Fig. 9.36).  
3. After the edentulous clip is fixated into position on the patient's jaw using the screws, the patient tracker will be firmly tightened in place.

![](images/d1f9acd4f291dd4a68ae9c8d0c25408abfe6bdf6ee0f5b97cdb8e5c34b7c6da2.jpg)

4. The patient is now ready for registration. The edentulous fiducial registration button is only activated after probe calibration is finished. Click on the Register Edentulous Fiducials icon, which is contained within the surgery workflow (Fig. 9.37).

![](images/17daec42e083e330ce7b0fe0e7dab2493cf844cc9192751609681566e337c988.jpg)

Fig. 9.38 Edentulous fiducial registration screen

5. Each previously marked fiducial will be present on the screen (  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 9.38).  
6. Click the line containing the fiducial of interest. The line will highlight in green. Place the probe into the center of the head of the screw, and hold the probe in the same orientation that the edentulous fiducial was originally drilled. After the surgeon is positioned, click Register Fiducial. Do not move the probe until prompted by the software.

7. Repeat step 10 for all edentulous fiducials in the list. If registration is outside of tolerances, the software will provide feedback.  
8. Once the edentulous fiducials have been registered, use the drill handpiece to perform a system check. The system check should include touching each edentulous fiducial to see that it is properly registered. The surgeon should also touch visible anatomic locations on the patient such as irregularities.

larities in the bone. The system is now ready for navigation.

9. The edentulous fiducials can be removed at any time after they are registered. They should be removed after the implants are placed.

# 9.7.25.6Performing Navigation Surgery in Edentulous Patient

Performing surgery in the edentulous patient is performed in the same fashion as in the edentate patient. The only difference is that the system check should include touching edentulous fiducials or anatomical locations on the patient such as bony irregularities.

# 9.7.25.7Postsurgery for All Patients

After navigation, the surgeon clicks the End Surgery button.

The software will prompt "Do you want to complete this surgery?" Accepting the prompt returns the user to the patient selection screen.

Make sure to remove edentulous fiducials, fiducial clip, and edentulous plates at the end of surgery.

# Conclusion

The natural progression from analog, 2D imaging, and diagnostics to digital, 3D imaging, and diagnostics has led to an increased understanding of the complex nature of implant surgery and prosthetics. The increased utilization of these digital 3D diagnostic modalities allows the surgical team to see the limitations of freehand surgery. CAS allows the implant team to overcome the limitations of human stereo vision and increase the accuracy and precision of implant placement. Dynamic navigation allows the surgeon to implement digital implant treatment plans in an efficient fashion. This efficiency and flexibility allow the team to utilize CAS on every implant in every patient. High-level statistical evidence clearly illustrates the improved accuracy and precision of CAS over freehand surgery.
