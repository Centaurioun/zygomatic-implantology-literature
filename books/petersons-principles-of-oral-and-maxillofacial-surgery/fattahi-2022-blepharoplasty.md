# 72.1 Introduction

Blepharoplasty, commonly referred to "eye lid lift," is a widely accepted and utilized aesthetic surgical procedure. According to a recent survey, blepharoplasty of upper and lower lids was the fourth most commonly performed cosmetic procedure in the United States in 2016, trailing body liposuction, breast enhancement, and rhinoplasty. [1] Contributing to its popularity is its relative ease of performance, ability to be done in an office setting with minimal anesthesia, and lack of a prolonged recovery period.

History of blepharoplasty to correct "lid disorders" dates all the way back to the first century A.D. in Rome when Aulus Cornelius Celsius described the excision of eye lid skin [2]. Since then, multiple refinements and modifications have been proposed.

Eyes are the "windows to the soul"; attractive eyes are one of the main features of an aesthetic and balanced face (Fig. 72.1) [3]. In order to achieve an excellent result, blepharoplasty of upper and lower lids demands a clear understanding of the appropriate preoperative diagnosis, regional anatomy, surgical execution, and management of any postoperative complications. Perhaps more important than the aforementioned concepts, it is paramount to remember that any cosmetic surgical procedure requires an appreciation of what the patient wants. Discrepancies between what the practitioner wants to treat and what the patient wants to have treated can lead to suboptimal results. Often times, patients will present to the clinician's office with a specific complaint regarding the appearance of the periorbital region. Based on the vast amount of information available on the Internet, most patients can be quite focused about their concerns. Considering the complex anatomy of the periorbital region, the clinician must formulate a clear diagnosis and treatment plan that corresponds to the patient's concerns. For example, a patient may not be satisfied with the appearance of upper eye lids and complain that she has difficulty applying makeup to the upper lids simply because they are so "sagging." This patient may present for what she perceives as an eye lid issue. Often times, however, these patients suffer from brow ptosis and actually need brow elevation in order to address the "sagging" eye lids (Fig. 72.2). Therefore, proper preoperative communi

cation and treatment planning is absolutely necessary in order to obtain satisfactory results and a happy patient. The purpose of this chapter is to familiarize the reader with commonly used nomenclature, surgical anatomy, patient selection, surgical execution, and potential complications associated with upper and lower lid blepharoplasty.

# 72.2 Nomenclature

As is common with many aesthetic procedures, multiple "phrases" and "terms" are used to describe the appearance of the upper and lower lids. This can sometimes lead to confusion for the novice surgeon. A list of commonly used diagnoses is as follows:

Dermatochalasis: This is a nonspecific term implying excess skin; this is applicable to any part of the facial skin, typically due to a weak bony foundation (hypoplastic infraorbital rim in case of lower lids), aging process, photoaging, genetics, and environmental causes (Fig. 72.3).

![](images/4b818abe5e911c8a660b415e9c395ef3400134604e4f1019c966479bb2559d4f.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 72.5 Patient with prolapsed fat pads of lower lids and dermatochalasia of all four lids

- Blepharochalasis: This is a more specific term implying an inflammatory component to redundant skin of the lids. This is often related to angioedema and episodic swelling and edema of the periorbital region.  
- Blepharoptosis: This acquired or congenital condition relates to drooling of upper lids. This is usually secondary to disinsertion of the levator palpebrae aponeurosis (LPS) from the upper tarsal plate (Fig. 72.4). This condition is different from brow ptosis, which often causes excess upper lid skin. Blepharoptosis can occur simultaneously with dermatochalasis and requires repair of LPS dysfunction.  
Pseudoptosis: This term should not be confused with blepharoptosis; this "ptosis," albeit not a true ptosis, is due to the appearance of "drooping" upper eye lid skin without any levator dysfunction. This is simply excessive, heavy lid skin causing a "drooping appearance." There is no indication for ptosis surgery in these patients. Pseudoptosis can also connote the appearance of an enophthalmic globe (due to the posterior displacement of the globe and inferior positioning of the upper lid).  
Prolapsed fat pads: Prominent lower lid fat pads or the medial fat pad of the upper lid can present as a "bulge" secondary to weakening of the orbital septum. The term "prolapsed" is more accurate than "herniated" since the septum is still intact, albeit weak, as opposed to a herniation where there is a distinct opening through which fat bulges (Fig. 72.5).

Hypertrophic orbicularis oculi: This is a distinct and hypertrophic portion of the pretarsal component of the orbicularis oculi in the lower lid. Although this can be considered aesthetic in many individuals, in some patients, this condition may exacerbate the "bulge" in the lower lid.  
Prolapsed lacrimal gland: This infrequent occurrence is due to the weakness of the septum of the upper lid, causing a unilateral or bilateral fullness in the lateral aspect of the upper lids due to the descent of the lacrimal gland.  
Lower lid malposition: This general term applies to any degree of abnormality associated with the lower lid. This could encompass frank ectropion, entropion, lower lid rounding or shortness, scleral show, and lateral canthal dystopia (Fig. 72.6).

# 72.3 Anatomy

Surgical anatomy of the eye lids is rather complex [4-10]. There are numerous structures in both upper and lower lids with similar functions, but different names (Fig. 72.7). Also, it is imperative to remember that at times, surgical alterations of the lid anatomy may involve alteration of the brow or midface structures as well; therefore, an understanding of the surgical anatomy of those particular areas is also helpful.

The most consistent method toward understanding the surgical anatomy of the upper and lower lids is to

![](images/9c16703095c3ff1a97b17ca9c2510d8358abdf0887fe91a3b60a68c9b994e8af.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 72.7 Anatomic details for upper and lower eye lids. (From Peterson, 3rd edition; Fig. 65.7)

divide each lid into three lamellae: anterior, middle, and posterior. Each lamella has several components which will be discussed individually.

Anterior lamella: Skin and orbicularis oculi  
Middle lamella: Orbital septum and orbital fat pads  
Posterior lamella: Lid retractors, suspensory system, tarsus, and conjunctiva

# 72.3.1 Anterior Lamella

The anterior lamella includes the eye lid skin and the orbicularis oculi muscle (Fig. 72.8). Upper and lower lid skins are the thinnest skin on the body; the average thickness of the epidermis complex in the adult lid is about 130 microns [11]. This thinness can be considered both an attribute and a disadvantage to the surgeon; while the lid skin is amenable to massaging following surgery if necessary, it is also quite susceptible to scarring if handled improperly during surgery.

A clinically significant region of the skin of the upper lid is the supratarsal crease. This crease (two distinct creases in many patients) is the point of attachment of the upper septum to the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. This crease is usually found about  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  cephalad to the upper lid margin. This crease may not be present in  $50\%$  of the patients of Asian descent. There are no well-defined creases in the lower lid in most patients; however, with age and exposure to the environment, lower lid creases/rhytids begin to develop just inferior to the lashes. These creases run in a medial to lateral direction and can be utilized for the placement of incision for a transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty.

The orbicularis oculi is a circular skeletal muscle encompassing the lids and adjacent tissues. The muscle is innervated by the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) and has two major components: palpebral and orbital. The palpebral portion is further subdivided into pretarsal and preseptal. The orbital portion (also known as the deep portion) originates from the superomedial and inferomedial orbital rim, the maxillary process of the frontal bone, the frontal process of maxilla, and the medial canthal tendon. The fibers sweep across the eyelids, onto the forehead, and the cheek regions, respectively. The orbital portion covers the corrugator supercilii muscle. This portion of the orbicularis oculi is rarely encountered during blepharoplasty.

The preseptal and pretarsal components of the palpebral portion of the muscle have voluntary and involuntary movements. The pretarsal portion is firmly attached to the tarsal plates; the preseptal component is anchored medially to the medical canthal tendon and laterally attach to the lateral canthal region. The palpebral components of the orbicularis oculi are responsible for the blink reflex and to move the marginal tear film toward the lacrimal puncta.

# 72.3.2 Middle Lamella

The middle lamella is composed of the orbital septum and the orbital fat pads (Fig. 72.9). The septum is essentially a fascial membrane separating the eyelids

![](images/6d3b73ae644a087ef45162229c3137d153ac3e45d27a900671ab97e0a52e64b9.jpg)

Fig. 72.8 Components of the anterior lamella. (From Peterson, 3rd edition; Fig. 65.8)

from the deeper orbital contents. The septum maintains the orbital fat pads on its posterior surface. In both lids, the septum originates from the arcus marginalis, the confluence of the periorbital periosteum and the periosteum of the facial bones. In the upper lid, the septum attaches to the levator aponeurosis, about  $2 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  above the superior edge of the tarsal plate; this fusion represents the clinically significant supratarsal crease. As previously mentioned, this crease may not be present in approximately  $50\%$  of the Asian population. In this group of patients, the septum attaches directly to the

superior aspect of the upper tarsus (Fig. 72.10). In the lower lid, the septum attaches directly on the inferior aspect of the tarsal plate. The orbital septums of the lower and upper lids actually meet each other medially just deep to the orbicularis oculi muscle around the posterior lacrimal crest. Laterally, the septum fuses with the lateral canthal tendon region.

Just deep to the septum, one finds the preaponeurotic orbital fat pads and the lacrimal gland (Fig. 72.11). In the upper lids, there are two fat pads: nasal and middle. The lacrimal gland occupies the space

laterally. These two fat pads separate the septum from the underlying levator aponeurosis. The tendon of the superior oblique muscle separates the central fat from the nasal fat compartment. In the lower lids, there are three fat pads: medial, central, and temporal. The medial fat pad is the most vascular; this is of clinical significance during fat removal in blepharoplasty in order to prevent postoperative retrobulbar bleed. The inferior oblique muscle separates the medial from the central fat pad (Fig. 72.12). The temporal fat pad may have

more than one component and includes a lateral extension known as the Eisler's fat pad.

# 72.3.3 Posterior Lamella

Lid retractors, suspensory system, tarsus, and the conjunctiva makeup the posterior lamella of the lids (Fig. 72.13). Lid retractors oppose the action of the orbicularis oculi. In the upper lid, the retractors include the levator aponeurosis (fascial condensation of the levator palpebrae aponeurosis, LPS) and the Müller's muscle. LPS is a parasympathetically innervated muscle (cranial nerve III), originating from the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone, travels superior to the superior rectus muscle, and becomes aponeurotic as it attaches to the lower  $2/3$  of the anterior surface of the upper tarsal plate. Müller's muscle is a sympathetically innervated (superior cervical chain) muscle originating from the inner surface of the LPS and inserting on the superior edge of the upper tarsal plate. Both muscles are elevators of the upper lid. In the lower lid, the lid retractors include the capsulopalpebral fascia and a lesser defined muscle known as the inferior tarsal or palpebral muscle, also known as the Horner's muscle. The capsulopalpebral fascia is an extension of the inferior rectus muscle attaching to the inferior edge of the lower tarsal plate.

Fig. 72.12 Inferior oblique muscle (arrow) separating the nasal and medial fat pads

The Horner's muscle is a portion of the deep head of the orbicularis oculi muscle. These two lower lid retractors are analogous to the levator aponeurosis of the LPS and Müller's muscle of the upper lid, respectively.

The two hammock-like suspensory systems of the upper and lower lids include the Whitnall's ligament and the Lockwood's ligament, respectively. They are also known as the superior and inferior transverse suspensory ligaments. They prevent the globe from cranio-caudal movement. Whitnall's ligament is a fascial condensation originating from the trochlea and attaching to the orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland. This ligament is found just superior to the LPS but deep to the septum. Lockwood's suspensory ligament is a fascial condensation of the Tenon's capsule (bulbar fascia) running between the medial orbital wall and attaching to the lateral retinaculum. Lockwood's suspensory system is just anterior to the capsulopalpebral fascia.

Tarsal plates provide the main skeletal support to the upper and lower lids. They are made of dense fibroelastic tissue lined with Meibomian glands. In the lower lid, the tarsal plate is only  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  in height; in the upper lid, the plate is  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  in height.

Conjunctiva makes up the last component of the posterior lamella. It lines the most inner aspect of the lids (palpebral conjunctiva), forms the fornix, then turns

onto the globe, and covers the anterior most aspect of the cornea (bulbar conjunctiva).

Although not specifically components of the posterior lamella, the lateral and medial canthi play a significant role in the transverse and spatial relationship of the lower land upper lids. Lateral and medial canthi are the lateral and medial fibrous extensions of the tarsal plates. Both canthi have two heads: superficial and deep (anterior and posterior). Anterior limb of the medial canthus and posterior limb of the lateral canthus are thicker than their counterpart. The two limbs of the medial canthal tendon cover the lacrimal sac; the two limbs of the lateral canthal tendon cover the Eisler's fat pad.

The lateral retinaculum (LR) is a clinically significant structure in the lateral orbital rim (Fig. 72.14) [12-14]. LR is essentially a labyrinth of connective tissue anchored within the lateral orbital rim that maintains the position, integrity, and function of the globe. It is attached to the Whitnalls' tubercle, a bony protuberance  $10\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the zygomaticofrontal suture and  $3\mathrm{mm}$  posterior (deep) to lateral orbital wall rim within the zygomatic bone. The following structures attach to the LR:

Lateral canthal tendon (posterior limb)  
Lateral horn of LPS aponeurosis  
- Lockwood's ligament of the lower lid  
- Check ligament of lateral rectus muscle

# 72.4 Innervation and Blood Supply

Sensory innervation of the eye lids is provided by the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal), specifically the first and second divisions (ophthalmic and maxillary). The lacrimal nerve travels in a superior and lateral direction providing sensation to the lacrimal gland, upper lid, and brow region. The frontal nerve divides into the supraorbital (centrally) and supratrochlear (medially) to provide sensation to the upper lid, mid brow, forehead, scalp, and nasal bridge. The nasociliary nerve gives off branches to provide sensation to the globe. The infraorbital nerve emerges from its foramen to provide sensation to the lower lid, mid cheek and upper lip, and anterior maxillary teeth. The zygomatic nerve divides into the zygomaticotemporal and zygomaticofacial nerves to provide sensation to the temple and lateral brow and lateral aspects of lower lid and cheek, respectively.

The blood supply to the eye lids is supplied by the internal and external carotid systems. The ophthalmic artery, facial artery, and infraorbital artery are the main arteries in this region. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid system and has multiple branches (supraorbital, supratrochlear, ethmoidal, marginal, and external nasal). The facial artery becomes the angular artery in the medial canthal region and anastomoses with the branches of the ophthalmic artery medial to the lacrimal sac. The infraorbital artery emerges from

the maxillary artery and supplies the lower lid region. There are the marginal and peripheral cascades (anastomoses between the internal and external carotid systems) within the lid proper responsible for the blood supply to the lashes and tarsus (marginal) and the conjunctiva and lid muscles (peripheral).

The venous system mirrors that of the arterial system, although deep anastomoses with the pterygoid plexus of veins and the superior ophthalmic vein exist, which may lead to vascular complications from injectables or lead to a retrograde infection from other sources.

# 72.5 Lacrimal System

The lacrimal system begins with the lacrimal gland sitting in the lacrimal fossa. Tears are produced in the gland and then travel in a lateral to medial direction toward the lacrimal puncta by the blink reflex. There are accessory lacrimal glands within the upper and lower fornices known as glands of Kraus and Wolfring. Tears enter the upper and lower canaliculi, approximately  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  away from the lacrimal sac. Both canaliculi have a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  vertical component before making a  $90^{\circ}$  turn to form the common canaliculus. The common canaliculus runs deep to the pretarsal orbicularis oculi to empty into the nasolacrimal duct, which then travels into the inferior meatus approximately  $15\mathrm{mm}$  from the nasal floor.

# 72.6 Patient Evaluation

Perhaps the most significant component of any aesthetic surgery is a thorough understanding of the patient's needs and desires. The surgeon must recognize the patient's complaint and then determine if the patient's expectations are realistic. Patients seeking blepharoplasty usually complain of "bags under the eyes," "excess skin in the upper lids," "always looking tired," "deceased vision laterally," and "inability to apply makeup to the upper lids." [15-17] It is important to establish the exact reason a patient is seeking to have surgery. This is facilitated by giving the patient a hand mirror and asking him or her to point to the areas of concern.

Once the chief complaint has been elicited, a complete medical history must be performed. Medical conditions such as thyroid disease, heart disease, liver dysfunction, bleeding disorders, and seasonal allergy and edema must be ruled out. Many of these conditions may interfere with the proper diagnosis and surgical execution of blepharoplasty. It is particularly important to determine if a patient has had LASIK surgery (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) in the past 6 months since the conjunctiva can become anesthetic following this procedure and mask symptoms associated with dry eyes.

Once the history has been completed, a step-by-step approach must be undertaken to evaluate the lids. With all aesthetic procedures, one must first gauge an overall view of the entire face before focusing on the specific area of concern. This overall image often times provides a tremendous amount of information about the aging process that can then be relayed to the patient during the evaluation of the face.

Following this overall assessment, the clinician must evaluate the position of the brows and forehead. If a patient appears to have dermatochalasis of the upper lids, one must ascertain that the dermatochalasis is not due to brow ptosis. Assessment of the upper lids can only be done properly with the brows in a neutral position. Performing an upper blepharoplasty in the presence of brow ptosis will only cause further descent of the brow and lead to an unaesthetic result. If the brow appears ptotic, the patient may need to have a brow elevation (endoscopic, open, browpexy, etc.) prior to upper blepharoplasty [18]. There are specific measurements for an ideal brow for males and females. Generally, there are three parts to an eye brow: medial, apex, and tail. In a male, all three regions should be aligned with the supraorbital rim. A masculine brow is one with little elevation in its apex or tail. On the other hand, a female brow should have a slight elevation medially (0–2 mm compared with the underlying supraorbital rim), elevate to 10mm at the apex (compared with the underlying supraorbital rim), and then slightly descend toward the tail aspect. A complete evaluation of the brow and forehead is described in another chapter in this book.

Next, attention should be directed toward the upper lids. Determination of the presence or absence of a supratarsal crease must be made. Typically, the supratarsal crease is about  $9 - 11\mathrm{mm}$  above the lid margin. This can be measured with a ruler while elevating the brow with one hand and asking the patient to look downward. If the supratarsal crease is significantly greater than  $9 - 11\mathrm{mm}$ , one must consider the possibility of levator disinsertion from the septum. With the brow kept in its normal position, excess upper lid skin must be pinched between two fingers to determine the amount of dermatochalasis. This can be subjectively graded from 0 to 3 with 3 being significant hooding where excess lid skin is sitting on top of the lashes to 0 being no redundant tissue (this grading system is not universally used). Assessment of the upper lid fat pads must also be done. Usually, one finds prolapsed medial fat pad in the upper lid, especially in an older patient. Another important consideration is the presence of lid ptosis (blepharoptosis) [7, 19]. This can be determined in two ways. First method is to measure the palpebral fissure. This is the distance between the central aspect of the upper lid to the central aspect of the lower lid with the patient gazing in a primary position. This width should be

![](images/48588ec07196baf4e4c76ef9a06906181aabb047333629f0d527680ba9388df6.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 72.16 Asking the patient to look up will accentuate the borders of the lower eye lid fat prolapse

almost  $10\mathrm{mm}$  bilaterally. A significant decrease in palpebral fissure height should raise the suspicion for upper lid ptosis. The other method is the margin reflex distance-1 (MRD-1). This is the distance between the light reflex in the patient's cornea to the central upper lid margin with the patient's eyes in the primary position of gaze. The upper lid usually covers  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of the superior limbus of the iris (Fig. 72.15). The normal MRD-1 is about  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$ ; a smaller number may indicate upper lid ptosis. The MRD-1 is more accurate than the palpebral fissure width since the latter can be altered by lower lid malposition (rounding, ectropion).

After the upper lid, focus should be directed at the lower lids. The presence of the fine rhytids just inferior to the lashes should be noted. Any excess skin in the lower lid subunit should be assessed. One can usually find prolapsed fat pads along the lower lids. The presence of prolapsed lower lid fat pads can be assessed by asking the patient to look upward or by gently pushing on the upper lids (while the eye is closed) to determine any lower lid "bulges" (Fig. 72.16). Hypertrophic orbicularis oculi muscle can be differentiated from a lower lid prolapsed fat pad by asking the patient to smile; animation of the muscles of facial expression

emphasizes hypertrophy of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Lower lid retraction can be assessed by measuring the distance from the inferior limbus to the central portion of the lower lid. Usually, the lower eye lid is at the level of the inferior limbus. Another method is the margin reflex distance-2 (MRD-2). MRD-2 is the distance from the light reflex of the cornea to the central aspect of the lower eye lid with the patient's eyes in primary gaze. This distance should be approximately  $5 - 5.5\mathrm{mm}$  [20]. This distance is increased in lower lid retraction.

Lower lid laxity should also be determined by the snap and distraction test (Fig. 72.17). The snap test is performed by pulling the lower lid downward and then releasing it to determine how quickly the lid "snaps"

back into place. This should occur in less than 1 second or with one or two blinks. The lid distraction test is performed by pulling the lid away from the globe in an anterior and inferior direction. If the lid is distracted more than  $7\mathrm{mm}$ , the lid is considered abnormally loose. If the snap or distraction tests are positive, the surgeon should consider a lid tightening procedure at the time of blepharoplasty in order to prevent postoperative lid malposition.

Consideration should also be given to the mid face region. If there is evidence of mid face ptosis (prominent nasolabial fold, nasojugal fold, etc.), the patient should be advised about other indicated procedures such as midface lift, fat repositioning, cheek implants, and dermal fillers.

Other components of the physical exam should include a visual acuity examination. If there is diminished vision due to excessive hooding of the upper lids, or due to other intrinsic globe issues, a formal visual field test by an ophthalmologist or optometrist should be done. Many times, insurance companies will require such a test prior to authorizing upper blepharoplasty. Extraocular movements should be recorded preoperatively to ensure full and unrestricted movement bilaterally. Bell's phenomenon should also be assessed to prevent corneal exposure and desiccation in case of a residual lagophthalmos following surgery. The patient is asked to close her/his eyes tightly; the clinician then opens the lid to assess position of the cornea. A normal Bell's phenomenon will roll the globe and cornea in an upward position upon forceful closure of the lids (Fig. 72.18).

If the patient has reported significant symptoms of dry eyes, a Schirmer test has been historically used to evaluate tear production and secretion. Newer tests that measure the amount of specific proteins in tears or can capture an image of minor lacrimal glands are now routinely used in place of a Schirmer test. After drying the

inferior fornix of the lower lid, a Schirmer strip is bent and inserted in the lateral aspect of the lower fornix. Room lights may need to be dimmed to prevent reflex blinking. A normal Schirmer test is  $15\mathrm{mm}$  of wetness on the strip after 5 minutes. Five to ten millimeter of wetness suggests hyposcretion, while less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  is highly indicative of dry eyes. If the Schirmer test is abnormal, further investigation is warranted. These patients will definitely require a very "conservative" blepharoplasty and may need frequent eye lubricants postoperatively.

A complete set of photographs is an absolute necessity in any aesthetic surgery. For blepharoplasty, frontal repose, frontal animated (smile), 3/4, profile, and a photo with the patient looking in an upward gaze are the minimum.

# 72.7 Surgical Procedures

Upper lid blepharoplasty is begun by marking the patient in the preoperative area [21-24]. The patient should be in a sitting position facing the surgeon. Most patients have a supratarsal crease. This crease can be used as the inferior aspect of the incision if the crease is in a normal position. The brow is elevated with the nondominant hand. A fine tipped marker is used to outline the crease. The incision is marked just above the superior punctum and extends laterally and fades into one of the crow's feet. It is important to maintain the incision within the eye lid subunit and not extend too far laterally. The upper portion of the incision is determined by pinching the excess upper lid skin by a fine blunt forceps until eye lashes began to evert (Fig. 72.19). This position is marked at its highest position. This will serve at the superior incision once it is connected medially and

laterally to the inferior incision. The basic shape of the incision is nearly an ellipse or oval (Fig. 72.20). While a skin/muscle flap can be elevated simultaneously, the easiest method of flap elevation is a skin only flap. This is done quite easily after administration of local anesthetic with a vasoconstrictor for hemostasis purposes. The skin flap is incised and undermined by iris scissors. Hemostasis is obtained by electrocautery. At this point, hypertrophic or ptotic orbicularis oculi can be excised cautiously from the superior aspect of the incision in order to avoid the LPS (Fig. 72.21). This will further expose the orbital septum which will need to be incised if preaponeurotic fat pads (usually the nasal fat pad) need to be removed. A transverse incision through the orbital septum will expose the underlying medial and central upper lid fat pads (Fig. 72.22). The prolapsed portion of the fat pads are then grasped with hemostats and cut with scissors, and electrocautery is applied to the cut edges of fat pads to ensure complete hemostasis before releasing the clamp and allowing the fat pads to retract posteriorly. Closure is not done until both sides are performed to ensure equal amount of skin, muscle, and fat resection. A slight lagophthalmos (about  $2\mathrm{mm}$ ) is

desirable at this point (Fig. 72.23). This resolves within a few days. Skin closure is with 6-0 sutures. If a supratarsal crease does not exist, then a skin-muscle flap can be elevated simultaneously. The inferior edge of the incision in this situation would be about  $9 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  above the lashes. A skin-muscle flap will allow creation of a new supratarsal crease by attaching the levator aponeurosis directly to the inferior edge of the incision.

For lower lid blepharoplasty, the first decision to be made is whether a transconjunctival or transcutaneous blepharoplasty is to be performed. If the patient has prolapsed lower fat without excess skin, then a transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty is indicated. Of note, it is also possible to "reposition" the fat in the nasojugal

area via a transconjunctival approach if needed. If, however, excess skin is present in the lower lid, then the surgeon has three choices: (1) transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty with removal of fat and skin, (2) a transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty to remove the fat with a skin tightening procedure at the same time or later time (i.e., chemical peel and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser resurfacing), and (3) a lower eye lid "pinch" blepharoplasty [25-33]. This decision must be made preoperatively and discussed with the patient at length. If a transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty is considered, a lid tightening procedure must be strongly considered at the same time to prevent postoperative lid malposition especially if the patient has preoperative lid laxity (i.e., positive snap or distraction tests and previous lower lid blepharoplasty).

For transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty, the patient is marked in the preoperative area by gently pushing on the globe or asking the patient to look up and determining the areas of prolapsed fat. These regions are marked with a marking pen. A transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty is performed by gentle

retraction of the globe with a globe retractor, followed by incising the palpebral conjunctiva and capsulopalpebral fascia with electrocautery (Fig. 72.24). The incision is about  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to lid margin. This will allow easy access into the three lower lid fat pads without disrupting the orbital septum. With gentle pressure on the globe, fat is easily protruded into the surgical field [34]. Each prolapsed fat pad is clamped with a hemostat, excess fat is trimmed, and electrocautery is used to cauterize the clamp prior to release in ensure hemostasis. It is prudent to ensure that no muscle is attached to the fat prior to resection. Both sides are then evaluated simultaneously to ensure equal removal of fat. The incision is closed with resorbable suture, and if a skin tightening procedure is to be done at the same time, the surgeon proceeds as appropriate.

A transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty is initiated with skin markings for the ideal incision. Preoperative markings for the location of prolapsed fat pads is done as described previously. The ideal location of a transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty incision is

Fig. 72.25 Placement of lower eye lid transcutaneous blepharoplasty. The incision is about  $4\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to lower lashes

one within  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of the lower lashes (Fig. 72.25). The incision is started medially just below the punctum and extends laterally. At the lateral canthal region, the incision should rise, following the upward curve of the lower lid and then gently descend and blend in with one of the crow's feet. A skin only flap is first elevated. Once the skin flap is retracted inferiorly, a muscle flap is blunted dissected and elevated in a step-like fashion. This step should decrease the incidence of lower lid retraction since the skin incision and muscle incision will not be at the same location. Once the muscle has been elevated, the orbital septum can be clearly seen. A transverse incision is made through the orbital septum, exposing the underlying fat pads. Each fat pad is approached individually. Excess fat is clamped and removed, and hemostasis is obtained as previously described. Once the fat has been removed, attention is directed toward the lateral aspect of the incision where the lateral most portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle flap (off the inferior aspect of the incision) is suspended to the lateral retinaculum with a 4-0 suture. This pexing of the muscle to the thick fascial condensation of the lateral orbital wall will significantly reduce the risk of lower lid malposition postoperatively [35]. Once this has been done, the inferior skin flap is grasped at its lateral edge, pulled cephalad, and excess skin is removed with scissors. Next, the muscle flap is closed, followed by closure of the skin incision using 6-0 sutures. If an upper blepharoplasty is being performed simultaneously, the upper lid incision can aid in suspending the lower lid (Fig. 72.26). Authors routinely use frost sutures or a formal tarsorrhaphy in any patient with preexisting lower lid laxity even after a formal canthopexy.

A "pinch" lower eye lid blepharoplasty is indicated in patients with no fat prolapse but with excess eye lid skin. This procedure begins with "pinching" the excess skin with fine forceps in a cephalad direction toward the lashes; then, the "rolled" lower eye lid skin is simply excised with the incision being placed  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  below the

lashes. There is no muscle or fat excision in this maneuver (Fig. 72.27). Closure of the skin incision is performed using 6-0 sutures.

# 72.8 Postoperative Care

Since upper and lower lid blepharoplasty is considered a "clean" surgical wound, perioperative antibiotic coverage for greater than 24 hours is not recommended. All patients should have ice cold compresses applied to the surgical site in the recovery room and for the first 48 hours postoperatively. No contact lenses should be worn for the first few days following surgery. Patients are instructed to avoid exercise and heavy lifting for the first 2 weeks postoperatively to decrease the chance of capillary tears and bruising. Ophthalmic steroid eye drops may be used to decrease chemosis. All non-resorbable sutures are removed in 5 days. Steri-strips can be used to support the incision if necessary (Fig. 72.28).

# 72.9 Complications and Management

There are minor and major complications associated with blepharoplasty [2, 7, 36-39]. Fortunately, the major problems are rare. Minor issues include chemosis, bruising, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and blurred vision. All of these issues are transient and will resolve within the first 7-14 days following surgery.

More major complications include those associated with aesthetics, lid position, and function of the eyes. Aesthetic complications involve persistence of orbital fat pads, excess or redundant skin, and asymmetry between the two sides. This can be prevented by precise preoperative assessment. The lateral fat pad of the lower lid is usually the most difficult pad to access. Most

under-resections are associated with this particular pad. Persistent excess skin postoperatively can be prevented by measuring the patient while the patient is sitting. When the patient lies supine, the brows raise; this can remove some of the dermatochalasis and lead to under-removal of excess skin. Asymmetries usually occur due to unequal removal of fat and skin from both sides. All fat and excised skin should be kept and labeled throughout the procedure to ensure equal amount of resection (assuming there were no asymmetries preoperatively). Asymmetries can also be due to the position of the supratarsal crease or incision. It is imperative to measure the distance between the lashes and the crease (incision) if any doubt exists regarding potential asymmetries between two sides.

Lid malposition can occur if excess skin was removed or if there was lid laxity preoperatively, or both. Following a conservative transcutaneous lower lid

blepharoplasty, a minor rounding (less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ) of the lower lid can occur without any adverse sequela. This is usually amenable to massage. However, if the rounding is greater, or if there is frank ectropion, this will need surgical repair in most cases. Although massage and taping of the lids can help, most patients will need a lid tightening procedure, mucosal graft for posterior lamella lengthening, tarsorrhaphy, or skin graft for anterior lamella lengthening. This is the main reason the author advocates pexing of the preseptal orbicularis muscle to the lateral retinaculum in every transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty along with a frost suture and/or tarsorrhaphy.

Dry eyes, or functional issues following blepharoplasty, are usually due to a preexisting condition or excessive skin resection leading to a persistent lagophthalmos or both. This requires application of artificial tears, taping of the lids, and massage. Referral to an ophthalmologist or oculoplastic surgeon may be warranted if the condition persists. Diplopia following blepharoplasty can occur if the superior oblique or the inferior oblique muscles are injured during surgery. Care must be taken during fat removal to ensure that all muscle and fascia has been removed from the fat pads prior to excision. Electrocautery near these muscles can also cause disturbances of vision. Persistent diplopia can be a serious problem and must be referred to an ophthalmologist.

Retrobulbar bleeds and blindness are the most serious complications of upper and lower blepharoplasty. Meticulous hemostasis is mandatory during surgery to decrease the chance of postoperative bleeding. Intense, unilateral pain, and progressive proptosis and tightness are hall marks of a retrobulbar bleed; this requires emergent attention by an inferior canthotomy and cantholysis to decrease the intraocular pressure and evacuate any clots. If this pressure is allowed to increase, optic nerve ischemia can occur, which will cause irreversible visual disturbance. The canthotomy and cantholysis should be kept open for 24-48 hours. Once the situation has been resolved, the lateral canthal tendon can be repaired.

# Conclusion

Upper and lower blepharoplasty is a commonly sought after and performed aesthetic procedure. Proper diagnosis, a firm understanding of the surgical anatomy, precise execution, and the appropriate and timely management of potential complications are imperative for any clinician offering this service to patients. If properly performed, results can be quite gratifying for the patient and the surgeon equally.
