# 26.1 Introduction

Nasal bones are the most frequently fractured bones of the face in the adult patient. Due to its location on the face, less force is required to fracture the nasal complex than any other facial bone [1-3]. Because of the frequency of injury, as well as complex topography and different components (bone, cartilage, mucosa, skin) of the nasal complex, appropriate management of the acutely injured nose is imperative in order to prevent adverse sequelae. It is interesting to note that despite the seemingly "simple" approach to the management of nasal bone fractures, the incident of unfavorable results can be as high as  $62\%$  [4-7].

The most common etiologic factors for blunt nasal trauma in the United States continue to be motor vehicle collision, interpersonal alterations, and sport-related injuries [8]. Mechanism of injury is certainly important in determining the nature of the deformity as will be discussed later. The purpose of this chapter is to review pertinent surgical anatomy, clinical and radiographic diagnostic tools, surgical management, and potential complications associated with nasal complex fractures.

# 26.2 Surgical Anatomy

The nasal complex is comprised of underlying nasal mucosa and turbinates, upper and lower cartilages, the cartilaginous and bony septum midline, and the paired nasal bones [9, 10]. The superficial musculoaponeurotic system of the face (SMAS) comprises the overlying soft tissue envelope of the nose and includes all of the perinasal musculature (Fig. 26.1). The paired nasal bones are located between the nasofrontal suture cephalically, and the upper lateral cartilages caudally. They are laterally bordered by the frontal processes of the maxillary bones. It is important to remember that the nasal bones overlap the cephalic portion of the upper lateral cartilages by  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 26.2). The nasal septum is comprised of cartilage (anteriorly) and the ethmoid and

$\square$  Fig. 26.1 Perinasal musculature overlying the bony and cartilaginous framework

vomer bones (posteriorly). The quadrangular portion of the nasal is the primary support mechanism of the nasal complex and is made of cartilage (Fig. 26.3). The cartilage is thick posteriorly along the junction with the vomer and ethmoid bones as well as along the maxillary crest. The vascular supply to the nasal complex is through the internal and external carotid systems via branches of the facial, superior labial, angular, sphenopalatine, ethmoidal, and superior ophthalmic arteries [11, 12]. Innervation to the nasal complex is primarily through the 2nd division (Maxillary) of the trigeminal nerve.

# 26.3 Clinical and Radiographic Diagnostic Tools

Examination of a patient with nasal trauma is no different than any other acutely injured person. Lifethreatening and major organ injuries are addressed primarily prior to the secondary evaluation of the maxillofacial region. Imperative to the examination of the nose is obtaining a complete history. The mechanism of injury and timing of the event are important since they may assist in predicting a specific type of fracture or injury. For example, if the vector of force contacting the

![](images/9802aa99b144edaf7196a0c79af0b93b49b44c3694ffce69093b990b3760f7ad.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 26.2 Cartilaginous and bony framework of the nasal complex

![](images/f0c041f8d41c19af29f44a3cf247978a28fc6c625a3077bbeef7dea75a9d7c2e.jpg)

nose is directly perpendicular to the nasal dorsum, then it is predictable that the bony complex is typically fractured in a lateral (outward) direction. On the other hand, if the force is directed laterally to the nose (a right-handed punch to the left side of the nose), the nasal complex will then deviate away from the vector of force with one nasal bone being medially displaced, while the other one will be laterally displaced. Also, acknowledgement of any previous nasal trauma and presence of pre-existing nasal deviation is important in determining whether a patient may require surgical intervention. Access to pre-injury photographs is always quite helpful.

Examination of the nasal complex is done by performing a detailed internal and external evaluation of the nose. All patients with nasal complex trauma will have epistaxis (Fig. 26.4). Observation of the facial

region may reveal clinical signs of underlying fractures such as peri-orbital ecchymosis, nasal swelling, nasal complex deviation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, and lack of nasal projection. Increased intercanthal distance should be noted if present. Difficulty smelling (anosmia) is a late finding following nasal complex trauma and usually occurs if the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone is involved. Palpation of the nose may reveal mobility or crepitus indicative of fracture. Internal examination with good lighting, nasal speculum, and suction is imperative to determine the presence of intranasal lacerations, septal deviations off the nasal crest of the maxilla, and the possibility of a nasal septal hematoma. Septal hematoma must be drained in order to prevent late vascular complications associated with a devitalized cartilage predisposing to the development of a septal perforation. If a skull base fracture involving

Fig. 26.3 Cartilaginous and bony septum

the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone is suspected, a simple double halo test can be done at the bedside to ascertain the presence of CSF.

Today, the standard of care for maxillofacial trauma imaging is computed tomography (CT scan) without contrast (Fig. 26.5) [13-15]. Nasal bone injuries and septal deviations and/or fractures are clearly delineated via CT scan. Although plain nasal radiographs are still utilized in some institutions, their value is limited. As previously stated, photographs of the acutely injured nose as well as pre-morbid photos obtained from the patient or family are helpful for documentation purposes as well as for pre- and postoperative comparison purposes.

There are several different classification systems for nasal complex fractures [4, 16-18]. Unfortunately, no one system is universally accepted. Perhaps the most relevant and accepted classification system is one describing the clinical and radiographic findings: open vs. closed, deviated vs. non-deviated, comminuted vs. non-comminuted. Open vs. closed denotes the existence of open fracture through an external or internal laceration. Deviated vs. non-deviated refers to the appearance of

nasal bones and septum. It is important to determine the status of the septum since failure to address this important structure will increase the potential for secondary posttraumatic rhinoplasty. Comminuted vs. non-comminuted refers to the status of the nasal bones and the surrounding bony pyramid (frontal process of maxilla, anterior nasal spine, ethmoidal bones).

# Definitions

Open vs. closed nasal fractures denote the existence of open fracture through an external or internal laceration.

Deviated vs. non-deviated nasal fractures refers to the appearance of nasal bones and septum.

Comminuted vs. non-comminuted nasal fractures refers to the status of the nasal bones and the surrounding bony pyramid (frontal process of maxilla, anterior nasal spine, ethmoidal bones).

# Importance

Thorough and appropriate clinical examination is imperative in order to avoid overlooking potentially devastating injuries, such as a septal hematoma. An untreated septal hematoma can lead to septal perforation and possibly a saddle nose deformity.

# Tips and Tricks

Nasal complex fractures can generally be diagnosed by clinical exam alone, however, CT scans are beneficial in evaluating the extent of injury (comminution) and status of the nasal septum.

# 26.4 Surgical Management

The goals of management of nasal bony injuries is to prevent development of a posttraumatic nasal deformity, restoration of proper nasal airflow, prevention of cosmetic deformity, and maintenance of proper nasal complex topography and projection [19-21]. Restoration of the sense of smell is also important although anosmia may occur following high impact nasal and naso-orbita-ethmoidal injuries (covered in more detail in  $\triangleright$  Chap. 25). Repair of nasal bone injuries can be done under local anesthesia, conscious sedation, or general anesthesia [22-24]. However, the most efficient method, and perhaps the most comfortable route, is to perform the repair under general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Closed-reduction of the nasal complex is still the most commonly performed maneuver for repair of the injured bony nose; however, the incidence of patients

requiring a posttraumatic rhinoplasty following closed reduction can range between  $9 - 62\%$  [4, 25-27].

After the patient is intubated, a thorough manual examination of the nasal complex must be done. Crepitus, mobility, bony depressions, and asymmetries must be assessed and accounted for. The presence and/ or absence of peri-nasal lacerations must also be confirmed. Intranasal exam is performed next. This can be accomplished via endoscopy or using a nasal speculum

and good lighting. Once the examination is completed, the nasal cavity is injected with a local anesthetic and a vasoconstrictor. The nasal cavity is then packed with cottonoid strips soaked in a vasoconstrictive solution. After waiting 10-15 minutes, the nasal cavity is examined again. The vasoconstriction significantly improves intranasal visualization. Using appropriate nasal reduction forceps, the nasal bones and the septum must be reduced in the appropriate vector (Fig. 26.6). The

reduction must be maintained via intranasal packings and/or splints. If conventional methods to repair the nasal complex are not successful, the threshold for performing more extensive procedures such septoplasty (with or without harvest of cartilage) and bony osteotomies in the acute setting in order to "straighten" the nasal complex should be rather low [8, 28-31]. The septum can be approached through a hemi-transfixion incision and can simply be scored on its convex side in order to remove deviations. Although deviated septal cartilage can be removed at this time, it is more prudent to maintain all septal cartilage at the time of the initial repair in case a posttraumatic nasal deformity develops at which point cartilage grafts from the septum becomes a rather important reconstructive tool. If the nasal septum continues to deviate off of the anterior nasal spine (ANS), subperichondrial and subperiosteal dissections must be performed in the region of the ANS; the septum must be then manually separated from the ANS and then reattached to it using sutures. This will ensure a midline caudal septum.

Bony vault deviation involving the nasal bones that cannot be reduced via closed reduction may require an open reduction or osteotomies. Time interval from the initial injury to the time of repair (longer than 10-14 days) may impede closed reduction of nasal bones since the adult nasal bone will begin to form a callus after this period of time and may no longer be easily manipulated. Delay in the initial treatment of the acutely injured nose may require open reduction and bony osteotomies. In this situation, a trans-oral approach to the naso-maxillary buttresses, frontal processes of the maxilla, and the nasal bones may facilitate an open reduction with, or without internal fixation. Endonasal or percutaneous lateral osteotomies to mobilize the bony nose can also be performed [32, 33]. Lateral nasal osteotomy is a powerful maneuver in order to straighten the bony nasal vault. Again, consideration should be given to intranasal packing in order to maintain the mobilized bony segments. The use of external splints also aids in the elimination of dead space and maintenance of reduction (Fig. 26.7). Approaching the nasal bones through existing peri-nasal lacerations is also an acceptable approach. Open reduction with or without fixation

Fig. 26.7 Nasal splint applied at the completion of reduction

can be directly performed via this method and can be quite effective (Fig. 26.8).

# Key Points

Delayed nasal fracture repair may require open reduction and/or osteotomies in order to appropriately reduce and reposition the fractured segments

Care must be taken to maintain septal cartilage, as this plays a vital role in secondary nasal reconstruction if needed.

# 26.5 Postoperative Care and Complications

Consideration should be given to the use of perioperative antibiotics when addressing nasal trauma and repair. Extended antibiotic use has been encouraged especially when internal nasal packings have been used in order to decrease the remote possibility of toxic shock syndrome or an acute obstructive sinusitis. Although there are no specific guidelines, external dressings and splints are removed within the first week and if necessary, a new splint is applied. Patients are instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity to decrease the possibility of epistaxis. Sinus precautions are also encouraged.

It is interesting to note that the incidence for a residual nasal deformity following closed reduction of nasal

fractures can be up to  $62\%$ , although several studies have confirmed much better results [4, 19]. It is therefore imperative to follow the patient's progress in order to ensure that an acceptable functional and cosmetic outcome has been obtained. It is generally prudent to wait up to a year prior to addressing a residual posttraumatic

deformity although it is the author's opinion that a grossly deviated nose at one month following repair of nasal complex fracture will remain a grossly deviated nose at one year after surgery; therefore, in specific cases, earlier intervention via a posttraumatic rhinoplasty is warranted and certainly indicated (Fig. 26.9).

# Conclusion

Nasal bones are the most frequently fractured bones of the face in the adult patient. The most common etiologic factors in the United States are motor vehicle collisions, interpersonal violence, and sport-related injuries. The prominence of the nasal bones and architecture lends itself to a higher propensity to injury, and also requires less force to lead to bony fractures. The nasal complex contains many components (bone, cartilage, mucosa, and skin), therefore knowledge of these structures and the appropriate management is essential. The most common modality for the treatment of acute nasal complex fractures is closed reduction, with open reduction being reserved for more complex/difficult fractures and those with overlying lacerations. Despite the seemingly "simple" approach to the management of nasal bone fractures, the incident of unfavorable results can be as high as  $62\%$ . Revision rhinoplasty may be warranted in those patients with unsuccessful primary repair of nasal complex fractures.
