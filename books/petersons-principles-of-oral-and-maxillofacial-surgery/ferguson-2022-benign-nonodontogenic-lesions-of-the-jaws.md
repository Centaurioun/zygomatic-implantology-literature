# Introduction

Benign nonodontogenic tumors are common entities and on occasion present some difficulty in classification. The most common group of lesions, the cemento-osseous dysplasias, are typically associated with erupted teeth and multiple jaw quadrants may be involved. Fibrous dysplasias and associated skin pigmentation and endocrinopathies allow more precise diagnosis via the study of gene alterations and mutations. Discussion of nonodontogenic cysts features appearance, incidence, behavior and management. The vascular malformations and treatment options allow a deep discussion of these treatment options as does the discussion related to histocytosis.

# Learning Aims

The participant will be exposed to the clinical pathologic entities that are of nonodontogenic tumors in origins, but can be surgically remedied but may recur. These lesions are not limited to the craniofacial complex. Potential for facial disfigurement/malocclusion and affectation of the jaw's bony contours can also modify prosthetic and reconstructive options

# Importance

# Benign Fibro-Osseous Disease

Common entity seen is replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and varying amounts of mineralized tissue. Fibrous dysplasia classic involvement with single or multiple bones are discussed as well as skin pigmentation and endocrinopathy and possible malignant transformation. Also, there was an in-depth presentation of the commonly occurring cemento-osseous dysplasia.

# Fibro-Osseous Neoplasms

Radiographically associated with radiolucency/radiopacity and concepts of surgical remedy. The discussion of a conservative versus aggressive management as well as possible pediatric population involvement was documented.

# Chaondromantosis

Both synovial and osteochondroma with involvement with the temporomandibular joint articulation and treatment considerations are discussed.

# Giant Cell Liaisons

The differentiations and treatment options and ability to cure along with discussion of hyperparathyroidism are undertaken.

# Vascular Malformations

Diagnostic and treatment options are presented. The concept of low-flow versus high-flow lesions and embolization strategies are discussed.

# Nonodontongenic Cysts of the Jaw

Classification/discussion occurred and the temporal concept of: if the globulomaxillary-nasolabial/median mandibular cysts are true entities. A discussion of nasopalatine and traumatic bone cysts was documented additionally.

# Neurogenic Tumors

In particular, a discussion of traumatic neuroma diagnosis and treatment with mention of imaging/surgical management strategies was introduced.

# Conclusion

Benign nonodontogenic tumors of the jaws are a heterogeneous group of benign tumors, but a malignant transformation is uncommon. These lesions may occur in the maxilla-mandibular complex but also in the craniofacial complex. These lesions while in tooth-bearing areas of the jaws may develop from epithelium and or mesenchyme. These lesions treatment may range from observational to resective.

Benign nonodontogenic lesions of the jaws represent a mixed group of tumors, which in many cases are difficult to classify. Interestingly, there are some lesions within this group that seem to occur only in the jaws, and although they do not contain any histologic or immunohistochemical evidence of odontogenic structures, the mere fact that they occur only in the jaws may mean that they are in fact related to the odontogenic apparatus. The subjects discussed in this chapter are fibro-osseous disease, osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma, aggressive mesenchymal tumors of childhood, benign tumors of bone-forming cells, synovial chondromatosis and osteochondroma, lesions containing giant cells, vascular malformations, Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, nonodontogenic cysts of the jaws, neurogenic tumors, Paget's disease, massive osteolysis (Gorham's disease), and tori.

# 32.1 Benign Fibro-Osseous Disease

Differences remain in the classification and diagnosis of fibro-osseous disease [1]. The general consensus is that the common entity for all of the lesions is the replacement of normal bone with a tissue composed of collagen fibers and fibroblasts that contain varying amounts of mineralized substance, which can be either osteoid or cementoid tissue. It is difficult to differentiate conclusively between bone and cementum with light microsurgery; thus, histologic information alone may be inadequate for a diagnosis [2].

For the purposes of this chapter, the term fibrosseous disease is taken to include the following groups of lesions: fibrous dysplasia, cemento-osseous dysplasia, and fibrosseous neoplasms.

# 32.1.1 Fibrous Dysplasia

Fibrous dysplasia is considered to be a developmental hamartomatous fibro-osseous disease of unknown etiology.

FD is a benign localized intramedullary proliferation of woven trabecular bone admixed with fibrous tissue. It may represent developmental arrest in a benign fibrosseous proliferation that lacks the ability to fully differentiate [3] Somatic mutation occurring in the gene coding for the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein GS in the guanine nucleotide-binding alpha stimulating (GNAS) has been proposed to cause monostotic and polyostotic conditions and McCune-Albright syndrome [4, 5]. The mutation results in defective osteoblastic differentiation.

Fibrous dysplasia is subdivided into four different forms:

1. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia affecting only one bone.  
2. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia affecting multiple bones.  
3. McCune-Albright syndrome in which multiple lesions are associated with hyperpigmentation and endocrine disturbances, predominantly precocious puberty and/or hyperthyroidism [6].  
4. Craniofacial fibrous dysplasia confined to bones of the craniofacial complex.

Any bone in the body may be affected. In the head and neck, the facial and skull bones are affected in  $10 - 20\%$  of cases of monostotic disease and  $50\%$  of polyostotic disease; thus, the jaws are commonly associated with all forms of fibrous dysplasia. In the jaws, the onset is usually during the first and second decades, and it produces painless swelling of the involved bones (Fig. 32.1). Classically, the radiographic appearance shows a ground-glass opacity without clearly defined borders (Fig. 32.2). In its craniofacial form, the maxilla, zygoma, sphenoid, frontal bones, nasal bones, and base of the skull can be involved. Temporal bone involvement may show (i) progressive hearing loss, (ii) temporal bone enlargement with progressive bony occlusion of the external auditory meatus, and (iii) constriction of the ear canal possibly resulting in the development of an epidermoid cyst likened to cholesteatoma [141]. Expansion can cause compression of nerves and blood vessels.

The optic canal can be narrowed by fibrous dysplasia, although it seems unlikely that any associated vision loss can be relieved by orbital decompression [7]. The maxilla appears to be affected more often than the mandible, and females are affected more commonly than males. Typically, lesions undergo periods of activity and periods of quiescence. When they are active, they are often symptomatic in that the patient may perceive a throbbing or discomfort, the swelling increases, and the lesions appear hot on a bone scan

(  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 32.3) and can, in fact, mimic osteomyelitis [8-12]. In a quiescent phase, they may be totally asymptomatic. Teeth can be displaced by the lesion  
(  $\square$  Fig. 32.4). Familial cases of fibrous dysplasia have been noted [13].

The lesions of fibrous dysplasia may be under hormonal control, particularly in McCune-Albright syndrome, and cases of increased activity and reactivation during pregnancy have been noted [14, 15]. Although not normally recognized as a premalignant lesion, sarcomatous change(osteogenic sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma) has been noted in fibrous dysplasia [16]. Early cases appear to have been associated with the use of radiation therapy for treatment [17, 18], but cases of spontaneous sarcomatous degeneration have been noted [19]. In addition, some cases have been difficult to diagnose and may have represented a low-grade osteosarcoma from the outset [20-22].

![](images/da1ccee4f52163be25ec8e06f7ed358176a23ca8837092673a4c16d221eaf7a1.jpg)  
Fig. 32.4 Teeth displaced by lesions of fibrous dysplasia

Classically, fibrous dysplasia appears to be a lesion that "burns itself out" when the patient is in the late teens or early 20s, although cases of active fibrous dysplasia have been noted much later than this.

Treatment is generally symptomatic and conservative; if the lesions are asymptomatic, a biopsy diagnosis alone may be adequate without carrying out any definitive treatment. Medical treatment with bisphosphonates is often used in an attempt to slow bone turnover [23]. Surgical treatment should be limited during an active phase because the lesions are vascular and can bleed quite profusely. Treatment is best reserved for quiescent periods, at which time, cosmetic recontouring to restore normal configuration is the treatment of choice. Regrowth, however, can be expected after this treatment in  $25 - 50\%$  of cases, particularly if undertaken at a young age. Some investigators have suggested more aggressive surgical procedures including mandibular and maxillary resections [24, 25].

# 32.1.2Cemento-Osseous Dysplasia

The cemento-osseous dysplasias represent a pathologic process of the tooth-bearing areas and probably represent the most common manifestation of fibro-osseous disease. However, because they are frequently asymptomatic and require no treatment, they are less of a diagnostic and clinical dilemma than are the other forms of fibro-osseous disease. In this condition, there is a disordered production of bone and cementum-like tissue in the jaws. The three forms include periapical, focal, and florid osseous dysplasias, and familial gigantiform cementoma, which are probably variants of the same pathologic process but which can be differentiated by clinical and radiographic features. The etiology of these lesions remains in doubt, but local trauma may play some part, even such benign trauma as abnormal occlusal forces. A predominance of cases occurs in females

and particularly in African Americans and Asians [25]. It is suspected that the periodontal ligament may be the origin of the fibrous tissue found in the cemento-osseous dysplasias. Histologically, the three types of cemento-osseous dysplasia are indistinguishable, showing new woven bone trabeculae and/or spherules of cementum-like material, which often blend into the cortical bone. A fibrous tissue stroma is present. There is very little inflammatory component. Traumatic bone cysts have been reported in conjunction with this lesion [26].

# 32.1.2.1 Periapical Cimento-Osseous Dysplasia

Periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia presents as asymptomatic circumscribed lesions that form around the apex of vital teeth with the anterior mandible being most commonly involved. African American females are predominantly affected. Radiographically, the lesions can be radiolucent, mixed density, or radiopaque, and depending on their stage of development, no tooth mobility nor bony expansion is typically seen (Fig. 32.5). Studies indicate that they may occur in approximately  $6\%$  of African American females [27].

# 32.1.2.2Focal Cimento-Osseous Dysplasia

Lesions of focal cemento-osseous dysplasia have a predilection for middle-aged African American females and present as nonexpansile radiolucencies with associated opacities, often in edentulous areas of the mandible. It represents an incomplete form of florid cemento-osseous dysplasia. They frequently occur in sites of previous dental extractions and may represent some type of abnormal healing after dental extraction. Because they are usually asymptomatic, cases are often noted on routine panoramic radiographs. They are normally well-circumscribed and rarely exceed  $2\mathrm{cm}$ . Differentiation from ossifying fibroma may be difficult [28].

# 32.1.2.3 Florid Cimento-Osseous Dysplasia

Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia has a predilection for middle-aged African American females and presents as

Fig. 32.6 Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia of the mandible in a 49-year-old African American woman. All associated teeth are vital

a painless nonexpansile lesion often involving two or more jaw quadrants. Radiographically, it appears as multiple confluent lobular radiopaque masses in tooth-bearing areas (Fig. 32.6). Radiodensity tends to increase with time. Lesions may be associated with superimposed infection and osteomyelitis and have also been associated with idiopathic bone cysts [29]. Histologically, they have an unencapsulated proliferation of cellular fibrous tissue with trabeculae or woven bone and calcification, essentially, dysmorphic bone-cementum complexes. More mature lesions may become acellular and avascular with coalescent sclerotic bone masses. Although common in African Americans, florid cemento-osseous dysplasia has been noted in all racial groups. Many patients are partially or totally edentulous when the condition is first discovered. Jaw expansion is not usually a feature except with familial gigantiform cementoma or of limited degree. It has been suggested that chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis may represent a variant of this condition, but it probably represents a different condition, inflammatory in nature. The differences between the two conditions have been noted and described [9, 30, 31]. However, the role of bacteria in chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis has proved elusive, and in general, even authorities who strongly support an infectious origin have had difficulty isolating organisms [32, 33].

# 32.1.3Familial Gigantiform Cementoma

Familial gigantiform cementoma represents an autosomal dominant variant of osseous dysplasia usually involving multiple quadrants with variably expansile lesions, often in the anterior mandible [34]. This particular form of osseous dysplasia has no racial predilection. The lesions often evolve during childhood and can grow rapidly. Treatment is usually surgical

and symptomatic and is limited to cosmetic recontouring.

# 32.1.4Fibro-Osseous Neoplasms

# 32.1.4.1Ossifying Fibroma

Ossifying fibroma (cemento-ossifying fibroma) usually presents as a well-demarcated mixed radiolucency/radiopacity with smooth and often sclerotic borders (Fig. 32.7) [37-39]. The lesions are usually solitary and most commonly occur in the mandible. Histologically, they contain a relatively avascular cellular fibrous stroma with reticular bone trabeculae and cementum-like spherules [81, 82]. Most authorities now feel comfortable clearly differentiating this lesion from fibrous dysplasia.

Chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in an ossifying fibroma and a cementifying fibroma [35, 36]. The ossifying fibroma is believed to be a true neoplasm and occurs at a later age than does fibrous dysplasia, being most common later in the third and early in the fourth decades. Ossifying fibroma appears to be confined to the jaws and craniofacial complex, although similar lesions have been reported in the long bones:(tibia). There is a female predominance but no racial predominance, and growth rates are variable. Derived from mesenchymal stem cells, however cellular origin may be from bone vs cementum [142]. Because it is believed to be a neoplasm, the treatment is surgical; in fact, the lesions often shell out easily at surgery, although there is a recurrence rate that has variously been reported from  $1\%$  to  $63\%$  [40-42]. For these reasons, some authorities recommend aggressive treatment for more aggressive lesions, including aggressive curettage, localized surgical resection, and segmental mandibular resection [43, 44]. When present in the craniofacial complex, treatment may have to be more aggressive to protect the vital structures [45].

# 32.1.4.2 Juvenile Aggressive Ossifying Fibroma

Juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma was first described in 1952 as a variant of ossifying fibroma [46]. The lesions classically occur in younger children and adolescents and present with an aggressive behavior, but they have been noted in older patients and are not always particularly aggressive. The World Health Organization defines juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma as "an actively growing lesion mainly affecting individuals below the age of 15 years, which is composed of a cell-lich fibrous tissue containing bands of cellular osteoid without osteoblastic rimming together with trabeculae of more typical woven bone, and the stroma reveals numerous small rounded mineralized collagenous ossicles and immature osteoid. Small foci of giant cells may be present, and in some parts, there may be abundant osteoclasts related to the woven bone. Usually, no fibrous capsule can be demonstrated, but the lesion is well demarcated from the surrounding bone." [47] Two variants have been described: trabecular and psammomatous. The trabecular variant usually occurs in childhood, with a slight maxillary predominance, and may contain clustered multinuclear giant cells. The psammomatous variant can occur in adults and adolescents and often affects the orbit and paranasal tissues; frequently, it contains a whorled pattern of closely packed spherical ossicles and a myxoid component with aneurysmal bone cyst-like areas.

Although believed to be more aggressive than the more common ossifying fibroma that is found at a later age, this condition is not considered to necessitate truly aggressive surgery. Conservative excision is still the recommended treatment, although lesions involving the craniofacial structures may require more extensive surgery. Recurrence rates of between up to  $60\%$  with incomplete removal have been reported, and recurrences may be more common in younger patients [1].

# 32.2 Osteoblastoma and Osteoid Osteoma

Osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma are generally believed to be variants of the same lesion and are related to fibrousseous disease. Cementoblastoma and gigantiform cementoma are the equivalent cemental lesions and are associated with teeth. The alternative name for the osteoblastoma is giant osteoid osteoma, and it is generally believed to represent a larger version of the osteoid osteoma. Both are benign processes and are thought to represent true neoplasms. The osteoblastoma occurs primarily in the vertebrae and long bones. In the head and neck, the most common site of involvement is the jaws, followed by the cervical vertebrae and the skull

[48-51]. Clinically, it often grows rapidly and the predominant clinical feature is pain, which is generally localized to the lesion itself. Although believed to be a true neoplasm, there have been reports of regression after biopsy or incomplete removal, which could point to it being a reactive process of some kind [52]. Most cases of osteoblastoma occur in the second decade of life; they rarely occur after age 30 years. Males appear to be affected more commonly than females. In the head and neck, the body of the mandible is the most common site.

Radiographic features are variable, usually consisting of a combination of radiolucency and radiopacity (Fig. 32.8). The designation osteoblastoma is normally reserved for lesions greater than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter. They are well-circumscribed radiographically with a thin radiolucency surrounding the variably calcified contents. A sunray pattern of new bone formation similar to that described in malignant bone tumors may be evident.

The histologic appearance shows irregular trabeculae of osteoid and immature bone within a predominantly vascular stromal network. There are various degrees of calcification present. Stromal cells are generally small and slender. Differentiation must be made from the ossifying fibroma, fibrous dysplasia, and osteosarcoma.

Treatment of the osteoblastoma is generally confined to conservative surgical excision with either curettage or local excision. Recurrences are rare but have been reported and may necessitate more aggressive treatment such as en bloc resection [53]. Rare examples of malignant transformation have been reported [54, 55], but some of these may be related to an incorrect initial diagnosis [51].

The osteoid osteoma represents a smaller version of the osteoblastoma and is thought to be a true neoplasm. It is normally less than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter clinically and radio-graphically. It again occurs in the second and third decades of life with a male predominance. Pain is again the major clinical feature. Classically, the pain is nocturnal and is relieved by salicylates. If the lesion is located near the cortex, it may produce a localized tender swelling. Radiographically, the lesion again shows a well-defined mixed radiolucency/radiopacity with a small radiolucent rim around the lesion, which is walled by sclerotic bone. Histologically, it resembles the osteoblastoma with a rich vascular stroma with trabeculae of osteoid and immature bone. The bone is rimmed by layers of active osteoblasts. Histologically, it is impossible to differentiate it from the osteoblastoma. Treatment is again conservative surgical excision. Spontaneous regression has also been reported clinically.

# 32.3 Chondroma

A chondroma is a benign tumor composed of mature hyaline cartilage. The occurrence of these lesions in the jaws is extremely rare [56]; in fact, whether they ever occur in the jaws or whether they are usually described as chondromyxomas or chondromyxoid fibromas has been questioned [57-61]. In many cases, the true diagnosis in those reported cases is actually low-grade chondrosarcoma [62]. Most reports concern the mandibular condyle, suggesting that these lesions may arise from cartilaginous remnants [63, 64]. The chondroma presents as a painless slowly progressive swelling, which may result in mucosa ulceration. Based on location, it grows within bone ( enchondroma) or grows outward from bone (ecchondroma), or soft tissues (soft-part chondroma). The gender distribution is equal, and most tumors occur in patients younger than age 50 years. Radiographically, they present as irregular radiolucent lesions, although foci of calcification may occasionally be present. Resorption of tooth roots has been reported. Histologically, the lesions contain well-defined lobules of mature hyaline cartilage. Treatment is localized, and conservative surgical excision is normally recommended. Because of the doubtful nature of these lesions and the always-present possibility of a lesion representing a low-grade chondrosarcoma, some authorities have suggested wide excision for all of these lesions as a safety precaution [62].

# 32.4 Osteoma

Osteomas are benign tumors consisting of mature compact or cancellous bone. They may arise on the surface of bone (periosteal osteomas) or centrally within the bone (endosteal osteomas) [65]. They are often discovered as asymptomatic radiopacities.

Osteomas are most commonly discovered during the second and fifth decades of life, although they have been noted in all age groups. Males appear to be affected more frequently than females and also seen in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.

Gardner's syndrome, a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis, is an autosomal dominant condition in which patients have intestinal polyposis, related cancers occur in the thyroid, liver, and kidneys, multiple osteomas (usually endosteal) of the jaws, fibromas of the skin, epidermal cysts, impacted teeth, and odontomas [66-69]. The specific gene mutation associated with the condition has now been identified as the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC gene) located in chromosome 5q21(band q21 on chromosome 5) [70-72]. Many cases of incomplete manifestation of the syndrome have been reported. The clinical significance of this syndrome is that the intestinal polyps, which frequently occur in the colon and rectum, are premalignant and have a very high rate of malignant transformation. The associated osteomas are often found in the jaws, particularly in the angle region of the mandible, as well as the facial bones and long bones. It has been suggested that any patient with multiple mandibular osteomas should be investigated for the possibility of Gardner's syndrome. Investigation should include a detailed history of gastrointestinal disturbance and, if positive, follow-up with colonoscopy; if the diagnosis is confirmed, a prophylactic colectomy is generally recommended. Periosteal osteomas usually present as asymptomatic slow-growing bony masses. Endosteal osteomas are usually asymptomatic and are noted on routine radiographs. Radiographically, they appear as well-circumscribed sclerotic radiopaque masses (Fig. 32.9). Histologically, they consist of either dense compact bone with sparse marrow spaces or lamellar trabeculae of cancellous bone with fibrofatty marrow spaces. Osteoblastic activity is often predominant.

Treatment of osteomas is surgical excision (Fig. 32.10). This is often necessary to establish the diagnosis. Asymptomatic cases may be followed up clinically and radiographically without treatment. After excision, recurrences are very rare.

# 32.5 Synovial Chondromatosis and Osteochondroma

Both synovial chondromatosis and osteochondroma are conditions that occur in the temporomandibular joints and may be considered variants of the chondroma and osteoma. In synovial chondromatosis, the tumor begins as small nodules of cartilage, and there is a proliferation of small particulate, generally unattached, chondromas within the confines of the joint capsule. Most commonly occurs in adults aged 20-50, and most frequently found in the knee, they have been reported in most joints. Symptoms include joint pain, swelling, decreased range of motion, and locking of the joint. Well-recognized cases have occurred in the temporomandibular joints (normally only the superior compartment [73] with symptoms normally consisting of pain and swelling but most often with deviation of the mandible toward the unaffected side) (Fig. 32.11) [74, 75]. The etiology is

unknown, but trauma has been suggested [76]. When these lesions become symptomatic, they should be removed via a standard preauricular approach, though an endoscopic approach has also been described [76]. Perforation into the middle cranial fossa has also been described [77]. Because it is believed that they arise from metaplasia within the synovial lining cells of the joint, it is often advocated that the lining be removed at the same time [78]. Cases have been reported in which up to 200 of these bodies were present within the temporomandibular joint (Fig. 32.12) [73]. After removal, recurrence has not been reported.

The osteochondroma (osteocartilaginous exostosis) is believed to be a benign lesion that arises predominantly in long bones from a herniation of cartilage through the epiphyseal plate (knee, hip, shoulder, and joints). It tends to present with a predominantly osseous core with a cartilaginous cap. The lesion becomes symptomatic when function is affected, for example, a malocclusion or mandibular asymmetry develops

(  $\square$  Fig. 32.13). Cases have been reported in the mandibular condyle and coronoid tip [79]. Cases in the temporomandibular joints appear identical in all respects to lesions in other bones of the body. However, the association with the epiphyseal plate that occurs in the long bones is not present in the temporomandibular joint. On magnetic resonance imaging, it appears as an extraneous appendage to the temporomandibular joint and is usually more brighter than the surrounding mandible (  $\square$  Fig. 32.14). Treatment is symptomatic; when symptoms occur, localized excision is recommended via the normal temporomandibular approach. Recurrence has been reported but is unusual [80].

# 32.6 Aggressive Mesenchymal: Tumors of Childhood

It is recognized that children and young adults can develop an aggressive and rapidly growing tumor of bone, which, although often having a benign mesenchymal appearance, nevertheless behaves very aggressively. The exact nature of these lesions remains unknown, but many have been classified as desmoplastic fibromas, which are the hard tissue equivalent of fibromatosis in the soft tissues. Any bone can be affected including the jaws. They are considered to be a type of intraosseous fibroma [83].

The etiology and pathogenesis are in doubt because their aggressive behavior suggests a neoplastic process, but genetic, endocrine, and traumatic factors have also been suggested. Most occur in persons younger than age 20 years, and there is no gender predilection. The mandible is affected more frequently than the maxilla, and expansion may be noted [84]. Radiographically, a unilocular or multilocular radiolucency is noted with poorly defined lobulated margins, cortical perforation, and root resorption often being present (Figs. 32.15 and 32.16). Histologically, the lesion consists of interlacing bundles in a whirled aggregate of collagenous tissue with elongated and spindle fibroblasts. The low power appearance is that of a hypocellular neoplasm. However, atypia and mitotic features are not found. Osteoid material is not produced by this lesion.

In treating this lesion, the adage "treat the biology, not the histology" is of paramount importance. Although the lesion appears benign histologically, it often behaves aggressively [85], and the appropriate treatment is aggressive surgery, which often involves mandibular or maxillary resection (Fig. 32.17). This

is psychologically difficult for the surgeon to perform in a young child without a histologic diagnosis of malignancy, but the recurrence rate is very high after more conservative procedures. For lesions in inaccessible areas such as the base of the skull, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy has been attempted with variable degrees of success [86, 87].

# 32.7 Lesions Containing Giant Cells

A number of lesions that occur in the jaws contain giant cells within them. Their relationship with each other, however, is ill-defined. Histologically, all of the giant cell lesions appear similar, if not identical, and they usually cannot be distinguished on light microscopy alone. The clinical history, immunohistochemistry, or genetic markers have to be used to differentiate the lesions.

# 32.7.1 Central Giant Cell Granuloma

Central giant cell granuloma is a lesion occurring almost exclusively in the jaws. (A similar lesion has been described in the small bones of the fingers and toes, but its relationship with the central giant cell granuloma is unknown [88].) Although not normally considered an odontogenic lesion, the fact that it occurs only in the jawbones probably indicates some relationship with the teeth or tooth-bearing structures. It occurs primarily in the anterior parts of the jaws in people in the second and third decades of life, but it has been recorded in all sites at all ages. It is likely to occur in females under the age of 30 [89]. Its histogenesis remains speculative. When first described, it was called a "reparative giant cell granuloma," [90-92] and it was considered a reparative lesion that was essentially self-healing. There was little evidence of this, however, and only oblique references to its self-healing properties can be found. Worth [93] showed in a study of a number of nontreated lesions that resolution often did occur as seen radiographically; even when the lesions did not resolve completely radiographically, only a fibrous scar was noted on surgical exploration. The current consensus, however, is that these are not reparative lesions and that if they are not treated, they are progressive. Most appear to follow a fairly benign course, but more aggressive lesions have been noted [94-96]. The true nature of the central giant cell granuloma remains speculative. It has been suggested that it may be an inflammatory lesion, a reactive lesion, a true tumor, or an endocrine lesion. The belief that it is not a neoplasm but rather some peculiar reactive lesion is generally accepted.

Older theories about the origin of these lesions suggested that they may be derived from the odontoclasts that were responsible for resorption of the deciduous teeth; this was said to explain why they are normally found in areas where deciduous teeth were present and are found after the deciduous teeth have resorbed.

Radiographically, the central giant cell granuloma can take a number of forms from a well-defined radiolucency, a more ill-defined radiolucency, or a multilocular radiolucency. Teeth can be displaced by the lesion, although resorption of teeth is uncommon (Figs. 32.18 and 32.19).

Histologically, these granulomas contain focal arrangements of giant cells within a vascular stroma with thinwalled capillaries adjacent to the giant cells. There is a spindle cell stroma. Immunohistochemistry has shown that the giant cells are in fact osteoclasts [97], and the spindle cells are probably the cells of origin of this lesion [98].

Treatment is usually surgical and consists of local curettage, which is usually curative [99]. However, there is a  $15 - 20\%$  recurrence rate, and if the lesions are large, even conservative curettage may involve the loss of many teeth and possibly the inferior alveolar nerve in the mandible; it may have sinus and nasal implications in the maxilla. With the aggressive variants, more aggressive surgery has been suggested including mandibular resection and appropriate reconstruction [100].

Because the central giant cell granuloma and the brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism cannot be separated histologically, it is advocated that hyperparathyroidism be excluded from the diagnosis by serum calcium, phosphate, and parathormone and parathormone-related protein assays in all but the single small and more benign lesions [101].

A number of nonsurgical treatments have been suggested, all of which have their advocates. Intralesional steroids (usually triamcinolone injected into the lesion once per week for 6 weeks) have been advocated and have shown some success [102, 103].

Their mode of action is unknown, but they may work by suppressing the inflammatory component of the lesion. They are probably best reserved for smaller lesions that can be more easily treated by intralesional injections (Fig. 32.20). Calcitonin given by

Note the continued development of the roots of the second molar, the cessation of resorption of the distal root of the first molar, and the radiopacity replacing radiolucency

subcutaneous injection or by nasal spray has also been advocated and has met with some success (Fig. 32.21) [104, 105]. The theory behind this treatment is that the lesion may be caused by an as-yet-undiscovered parathormone-like hormone and that the use of calcitonin antagonizes its action and allows the lesion to heal. Because some of the giant cells have been shown to have calcitonin receptors on them, this may explain calcitonin's effectiveness [101, 107, 108].

Alternatives or adjuncts to surgery include bisphosphonates, which slow growth, interferon-alpha 2a, which slows growth, and calcitonin, which slows growth and corticosteroids, which convert lesions into fibrous tissue. Treatment failures have also been reported with calcitonin [109, 110]. Interferon-alpha given by subcutaneous injection has also been advocated in the treatment of the

central giant cell granuloma and has again met with some success [111]. The rationale for this therapy is that the antiangiogenic action of the interferon-alpha suppresses the angiogenic component of this lesion, causing healing to occur. In most cases, surgery is still required after the interferon-alpha treatment, but it may be less radical surgery and there may be a smaller chance of recurrence. Complications and side effects of interferon can be severe, however [112].

It has again been suggested that the central giant cell granuloma may, in fact, be a self-healing lesion, with the natural healing process stimulated by the nonsurgical therapy employed [106].

# 32.7.2 Giant Cell Tumor

The giant cell tumor is normally found in the long bones, and its presence in the jaws is not universally accepted; if it does occur, it is extremely rare. This lesion is an aggressive one and is thought by some to be a variant of a low-grade osteosarcoma. The recurrence rate after local curettage is high, and the appropriate treatment is in doubt. Some authorities advocate local curettage, whereas others have advocated resection. Histologically, it is very similar to the central giant cell granuloma, except that the giant cells are larger with more nuclei, and they are more evenly spread throughout the lesion and not as focally placed as in the central giant cell granuloma. However, in any particular case, it may be extremely difficult to make this distinction [51].

# 32.7.3Hyperparathyroidism

In hyperparathyroidism (primary, secondary, or tertiary), calcium is mobilized from the bones into the bloodstream to maintain homeostasis in the face of increased renal excretion. Mobilization from bone takes place focally and produces lesions in the bones (including the jaws) that are known as brown tumors because of their fairly distinctive coloration on surgical exploration [113]. Clinically and histologically, they are identical to the central giant cell granuloma (Fig. 32.22). Therefore, whenever a lesion such as this is recurrent, aggressive, or multiple hyperparathyroidism must be excluded by means of serum calcium, phosphate, and parathormone and parathormone-related protein assays. If these confirm a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, it should be treated appropriately. The lesions normally resolve without any further treatment.

# 32.7.4Cherubism

Cherubism is a familial genetically dominant condition first described by Jones in a family in 1933 [114]. Affected family members have multiple lesions mainly affecting the facial bones. Cherubism is a familial disease, and it affects  $100\%$  of males and  $70\%$  of females [143]. Because of the involvement of the maxilla and orbital floor, the face has a rounded appearance and the eyes tend to look upward, giving the patient a cherubic appearance (Fig. 32.23). The genetic defect in this condition has been identified on chromosome 4p1 6.3 [115, 116].

Expression is variable, with some patients having subclinical lesions discovered only on radiographs and some having extensive and clinically obvious lesions. Spontaneous mutations also occur. Radiographically, the lesions appear honeycombed and can be very extensive. Teeth are often displaced, and in active periods, the lesions are extremely vascular (Figs. 32.24 and 32.25).

Histologically, the lesions are very similar to central giant cell granuloma, with focal accumulations of giant cells in a spindle cell matrix. Perivascular cuff-like collagen deposits are seen histopathologically and, in some cases, can be used to differentiate the two lesions.

Because of its histologic similarity to central giant cell granuloma, calcitonin has been used in an attempt to cause resolution, but it has not met with variable success, suggesting that they are, in fact, different lesions [117, 118].

Treatment of cherubism is usually conservative and expectant and into the teenage years is devoted to trying to aid eruption of the teeth, which is often abnormal. Later, it is directed toward cosmetic recontouring of the affected bones. The lesions normally become less active and less vascular toward the end of the second decade

![](images/7a4663a23be99af48ee2fc6b10257b3975a37c1f45880d62b8b431e9c69a1927.jpg)

# 32.7.5Aneurysmal Bone Cyst

Aneurysmal bone cyst is most commonly found in the jawbones and appears to be a combination of a sinusoidal vascular lesion with a giant cell component. ABC is an expansile osteolytic lesion often multilocular, with

![](images/71ed4346381b275265575f50ad84a20922d607af6518e417a7f51187dbf39436.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 32.25 A coronal computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient in  $\square$  Fig. 32.23 shows extensive involvement of the mandible and maxilla by cherubism

blood-filled spaces separated by fibrous septa. Radiographically, the lesion appears as a well-circumscribed soap bubble-type lesion (Fig. 32.26). Histologically, the giant cell component resembles the central giant cell granuloma, whereas the vascular component is thin-walled sinusoids. Some authorities consider this to be a vascular variant of a central giant cell granuloma; others consider it a separate lesion. It responds well to aggressive curettage, although hemorrhage can be a problem. Recurrences are rare.

# 32.8 Vascular Malformations

Vascular malformations can occur anywhere in the body and are thought to be developmental lesions, which can occur in soft tissue or bone. Central vascular malformations of the jaws are a rare but well-documented entity. They are in contrast to the true hemangioma, which is a neoplasm of vascular endothelium and is normally present at birth, often enlarges, and then frequently involutes [119]. The vascular malformation generally is not present at birth, appears later, and does not involute. Vascular malformations can take a number of forms and represent structural abnormalities of the capillary, venous, lymphatic, and arterial system. The most practical classification is to divide them into highflow and lowflow vascular malformations. The high-flow vascular malformations are either arterial lesions or arteriovenous fistulas. The low-flow malformations are mainly venous in nature, but can be combinations of capillary,

![](images/7e75ddf03e260419f7d0147c7261ae3393ca5ae686c9a795bd200d25fc2963f2.jpg)

venous, and lymphatic components. The clinical significance of a vascular malformation is that a central highflow vascular malformation can cause torrential hemorrhage when surgical intervention ensues. This has been fatal on occasion [120]. Many of these lesions are asymptomatic and may even be difficult to detect preoperatively on radiographs. If there is a clinical presentation, it is often a slow-growing asymmetrical expansile lesion of the jaw, and if it is high flow, it may be associated with a bruit [123-125]. Radiographically, a highflow malformation may appear as an irregular, poorly defined soap bubble-type lesion, which may cause resorption of the roots of teeth and does not normally cause nerve involvement (Fig. 32.27). Low-flow malformations are similar but are often somewhat better defined and may contain calcifications or phleboliths within them. The presence of phleboliths is diagnostic of a low-flow malformation. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by computed tomography.

To avoid the possibility of inadvertently carrying out a tooth removal or a biopsy in the presence of a high-flow malformation, a diagnostic needle aspiration should be carried out preoperatively. If bright red blood under pressure is encountered, surgery should be abandoned. Because the radiographic and clinical appearances of a vascular malformation are not diagnostic, the differential diagnosis normally includes a number of odontogenic and nonodontogenic lesions, including central giant cell granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ameloblastoma, odontogenic keratocyst, and odontogenic myxoma. All of these lesions should

undergo needle aspiration before biopsy or surgical treatment to rule out a high-flow vascular malformation. When a vascular malformation is suspected or diagnosed, selective angiography is normally performed via a femoral approach (Fig. 32.28). If a high-flow vascular malformation is diagnosed, treatment is normally preoperative embolization followed by wide resective surgery. The embolization can involve a number of materials, including muscle, polyvinyl, pellets, and platinum coils, which are inserted via the angiography catheter or on direct puncture. On entering the lesion, they unwind and expand (Fig. 32.29) [121, 122]. Postembolization angiography carried out immediately after the embolization normally shows a diminution in blood flow to the lesion. However,

because of the powerful angiogenic effect of these lesions (probably by production of angiogenesis growth factor), reestablishment of smaller collateral vessels usually occurs within a few days, and it is often impossible to re-embolize these smaller collateral vessels. Therefore, definitive surgery should be carried out within a small number of days of embolization. Definitive surgery normally takes the form of resection under hypotensive anesthesia with adequate resuscitative measures available [115].

![](images/f05298b05b717cfa86bf3a02862d67d2c757ad6e5d4aaee3423aa9bae7c1598b.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 32.28 Subtraction angiogram of a high-flow vascular malformation of the mandible. Oblique lateral view with lower incisors (arrow)

After resection, appropriate reconstruction can be performed. This can include the re-insertion of the resected portion of bone after curettage, thinning, perforation, and simultaneous bone grafting (Fig. 32.30). Other approaches such as injection of a variety of substances into the lesion including glue, fibrin gel, and platinum coils [122] have been attempted; also, case reports exist of lesions being treated by means of local curettage after embolization, but this is not normally recommended.

Low-flow or venous malformations are not as life-threatening and are normally treated with direct puncture and an attempt to thrombose the lesion by intralesional injection of a variety of agents, including sclerosing agents, an absorbable gelatin sponge, and platinum coils. This may bring about thrombosis,

allowing the necessary dental or surgical treatment to be carried out. Often, mandibular resection is not necessary but, rather, a local surgical procedure.

# 32.8.1 Langerhans' Cell Histiocytosis

Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is the term currently employed for what was previously known as histiocytosis X, and before that the three separate conditions Letterer-Siwe disease, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease, and eosinophilic granuloma. Lichtenstein [126] first suggested that the three diseases were related and that the common factor was the presence of histiocytes. The cells of origin of this disease have now been identified as the Langerhans cells, which are dendritic cells in the skin and mucosa that have a macrophage-like function. This proliferation of Langerhans cells has an expression of CD1A,S100 and the presence of Birbeck granules by ultrastructural examination. At the present time, what causes these cells to proliferate in a clonal fashion with phenotypic evidence of activation and give rise to Langerhans' cell disease is unknown [127]. The nature of this disease also eludes us. Some recent studies have suggested that it may have some of the properties of a tumor or have a viral etiology. Other studies propose that it may be a response to an overwhelming allergenic challenge, and they report cases of eosinophilic granuloma that have resolved spontaneously, further adding to the puzzle [128]. The Histiocyte Society has attempted to define all of the histiocytic diseases in a logical manner [129], and Letterer-Siwe disease is now believed to represent the acute disseminated form of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, whereas Hand-Schuller-Christian disease represents the chronic disseminated form, and eosinophilic granuloma represents the chronic localized form.

The acute disseminated form (multifocal and multisystem) usually affects youn children, with involvement of skin, bone, internal organs (especially lungs and liver). Treatment is by chemotherapy, but fatality is common from disease progression.

The chronic disseminated form of the disease is classically associated with a triad of punched-out bone lesions (often affecting the skull and jaws), diabetes insipidus (owing to posterior pituitary involvement), and exophthalmos (owing to deposits in the posterior orbit). This normally affects an older age group, often in the second and third decades but sometimes much older. The bone lesions often affect the jaws. Although they usually appear as fairly well-defined punched-out radiolucencies (Fig. 32.31), they can also be less well

defined and can affect the apices of the teeth only and lead to a possible differential diagnosis of periapical infection. A frequent aspect of presentation is loose teeth; radiographically, they often appear as "floating teeth" (Fig. 32.32). The treatment of the chronic disseminated form of the disease is variable and, for well-circumscribed lesions, can consist of local curettage. However, for more aggressive forms, chemotherapy is frequently employed as well. Lowdose radiation therapy has also been used on isolated lesions, and it does remain one of the very few indications for lowdose radiation therapy, often in the region of a few hundred centigray.

The chronic localized form of the disease is commonly found in the jaws and usually shows as a well-defined radiolucency, often in the bicuspid region and more frequently in the mandible. Differential diagnosis in this case includes any fairly well-defined radiolucency. Treatment usually consists of aggressive local curettage, and the recurrence rate is low. Teeth are sacrificed as necessary. Intralesional steroids have also been employed

with some success, and cases of spontaneous regression have been reported [130].

In all of the clinical syndromes and variants, genetic studies reveal that the X-linked androgen receptor gene is clonal for proliferation of Langerhans cells [144]. It is generally believed that the occurrence of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is sporadic, but clusters have been noted and there are a number of reports of a familial incidence [127]. The author has seen the disease in a father and a son. The father was diagnosed with the chronic disseminated form of the disease at age 53 years (see Fig. 32.31), whereas his son died from the acute disseminated form of the disease at age 11 years.

# 32.9 Nonodontogenic Cysts of the Jaws

In this section, the following are discussed: globulomaxillary lesion, nasolabial lesion, median mandibular cyst, nasopalatine duct cyst, all of which are also known as fissural cysts, traumatic bone cyst, and Stafne's bone cyst. Aneurysmal bone cyst has been discussed under "Lesions Containing Giant Cells," earlier.

# 32.9.1Globulomaxillary Lesion

Globulomaxillary lesion was initially defined as a globulomaxillary cyst and was thought to be a fissural cyst caused by retained epithelial remnants at the fusion of the maxillary process with the globular process. It is normally found in the second or third decade. In the classic description, the lesion presents as a pear-shaped well-defined radiolucency in the maxilla between the lateral incisor and the canine. Associated teeth are classically vital, and the lesion is lined by cystic epithelium with occasional globular or ciliated epithelia.

Current thinking is that, although this lesion does exist as a radiographic and clinical entity (Fig. 32.33), it is not, in fact, a fissural cyst because the proposed embryonic derivation is now known to be flawed and the supposed fusion line does not exist. It is believed that most lesions previously diagnosed as globulomaxillary cysts can now be reclassified as keratocystic odontogenic tumor (formerly "odontogenic keratocyst"), radicular cysts, periapical granulomas, lateral periodontal cysts, central giant cell granulomas, calcifying odontogenic cysts, and odontogenic myxomas [51].

Tooth roots may be diverged by the lesion, and biopsy is usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis and enable appropriate surgical treatment to be carried out. Treatment normally consists of enucleation and curettage.

# 32.9.2Nasolabial Cysts

The nasolabial cyst was believed to be the soft tissue counterpart of the globulomaxillary cyst. Again, it was believed to be formed at the lines of fusion of the globulomaxillary processes. Similarly, this lesion does exist, but its true origin remains in doubt. It could be derived from remnants that form the nasolacrimal duct. This cyst manifests itself as a soft tissue swelling in the lateral aspect of the upper lip, fairly high in the sulcus (Fig. 32.34). The cyst lining is typically a pseudostratified columnar type with numerous goblet cells. Treatment is local excision.

# 32.9.3Median Mandibular Cyst

Median mandibular cyst is a rare cyst found in the midline of the mandible. It was originally thought to form at the line of fusion of each half of the mandibular arch. Again, the embryologic theory behind this lesion is no longer thought to be plausible, and it is believed that those lesions found in the anterior mandible represent some other type of odontogenic cyst or tumor.

# 32.9.4Nasopalatine Duct Cyst

Nasopalatine duct cyst is also known as incisive canal cyst and is generally located on the palatal end of the nasopalatine duct. It frequently presents as a soft swelling behind the upper anterior teeth. It is believed to be derived from the epithelial remnants of the paired embryonic nasopalatine ducts within the incisive canal and that either infection or trauma may be the stimulus for the cells to proliferate and form a cyst. It is

considered to be the most common epithelial and nonodontogenic cyst of the maxilla (Case report Ddent 2013; PMCID:PMC3834977 PMID 24307954). These cysts appear to occur more frequently in males than in females and are most common in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Most cases are asymptomatic, and either are found by chance on radiograph or present as a soft tissue swelling in the palate. Radiographically, this cyst appears as a well-defined radiolucency found in the midline of the anterior palate (Fig. 32.35). In many patients, the nasopalatine duct can be identified on an occlusal radiograph; the question then arises as to when the diagnosis of nasopalatine duct cyst should be entertained. A fairly arbitrary cutoff point of  $7\mathrm{mm}$  has been suggested if the nasopalatine duct appears to be greater than  $7\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter, the presence of a cyst should be suspected [131].

Diagnosis is by biopsy, which normally shows a pseudostratified columnar epithelium lining. Treatment, if required, is surgical and consists of local curettage. This almost inevitably requires the sacrifice of the nasopalatine vessels and nerves, which results in a small area of anesthesia over the anterior palate behind the upper incisor teeth. Some patients (particularly more elderly patients) find this particularly troublesome in the articulation of some words. Recurrence rate is very low after treatment.

# 32.9.5Traumatic Bone Cyst

Traumatic bone cyst, or cavity, has been called a number of names, including idiopathic bone cyst, simple bone cyst, and latent bone cyst or cavity. It is almost always asymptomatic and a chance finding on radiographs. It

occurs most commonly in the mandible, particularly in the posterior mandible. It classically appears on a radiograph as a fairly well-defined radiolucency, which usually has a scalloped margin beneath the tooth roots (Fig. 32.36). It is not quite as well defined as an odontogenic cyst, and the description made by Howe was that it appears as a "pencil sketch for a final pen and ink drawing." [132]

The etiology of this lesion is in doubt, and suggestions have included that it may result from trauma, which can be quite mild, but results in intramedullary hemorrhage. Instead of organization and new bone formation occurring, for some reason, the blood clot liquefies and is then resorbed, leaving an empty space. The traumatic bone cyst is defined as as intraosseous pseudocyst devoid of an epithelial lining, either empty or filled with a serous or sanguineous fluid [145]. On surgical exploration, these lesions are normally found to have either no lining whatsoever or just a very thin filmy lining. Studies have shown that the gaseous contents of the lesion are mainly nitrogen, and this is presumably because they contain air and the oxygen is absorbed preferentially into the bloodstream [133].

Although these lesions have been shown to regress spontaneously, a biopsy is almost always performed to determine the diagnosis. The biopsy is normally curative because anything that causes bleeding into the lesion causes resolution. Suggested treatments have included everything from no treatment whatsoever to curettage or injection of autologous blood or packing with an absorbable gelatin sponge [134]. Recurrences are extremely rare but have been reported, sometimes in conjunction with fibro-osseous disease, as have bilateral cases [134].

# 32.9.6Stafne's Bone Defect

Stafne: bone defect is also known as static bone cyst; it is always asymptomatic and found by chance on a radiograph. It presents as a well-defined radiolucency on the lower border of the mandible, below the inferior alveolar nerve (Fig. 32.37). The appearance is so diagnostic that biopsy is often not required. When this defect is explored surgically, one normally finds that it is not a totally intra-bony lesion but, in fact, an indentation of the mandible on the lingual side (Fig. 32.38). The indentation is normally filled with an offshoot of the submandibular salivary gland. This can be confirmed by sialography, which shows filling of the defects with the radiopaque media. Cases have also been seen that include lymphoid tissue in the cavity. It is believed that these may represent developmental lesions, although they may not present until adult life. Such lesions may represent the entrapment of the salivary gland or lymphoid tissue during the development of

the mandible or the subsequent erosion of the lingual plate of the mandible by the tissue. Treatment is unnecessary, but enucleation is often performed as a process of diagnosis [135].

# 32.10Neurogenic Tumors

# 32.10.1Schwannoma

The schwannoma is a benign tumor of the neurilemoma or nerve sheath. Although usually found in the soft tissues, it can occur in bone, where it usually exists as a well-defined radiolucency. Following biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, treatment usually consists of surgical excision. Recurrences are rare. Histologically, lesions are well-encapsulated and predominantly of spindle cells showing either an Antoni A (spindle cells arranged in palisaded whorls and waves) or an Antoni B (spindle cells with a more haphazard appearance).

# 32.10.2Neurofibroma

Neurofibromas are believed to be derived from the fibrous elements of the neural sheath and may exist as solitary lesions or as part of generalized neurofibromatosis or von Recklinghausen's disease. This latter condi

![](images/41edb59955a36a46e4b5a6c5e4e66e69913f79b5263a080cc49ab1fe4afb7c79.jpg)

tion is autosomal dominant, and two distinct subsets have been defined. Neurofibromatosis 1 (NFl) has an incidence of 1 in 3500 and the gene is located on chromosome 1 7q11.2, whereas neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) has an incidence of 1 in 60,000 and the suppressor gene is on the long arm of chromosome 22.

Although most commonly reported in soft tissues, neurofibromas do occur in bone and have been reported on the inferior alveolar nerve, where they appear as a fusiform swelling in continuity with the inferior alveolar canal (Fig. 32.39). Other bone changes associated with neurofibromatosis can include cortical erosion from adjacent soft: tissue lesions or medullary resorption from interosseous lesions. Neurofibroma cases associated with the inferior alveolar nerve can cause neurogenic pain or paresthesia.

The normally recommended treatment after biopsy is localized excision. The lesions are often vascular, and extensive blood loss has been reported from surgical management of mandibular lesions. Mandibular resection has been advocated by some authorities. The malignant transformation rate to neurogenic sarcoma of  $5 - 15\%$  in the generalized form of the disease could be a further indication for surgical removal of these lesions.

# 32.10.3Traumatic Neuroma

Traumatic neuroma represents a misguided attempt at nerve regeneration whereby following an injury to a nerve, neurons sprout from the site of injury but, for anatomic or physiologic reasons, cannot result in a functional nerve repair. If a nerve is sectioned, an amputation neuroma can develop on the stump; if a nerve is injured along its length, either an in continuity or a lateral neuroma can result (Fig. 32.40). In the oral cav

ity, these latter neuromas are most often noted on the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves. On the inferior alveolar nerve, they can occur as a fusiform enlargement of the inferior alveolar canal and result most commonly after mandibular trauma, resection of pathologic lesions, and nerve involvement after dentoalveolar surgery (  $\bullet$  Fig. 32.41).

If the symptoms are severe, appropriate treatment is resection of the neuroma and appropriate nerve reconstruction. Because the inferior alveolar nerve cannot be stretched significantly in the canal, repair normally involves a graft of some kind. Nerve grafts from the sural nerve or great auricular nerve have been reported, as have vein grafts, with some success [136]. The approach can be either intraoral or extraoral, but the extraoral approach generally gives better access and clinical results. However, it does have a higher morbidity, with possible risks of scarring and of damage to the mandibular branch of the facial nerve. Processed human nerve allografting may hold some promise to restore function and tissue membrane wrapping of the nerve. MRI neurography has a role for diagnosis of peripheral trigeminal nerve injuries [146].

# 32.11Paget's Disease

First described by Sir James Paget in 1876 [137], this entity still carries his name. Its alternative name is osteitis deformans. It is a slowly progressive bone condition of unknown etiology, predominantly affecting males

over the age of 50 years. It may represent a complex interplay between genetic and environmental (possibly viral) factors, which are poorly understood. The genetic component may consist of mutations to the SQSTM1 (most common), TNFRSF11A, and TNFRSF11B gene that encodes the p62 protein often found in Paget's disease.

Clinically, there is hyperactive bone turnover with alternate resorption of bone, a vascular phase, and, finally, a sclerosing phase. Most bones of the body are involved, and the disease can result in considerable deformity. In the facial region, the maxilla is affected more often than the mandible. Family histories have been obtained in this disease, and the genetic basis of the condition is being defined, looking at chromosomes 2, 5, and 10.

The classic presentation used to be a patient whose hat or gloves no longer fitted correctly or in whom false teeth, particularly the maxillary denture, did not fit owing to bone swelling. Today, these presentations are much fewer because well-fitting hats, gloves, and dentures are less commonly encountered. Initial presentation is usually related to bone deformity or pain. In the head and neck, headaches and symptoms owing to vascular and nerve compression have been noted.

The classic radiographic appearance is of a "cotton wool" appearance in the skull and maxilla of affected patients (Fig. 32.42), with hypercementosis around the roots of teeth and loss of lamina dura and obliteration of the periodontal ligament space. This does make tooth extraction extremely difficult in these patients. Root resorption has also been noted.

The histopathology shows the typical reversal lines of alternate resorption and bone deposition (Fig. 32.43). Classically, patients have markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels.

Treatment is both systemic and local. Systemic treatment currently consists of the use of salmon calcitonin or non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates to inhibit bone (zoledronic acid).

Calcitonin can be utilized either by the subcutaneous route or by nasal spray inhalation. Treatment causes stabilization of the bone and a lowering of the raised alkaline phosphatase levels. Localized treatment is directed to cosmetic and/or functional reintouring of bone. It should be noted that the bone of Paget's disease is often vascular, and bleeding during reintouring can be extensive. Somewhat paradoxically, however, healing is often delayed owing to the intervening sclerotic areas of bone.

Fig. 32.43 Histology of Paget's disease shows reversal lines of new bone deposition and resorption (hematoxylin and eosin,  $\times 40$  original magnification)

The classic causes of death in patients with Paget's disease are left heart failure and osteosarcoma. Heart failure is caused by the excessive blood supply to the remodeling bone, which can cause high output or left heart failure in elderly persons. Sarcomatous change has been reported in  $5 - 15\%$  of patients with Paget's disease, which should be considered a premalignant condition [138].

# 32.12Gorham's Disease (Gorham-Stout Syndrome)

Although first described in 1838, this disease was named after Gorham, who reviewed the literature and added three new cases in 1954 [139]. Its alternative name is massive osteolysis. Gorham's disease is a rare disease of unknown etiology, usually occurring in the second to third decades of life, although it has been reported in all age groups. There is no sex or racial predilection, although an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern has been suggested. The diagnosis is usually one of exclusion. Any bone can be affected, and there is usually massive osteolysis, which is generally asymptomatic until a pathologic fracture occurs (Figs. 32.44 and 32.45). It is considered to be a monocentric bone disease caused by deranged osteoclastic activity. The bone is usually replaced with fibrous tissue. The majority of cases are monostotic, but polyostotic cases have been reported [139]. There is no specific treatment for this disease; however, radiation therapy and surgical resection have been beneficial in selected cases. Serum biochemistry is usually normal, and isotope bone scans do not show excessive activity. Osteolytic changes are the result of hyperactive osteoclastic bone [147]. The long-term prognosis is uncertain, but some long-term remissions have been reported [140].

# 32.13Tori

# 32.13.1Torus Palatinus

The palatine torus appears as a bony hard swelling along the midline of the palate. It can be discrete or may be large and lobular (Fig. 32.46). It usually occurs in the second or third decade of life and has a tendency to grow throughout life. It is tempting to think that these lesions may be embryologic in their development and form at the line of fusion of the two palatal plates, but this is probably incorrect and the true nature of these lesions remains unknown. Larger versions may require

surgical removal because of their interference either with speech or feeding or with prosthodontic reconstruction. The common surgical approach is via a double Y-shaped incision (Fig. 32.47) and subsequent bone removal. The bone is virtually always solid cortical bone and is actually fairly difficult to remove. The recommended technique is to make a number of vertical cuts in the bone with a fissure bur (Fig. 32.48). Then, the intervening ridges of bone can be snapped off and a final smoothing of the residual bone carried out, taking care not to perforate through into the nasal cavity (Fig. 32.49). It may be advisable to insert a palatal splint after the procedure to prevent excessive hematoma formation and possible recurrence of the torus (Fig. 32.50).

# 32.13.2Torus Mandibularis

Mandibular tori are bony exophytic growths that present on the lingual aspect of the mandible opposite the bicuspidis (Fig. 32.51). They are virtually always bilateral. Again, they present in early midlife and tend to grow with age. Larger versions may require removal because they interfere with tongue positioning, speech, and prosthodontic reconstruction, as well as with oral hygiene around the posterior teeth. The etiology of these lesions is in doubt; again, it is tempting to think of them as being embryologic lesions formed at the junction of the original Meckel cartilage and the neo-mandible, but this is almost certainly not correct.

If surgical removal is required, it is carried out via an extensive lingual gingival margin incision with a possible releasing incision, followed by removal of the bone. This is carried out by making a number of vertical cuts with a fissure bur, as with the maxillary torus, and then snapping off the intervening ridges of bone with a periosteal

elevator. The residual irregularities are then smoothed with a larger bur. Occasionally, mandibular tori are on a fairly narrow neck and can be removed in toto with a well-directional blow from a mallet and chisel.

Recurrence of tori is rare, and it has often been noted that palatal and mandibular tori rarely occur in the same patients.
