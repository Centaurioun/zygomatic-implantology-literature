# 8.1 Introduction

The evolution in sophisticated diagnostic imaging modalities and associated software applications continues to impact the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The advent of computed tomography (CT) in dentistry began in the late 1980s with the use of medical-grade machines located in major hospitals or radiology centers. Patients were referred for CT scans to achieve a level of diagnosis beyond the scope of conventional two-dimensional panoramic or periodical radiography available in most dental offices. As computing power increased, the ability to move from two-dimensional to three-dimensional data marked the beginning of a new and exciting area in diagnostic imaging, paving the way for the development and adoption of interactive treatment planning software to help interpret the massive amount of anatomic data. The information gained from a CT scan allowed the clinician to appreciate the "reality of anatomy" for each patient presentation—yielding views of structures aided by advances in data processing power of the computer-driven technology. As dental implants increased in popularity as tooth replacements, the accurate assessment of patient anatomy and collaboration between restorative clinician and surgeon became more critical as determinants of successful outcomes. CT technology and interactive treatment planning software applications helped bridge the communication gap between all members of the implant team while appreciably removing the guesswork from the process.

Despite all of the benefits of three-dimensional CT scan data, the actual use of the technology was quite limited due to several barriers, including cost of the scan, proximity of the radiology center, and lack of proper training in interpretive three-dimensional diagnostics. Recently, a new family of imaging machines was introduced with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) technology, which offered several immediate benefits for dental applications by helping to remove many of the barriers associated with the imaging modality. CBCT machines are far less costly than a medical-grade CT machine, can offer excellent image quality at a fraction of the radiation dose to the patient, and are small enough to fit into a dental office. Therefore, in the author's opinion, dental applications of three-dimensional imaging have become one of the most significant developments that will have the most impact on how surgical and restorative procedures are planned, communicated, and executed for years to come. As computing processing power, graphics emulations, and display screens continue to dramatically improve, the actual use of the techniques and concepts presented will be ultimately limited by the clinician's imagination. Regardless

of the enormous benefits of this technology, there are risks associated with even low-dose radiation exposure. Therefore, clinicians should be responsible when utilizing CBCT or CT in adhering to the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) for each of our patients. The goal of this chapter is to illustrate how this technology can be applied for a variety of different clinical presentations.

Whether using standard CT or CBCT, the scan data requires further processing so that it can be visualized on the computer display. It is not the intent of this chapter to review the technical aspects of this process, as it is the application of the technology that is most rewarding for both clinician and patient. If the patient is referred to a radiology center, the data will be provided on a CD-type disk, with a self-contained viewing software. If an in-office CBCT machine is used, the data will be processed and viewed on a computer workstation. Regardless of how the data are acquired, the software will produce four basic views: the axial, the panoramic, the three-dimensional reconstruction, and the cross-sectional views (Fig. 8.1). These four image types are the building blocks for analyzing data, formulating an accurate diagnosis, communicating with clinical teammates, educating the patient, formulating a definitive plan, and properly executing the plan. The key to the process is how each of these images can be utilized through direct interaction, such as changing the gray scale, scrolling through the various slices, or simulating implant placement with sophisticated planning tools.

The image acquisition process can be limited by the type of machine used and the size of the data collection sensor. These differences can affect the field of view (FOV). A large FOV machine allows for inspection of the entire maxillofacial complex as displayed in a variety of different formats for diagnostic accuracy (Fig. 8.2). An example of the diversity of how data can be displayed is found in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) view, in which the software automatically generates a series of interactive images focusing on the anatomic landmarks for both the left and the right condyles (Fig. 8.3). Various third-party interactive treatment planning software can manipulate the CT/CBCT data in an ever-expanding array of capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis, treatment planning phase, and surgical intervention. The use in maxillofacial surgical procedures includes, but is not limited to, impacted teeth, implant placement, block and particulate bone grafting, orthognathic procedures, distraction osteogenesis, TMJ dysfunction, sinus augmentation, and many others. Each of these procedures can be enhanced through the application of three-dimensional imaging technologies. The following clinical presentations demonstrate how new three-dimensional tools can be applied.

# Learning Aims and Applications of CBCT

Impacted teeth  
Supranumerary teeth  
- Pathologic lesions and incidental finding  
Understanding of the space required to place and restore a single implant in the esthetic zone, TOB (triangle of bone)  
- Noting the location of the mental foramen and the path of the inferior alveolar nerve is essential to avoid potential serious complications.

# Learning Aim

It has been well documented that panoramic and periapical radiography are limited in diagnostic accuracy due to the inherent distortion factor, overlap of adjacent structures, the inability to realistically evaluate spatial relationships, assess bone width, or quality. The use of CT/CBCT resolves these issues by accurately supplying undistorted three-dimensional assessment of bone width, density, location of nerves, vessels, volume of the maxillary sinus, location of septum, root morphology, the temporomandibular joint complex, spatial position of impacted or supernumerary teeth, and magnitude of potential pathological lesions. The improved diagnostic acuity affords the clinician with the vital information required to formulate and present one or more treatment options to the patient.

# Case One: CBCT Diagnostics for a Horizontally Impacted Maxillary Canine and More

A 10-year-old boy was referred for a three-dimensional CBCT scan by his orthodontist when it was determined that he had an overretained deciduous canine and a horizontally impacted permanent canine. Two-dimensional radiographs were not sufficient to diagnose the spatial position of the canine relative to adjacent vital structures. With

the parent's approval, a scan was performed, and the three-dimensional data were reviewed. The mixed dentition can be clearly visualized in the initial view of the maxilla (see

Fig. 8.4). The horizontally impacted canine can be seen in the upper right side of the image, with confirmation that the contralateral canine had erupted properly.

Utilizing the CBCT scan data, the maxillary arch was reconstructed as a solid interactive three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional reconstruction accurately revealed the maxillary bone, the properly erupted right canine, the left deciduous canine, and the left impacted canine (see Fig. 8.5a). The lateral three-dimensional view exhibited horizontal position of the permanent canine and the vertical position of the primary canine (see Fig. 8.5b). Proximity to adjacent vital structures

can also be appreciated in this view. However, the author recommends that all views be assimilated before a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan is determined. The axial view allows further inspection of the impacted tooth and root apex (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.6). The root apex was not fully developed, a fact to be considered if it was determined that the canine tooth could be orthodontically moved into a proper position. The axial view also displayed adjacent vital structures, such as the floor of the nose and the maxillary sinus (see arrows).

Fig. 8.7 The cross-sectional view revealed the lack of closure of the root apex and surrounding structures

Confirmation of the location of the tooth and its proximity to vital anatomy was found in the cross-sectional slice (Fig. 8.7). The status of the root apex was also confirmed (see arrows).

Using the maximum intensity projection (MIP), one method of mapping three-dimensional points to a two-dimensional plane, the mixed dentition was clearly visualized but was difficult to interpret, which can sometimes lead to an unexpected incidental finding (Fig. 8.8a). Further inspection of the three-dimensional data revealed a supernumerary tooth (mesiodens) near the right maxillary central incisor (see Fig. 8.8b). The axial image (Fig. 8.9) confirmed the palatal position (yellow arrow) and close proximity to the incisive canal (white arrow). A series of cross-sectional image slices (44-49) revealed the 180-degree vertically rotated position of the second impacted tooth and radiolucent area surrounding the clinical crown (Fig. 8.10).

The valuable information acquired through three-dimensional imaging technology was essential in accurately diagnosing two impacted teeth within the maxillary scan. Once this information was assimilated, a proper plan of treatment was developed and discussed by all members of the treatment team: the oral surgeon, the orthodontist, and the prosthodontist. The three-dimensional images allowed for improved communication between members of the team, providing the necessary information for a proper course of treatment resulting in a successful outcome.

# Case Two: CBCT Diagnostics for a Mandibular Implant Evaluation and More

A 60-year-old man requested an evaluation and treatment recommendation for two missing mandibular first molar teeth. Clinical examination was unremarkable except for the volumetric change in the bone as a consequence of tooth loss. His chief complaint was that he wanted to

restore the spaces in his lower arch; he had no other symptoms. A periapical radiograph revealed a suspicious radiolucent area anterior to the potential implant receptor site (see Fig. 8.11a). The arrows indicate the outline of the area. The intraoral view showed that the mandibu

lar right lateral incisor, canine, and two bicuspid teeth were all within normal limits (see Fig. 8.11b). Due to the loss of bone in the first molar area, the proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve, and an irregular appearance on the two-dimensional radiograph, a CBCT scan was recommended.

The panoramic reconstructed view from the CBCT data revealed the potential implant receptor sites in the areas of the mandibular first molar teeth. An unexpected incidental finding further reinforced the need for three-dimensional assessment of patient anatomy. A well-circumscribed lesion was detected in the areas of the mandibular canine and premolar teeth (see Fig. 8.12). Further inspection of the cross-sectional images revealed the size and extent of the lesion within the mandible and in

relation to the adjacent teeth (see Fig. 8.13). The lesion was radiolucent within the confines of the dense facial and lingual mandibular cortical plates (see Fig. 8.14). The lesion was accurately measured in all dimensions. The three-dimensional reconstructed image showed the area of the missing right mandibular molar and its proximity to the mental foramen (see Fig. 8.15).

The axial slices illustrated the well-circumscribed lesion from a different view, revealing a solid anterior border within the symphysis (see Fig. 8.16). The path of the inferior alveolar nerves had been previously traced in orange. The scope of the lesion seemed to extend to the right mental foramen as seen in the axial view (see Fig. 8.17a). To determine whether the lesion was expansive, accurate measurements were made from the facial to the lingual cortical plates over the lesion and in the area of the contralateral side of the mandible (see Fig. 8.17b). The measurements were the same, indicating a nonexpansive lesion. Due to proximity to the adjacent teeth, pulp tests were performed, and both teeth were found to be vital. The patient was advised of the findings and referred to an oral surgeon. The nature of digital data workflow and CBCT data provides clinicians with one of the best communication tools for diagnosis and treatment planning. The data set was sent via email to the local surgeon for review and discussion. The surgeon was able to view the interactive data and offers a plan for treatment after consultation with the referring dentist. The information was reviewed with the patient, and, based upon a thorough

review of the findings, it was agreed that a surgical intervention was recommended.

After local anesthesia was administered utilizing a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap, the area was exposed, and the lesion was excised, leaving a shiny appearance to the lingual cortical plate (Fig. 8.18). It was elected to fill the lesion with a sterile, biocompatible natural porous bovine bone mineral matrix (Fig. 8.19). The excised lesion was sent for biopsy (Fig. 8.20), and the area healed uneventfully. The histologic evaluation indicated that the lesion was an odontogenic keratocyst. This type of lesion has a high recurrence rate, which means that it should be followed carefully after initial treatment. The low dosage of CBCT makes it an ideal modality for postoperative follow-up. The 5-month postoperative CBCT cross-sectional image reveals complete fill of the defect site (Fig. 8.21). The postoperative axial view and the resultant density of the grafted site can been seen at 5 months in Fig. 8.22. The lesion has been followed up for over 3 years without any sign of recurrence (Fig. 8.23).

adjacent teeth, the subsequent treatment could have been debilitating to the patient. The diagnostic accuracy afforded by the three-dimensional views allowed for a complete understanding of the size and scope of the lesion, so that the oral surgeon could make an educated decision on the recommended course of treatment. Therefore, the ability to visualize the lesion and its properties is essential for successful outcomes.

# Case Three: CBCT Diagnostics to Assess Potential Graft Augmentation

A 17-year-old female was referred for routine dental implant evaluation of a congenitally missing maxillary left lateral incisor. Clinical examination revealed a facial concavity in the area of the missing tooth, leaving a narrow facial-palatal dimension of bone for an implant. Conventional periapical radiographs were not helpful in determining the quality of the bone, the width of bone, or the thickness of the facial or palatal cortical plates. Further radiographic studies were suggested and a CBCT scan was performed.

The panoramic reconstructed view based upon the CBCT data revealed blunted root apexes for the maxillary anterior teeth and allowed inspection of the potential lateral incisor implant receptor site (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.24). To gain an understanding of the space required to place and restore a single implant in the esthetic zone, all three-dimensional views were considered. The axial view sliced near the crest of the bone displays the root morphology of the entire arch and the facial-palatal width of the residual alveolar crestal bone (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.25). The shape of the individual teeth as seen in the axial view demonstrates what the author has termed as the "restorative dilemma." The shape of our natural teeth as they emerge from the bone is consistent with normal tooth morphology. The dental implants we

Fig. 8.24 Panoramic reconstructed view reveals a congenitally missing maxillary left lateral incisor

may use to insert into the bone are "round" in shape. Going from the round shape of the implant to a morphologically correct tooth form is not easy. It is a restorative dilemma.

Utilizing nondistorted measuring tools in the axial view (red), the facial-palatal dimension can be determined for the right existing lateral incisor tooth, as transposed to the left lateral space (see Fig. 8.26). A realistic implant known to be  $3.8\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter can be virtually placed to assess the potential volumetric space requirements of this receptor site (yellow arrow). The narrow ridge can then be assessed in the cross-sectional views (see Fig. 8.27a). Utilizing specialized three-dimensional planning software,

Fig. 8.26 The axial view allows for precise measurements (in red) to compare the right-side existing lateral incisor with the potential space requirements for the implant receptor site (arrow)

a simulated bone graft can be positioned on the facial aspect of the alveolar ridge (see Fig. 8.27b). If this were to be a block graft taken from mandibular ramus or the anterior symphysis fixation would be an issue to ensure success, this aspect can also be virtually planned (see  
Fig. 8.28b, c). The length and diameter of the fixation screw should be commensurate with the graft thickness and density of the underlying host bone. Once an appropriate ridge width and volume has been achieved, the implant can be planned.

In research developed in 1992 and first published in 1995, the author proposed a method for receptor site evaluation within the cross-sectional slice depicting the available bone. This concept is called the Triangle of Bone® (TOB). The base of the triangle is created by drawing a line from the widest portion of the facial bone to the widest portion

of the palatal bone. The apex of the triangle is positioned above the alveolar crestal bone (or proposed position of the crest when considering grafting), and the lines are connected. The most ideal position to maximize bone volume

Fig. 8.29 Closer inspection of the positioning of the simulated bone graft, implant, abutment, and virtual tooth reveals that at the facial-coronal aspect of the implant, there is  $1.65\mathrm{mm}$  of new simulated bone,  $2.93\mathrm{mm}$  at the middle of the implant, and  $1.65\mathrm{mm}$  on the palatal aspect near the first thread

surrounding an implant would be to bisect the triangle. A realistic  $3.8\mathrm{mm}$  diameter tapered design implant placed within the TOB is surrounded by bone in the apical two thirds, leaving the facial aspect exposed to the simulated bone graft (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.29a). However, the goal of implant dentistry is not the implant; it is the tooth. Therefore, the restorative aspect must be considered before finalizing the placement of the implant. The abutment simulation helps to visualize the path of emergence of the implant within the envelope of the restoration (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.29b).

The three-dimensional planning concepts and software tools have empowered clinicians with new paradigms for assessing implant and/or grafting sites. Closer inspection of the positioning of the simulated bone graft, implant, abutment, and virtual tooth reveals that at the facial-coronal aspect of the implant, there is  $1.65\mathrm{mm}$  of new simulated bone,  $2.93\mathrm{mm}$  at the middle of the implant, and  $1.65\mathrm{mm}$  on the palatal aspect near the first thread (see

implant placement should be completed utilizing the three-dimensional reconstructed model.

Examination of the three-dimensional reconstructed maxilla reveals the dentition, the surrounding root eminences, and the resulting concavity in the area of the congenitally missing left lateral incisor tooth (see Fig. 8.31a). The placement of a simulated implant helps to visualize the depth of the concavity and assess the facial exposure of the coronal aspect of the implant (see Fig. 8.31b). An abutment projection that extends from the implant is helpful in determining implant positioning and angulation (see Fig. 8.32a). Using advanced "clipping" features of the planning software, the three-dimensional maxilla can be sliced to provide additional vital information regarding the implant position and abutment within the envelope of the virtual tooth (see Fig. 8.32b). The proximity of the implant to the adjacent teeth can be confirmed by removing the maxillary bone and leaving only the clinical crowns and tooth roots (see Fig. 8.32). Interactive treatment planning software can provide a variety of methods to reveal the three-dimensional data, and perhaps, the most striking is the ability to selectively control the opacity of different anatomy, a concept that the author has termed selective transparency. Using selective transparency, the outer maxillary bone remains translucent, showing the

Fig. 8.33 Using "selective transparency" reveals the implant and abutment projection within the planned receptor site

underlying implant and adjacent teeth and roots (see Fig. 8.33).

For illustrative purposes, the bone graft site can be virtually prepared to receive a block bone graft as demonstrated utilizing innovative software modules (Fig. 8.34a). The facial bone has been modified, and the simulated receptor site de-corticated for better vascularity to the graft (see Fig. 8.34b). Using a special "graft volume tool," the prepared defect site can be virtually filled with an adequate volume of bone to support an implant based upon the paradigms addressed previously (see Fig. 8.35). The fixation of the graft can also be visualized in advance of the procedure for proper positioning within the graft and the receptor site bone (see Fig. 8.36a, b). Through three-dimensional "clipping," the entire surgical and restorative complex can be visualized, including the implant, the bone graft, the abutment, and the virtual tooth (Fig. 8.37). The final simulation on the three-dimensional reconstructed maxilla is useful as an educational tool to explain the individual process to the patient and a communication tool to the referring clinician regarding all of the components of the procedure (Fig. 8.38). The implant can be seen emerging from the proposed bone graft (see

# Case Four: CBCT Diagnostics in the Mandible—Implants and More

A 62-year-old man presented with complete maxillary and mandibular removable dentures. He wished to review treatment options for implant-supported restorations, both fixed and removable. As part of the presurgical prosthetic workup, maxillary and mandibular study casts were fabricated to facilitate capturing vertical dimension records. A complete denture setup was achieved with the appropriate tooth mold to fit the arch form. Although it appeared that the patient had adequate bone for implant placement, in order to plan with greater accuracy, a barium sulfate scanning template was fabricated by duplicating the tooth setup (BariOpaque®, Salvin Dental, Charlotte, NC). The scanning template was placed intraorally, with a putty bite registration to stabilize the maxillary and mandibular position and to minimize movement before the CBCT scan. The panoramic radiograph with the mandibular barium sulfate scanning template can be seen in Fig. 8.39. For the purposes of this chapter, only the information from the mandible is presented.

The three-dimensional reconstructed view allows for inspection of the mandibular morphology and an appreciation of the mental foramina (see Fig. 8.40). However, it does not reflect the relationship between the bone and the desired occlusion. A properly fabricated radiopaque scano

graphic template affects the treatment plan by linking the tooth position to the underlying bone, establishing important landmarks that help to direct implant positioning (see Fig. 8.41a, b). Whereas it is possible to simulate the placement of implants in the anterior symphysis without a template, there is no assurance that the implants can be restored properly within the boundaries of the restorative envelope (see Fig. 8.42). Noting the location of the mental foramen and the path of the inferior alveolar nerve is essential to avoid potential serious complications. Most interactive treatment planning software applications will provide the necessary tools to trace out the nerve from the lingula to the mental foramen. Using the cross-sectional images, the location of the mental foramen can be located and the nerve traced (see Fig. 8.43). Once the nerves have been located, the implants can be placed at the desired position within the confines of the scanning template. Ideally, the implant should be positioned within the bone, with an abutment projection extending above the occlusal plane and adjusted after taking into consideration the other views (see Fig. 8.44a). Note the difference in bone quality, density, and morphology from one implant receptor site to the next (see Fig. 8.44b). Implant length and diameter can also be evaluated in the cross-sectional view.

Returning to the three-dimensional reconstructed model and the occlusal view, the inter-implant distances and angulation can be evaluated to fit the needs of the restorative scheme. If desired, the software can help to parallel the implants (see Fig. 8.45a). Using the concept of selective transparency, the path of the mental nerves and proximity to the implants can be clearly visualized. The initial positioning of the implants can then be verified by superimposition of the scanning template (see Fig. 8.46). Adjustments can be accomplished if necessary. The left distal-most implant exits in the embrasure between the left canine and the first bicuspid tooth. If this were to be a screw-retained hybrid-type restoration, the implant could be repositioned to achieve a better location for the screw access hole. Once the implant positions have been verified,

the oral surgeon can confer with the referring clinician and prepare for the surgical intervention. Based upon the accepted virtual plan, a CT-derived bone-borne or soft tissue-borne template could be fabricated—referred to by the author as "template-assisted" surgery. Or the surgeon can place the implants free-hand, using the CT data as provided by the plan to guide the implant placement based upon computer printouts of the various slices—referred to as "CT-assisted" surgery.

Upon inspection of the entire mandible in either the panoramic or axial view, additional significant anatomy was discovered. In the posterior right-side mandible, a horizontally impacted molar was identified (see Fig. 8.47). The ability to zoom in and focus on a small area of interest is an important feature of three-dimensional imaging tech

Fig. 8.47 The axial view revealed a horizontally impacted third molar

nology. The close-up axial view reveals the horizontal tooth position with the clinical crown facing the lingual (see Fig. 8.48a). Scrolling through the next axial slice revealed a dilaceration of roots embedded in the thick facial cortical bone (see Fig. 8.48b). The proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve can be confirmed in the cross-sectional view if the nerve had been previously traced to the posterior aspect of the mandible (see Fig. 8.49). If the software allows for the tooth to be virtually separated from the bone, the coronal aspect of the impacted tooth would be visible in the three-dimensional reconstructed view (see Fig. 8.50). The area of interest can be expanded to clearly visualize the molar, the extent of the bone surrounding the coronal portion, and its proximity to the path of the inferior alveolar nerve using transparency features of the software (see Fig. 8.51). Rotation of the three-dimen

sional mandible allows for a lingual view of the impacted molar and the relationship to the nerve from another perspective (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.52). The bone can be totally removed to provide an even closer inspection of the vital anatomy and root morphology (see  $\square$  Fig. 8.53).

Fortunately, in this example, there was adequate spacing between the molar tooth and the nerve to avoid potential damaging complications. If the molar required removal, these views would prove to help guide the oral surgeon in planning the surgical intervention with the least amount of patient morbidity.

If the posterior ramus were to be utilized as a potential donor graft site, the three-dimensional reconstructed view would provide ample information to determine whether the procedure could be successfully accomplished (Fig. 8.54). Whereas the bone might look excellent during the harvesting procedure, without a complete understanding of the underlying vital anatomy, complications could occur. Therefore, it is imperative to locate the path of the inferior alveolar nerve in relation to the donor site. The cross-sectional view reveals the thickness of the facial cortical plate and the proximity of the inferior alveolar nerve (Fig. 8.55). If there was adequate clearance, and the quality of bone sufficient for the bone to be utilized as a donor, a plan can be formulated that would allow for proper harvesting while limiting potential complications. Using advanced software specifically designed for oral surgery applications, different procedures can be simulated, including segmental osteotomies and more. Once the dimensions of the donor site have been established, the surgery can be simulated on the three-dimensional model. The donor graft can be virtually removed from the mandible and positioned where it is needed to augment the distant receptor site (Fig. 8.56). If the receptor site was part of the three-dimensional reconstructed maxilla, it could be moved to the site to see if it fit properly. This can all be accomplished before touching the scalpel to the patient.

# Conclusion

The ability to interactively assess patient anatomy with three-dimensional imaging has empowered clinicians with an expanded set of tools which can greatly improve diagnostic accuracy. Applications for the use of this technology apply to all specialities of dentistry but are particularly suited for oral surgery procedures as illustrated in this chapter. The examples are almost limitless as each patient presents with an individual set of anatomical realities which need to be appreciated prior to the development of a definitive treatment plant. Virtual simulation of "routine" extractions can be found to be anything but routine after reviewing the axial or cross-sectional slices of a CT/CBCT

scan of the region in question. The shape and dimension of a defect requiring bone grafting can be preoperatively assessed and visualized in great detail so as to understand the volume required to manage the site, helping to decide between particulate or block grafting techniques. Implant or bone grafting receptor sites can be evaluated for thickness of the buccal or lingual cortex, density of the intermediullary bone, and proximity to vital structures. Manipulation of the 3-D interactive data with new and innovative software tools can yield unprecedented views, which allow for inspection of the patient's unique anatomical presentation and provide the means to remove guesswork from the process.

The case examples contained in this chapter were selected to illustrate how three-dimensional imaging and interactive software applications can significantly enhance the diagnosis and treatment planning process through the use of a variety of applications for the technology. It is important to note that the concepts presented are not limited to specific case types but provide the potential for expansion into every area of dentoalveolar surgical, implant, and prosthetic reconstruction. It is the author's opinion that the utilization of CT/CBCT diagnostic imaging by the oral surgeon will significantly impact on the everyday practice workflow, including case presentation, reduction of potential complications, supplemental medical-legal documentation, improved treatment planning capabilities, enhanced communication with referring clinicians, and reduction in patient morbidity during and after the ultimate surgical intervention.
