# 67.1 Introduction

Denteskeletal modifications mark the foundation of orthognathic surgery that allow for establishment of harmonious function and aesthetics. The soft tissue drape over the planned dentoskeletal movements further augments the end aesthetic result. It is paramount that the surgeon understands the affects of the dentoskeletal changes on the soft tissue and includes this in the overall treatment planning of the patient. The treatment planning should include the pediatric dentist, orthodontist, and oral and maxillofacial surgeon to ensure consideration of development and final outcomes of airway, occlusion, condylar positioning, skeletal proportions, and soft tissue aesthetics.

The analysis of facial soft tissue and the associated aesthetic outcome in orthognathic surgery is the most challenging and unpredictable component in the orthodontic-surgical treatment planning process. The final aesthetic facial appearance together with the establishment of a functional and stable occlusion is both equal and important goals in orthognathic surgery. Historically, orthodontic literature contained the original studies predicting the soft tissue changes following dentofacial deformity correction. Over the years, two-dimensional imaging, coupled with photographic analysis, was utilized to predict soft tissue changes with variable success. However, there remains a need for an ideal procedure capable of assessing and predicting accurately the facial envelope in a three-dimensional manner.

Soft tissue changes related to the skeletal maxillary and/or mandibular movements have been classically studied in the lateral profile view from cephalometrics and ratios of soft to bone tissue movements established based on mean values of responses and on a simple correlation of one variable with another or using linear

regression equations [1-18]. In addition, these ratios have been calculated from linear changes limited to specific two-dimensional cephalometric landmarks in the midsagittal plane. This method is restrictive and its accuracy and reliability in predicting realistic profile changes is questionable since such an approach does not take into account the more complex geometrical three-dimensional interactions of highly variable individual parameters such as soft tissue tension, thickness, muscle strain, posture, and tonus. Furthermore, technical parameters, such as surgeon expertise and soft tissue closure, which include V-Y closure, alar base cinch, and anterior nasal spine modification, are variables that are difficult to account for in the prediction of final outcomes.

Computer imaging advancements in three-dimensional simulation have allowed for the use of image fusion technology to predict both skeletal and the associated soft tissue changes more accurately. Traditionally, several methods for the evaluation and prediction of facial soft tissue outcomes have been described in the literature and are separately reviewed in this chapter: (1) the lateral cephalometric "line drawing" tracing prediction (manual and computer assisted) [19-21]; (2) the photographic prediction [22, 23]; (3) the computerized video (digital) imaging (video cephalometrics) prediction [24-38]; (4) the three-dimensional computer-assisted prediction utilizing image fusion [39-51].

# 67.2 General Soft Tissue Effects

Many articles have been written about the soft tissue changes following orthognathic surgery. However, there are multifactorial variables that pose challenges to accurately predict the end soft-tissue aesthetic results. Use of rigid fixation has allowed the surgeon to accurately position the skeletal components in the final position, but soft tissue changes may be further affected by type of procedure [52, 53], wound closure technique [54, 55], adaptive qualities of the soft tissues, lip thickness and tone [4, 56], interlabial gap, dental positioning, including overjet and overbite, scar tissue, and amount of fatty and muscular tissue. Furthermore, a study by Betts found that soft tissue changes associated with maxillary surgery may be more affected by the position of the soft tissue incision and methods used in closure than by the surgically induced hard tissue change [57].

In addition to the surgical variables, it is critical to understand orthodontic treatment planning and its affects on soft tissue changes. Orthodontic changes will be mainly seen at the lip position, but the movement may not always be accurately predicted. The effects of ongoing growth, anterior nasal spine prominence, amount of overjet and overbite, adipose tissue, thin vs.

thick lips, and other factors may lead to lip positioning variability from patient to patient [58, 59]. When extractions are combined with orthodontic treatment preoperatively, soft tissue changes may be further affected when compared to a patient that does not undergo extractions. A meta-analysis showed a significant increase regarding the nasolabial angle, upper lip thickness, labrale superioris to E-Line, and labrale inferioris to E-line in the extraction group, suggesting the flattening of the profile following extraction treatment [60]. As a result, different orthodontic treatment philosophies may introduce even more variables that can affect the prediction of soft tissue changes.

Even though multifactorial variables exist patient-to-patient that can affect soft tissue prediction, studies have been able to describe the relationship of two specific points through ratio of soft to hard tissue movement. The next sections will outline general principles and associated ratios for soft tissue change utilizing the various modalities to predict soft tissue changes.

# 67.3 Lateral Cephalometric Prediction (Manual and Computer Assisted)

The cephalometric soft tissue and skeletal analysis for planning orthodontic treatment has been reported as early as the 1950s and rapidly became an irreplaceable tool in the evaluation and treatment planning process for patients who require orthognathic surgery [61]. The literature is replete with reports describing different methods of cephalometric analysis, planning, and prediction based on specific landmarks repositioning in response to determined skeletal movements [1-21, 24-38]. Three visual treatment objective methods have traditionally used: (1) the "cut-and-paste" technique, which involves manual cutting, moving, and repositioning of cephalometric acetate tracings to obtain the desired aesthetic profile as well as a Class I occlusal relationship [19, 21]; (2) the computer-assisted technique, which generates soft tissue prediction profile tracings by using software programs from the lateral cephalometric radiograph [20]; (3) the computer-assisted photographic imaging technique, which integrates digital images of the patient with the lateral cephalogram predicting a two-dimensional image simulation of the suitable skeletal and soft tissue profile outcome [24-38]. In all three techniques, the soft tissue profile is adjusted and changes are planned according to previously reported soft-to-bone tissue ratios. Factors influencing accuracy of such a prediction tracing include: understanding of profile planning, accuracy of surgery, degree of relapse, accuracy and reproducibility of tracings, soft-to-hard tissue ratio, reliability of cephalometrics and of photography,

and variation in lip posture limitation of two-dimensional planning. Authors comparing the accuracy and predictability of the manual versus computed technique have found quite similar values in mandibular advancement planning results with only a few points differing between prediction and outcomes of cephalometric tracings [5, 7]. Conversely, the hand technique has been found to be more accurate in the maxillary and bimaxillary prediction of soft tissue changes, particularly in the lip area [5].

Historically, the first studies on soft tissues changes after orthognathic surgery were directed to the lower lip and chin after mandibular procedures [62]. Conversely, it is not until the mid-1970s that the first reports on soft tissue changes associated with maxillary surgery (advancement, intrusion, retrusion, or bimaxillary) were published [2, 4, 11, 17]. This correlates with the evolution of orthognathic surgery from the lower jaw to the upper with increasing knowledge and skill.

# 67.3.1 Mandibular Surgery

The lower lip, the mento-labial fold (Mlf) and the neck-chin angle are the anatomical regions most strongly influenced by the anterior or posterior surgical repositioning of the mandible. The soft tissues of the mandible generally follow the hard tissue movements, except for the lower lip, which is also influenced by the contact with the upper lip, upper incisors, and surrounding musculature.

# 67.3.1.1 Mandibular Advancement

Mandibular advancement surgery mainly affects the soft tissue structures below the nasolabial sulcus. Changes in the upper lip (minor anterior movement) are usually negligible, temporary and only limited to patients with Class II deep-bite deformities [13, 63]. The lower lip is altered by a global reduction in thickness, lengthening, and straightening [64]. The chin area is affected by decreasing the lower labial sulcus or mento-labial fold depth. The lower lip also presents the most variable soft-to-bone tissue ratios, ranging from 0.38:1 to 0.80:1, contrary to the chin ratios, which are almost invariable in a 1:1 relationship, probably due to the tight attachment of the mental soft tissue to the underlying skeletal bases [1, 8, 11, 13, 14, 65] (Table 67.1). However, predicting the soft tissue changes based on bony movement does not correlate long-term [13].

# 67.3.1.2 Mandibular Setback

Mandibular setback surgery does not affect tissues superior to the subnasale. With mandibular horizontal retropositioning, the lower lip has been found to become

more everted and shorter [66], with a closure of the mentalabial fold, whereas the upper lip can sometimes be displaced posteriorly with a discrete opening of the nasolabial angle and overall lengthening [67]. The Li:L1 (labi inferiorus:lower incisor) ratio was around 0.6:1 and in the chin region,  $\mathrm{Pg}$  (pogonion') followed  $\mathrm{Pg}$  and the B point on an almost 1:1 ratio. These ratios have been constantly found in several studies, regardless of the magnitude of the setback movement [1, 20] (Table 67.2). However, the long-term soft-tissue changes do not correlate predictably to bony changes [68].

# 67.3.1.3 Genioplasty

Soft tissue changes following a genioplasty are predominantly observed in the chin region and less in the labiomental sulcus and lower lip [69]. The most unpredictable points when planning a genioplasty are the superior and inferior vermilion, as well as the  $\mathrm{Pg}$  and Me' [1, 5, 15].

Also, studies have shown a difference, although slight, between the sliding genioplasty and alloplastic genioplasty (Tables 67.3 and 67.4). The relationship between the soft tissue and bone is worst with the setback genioplasty, in which about half of the bony movement is lost because of the soft tissue response, which often can lead to a less than desirable result or a flat lower lip-chin relationship lacking the normal S curve (Table 67.5). Generally, the soft tissue changes followed the vertical elongation of the chin, but vertical reduction demonstrated a poor tissue-to-bone response (Table 67.6).

# 67.3.2 Maxillary Surgery

Soft tissue changes related to maxillary surgery have proven to be relatively more unpredictable than in the

mandibular surgery, regardless of the type and the amount of skeletal movement produced. The nasolabial angle and the upper lip are the anatomical regions most strongly influenced and the most variable, depending on the adjunctive soft tissue procedures and neuromuscular tone [70-72].

# 67.3.2.1 Maxillary Advancement

The main changes induced by this procedure are located in the nasal region and the upper lip. The vermilion border of the upper lip (Ls) typically advances horizontally with a rotational and translational movement around subnasale following the upper incisor (U1) in a soft-to-bone tissue ratios ranging from 0.33:1 to 0.9:1 [1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 18, 73]. The latter high value has been reported when a V-Y technique and nasal cinch for the closure of the maxillary vestibular incision is utilized, which prevented the thinning and shortening of the upper lip and widening of the nose invariably associated with maxillary advancements [3]. The thinning of the upper lip may result in the loss of the visible vermilion border, which is

aesthetically undesirable. The nasal effects imply a decreasing of the nasolabial angle, widening of the alar bases – which can be limited by using the alar base cinch suture procedure [55, 74] – deepening of the supratip break, and nasal tip elevation (1 mm for every 6 mm of superior movement of U1) [70, 71, 75]. In some patients, the tip elevation may produce positive aesthetic changes, such as the disappearance of the nasal hump that usually accompanies maxillary advancement or impaction [70, 71, 75] (Tables 67.7).

# 67.3.2.2 Maxillary Impaction

Surgical repositioning of the maxilla mainly affects the morphology of the nose and upper lip in both vertical and horizontal dimensions [1, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17]. The decrease in the amount of the visible vermilion due to an inward rolling of the upper lip, a down turning of the corners of the mouth and a widening of the alar base of the nose are the main undesirable aesthetic effects associated with the decrease of the face height resulting from this procedure. Some authors have clinically observed that probably such changes are mainly related to postoperative muscular reorientation of the oronasal area rather than to the amount of skeletal movement. The ratios of vertical shortening in the upper lip related to the superior impaction of the maxilla have been reported to range from 0.2:1 to 0.4:1 by authors who did not perform an anatomic reorientation of the facial muscles around the oronasal area. Conversely, it was shown that when a functional orientation of the musculature is accomplished (V-Y closure of maxillary vestibular incision and alar base cinch suture) the post-surgical lip closely approaches its pre-operative morphology, presenting only a minimal and negligible shortening  $(10\%)$  [15]. This finding is of significant importance in planning and predicting the final suitable vertical maxillary

impaction and the resultant lip-to-tooth relationship. Following the posterior maxillary intrusion, the soft tissue chin (Mlf and  $\mathrm{Pg}$  ) has been found to autorotate on the same arc as the bony chin in a 1:1 ratio, with the Mlf angle unfolded from the inferior labial sulcus [73] (Tables 67.8 and 67.9).

# 67.3.2.3 Maxillary Setback

The upper lip and the nasal soft tissues closely follow the skeletal movements posteriorly [1, 7, 12]. As observed in advancement and intrusion cases, there is also a widening of the alar bases with a tendency for the tip of the nose to rotate downward, with a resulting opening of the nasolabial angle [76]. This may, in some patients, result in a parrot's beak nasal appearance. The same deformity can also be found after inferior repositioning of the maxilla and down graft. There is also a tendency for the upper lip to thicken and shorten following the maxillary posterior movement (Table 67.10).

# 67.3.2.4 Bimaxillar Surgery

Different studies have confirmed that the soft tissue response associated with double jaw surgery is similar to those found in single jaw procedures [9], with the exception of vertical movement of the lower lip and chin [23, 27, 29, 77]. However, there is scarce literature on the soft tissue effects following maxillomandibular advancement surgery in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patients are typically older, have more laxity in their tissue, and are more obese, which allows the soft tissue drape to react less to the large bony advancements greater than  $10\mathrm{mm}$ . Furthermore, counterclockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex may augment the aesthetic results in OSA patients by allowing the surgeon to lessen the amount of advancement but still adequately alleviate the obstruction in the posterior airway [78, 79]. A study by Conley and Boyd showed that MMA in OSA patients resulted in soft tissue to hard tissue ratio of about 0.90:1 for most anatomic sites of the upper lip, lower lip, and chin [80]. Studies have also shown that OSA patients generally approve of the final aesthetic result following MMA surgery [81, 82]. Generally, the OSA patients have profound variabilities that make the soft tissue prediction model challenging following skeletal surgery.

# 67.4 Photographic Prediction

First described by Henderson in 1974, the photographic soft tissue profile planning technique has been progressively abandoned due to the difficulty in correctly obtaining a satisfactory superimposition of an enlarged photograph on the cephalometric radiograph and the evolution of more sophisticated techniques [22].

techniques have used Moiré stereophotogrammetry. In general, these techniques are little used today.

# 67.4.1 Computerized Digital Video Imaging

Visual treatment objective (VTO) has been done by manual creation of simulated treatment tracings based on cephalometric radiographs. The first computer-based cephalometric systems appeared in the late 1970s [83]. At present, a number of two-dimensional computer-assisted imaging systems allow image fusion of photographs,

tracings, and radiographs. These computer-assisted programs permit rapid measurement and treatment planning of the skeletal and soft tissue. The validity and reliability of these systems are limited by their two-dimensional nature when dealing with a three-dimensional object [84]. The first reports on the video imaging techniques in the late 1980s dramatically changed the concept and the approach of the treatment planning and counseling in orthognathic surgery. These techniques enabled the superimposition of the lateral cephalometric radiographs and/or tracings on a two-dimensional patient's digital profile image, thus allowing the visual-

ization as well as the manipulation of parts of the image in order to simulate the suitable aesthetic results according to the movement of the underlying maxillary bone [25-27, 29]. Moreover, computer imaging provides a more realistic and tangible image of the treatment compared to the traditional "line drawing" cephalometric profile tracings of the surgical simulation. The two main advantages in using this technique are (1) the facilitation and enhancement of the communication between the orthodontist and/or the surgeon and the patient; and (2) the capability of helping in the preoperative treatment planning by manipulating the images until the desired soft tissue profile is achieved. Studies have shown that  $89\%$  of surgical candidates who underwent this technique found their two-dimensional image predictions realistic and considered that the desired result was achieved [31, 33]. Moreover,  $83\%$  of patients found that this technique was useful in deciding whether or not to undergo orthognathic surgery [31, 33]. The most prob

lematic and challenging parameter to solve is to accurately calculate the postoperative soft to hard tissue changes given the variability of the soft tissue thickness, tonicity, as well as translations relative to bony changes and the two dimensionality of the system. For the moment, the currently used commercial preprogrammed algorithms are based on clinically retrospective studies of stability of the soft tissues following bone and dental movements and use default soft to hard tissues ratios. The utilization of such default ratios accounts for some of the variability and inaccuracy in predicting the soft tissue outcome regardless of the technique, manual versus computed. Studies revealed several specifics concerning the accuracy and reliability of predictions regardless of the software program used: (1) upper and lower lips are the least accurately predictable regions, probably due to a high individual variability in thickness and tonicity; (2) the vertical plane prediction changes are generally more accurate than in the sagittal plane; (3) sagittal

# 67.4.1.1 Mandibular Advancement

Dentofacial Planner Plus and Quick Ceph Image software programs have been found to be relatively accurate in predicting changes in the lower third of the face associated with mandibular advancement [24, 35]. Changes of reference points between the computer's predicted and posttreatment tracings in the lower lip in the vertical plane are more predictable than in the sag

ittal plane, thus the final preoperative computed prediction usually tends to be more protrusive than the actual value, whereas the opposite is true in the chin area, with a soft tissue Pogonion  $(\mathrm{Po}^{\prime})$  which tends to be more superior [24, 35]. An overall predictability of more than  $80\%$  can be attained particularly in the lip area, whereas the least predictable region is the submental area [24, 35]. On the contrary, authors who tested the Prescription Planner/Portrait software found that the computer-predicted lower lip was more retrusive and thinner than on the actual profile and they

found no differences between patients who underwent mandibular advancement alone versus associated with genioplasty [36, 37].

# 67.4.1.2 Mandibular Setback

The only available study used Quick Ceph Image and Portrait Planner software programs and showed that (1) the results were accurate enough for use in communication and patient education; (2)  $30\%$  of the sample showed significant errors greater than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  and these errors were bigger in the vertical plane in the area of the lower lip, with a tendency to underestimate the amount of lip retraction, and also in the chin area; (3) the accuracy and predictability were not as good as in mandibular advancements, probably owing to the technique of image compression; and (4) both software programs showed similar results [26].

# 67.4.1.3 Bimaxillary Surgery

Several studies evaluating the accuracy of computerized surgical prediction methods using the Quick Ceph Image software program showed that the most important discrepancies between the computer-generated tracing versus the actual tracing were the following: (1) the lower lip tended to be predicted more inferior, shorter, and more protrusive than on the actual profile; (2) the upper lip shorter, with the superior labial sulcus located more posterior than on the actual profile; and (3) the soft tissue Pogonion  $(\mathrm{Pg}^{\prime})$  located more inferior than on the actual profile. These differences have been found to be probably related to the inaccuracy and variability of the default soft to hard tissue ratios used by the software rather than to the type of maxillary movement, association of mandibular or genioplasty procedure, or type of closure of the Le Fort I incision (V-Y versus non V-Y) [38].

Authors who have tested the DentoFacial Planner software in predicting changes in patients who underwent a Le Fort I procedure (advancement and intrusion) found that the nasal tip and the subnasale on the computer prediction were more posterior than on the actual profile [28].

# 67.4.1.4 Maxillary Impaction

The utilization of Orthognathic Treatment Planner (OPT) and Prescription Portrait software programs have shown a good global accuracy and reliability to within  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the majority of the measurements, but better in the sagittal plane [30].

# 67.4.2 Three-Dimensional Computer-Assisted Prediction

The foremost critique, which could be addressed to the previous methods of prediction, is that the analyses were based on two-dimensional lateral cephalograms, whereas the actual soft tissue changes are of course always three-dimensional. For this reason, current efforts are all directed in developing, as accurately as possible, a reliable and easily usable three-dimensional computer-treatment planning software to predict the facial soft tissue outcome in response to skeletal movements as closely as possible to reality.

In the early 1980s, different authors, supported by the advances in three-dimensional CT scanning techniques, pointed out the importance of the management of the third dimension in the evaluation and surgical planning of craniofacial surgery, inaugurating a new and exciting era [40, 45]. The first rudimentary computer-assisted software programs were at the beginning elaborated only for planning osteotomies and bone relocation, without taking into account the soft tissue envelope changes [40, 45]. In the mid-1990s, the need to improve the 3D soft tissue representation and prediction gave rise to a tremendous impetus, which led to a plethora of more or less reliable and accurate computer systems [39, 43, 46]. One of the most used methods in assessing the three-dimensional details of the face is based on CBCT scan data, which allows the separate visualization of the different constituents of the facial anatomy, thus enabling the surgeon to differentiate and separately manipulate the bone from the air and soft-tissue surfaces [39, 41-44, 46-50].

Even though the CBCT scan has the capacity of displaying both bone and soft tissue details, the three-dimensional reconstructed soft tissue images are generally incomplete and not lifelike. For this reason, some authors have recommended the simultaneous use of laser surface scanner images, or photogrammetric images, which are merged with the scan images, in order to improve the quality and accuracy of the production of the three-dimensional facial morphology [41, 42, 85].

Dolphin Imaging software can integrate and superimpose traditional two-dimensional photographs with digital two-dimensional lateral and frontal cephalometric radiographs. Two-dimensional photographs can also be imported and wrapped onto three-dimensional CBCT and CT images for presentation purposes (Figs. 67.1, 67.2, 67.3, and 67.4). Dolphin Imaging allows the operator to use both orthogonal and perspective projection-type cephalometric renderings. Visualization filters can then be applied and transparency adjusted for viewing the soft and hard tissues. Virtual orientation of the face-imaging space using the semitransparent filter allows the oper

ator to rotate and orient the virtual patients, optimally matching bilateral and anatomical structures. Simulation of surgical results and soft tissue movement is only possible in the two-dimensional environment. Traditionally, in photogrammetry, as seen previously, separate three-dimensional data sets (each containing its own coordinate system) are generated for each viewpoint as a range map

and are subsequently stitched together to produce a new overall three-dimensional coordinate system. Stitching multiple sides together has historically worked well for data input of "inanimate objects," where motion is not a factor. This technique does not work well when the subjects are animate, because "stitching" separate three-dimensional images together to generate a single

three-dimensional model of the patient can compromise accuracy due to the discontinuity of surface information. There is no guarantee that two separate images taken at different points of time with the movement factor will still match and can result in a fracture of information along the midline. This compromises accuracy. The preferable way to generate a three-dimensional surface image derived from multiple viewpoints is to generate a single unified and continuous coordinate system by selecting the best

quality data for any given xyz coordinate from each of the viewpoints. For this to work the reconstructive algorithms must be able to place a value on the quality of each point generated. This is the great advantage of using active photogrammetry and very fast capture time incorporated in systems such as the 3dMD system. A study that looked at the precision and accuracy of the 3dMD photogrammetric system showed that a mean global error of  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  (range,  $0.1 - 0.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) for mannequin head measurements

and that this system can be recommended for evaluation and documentation of the facial surface and could offer new opportunities in reconstructive, orthognathic, and craniofacial surgery [86].

The importance of three-dimensional virtual surgical planning increases with the complexity of the deformity and reconstruction needed to correct it. Three-dimensional image fusion has further increased the importance and accuracy of virtual treatment planning, and several systems are now available. At the center of the three-dimensional approach is the "Patient-Specific Anatomic Reconstruction" (PSAR), which is an anatomically accurate record in which all of the patient's 3D images are superimposed into one valid 3D structure and combined with the relevant biomechanical properties, which is called Image Fusion [84, 87]. The following are potential advantages of registering anatomically accurate three-dimensional facial surface images to CT/CBCT datasets:

1. Surface images may correct for CBCT surface artifacts of the soft tissue caused by patient movement.  
2. Independently acquired surface images compensate for soft tissue compression from upright CBCT device stabilization aids (i.e., chin rest, forehead restraint) or from supine soft tissue draping changes.  
3. Surface images most notably may supplement missing anatomical data (e.g., nose, chin).  
4. Surface images may provide a more accurate representation of the soft tissue that reflects the patient's natural head position for diagnosis and treatment planning.

In relation to surface three-dimensional construction, a surface image has two components, the geometry of the face and the color information, also called texture map, that is mathematically applied to the shape information.

Stereo photogrammetry is the optical method of obtaining an image by means of one or more stereo pairs of photographs taken simultaneously. The concept was first applied to the face as early as 1967 [88]. This technique differs from the other optics-based methods in that it requires no special pattern projection and the subject can be illuminated with regular photographic flash. Studies analyzing the 3D geometry have reported accurate identification of facial landmarks from  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  to  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  [89-92].

In the early 2000s, studies were focused mainly on the generation of real-time and mathematical realistic modeling of non-linear three-dimensional soft tissue deformations occurring simultaneously with the underlying bone movements, such as the CASP technique (computer-assisted three-dimensional virtual reality soft tissue planning and prediction for orthognathic sur

gery). The CASP technique is based on three-dimensional reconstructed CT images combined with surface data as follows: (1) processing of CT data using a specific algorithm and soft tissue and bone segmentation; (2) generation of a three-dimensional color individualizing facial model by mixing digitized color photographs with the reconstructed three-dimensional soft tissue (color facial texture-mapping technique); (3) utilization of two separate algorithms to study the soft tissue model deformation [48-51]. The final result is a virtual reality workbench, which allows a real-time generation of individualized predicted and animated color facial models resulting from translation and rotation of the underlying bone.

Recent studies have described 3D soft tissue prediction procedures using two different mathematical simulation models based on the finite element method (FEM) or mass spring. Studies have shown the sound superiority of the three-dimensional technique over the two-dimensional software programs in predicting the lower third of the face, especially in the lip and chin areas [41, 42]. This type of technique is seen in the 3dMDface [93], Vultus™ System, which allows the capture of the face surface by using a multiple camera views synchronized in a single capture to produce a single 3D polygon surface mesh. The surfaces images obtained with no radiation are then visualized and manipulated by using a specific software platform.

# 67.4.2.1 Workup

Initiation of the patient Workup requires collecting, cataloging, and archiving of all relevant 3D image datasets related to one point in time, referred to as an episode of care. Registration of the datasets could be performed using fiducial markers, but there are considerable workflow and quality drawbacks to this method, including the additional time needed to place the markers themselves and image distortion. A more direct method is to do a best-fit scenario between the data sets. The first step in this registration process entails segmentation of the outer surface of the CBCT data to generate a separate object that represents the outer geometry keeping the original spatial relationship (DICOM skin). Next, the geometry of the 3D optical surface image is registered to the DICOM skin, which acts as the reference object to ensure that the 3D surface adopts the coordinate system of the DICOM upon completion. If the software is well designed and user-friendly, superimposition should only take less than 30 seconds to complete. After registration, numerous options allow interaction with the datasets by either rendering the volumes independently or sepa

rately, including scrolling through the volume in 3D or simultaneously in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes.

Simulation refers to an imitation of a real-world process in a computer program using mathematical models to study the effects of the changing parameters and conditions to make a decision. Computer-based simulation gives the clinician the opportunity to perform virtual surgery or treatment, increasing the possibility of a successful outcome with no risk to the patient.

The Mass-Spring Model technique of simulation involves implementing a biomechanical model that defines the relationship between the hard and soft tissue with hundreds of thousands of non-linear connector points. This generates three-dimensional deformable tis

sue models that include spring-based force computations to model the physical characteristics of real tissue reactions. This mechanism simulates deformable tissues, such as the soft tissue of the face. The models employ force computations from physical laws and study of facial surgery cases and apply these forces to the three-dimensional model components. The computations modeled include tissue deformation and relaxation, external forces such as gravity, and three-dimensional collision detection with force feedback. The advantage of this approach is that computations are well within the power of available PCs and occur in real time.

all three planes of space are then automatically generated (Fig. 67.6a, b). The soft tissue is simultaneously reconstructed and the final aesthetic result can be seen in the virtual environment (Fig. 67.7). Surgery can then proceed along these guidelines (Fig. 67.8). The actual soft tissue changes occurring with surgery can be visualized in a histogram with the actual spot measure

ments recorded (Fig. 67.9). We have found this system to be accurate for advancement surgery of either the maxilla or Mandible (Fig. 67.10). Inaccuracies in the soft tissue simulation arise when vertical movements are undertaken or when there is preexisting soft tissue deformation from the device or muscle hyperfunction in the original data set. Also, soft tissue variations occur according to how each surgeon handles the soft tissues and what adjunctive techniques are performed. Because of these facts, the soft tissue simulation module should include the ability to rearrange the tissues based on the surgeon's experience. The Vultus system has such an option and we have found it very accurate when this is done.

# Conclusion

Correctly planning and accurately predicting surgical outcome is paramount in facial surgery. Gossett et al. [94] have outlined a threefold purpose for computer-simulated predictions: (1) guide the treatment to the desired result; (2) give the patient a reasonable preview of the outcome; and (3) serve as a communication tool between orthodontist, surgeon, and patient. Advancements in computer imaging have revolutionized the treatment of dentofacial deformities and, specifically, orthognathic surgery [93, 95-98]. Use of this image fusion technology now permits the creation of patient-specific anatomical reconstructions (PSAR) on a routine basis and a more comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan can thus be obtained. Both skeletal and the associated soft tissue changes thus become more accurate and predictable. At this point, no system is fully automatic, but the present systems provide a great improvement over the old two-dimensional soft tissue calculations. Surgeon experience and insight are still an important part of obtaining the desired functional and aesthetic result. In the end, treatment outcomes are improved. The ideal system would predict the soft tissue behavior resulting from the movements of the underlying bone and transfer of the ideal and customized computerized surgical plan to the operating room. In conclusion, it should be kept in mind that all previously mentioned prediction techniques are strongly dependent on rapidly developing technology, subject to daily improvements. Different studies have shown that the accuracy and reliability are far from perfect yet, but these are constantly improving [99, 100].
