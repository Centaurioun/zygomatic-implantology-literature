# 51.1 Introduction

Diseases and disorders of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and its associated structures are very commonly encountered by the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. Despite the high prevalence, signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) not only vary, but also substantially overlap with various other clinical entities, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and mistargeted management strategies. [1-4] In addition, the wide range of practitioners involved in the diagnosis and management of TMD, and significant heterogeneity in recommendations [5] further complicate appropriate diagnosis and care in a standardized fashion. The prudent clinician must base his/her management of TMD on an in-depth understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the TMJ apparatus. This chapter will focus on the clinical anatomy and pathophysiology of the TMJ and its associated structures, which should form the foundation in the diagnosis and management of diseases and disorders of the TMJ.

# 51.2 Overall Anatomy

The TMJ complex consists of the mandibular condyle which articulates against the articular fossa of the temporal bone; the articular disk; retrodiskal tissue; synovium; ligaments; and associated muscles. It is unique in that there is bilateral articulation, as well as a rigid closure due to occlusion of the teeth [3]. Functionally, the TMJ is a compound joint, with four articulating surfaces: (1) articular surface of the temporal bone; (2) mandibular condyle; (3) superior surface of the articular disk; and (4) inferior surface of the articular disk. The articular disk translates along the articular surface of the temporal bone, and the condyle undergoes rotational hinge movement against the articular disk. This hinge-glide function makes the TMJ a gingly-moarthroidal joint.

# Important Points

The TMJ complex consists of intra- and extra-articular structures that work in coordination to perform a wide variety of movements.  
The articulating surface and the disk of the TMJ are adaptable, but delicate structures can be affected by mechanical stress.

# 51.3 Osseous Structures

The articular part of the temporal bone consists of the articular fossa, the articular eminence, and the preglenoid plane (Fig. 51.1a-c). The articular fossa is a concavity that extends from the external acoustic meatus to the posterior slope of the articular eminence and is very thin. The articular eminence is a bony prominence situated anterior to the articular fossa. The eminence is prominent in the anteroposterior direction, and rather concave in the mediolateral direction. The preglenoid plane is a flattened portion anterior to the articular eminence.

The mandible is a horseshoe-shaped bone with paired condyles that articulate with the temporal bone. While there can be significant variations, the average mediolateral width of the condyle is  $20\mathrm{mm}$  [6], and the anteroposterior width is approximately  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$ , giving the condyle an elliptical shape when viewed from the superior (Fig. 51.2). The axes of the condyles form an angle of approximately  $145^{\circ}$  to  $160^{\circ}$  to one another axially. There is a depression on the medial aspect of the condyle, immediately below its articular surface. This depression is called the pterygoid fovea, which is where the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle inserts.

# 51.4 Cartilage and Synovium

The articular surfaces of the fossa and the condyle are covered with dense fibrocartilage, which is capable of regenerating and remodeling under functional loading. This is different from other synovial joints, which are usually covered with hyaline cartilage. Histologically, there is a proliferative zone of cells under the cartilage layer that undergoes major changes under functional stresses. These cells then may develop into either cartilage or osseous tissue.

In the articular cartilage (Fig. 51.3), chondrocytes are housed in hollow spaces (lacunae), within an intercellular matrix consisting of collagen fibers, water, and

ground substance. The chondrocytes are arranged in three different layers, each with different histological characteristics. The superficial zone is characterized by small, flattened chondrocytes oriented parallel to the surface. The middle zone is characterized by larger, rounded chondrocytes oriented perpendicular to the surface. In the deep zone, the chondrocytes are largest, and a demarcation can be seen in the deep portion where some calcification is present ("tide mark"). Because there is a paucity of blood vessels, the articular cartilage receives nourishment via diffusion from the synovial fluid.

The collagen fibers in the articular cartilage form an interlocking meshwork of fibrils that is parallel to the surface, and join as bundles as they attach in the calcified cartilage between the tide marks. This mesh-like structure allows interstitial water and ground substance to resist compressive forces. The ground substance consists of plasma proteins, glucose urea, salts, and proteoglycans. Proteoglycans consist of a protein core with several attached glycosaminoglycan chains of chondroitin sulfate and keratin sulfate. Proteoglycans help with diffusion of nutrients and metabolic byproducts. Ground substance allows influx and efflux of large

quantities of water, which imparts elasticity to the articular cartilage.

The synovial membrane is a thin, smooth, richly innervated, and vascular tissue that lines the capsular ligament. It serves multiple roles including phagocytosis, secretion, and production of hyaluronic acid, which

is a glycosaminoglycan in synovial fluid. Some synovial cells are thought to be capable of differentiating into chondrocytes. Synovial fluid is an ultrafiltrate of plasma and is present in the joint cavity, and approximately  $1 - 2\mathrm{mL}$  is present in a healthy TMJ [7]. It serves to lubricate the joint, and to transport nutrients and metabolic byproducts between the vascularized synovium and the avascular articular cartilage. Joint lubrication is thought to be a complex process involving the viscosity of synovial fluid and the ability of the articular cartilage to permit free entry and exit of water within the pores of its glycosaminoglycan matrix. It has been theorized that water is expelled from the articular cartilage from an area under load, into the synovial fluid. The concentration of hyaluronic acid and the viscosity of the synovial fluid are greater at the point of maximal load, resulting in protection of the articular surfaces. As the load is distributed throughout the joint surfaces, the deformation is transferred, and the original point of load regains its shape and thickness by reabsorbing water from the synovial fluid. While the exact mechanisms of fluid balance between the articular cartilage and the synovial fluid are unclear, the net result is a 14-fold decrease in coefficient of friction when compared to a dry joint.

# 51.5 Articular Disk and Retrodiskal Tissue

The articular disk is a nonvascularized and noninnervated structure composed of dense fibrous connective tissue (Fig. 51.4). It has a biconcave structure and can be divided into three portions based on thickness. The anterior band is situated under the articular eminence

![](images/417b53fe426bc41a3b0408c7e63ed25563c3e99c18fd1fbf0b72ce3e976792f3.jpg)

and attaches to the joint capsule and the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The intermediate zone, which forms the central portion of the disk, is thinnest and is positioned between the posterior slope of the articular eminence and the condyle. The posterior band sits above the superior part of the condyle and is connected to the temporal bone by the retrodskal tissue. The medial and lateral portions of the disk are thicker than the central portion and attach to the joint capsule. The disk separates the superior and inferior joint spaces, and the thick posterior band is positioned superior to the condyle [8] when the mandible is in centric relation.

The retrodiskal tissue is a highly vascular and innervated structure that consists of loose connective tissue and elastic fibers [8]. This structure is often referred to as the "bilaminar zone" because of the structural characteristics of the superior lamina (mainly loose fibroelastic tissue) and the inferior lamina (mainly collagen fibers). The retrodiskal tissue stabilizes the disk by counteracting the anterior pull by the lateral pterygoid muscle. It is also covered by synovial membrane, and therefore plays a significant role in synovial fluid production and metabolism.

# 51.6 Ligaments

Ligaments in the TMJ complex serve to stabilize the condyle and the disk during movement. There are three major (collateral, capsular, and temporomandibular), and two accessory (sphenomandibular and stylomandibular) ligaments.

The collateral ligaments (also referred to as the diskal ligaments) are nonelastic connective tissue fibers

that attach to the medial and lateral poles of the condyle, and blend with the capsular ligament (Fig. 51.5a). The collateral ligaments attach the disk to the lateral and medial poles of the condyle. These ligaments stabilize the disk by restricting its movement away from the condyle, thereby allowing the disk-condyle complex in unison. Although some rotation of the condyle occurs in relation to the disk, tight attachment of the collateral ligaments allows the disk to accompany the condyle during translatory movements [9].

The capsular ligament covers the joint and surrounds the joint space and the disk-condyle complex (Fig. 51.5a). Superiorly, it attaches to the temporal bone along the border of the mandibular fossa and the articular eminence. Inferiorly, it attaches to the condylar neck. The capsular ligament holds together and stabilizes the joint by resisting medial, lateral, and inferior forces, and restricts extreme range of motion. Secondarily, it serves to contain synovial fluid in the joint space.

The lateral aspect of the TMJ is covered by the temporomandibular ligaments, which is composed of the outer oblique and inner horizontal portions (Fig. 51.5b). The outer oblique portion attaches at the lateral aspect of the articular tubercle of the temporal bone, and the posterolateral aspect of the neck of the condyle. The outer oblique portion resists inferior distraction of the condyle such as in translation and rotation. The inner horizontal portion also attaches to the lateral aspect of the articular tubercle, but just medial to the attachment of the outer oblique portion. It runs posteriorly in a horizontal direction and attaches to the lateral pole of the condyle and the posterior aspect of the disk. The inner horizontal portion's function is to limit posterior movement of the condyle (especially during

![](images/14c444e1e16848857706d48d5905f2a992d59bc97d46bc8a18d4f2dc9846f05c.jpg)

pivoting movements like lateral excursive movements), which protects the retrodiskal tissues.

The sphenomandibular and stylomandibular ligaments serve as passive restraints on mandibular movement. The sphenomandibular ligament attaches superiorly to the spine of the sphenoid bone, and inferiorly to the lingual of the mandible and the inferomedial aspect of the neck of the condyle (Fig. 51.6). Besides stabilizing the mandible during movement, it also serves to some extent as a point of rotation during action of the lateral pterygoid muscles, thereby contributing to translation movements. The stylomandibular ligament attaches superiorly to the styloid process, and inferiorly to the posterior aspect of the mandibular angle, and also blends with the medial pterygoid muscle. Its functions are similar to that of the sphenomandibular ligament.

# 51.7 Vascular Supply and Innervation

The main vascular supplies of the TMJ are branches of the superficial temporal and maxillary arteries, as well as the masseteric artery. The superficial temporal and maxillary artery branches supply the anterior part of the TMJ, while the masseteric artery supplies the posterior. Posteriorly, there is a rich venous plexus that is

associated with the retrodiskal tissues. This plexus is filled and emptied with anterior and posterior movements of the jaw, respectively. The innervation to the TMJ is primarily from branches of the auriculotemporal. The masseteric and posterior deep temporal nerves also innervate the TMJ. Many of the nerves innervating the TMJ appear to be vasomotor and vasosensory. They may also have a role in the production of synovial fluid.

# 51.8 Musculature

The main movers of the mandible, or the muscles of mastication, are the temporalis, masseter, and the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles. These paired muscles function together symmetrically or asymmetrically to produce rotational and translational movements. For example, symmetrical contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscle produces protrusion and depression of the mandible, whereas asymmetric contraction results in deviation to the contralateral side.

Depending on the position, perimandibular musculature can be classified as supramandibular or inframandibular. The supramandibular muscles—temporalis, masseter, medial, and lateral pterygoid—primarily attach to the ramus and neck of the condyle, and their primary action is elevation of the mandi

![](images/44fb51a63c7e1873b3238b6b844e6fa1aa2dee83ad3659586aff92b3c8ae1c45.jpg)

ble. The lateral pterygoid muscle, however, also has a depression function [10]. The inframandibular muscles attach to the body and symphysis region of the mandible as well as to the hyoid bone. These include the four suprahyoid muscles (digastric, geniohyoid, mylohyoid, and stylohyoid) and four infrahyoid muscles ( sternohyoid, omohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid). The inframandibular muscles are primarily mandibular depressors. The suprahyoid muscles depress the mandible when the hyoid bone is fixed, and they also elevate the hyoid bone when the mandible is fixed. The infrahyoid muscles fix the hyoid bone during depressive mandibular movements.

# 51.8.1 Supramandibular Muscle Group

The temporalis muscle is a major mandibular elevator muscle. It has a broad fan shape and originates from the temporal line of the parietal bone as well as the sphenoid bone, and inserts at the coronoid process and the retromolar fossa (Fig. 51.7a). Based on the direction of the fibers, the temporalis muscle can be divided into three portions (anterior, middle, and posterior). The anterior portion consists of vertically oriented fibers, and primarily functions to elevate the mandible. The middle portion consists of oblique fiber, and the posterior portion consists of semihorizontal fibers. Because of the orientation of their fibers, both the middle and posterior portions also contribute to retrusion of the mandible. When viewed from the coronal aspect,

the fibers originating from the skull insert at the medial surface of the coronoid process, while the fibers originating from the more lateral temporalis fascia insert at the lateral surface of the coronoid process.

The masseter muscle is a powerful mandibular elevator muscle. It has a rectangular shape, originates from the zygomatic arch and the posterior aspect of the zygoma, and inserts on the mandibular angle. This muscle is divided into a superficial and deep portion (Fig. 51.7b). The superficial masseter originates from the inferior border of the zygoma and the anterior two-thirds of the zygomatic arch before inserting on the mandibular angle. The superficial masseter has alternating tendinous plates and bundles of muscle fibers, which allows increase in the power of the muscle. The deep portion originates from the medial aspect of the zygomatic arch and the posterior one-third of the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. When functioning independently or reciprocally, the superficial and deep masseters produce movements other than elevation of the mandible. Electromyographic studies show that the deep masseter is active during forced retrusion, whereas the superficial masseter is active during protrusive movements [11].

The medial pterygoid muscle is also a mandibular elevator muscle and, together with the masseter, forms the pterygomasseteric sling. The medial pterygoid muscle is rectangular-shaped; originates from the pterygoid fossa, the internal surface of the lateral pterygoid plate, and the maxillary tuberosity and the palatine bone; and inserts on the medial surface of the mandible, mostly at

the mandibular angle (Fig. 51.7c). Similar to the masseter muscle, the fibers of the medial pterygoid muscles have alternating layers of muscle and tendinous parts, which allows generation of more power. While the primary function is elevation of the mandible, the medial pterygoid muscle somewhat contributes to unilateral protrusion via independent function and can work synergistically with the lateral pterygoid muscle.

The lateral pterygoid muscle consists of the inferior head and the superior head (Fig. 51.7c). The larger inferior head originates from the lateral aspect of the lateral pterygoid plate, and inserts into the pterygoid

fovea of the mandibular condyle. The relatively smaller superior head originates from the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and inserts on the superior part of the pterygoid fovea, as well as on the joint capsule, articular disk, and the medial pole of the mandibular condyle. It has been shown in anatomic studies that most of the fibers of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle attach to the condyle rather than the disk. Both the inferior and superior heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle work in an independent and reciprocal manner. [11, 12] When the inferior head functions bilaterally, it produces a protrusive movement which pulls the disk-con

dyle complex anteriorly, causing a slide along the surface of the articular eminence, thereby opening the jaw. On unilateral function, the inferior head produces contralateral laterotrusive motion. The superior head, on the other hand, is involved with closing movements of the jaw, as well as retrusion and ipsilateral movement.

# 51.8.2 Inframandibular Muscle Group

The inframandibular muscles consist of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles. The suprahyoid muscles are the digastric, geniohyoid, mylohyoid, and stylohyoid muscles. As the name implies, these are run between the mandible and the hyoid bone and function to raise the hyoid bone (if the mandible is in a fixed position) or assist to depress the mandible (if the hyoid bone is fixed). The infrahyoid muscles are the sternohyoid, omohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid muscles. These muscles serve to either depress the hyoid bone or hold it in position during movement of the mandible.

# 51.9 Biomechanics of TMJ Movement

As a ginglymoarthroidal joint, the TMJ is capable of rotation and translation. Rotational and translatory movements can occur in unison or independently to produce various complex movements. This complexity of the TMJ is what allows excellent range of motion.

Rotation, or hinge-like movement, occurs in the inferior joint space between the inferior surface of the articular disk and the superior surface of the condyle. This pure hinge-like motion can in theory produce an interincisal opening of approximately  $25\mathrm{mm}$ . Translation occurs in the superior joint space between the articular surface of the temporal bone and the superior surface of the disk. Most mandibular movements involve some translator movement. The combination of rotation and translation is called the translatory cycle and begins from a rest position, which is determined by tone of the perimandibular musculature. Separation of the jaws initially occurs with rotary movement of the condyle against the inferior surface of the disk. During the "forward phase," the disk-condyle complex moves anteriorly and inferiorly along the posterior slope of the articular eminence, and then along the anterior slope. In the "return phase," the disk-condyle complex returns to its baseline position via the same path. Differences in the type of mandibular movement are determined by the laterality and degree of rotation combined with translation [13]. For such complex movements to be possible, adequate stability of the TMJ complex is required. This is provided by the various ligaments, which provide passive restriction during extreme ranges of motion.

# 51.10 Pathology of the TMJ and Associated Structures

# Important Points

TMD is a broad term encompassing a heterogeneous group of pathology affecting the TMJ and associated structures.  
The clinician must be able to differentiate the various conditions affecting the TMJ apparatus based on a thorough knowledge of anatomy and pathophysiology, as well as on accurate clinical examination and appropriate ancillary tests.  
- Various classification systems exist, each with a variable emphasis on comprehensiveness, standardization, and reproducibility.

Pathology of the TMJ and associated structures are collectively referred to as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). It is important not to confuse this term for diseases or disorders of the TMJ itself, as TMD encompasses both intra- and extra-articular pathology. This section will focus on pathology of the TMJ.

# 51.10.1 Epidemiology

Because of a lack of standardization in TMD diagnosis and classification, the reported prevalence of TMDs varies considerably. Among the general population, the prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMD is reported to be as high as  $40\%$  to  $60\%$  [14]. However, a systematic review with meta-analysis using a standardized diagnostic criteria [15] reported a prevalence of TMD ranging from  $6\%$  to  $13.3\%$ ,  $8.9\%$  to  $15.8\%$  for disk displacements, and  $8.9\%$  for arthralgia. There is also a heavy female sex predilection.

# 51.10.2 Types of TMJ Pathology

There are numerous classification systems for TMJ pathology, each with a different emphasis. For example, some systems classify based on etiology and pathogenesis [16], while others aim to standardize the diagnostic criteria to maximize reliability and minimize variability. An example of the latter is the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD), which is the most widely accepted protocol for both research and clinical use [1]. A modification of the RDC/TMD was developed to improve the validity and to emphasize the clinical aspect of the classification. This led to the development of the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) [17]. Despite these developments, both the RDC/TMD and the DC/TMD are limited to common TMDs, as diag

nostic criteria couldn't be reliably established for the less common conditions.

To overcome these limitations, the Consortium Network of the International Association for Dental Research and the Orofacial Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain

developed an expanded TMD taxonomy (▶ Box 51.1) [18]. This framework will be used when describing the various types of TMJ pathology. Regardless of the classification system used, it is important for the clinician to accurately assess the patient's condition to render appropriate treatment targeting the correct source(s).

This broad category includes arthralgia (localized pain in the joint replicated on clinical examination and corroborated by history) and arthritis (arthralgia with inflammatory component). Both arthralgia and arthritis can accompany other TMJ pathology such as disk displacement. The generic nature of this category should not be seen as a diagnosis but rather a "qualifier" for a condition that may help the clinician determine the need for (and type of) intervention.

# 51.10.4 Joint Disorders

# 51.10.4.1 Disk Displacement (Internal Derangement)

Displacement of the articular disk is the most common joint disorder [15] and involves deviation of the disk from its physiologic position. While the most common direction of displacement is anterior and medial (Fig. 51.8a, b), the disk can be displaced in other directions [19-23].

![](images/6f06692a50b4c328b7a62a5808726c817172398ff4a522ac747f01b0d1009845.jpg)

Deformation can sometimes occur in the displaced disk. Macroscopically, the posterior band can thicken and the length of the disk may decrease [8], and frank perforations may occur in chronically displaced disks. Histologically, hyalinization, calcium deposits, and abnormal patterns of collagen can be observed. [24, 25] The retrodiskal tissues also undergo changes, including narrowing of vessel lumen, fibrosis, and hyalinization of loose connective tissue [8].

Clinically, a displaced disk generally manifests as joint noise (displacement with reduction), and sometimes pain (arthralgia) or limitation of jaw movement (displacement without reduction with limited opening). Progression from a reducing disk to a nonreducing disk is not very common [26, 27]. Although rare, displacement of the disk can alter the occlusion [21, 28, 29] and is mostly seen in posteriorly displaced disks.

It is important to note that disk displacement is a broad category and may not necessarily always indicate a pathologic process requiring active intervention. Disk displacements often present minimal to no symptoms, and one study showed no correlation between disk position and jaw pain, function, and disability [30]. A widely accepted clinical staging system for disk

displacement is the Wilkes Classification [31] which places emphasis on severity and chronicity (Table 51.1).

# 51.10.4.2 Hypomobility Disorders (Other Than Disk Disorders)

Besides disk displacement without reduction, hypomobility of the mandible attributable to the joint can arise from fusion of the mandible to the base of skull. The fusion can involve the entire joint or part of the joint, and can be bony, fibrous, or fibro-osseous in nature. Direct or indirect trauma to the mandibular condyles (e.g., condylar fracture) is a common cause of hypomobility. Clinically, hypomobility disorders are characterized by marked restriction of mandibular range of motion, with a hard end-feel on passive opening. They also often cause restriction of mandibular growth on the ipsilateral side.

# 51.10.4.3 Hypermobility Disorders

Hypermobility disorders refer to dislocation of the joint that is reducible by the patient (subluxation), or requires reduction by a clinician (luxation or open lock). Subluxation or luxation can vary widely in frequency and duration, and may or may not accompany pain.

Hypermobility can be caused by iatrogenic injury (e.g., intubation), macrotrauma, and medications (e.g., phenothiazines, metoclopramide), or can be spontaneous.

# 51.10.5 Joint Diseases

# 51.10.5.1 Degenerative Joint Disease

Degenerative joint disease involves breakdown of the articular structures, and can accompany pain (osteoarthritis), or be painless (osteoarthrosis). Tissue breakdown can be mechanical, inflammatory, or idiopathic. Milam and Schmitz proposed three possible mechanisms (direct mechanical, hypoxia-reperfusion, and neurogenic inflammation), all of which culminate in activation of catabolic cytokines such as interleukin-1 $\beta$ , interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor- $\alpha$ , interleukin-8, endothelin-1, as well as catabolic enzymes [32]. Similarly, Gunson and colleagues described the role of free radicals (generated by mechanical stress and hypoxia-reperfusion), cytokine signaling, matrix metalloproteinases, phospholipid peroxidation, and subsequent arachidonic acid catabolism [33]. They proposed that all degenerative joint diseases of the TMJ share the same mechanistic pathway, regardless of the specific etiology.

Degenerative changes to the TMJ can be a manifestation of systemic arthritides or other nonarthritic systemic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile

idiopathic arthritis (JIA), gout [34], and systemic sclerosis [35]. Of special interest to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which encompasses a broad group of degenerative systemic arthritides characterized by inflammation of the synovium and destruction of the joint tissues. JIA affects 8 to 400 children per 100,000 worldwide [36], and the TMJ is reported to be involved in  $43\%$  of cases [37]. Although children with JIA may be asymptomatic, common signs and symptoms include joint stiffness, difficulty with joint articulation, and deformities of the affected joints. When the TMJ is involved, common findings include micrognathia, mandibular asymmetry, pronounced antegonial notching, class II malocclusion, and anterior open bite, all of which could progress at a steady rate. Because some patients do not present with symptoms, the degenerative condylar changes can go unrecognized during routine orthodontic or surgical evaluations. Various laboratory studies (e.g., rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) can aid in the diagnosis of JIA, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast is the criterion standard because it accurately illustrates synovial inflammation which is the hallmark of JIA. Early diagnosis and management of JIA is critical, as deformities and functional disturbances can worsen over time, and result in an overall poorer long-term prognosis [38].

Another degenerative joint disease of the TMJ that shares similar clinical features with JIA is idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR). ICR is progressive resorption of the condyle without a known cause, and  $17\beta$ -estradiol has been implicated as a possible contributing factor [39]. ICR affects individuals between ages 10 and 40 years, and has a strong female predilection [40]. Typical clinical findings include micrognathia with a Class II skeletal and dental deformity, as well as an anterior open bite [41]. Imaging is significant for degenerative changes of the affected condyle (Fig. 51.9a, b). Some features differentiate ICR from JIA [42]. ICR invariably affects the TMJ only and is typically bilateral. There is also a conspicuous absence of synovial inflammation, which is characteristic of JIA.

# 51.10.6 Neoplasms

Neoplasms are rare in the TMJ, but can arise from any tissue in the joint complex, including synovium, bone, cartilage, and associated musculature. Lesions can be benign or malignant; however, malignancies are rare [43]. Clinical symptoms can be similar to those of internal derangement (such as preauricular pain and range of motion limitations) or be absent. It is important that assessment and management are not delayed.

Osteochondroma is the most common benign tumor of the TMJ [43] and presents signs and symptoms related to increase in size of the condyle. Clinical findings frequently include shifting of the mandible to the contralateral side, sometimes with an ipsilateral open bite. Dentofacial deformities associated with this condition require orthognathic surgery in conjunction with management of the osteochondroma, which can include complete resection with reconstruction [44, 45] or partial [46] condylectomy.

Fig. 51.10 Synovial chondromatosis of the right TMJ with osteolytic changes to the articular fossa

Synovial chondromatosis (or synovial osteochondromatosis), a condition in which loose metaplastic cartilaginous bodies form, originates from the synovial membrane. These cartilaginous bodies detach from the synovial lining and can grow in the synovium. A common condition in large synovial joints, synovial chondromatosis also affects the TMJ. It is sometimes classified as a "pseudotumor" [43]. In the TMJ, age at onset tends to be in the fifth and sixth decades of life [47], as opposed to the third and fourth decades of life in synovial chondromatosis involving other joints. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and limited range of motion, although frequently patients may be completely asymptomatic. Imaging findings include widened joint space with cartilaginous or osseous bodies, sometimes with osteolytic changes in the glenoid fossa (Fig. 51.10). Histologically, the loose bodies contain multinucleated cells, and cellular atypia and hyperchro

matism can also be seen which can indicate a possibility of chondrosarcoma. Treatment of synovial chondromatosis is removal of the loose bodies with synovectomy. In the TMJ, complete synovectomy requires a condylectomy to permit access. Recurrence is rare after thorough treatment.

Other "pseudotumors" more commonly seen in other synovial joints have been reported in the TMJ. These include ganglion cysts and eosinophilic granuloma. Such conditions can cause nonspecific symptoms mimicking TMD, which highlights the importance of proper diagnosis.

Malignant tumors are rare in the TMJ, estimated to represent  $18.2\%$  of all TMJ neoplasms [43]. These are generally secondary to primary malignancies from adjacent structures. Chondrosarcoma is rare in the head and neck, reported to represent  $5\%$  to  $12\%$  of chondrosarcoma cases [48, 49]. The incidence in the TMJ is not determined, and there is a wide age distribution with a slight female predilection [50]. Some cases have been reported to have arisen from persistent synovial chondromatosis, with the same positive reaction to immunohistochemical markers [51]. However, no definitive association has been established. Common symptoms include swelling and trismus, and pain may or may not be present. Malignant tumors of the TMJ require aggressive therapy to prevent intracranial extension, and radiation and chemotherapy are appropriate adjuncts. Although metastatic lesions in the TMJ have been reported [10, 52, 53], they are more common in other parts of the mandible.

# 51.10.7 Infection

Infection of the TMJ, or septic arthritis, is uncommon. Besides postoperative infections and those originating from adjacent structures such as the teeth [54, 55] and the ear [56], septic arthritis can be of metastatic nature, usually through a hematogenous route. This is thought to be because of the absence of a basement membrane in the synovium, which permits blood-borne bacterial entry. In sexually active adults, septic arthritis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae can occur [57]. Other gram-positive cocci such as staphylococci and  $\beta$ -hemolytic streptococci have been isolated in septic TMJ arthritis. Therefore, penicillin with a  $\beta$ -inhibitor is the antibiotic agent of choice. Isolation of other microorganisms such as Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) has been reported in the literature [58].

# Conclusion

The complex anatomy and functions of the TMJ and associated structures require a thorough knowledge of its anatomy and pathophysiology. Integration of this thorough understanding with appropriate history, clinical examination, and ancillary testing is essential in the diagnosis and management of TMD.
