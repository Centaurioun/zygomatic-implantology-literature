# Learning Aims

1. Local and regional flaps are used to reconstruct facial defects due to missing tissue.  
2. The defect and flap tissue(s) should be analyzed for the appropriate flap selection, with care to place suture in natural skin creases.  
3. There are a variety of local and regional flaps available for facial reconstruction.  
4. Early recognition of flap compromise is essential for flap survival.

# 42.1 Introduction

Over the past 50 years, the development and application of several different flaps has led to reliable reconstruction of facial defects. Most defects can be reconstructed immediately, leading to better restoration of form and function with early rehabilitation [1]. Reconstructing facial defects can be both challenging and rewarding. Missing tissue most often results from either trauma or oncologic surgery. Commonly, a wide range of options are available for repairing a given defect, including healing by secondary intention, primary closure, placement of a skin graft, or mobilization of local or regional tissue. Compared with skin grafts, local flaps often produce superior functional and esthetic results [2-6]. A great advantage of local tissue transfer is that the tissue closely resembles the missing skin in color and texture. These flaps can be rotated, advanced, or transposed into a tissue defect. Regional tissue can also be recruited to repair facial defects. A thorough understanding of flap principles, surgical technique, wound healing, and esthetic subunits is critical to produce both a functional and an esthetic outcome.

# 42.2 Flap Principles

When deciding which option to use, there should be a progression from simple to complex treatments. Consideration should be given to primary closure or the use of skin grafts first, followed by local, then regional, and finally, distant pedicled or microsurgical free tissue transfer. Flaps require additional incisions and tissue movement, which increase the risks of postoperative bleeding, hematoma, pain, and infection. Confirmation of tumor-free margins should be done before flap reconstruction if a malignant lesion has been excised [7].

Prior to selecting a flap for reconstruction, it is imperative that a thorough patient evaluation be performed. The body's ability to heal and provide sufficient perfusion to the flap and adjacent tissues is critical for success. Consequently, there should be evaluation of the

possibility of impaired vascularity, such as a history of smoking, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. If there is concern regarding healing or vascular supply, consideration should be given to an alternate technique for reconstruction. Further considerations should also include the size and location of the defect, patient's age, and the condition of the skin. With increased age and damage, the quality of skin, elasticity, and moisture content decrease [8].

Some defects are amenable to closure with a single flap, but others require a combination of flaps for optimal results [9]. An advantage of using multiple flaps is that they can be harvested from separate esthetic units. This decreases the size of the secondary defect and may allow placement of scars between esthetic units, thus improving scar camouflage, leading to better cosmesis. Often, separated repair of individual facial subunits with separate flaps provides a better cosmetic result than if a single flap is used to reconstruct the entire defect.

Flaps differ from grafts in that they maintain their blood supply as they are moved. Abundant dermal and subdermal plexus allow for predictable elevation of random cutaneous flaps. A cutaneous flap may also have its arterial supply based on a dominant artery in the subcutaneous layer. Muscular perforating arteries are important contributors to the cutaneous vascular bed. The most important variable for flap viability is not the length-to-width ratio but, rather, the perfusion pressure and vascularity at the pedicle base [10]. Because local flaps provide their own blood supply, they are particularly useful in patients with compromised recipient sites such as those that have been irradiated.

As local flaps heal, regaining of blood flow and cutaneous sensibility increases. The rate of blood flow and two-point discrimination on the surface of local flaps is statistically no different when compared with the corresponding area of the unoperated side [11]. The recovery of sensory nerve function in facial flaps is dependent on the intimacy of contact between the flap and the recipient bed and on the viability of the type of restoration.

Relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs) result from vectors within the skin that reflect the intrinsic tension of the skin at rest, determined by the orientation of collagen fibers. They are due to the microarchitecture of the skin and represent the directional pull on wounds. The RSTLs are generally parallel to the facial rhytids. Lines of minimal tension (rhytids) result from repeated bending of the skin from muscular contraction. A permanent crease results from the adhesions between the dermis and the deeper tissues. These natural skin creases run perpendicular to the direction of muscle pull and can guide incision orientation for optimal scar camouflage and cosmesis.

The face is composed of esthetic subunits [12, 13]. The areas where these subunits meet are referred to as anatomic borders. The esthetic subunit principle is based on the fact that our eyes see objects as a series of block images that are spatially organized. Scars that are located at the junction of two adjacent anatomic subunits are inconspicuous because one expects to see delineation between these areas. Skin within each subunit is of similar composition, including elasticity, thickness, and texture, making it a suitable choice for facial reconstruction.

# Key Points

Repair of soft tissue defects should progress from simple to complex.  
Flap survival is dependent on the perfusion pressure and vascularity at the pedicle base.  
Skin creases are perpendicular to the direction of muscle pull.  
- Placing scars at junctions of esthetic subunits improves the esthetic outcome.

# 42.3 Flap Nomenclature

Many methods are described for classifying cutaneous flaps: by the arrangement of their blood supply, their configuration, location, tissue content, and method of transferring flaps. The defect produced either from trauma or neoplastic tissue removal is termed the primary defect. The movement of a flap towards the primary defect for closure is the primary movement. A

secondary defect is created after mobilization of a flap to close the primary defect, while movement of tissue adjacent to the primary defect is a secondary movement.

# 42.3.1 Blood Supply

Cutaneous flaps consist of skin and subcutaneous tissue and can be characterized by their predominant arterial supply. These include random pattern, axial pattern, and pedicle flaps (Fig. 42.1). Random flaps are supplied by the dermal and subdermal plexus alone and are the most common type of flaps used for reconstructing facial defects. Axial pattern flaps are supplied by more dominant superficial vessels oriented longitudinally along the flap axis. Pedicle flaps are supplied by large named arteries that supply the skin paddle through muscular perforating vessels. Free tissue transfer refers to flaps that are harvested from a remote region and have the vascular connection reestablished at the recipient site.

# 42.3.2 Location

Another means of classification is by the region from which the tissue is mobilized. This includes local, regional, and distant flaps. Local flaps imply use of tissue adjacent to the defect, whereas regional flaps refer to those flaps recruited from different areas of the same part of the body. Distant flaps are harvested from different parts of the body.

# 42.3.3 Configuration

Flaps are often referred to by their geometric configuration. Examples of these flaps include bilobed, rhombic, and  $Z$ -plasty.

# 42.3.4 Tissue Content

The layers of tissue contained within the flap can also be used to classify a flap. Cutaneous flap refers to those flaps that contain the skin only. When other layers are incorporated into the flap they are classified accordingly. Examples include myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps.

# 42.3.5 Method of Transfer

The most common method of classifying flaps is based on the method of transfer. Advancement flaps are mobilized along a linear axis toward the defect (Fig. 42.2). Rotation flaps pivot around a point at the base of the flap

(42.3). Although most flaps are moved by a combination of rotation and advancement into the defect, the major mechanism of tissue transfer is used to classify a given flap. Transposition flap refers to one that is mobilized toward an adjacent defect over an incomplete bridge of skin. Examples of transposition flaps include rhombic flaps and bilobed flaps (42.4). Interposition flaps differ from transposition flaps in that the incomplete bridge of adjacent skin is also elevated and mobilized (secondary movement). Interpolated flaps are those flaps that are mobilized either over or beneath a complete bridge of intact skin via a pedicle. These flaps often require a secondary surgery for pedicle division. Microvascular free tissue transfer from a different part of the body relies on reanastomosis of the vascular pedicle.

# 42.4 Designing the Flap

Many options are available for reconstructing facial defects. Often, the optimal method is not readily apparent. A stepwise approach can be helpful in selecting and

designing a flap. The characteristics of the defect and adjacent tissue must be analyzed. These include color, elasticity, and texture of the missing tissue. The defect size, depth, and location are evaluated as well as the availability and characteristics of adjacent or regional tissue. It is important to determine the mobility of adjacent structures and to identify those landmarks that must not be distorted. The orientation of the RSTLs and esthetic units should be analyzed closely.

Potential flap designs should be drawn on the skin surface, being careful to avoid those designs that obliterate or distort anatomic landmarks. The final location of the resultant scar should be anticipated by previsualizing suture lines and choosing flaps that place the lines in normal creases.

The secondary defect created as the tissue is transferred into the primary defect must be able to be closed easily. When designing a flap, it is important to avoid secondary deformities that distort important facial landmarks or affect function. Avoid obliterating critical anatomic lines that are essential for normal function and appearance.

Proper surgical technique involves gentle handling of the tissue by grasping the skin margins below the epidermis with skin hooks or fine-toothed tissue forceps. Avoid traumatizing the vascular supply by twisting or kinking the base of the flap. Deep pexing sutures minimize tension on the flap and eliminate dead space. Excessive tension on the flap may decrease blood flow and cause flap necrosis. Meticulous hemostasis should

be achieved before final suturing so that a hematoma does not develop beneath the flap. It is important to adequately mobilize and extend the flap, which should be of adequate size to remain in place without tension to minimize the chance of dehiscence, scarring, or ectropion.

# Key Points

The defect and tissue to be utilized should be analyzed to select the appropriate flap.  
Flap designs should be drawn on the patient, with care to place suture lines in natural creases and between esthetic subunits.  
Skin margins should be handled with skin hooks or fine-toothed tissue forceps with care.

# 42.5 Types of Flaps

# 42.5.1 Local Flaps

# 42.5.1.1 Advancement Flaps

Advancement flaps have a linear configuration and are advanced into the defect along a single vector. These flaps can be single or double. Advancement flaps are often chosen when the surrounding skin exhibits good tissue laxity and the resulting incision lines can be hidden in natural creases. Advancement flaps limit wound tension to a single vector with minimal perpendicular tension. The flap should be planned with a minimum length-to-width ratio of 4:1 [14, 15]. They are often

helpful in reconstructing defects involving the forehead, helical rim, lips, and cheek. In these areas, advancement flaps capitalize on the natural forehead furrows without causing vertical distortion of the hairline superiorly or the eyebrow inferiorly (Fig. 42.5).

Advancement flaps are created by parallel incisions approximately the width of the defect. The distal and proximal segments of the flap should be completely undermined. Standing cutaneous deformities ("dog-ears") are usually created and managed with excision. A Z-plasty incision or Burow's triangle may be performed at the base of the flap, reducing the standing cutaneous deformities.

A variation of the advancement flap is the V-Y flap. A triangular island of tissue adjacent to the defect is isolated and attached only to the subcutaneous tissue. It relies on a subcutaneous pedicle for blood supply. The V-shaped flap and adjacent margins are advanced into the defect. The secondary Y-shaped defect is then closed primarily in a simple manner. These flaps are especially amenable for cheek defects along the alar facial groove and are generally avoided where there are superficial nerves because of the depth of the incisions.

Local flaps are also useful for staged reconstruction of ear defects. Advancement of local tissue can be used to rebuild the missing tissue including the helical rim (Fig. 42.6).

Intraoral uses of advancement flaps include covering oroantral fistulae and alveolar clefts. A disadvantage of buccal advancement flaps is the decrease in vestibular sulcus depth (Fig. 42.7).

# 42.5.1.2 Rotation Flaps

Rotation flaps have a curvilinear configuration and rotate around a central point. Defects reconstructed with rotation flaps should be somewhat triangular or modified by removing normal tissue to create a triangular defect. Standing defects may be limited by designing the flap to have a curvilinear distance of four times the width of the defect arc [8]. The rotation of the flap reduces the effective length and should therefore be fac

tored in when planning and designing the flap. To counter this, a releasing incision may be made on the opposite end of the incision. These flaps have a large base and are usually random in their vascularity but may be axial. One or more rotation flaps are often used to reconstruct scalp defects, with the base four to six times longer than its width [15]. Because of the relative inelasticity of the scalp tissue, these flaps must be large relative to the size of the defect. Galeotomies, full thickness incisions in the

To adequately mobilize this flap to cover the defect

galea aponeurotica, is helpful in gaining additional rotation and advancement (Fig. 42.8). In the anterior scalp, the hairline requires special attention. Hair-bearing skin should be closed with tricophytic sutures, with care to avoid transecting hair follicles, and electrocautery should be used judiciously [16]. When defect goes from a hair-bearing to non-hair-bearing, each subunit should be reconstructed separately to place suture lines at subunit interfaces and to distribute the wound tension over a wider area [14, 16].

The axial frontonasal flap is a modified simple rotation flap with a back cut [17-20]. It is useful for closing nasal defects (Fig. 42.9). The flap is based on a vascular pedicle at the level of the medial canthus. This pedicle consists of a branch of the angular artery and the supraorbital artery.

First described by Veaun in 1922, rotated palatal flaps are helpful for closing large oroantral fistulae [9, 21]. Fistulae less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter usually close spontaneously [22, 23]. Two-layer closures are less prone to developing recurrence of oroantral fistulae. Local flaps or grafts can be used to close larger fistulae. The palatal flap remains a popular choice for intraoral reconstruction because it can provide keratinized mucosa [24]. The hard palate is richly vascular, with the descending palatal artery anastomosing with the nasopalatine artery to form a vascular network termed the "trilaminar macronet" coursing through mucosa, submucosa, and periosteum [24, 25]. Because of this, the palatal flap may be elevated as either an axial flap or random flap [24]. The axial flap may be used for areas such as the cheek, soft palate, and oronasal and oroantral fisulta closures. The random flap is indicated for oral-antral communication repair. Because the vascular supply is not as reliable as an axial flap, the random flap should not cross the midline and not exceed a length-to-width ratio of 2.4:1 or

without tension, periosteum must be incised (broken line) along its base and the flap advanced (arrow) over the defect. c If the fistula is present along an edentulous region, a transverse flap or bipedicle flap can be used

risk flap failure [24, 26]. Approximately  $75\%$  of the palatal soft tissue can be rotated to cover adjacent defects up to  $16~\mathrm{cm}^2$  [27]. A preformed stent or sutured iodoform gauze is placed over the denuded bone during the healing period. Epithelialization will take from 3 to 5 weeks and up to 8 weeks in smokers.

For large avulsive lip defects, flaps such as a Karapanzic or Bernard-Burrows are useful for defects missing greater than 2/3. These flaps utilize both rotation and advancement (Fig. 42.10).

# 42.5.1.3 Transposition Flaps

These flaps are rotated and advanced over adjacent skin to close a defect. Examples of transposition flaps include rhombic flaps and bilobed flaps. These flaps are advantageous in areas where it is desired to transfer the tension away from closure of the primary defect and into the repair of the secondary defect. However, this makes it difficult to place all suture lines within natural creases. Transposition flaps have a straight linear axis and are usually designed so that one border of the flap is also a border of the defect. The length of the flap should not be greater than three times the width [8]. An advantage of this type of flap is that it can be developed at variable distances. Areas where these flaps are often used include the nasal tip and ala, the inferior eyelid, and the lips.

The rhombic flap is a precise geometric flap that is useful for many defects of the face [28, 29]. The traditional rhombic ("Limberg") flap is designed with  $60^{\circ}$  and  $120^{\circ}$  internal angles and equal-length sides. There are four possible donor sites for this flap, two at each  $120^{\circ}$  corner. The angle of the leading edge of the rhombi flap is approximately  $120^{\circ}$  but may vary. The defect should first be converted into a parallelogram. The flap is begun by extending an incision along the short axis of the defect that is equal to the length of one side of the

rhombi defect. Another incision is then made at  $60^{\circ}$  to the first and of equal length (Fig. 42.11). The closer the lengths of the incisions are to the parallelogram, the less tension there will be at the defect site. Disadvantages of the rhombic flap are the significant tension at the clo

sure point as well as the amount of discarded tissue to transform a circular defect into a rhombus. If there are standing deformities left after closure and concern over the vascular supply, the deformity may be left in place and revised at a second surgery [8].

The bilobed flap is a transposition flap with two circular skin paddles (see Fig. 42.4) [30, 31]. Esser is credited with the design of the bilobed flap in 1918. It is useful for skin repair of lateral nose and nasal tip defects up to  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$ . The bilobed flap has a random pattern blood supply. The flap is primarily rotated around a pivot point and the paddles are transposed over an incomplete bridge of skin. The paddles should be  $90^{\circ}$  from one another and the defect [8]. The second lobe allows the transfer of tension further from the primary defect closure. The bilobed design rotates around an arc that is usually  $90 - 100^{\circ}$ . In the bilobed flap, the first lobe closes the defect and the second closes the first lobe defect. The flap is designed with a pivot point approximately a radius of the defect away from the wound margin. The first lobe is usually the same size as the defect, and the second lobe is slightly smaller with a triangular apex to allow for primary closure. The axis of the second flap is roughly  $90 - 100^{\circ}$  from the primary defect and undermined widely to distribute the tension.

An advantage of the bilobed flap is that one can construct a flap at some distance from the defect with an axis that is independent of the linear axis of the defect. A disadvantage of this flap is that it leaves a circular scar that does not blend with the existing skin creases. During healing, the flap may become elevated ("pin cushioning") because of the narrow pedicle that is prone to congestion, scar tissue that impedes lymphatic drainage, and curvilinear scars that tend to bunch the flap up as they shorten.

# 42.5.1.4 Interpolation Flaps

Interpolation flaps contain a pedicle that must pass over or under intact intervening tissue utilizing rotational and linear movements. A disadvantage of these types of flaps is that for those passing over bridging skin, the pedicle must be detached during a second surgical procedure. Care must be made to minimize pedicle tension to limit congestion. Occasionally, it is possible to perform a single-stage procedure by deepithelializing the pedicle and passing it under the intervening skin. Sufficient space in the subcutaneous tissues must be created to prevent compression of the flap and subsequent

congestion. Tissue bulk may be more readily corrected in the superficial approach. Advantages of interpolation flaps include their excellent vascularity and their skin color and texture match.

The forehead flap (median and paramedian) is a commonly used interpolation flap and remains the workhorse flap for large nasal defects [32-35]. Further indications include naso-orbito-ethmoid complex, medial canthus, and radix deformity reconstruction [36-38]. It is a robust and dependable flap due to its rich blood supply. The forehead flap is primarily based on the supratrochlear vessel, is relatively narrow, and uses a skin paddle from the forehead region. The flap is supplied by a rich anastomosis between the supratrochlear, angular, infratrochlear, supraorbital, and dorsonasal arteries centered on the medial canthal region [35]. Because of the marked vascularity, it is possible to incorporate cartilage or tissue grafts for nasal reconstruction. The forehead flap has abundant tissue available, allowing surfacing of the entire nasal unit with a single flap, and provides a good texture and color match to the native nose (Fig. 42.12). The disadvantage of this flap is the necessity of multiple procedures, thickness of the flap for nasal reconstruction, and the esthetic compromise while the pedicle is attached.

The technique for elevating the forehead flap is straightforward. The flap can be designed directly in the midline or in a maramidine location. A template of the defect is used to outline the flap. After confirmation of the supratrochlear artery with ultrasound, the flap may be drawn on the patient's forehead. Elevation of the flap proceeds in either a subgaleal or subcutaneous plane. The pedicle is always elevated in such a way as to incorporate the frontalis muscle to protect the artery. The width of the pedicle is usually  $1.0 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$ , which allows for easy rotation of the pedicle. Before inset, the skin paddle is selectively thinned by removing the frontalis muscle and subcutaneous tissue to match the native skin thickness. The pedicle is divided approximately 3 weeks later, with the base of the pedicle inset into the glabellar area to reestablish brow symmetry. The incision and resulting scar is perpendicular to the RSTLs but tends to heal well (Fig. 42.13).

The nasolabial flap (melolabial) is useful for reconstructing defects involving the oral cavity and those involving the lower third of the nose (Fig. 42.14) [39-42]. It can be used as an interpolation flap with either a single or staged technique. The flap is supplied by the angular artery, intraorbital artery, and infratrochlear artery and can be based either superiorly or inferiorly. Superiorly, it can be used to reconstruct the nose, including the lateral wall, tip, and ala [8, 43-45]. It can also be used in conjunction with cartilaginous grafts for ala reconstruction [46]. Inferiorly, the flap is used to reconstruct the upper lip, buccal mucosa, palate, and floor of mouth [8, 43-45]. Compared to the Karapanzic and Abbe flaps, the nasolabial flap does not cause microstomia [44, 46, 47]. When used intraorally, the nasolabial flap does not result in contracture or tissue tethering and results in minimal functional impairment [8, 48]. The area of recruitment for nasal reconstruction is in closer

proximity to the primary defect than is the forehead flap. A disadvantage of the nasolabial flap is that there is a limited amount of tissue available, and asymmetry can occur along the nasolabial flap folds. Defects up to  $5\mathrm{cm} \times 5\mathrm{cm}$  may be amenable with this flap. The pedicle is divided 3 to 4 weeks later, and the defect can be closed primarily by placing the scar in the nasal facial junction and the nasolabial flap fold.

There are a variety of approaches to reconstructing the upper lip. For optimal results, upper lip reconstruction should incorporate similar tissue through the use of local tissue rearrangement. The majority of subtotal upper lip defects are amenable through excisional techniques, mucosal advancement of the cheek and vermilion, lip-switch techniques, and skin grafts [49]. The lip-switch flap (Abbe) can be taken from either lip, but it is most commonly switched from the lower to the upper lip [50-52]. However, some authors strongly advocate

against the use of the Abbe flap to lip-switch the upper lip to the lower lip because of the resultant esthetic defect in the donor site [49]. This flap can be used to reconstruct as much as one-third of the upper lip, including defects centrally in the philtrum and laterally to vermilion defects [49]. The lower lip can supply a flap of one quarter its length, and the Abbé flap offers immediate replacement of total lip anatomy (Fig. 42.15). The Abbe flap is advantageous over other flaps such as the Bernard-Burrow or Kara-pandzic-type because it does not displace the modiolus or commissures, producing superior esthetic result. The flap should be designed in the center of the lower lip with inclusion of any necessary extensions. The height of the flap should equal the height of the lip laterally; flaps in the medial upper lip should have a philtral column border and straight lateral border contralaterally [49]. The Abbe flap can be elevated as a partial thickness flap, with or without mucosa, because a vertical vessel exists in the midline

[49]. The flap may also be lengthened caudally to increase the cephalic reach of the flap [49]. The labial artery supplies the flap and should be maintained with a small cuff of subcutaneous tissue and muscle surrounding the vascular pedicle. The pedicle is divided after approximately 2 weeks for partial-thickness flaps and 3 weeks for full-thickness flaps [49]. While the flap is not innervated, spontaneous reinnervation by facial nerve branches has been shown to occur in the first postoperative year [53].

Tongue flaps are excellent flaps for intraoral reconstruction. The dorsal or lateral tongue may be used to reconstruct defects in the palate, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and pharynx [54]. They use adjacent tissue, have an excellent blood supply, and are associated with minimal morbidity. The tongue has excellent axial and collateral circulation, with the lingual artery providing the main blood supply. Up to one half of the tongue can be rotated for tissue coverage without compromising speech, mastication, or deglutition [55]. A variety of flap

designs have been described including anterior- and posterior-based tongue flaps (Fig. 42.16). Some indications include repair of oral defects and fistulae closure. These flaps are helpful for providing closure of large oroantral fistulae that have previously failed after local advancement flaps or rotational mucoperiosteal flaps.

# 42.5.2 Regional Flaps

For large facial defects, local flaps may not provide sufficient tissue to adequately restore the missing tissue. In these cases, consideration should be given to using a

regional flap [56, 57]. Regional flaps are defined as those located near a defect but not in the immediate proximity. They are frequently harvested from the neck, check, or axilla and can provide coverage of large surfaces on the face. Selection of a specific regional flap depends on the size and location of the defect and also on the intrinsic properties of the flap. While microvascular free tissue transfer plays a significant role today, regional flaps remain a valuable piece of the surgeon's armamentarium. Examples of situations where local and regional flaps may be indicated for use include previously failed free flap surgery and depleted neck vessels. Advantages of regional flaps include the large amount of soft tissue and skin available. Disadvantages of these types of flaps

include poor color and texture match, excessive bulkiness of the flap, and donor site morbidity.

# 42.5.2.1 Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous Flap

The pectoralis major myocutaneous (PMMC) flap remains a workhorse of reconstructive surgery [58-60]. The flap was introduced by Ariyan [61] and has provided a reliable method of soft tissue reconstruction of bone and soft tissue defects of the mandible and maxilla. The flap is commonly used after failure of a free vascularized flap and in patients who are poor candidates for free flaps [62]. The PMMC flap can be rotated around a pivot point  $180^{\circ}$  and is supplied by two separate blood supplies (Fig. 42.17). The thoracoacromial artery arises from the second position of the axillary artery and forms four branches as it penetrates the fascia. The pectoral branch is the major artery that supplies the PMMC flap. The position of the vascular pedicle can be approximated by drawing a line from the shoulder point to the xiphoid. The pectoral branch descends at a right angle from the middle of the clavicle until it meets this line. Branches of the internal mammary artery supply the medial portion of the muscle and skin over the sternum. The flap provides good coverage for the carotid artery when combined with neck dissection.

While the pectoralis major muscle flap has a history of reliability, the skin paddle has a reported partial necrosis rate of  $15 - 27\%$  [63]. The skin overlying the

PMMC flap arises from musculocutaneous perforating branches from the internal mammary artery [64]. Centering the skin paddle over the fourth interostal space has demonstrated increased reliability with significantly reduced necrosis of the skin paddle [64]. In obese patients and women, due to a bulky skin paddle, an alternative option is to perform a pectoralis major muscle flap and to cover the donor site with a split- or full-thickness skin graft.

# 42.5.2.2 Deltopectoral Flap

The introduction of the deltopectoral flap by Bakamijian and colleagues represented a significant improvement for reconstructing large ablative resections for head and neck cancer [65-67]. Currently, it is used as an alternative to the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for soft tissue reconstruction of the mandible and maxilla. This flap is composed of fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin but does not contain muscle (Fig. 42.18). Perforators from the internal mammary artery provide vascular supply to the flap. The secondary defect is covered with a skin graft.

# 42.5.2.3 Temporalis Flap

The temporalis flap was introduced by Golovine in 1898 and remains useful for covering intraoral defects (Fig. 42.19) [68-71]. Further indications for the temporalis flap include reanimation surgery, midface soft

tissue augmentation, cranial base reconstruction, and orbital reconstruction [72]. The outer portion of the muscle is invested by the middle temporal vessel, which originates just below the zygomatic arch. The temporalis muscle is supplied by both the anterior and posterior deep temporal arteries, which arise from the second portion of the internal maxillary artery. The anterior deep temporal artery supplies  $20\%$ , the posterior deep temporal artery  $40\%$ , and the middle temporal artery  $40\%$  [72]. This dual blood supply allows for splitting of the muscle into two flaps, an anterior 2/3 and posterior 1/3.

When elevating the muscle, it is important to remain on the deep temporal fascia beneath the superficial temporal fascia to avoid damage to the frontal branch of the facial nerve. Elevation of the inferior portion of the flap is performed in a subperiosteal plane to avoid damage to the deep temporal arteries, which lie on the undersurface of the muscle. During separation of the temporalis fascia and muscle, the middle temporal artery may be present. The middle temporal artery is often sacrificed because it does not affect the flap's survival [72]. An osteotomy of the zygomatic arch is often helpful to

![](images/eae57603c2355214643d8512f103448160f5b4fbff02bc2a0c355e41d16be997.jpg)

facilitate placement of the muscle into the mouth. The arch can be put back into place and secured with plates and screws. For intraoral defects, an incision is made near the coronoid process. Palatal defects may be accessed through the lateral sinus wall. A disadvantage of the temporalis flap is the minimal cosmetic deformity of hollowing in the temporal region; this can be corrected with autogenous or alloplastic materials and can be minimized by using either an anterior or a posterior flap. Alternatively, if the defect is small enough the anterior segment may be used for the reconstruction and the posterior segment can be mobilized anteriorly to prevent hollowing.

# 42.5.2.4 Sternocleidomastoid Flap

First described by Jinau in 1909 [73] for facial reanimation, the sternocleidomastoid flap was repopularized by Owens [74-79]. The muscle is invested by the deep cervical fascia and is supplied by three arteries. The dominant vessel is the occipital artery, which enters the muscle below the mastoid tip and supplies the superior portion of the muscle. The superior thyroid artery supplies the middle portion, and the thyrocervical trunk supplies the inferior third of the muscle.

The muscle is elevated over the deep cervical fascia superior to the carotid sheath. It is recommended to maintain two of the three vessels when elevating the flap to enhance viability of the flap. The spinal accessory nerve enters the deep portion of the muscle approxi

mately at the carotid bifurcation and should be preserved to prevent denervation atrophy of the muscle (Fig. 42.20). Advantages of the sternocleidomastoid flap include its close proximity to the defect and minimal donor site defect (Figs. 42.21 and 42.22).

# 42.5.2.5 Trapezius Myocutaneous Flap

The trapezius myocutaneous flap is supplied by three arteries, allowing several flaps to be used. Of the flaps available from the trapezius muscle, the superior trapezius is the most reliable [80, 81]. The main vessel supplying the trapezius muscle is the transverse cervical artery, which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk. The upper portion of the muscle is supplied by the occipital artery. The trapezius myocutaneous flap is a ready source of skin of uniform thickness without excessive muscle bulk [82]. The main disadvantage is the limited rotation and the short pedicle.

# 42.5.2.6 Latissimus Dorsi Myocutaneous Flap

Quillen and colleagues [83] first described the use of the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap for head and neck reconstruction in 1978 [83]. The flap is not commonly used for head and neck reconstruction unless other flaps are unavailable or there are very large defects requiring coverage. The muscle is supplied by the thoracodorsal artery, which is the dominant vessel, and also by four to six perforators from the posterior intercostals and lumbar vessels. The main advantage of the latissimus dorsi flap is the large amount of skin provided. The main disadvantages are the need to reposition the patient during the operation and morbidity from the donor site [84].

# 42.6 Complications

Postoperative complications can be minimized with careful preoperative planning of the flap design and by early recognition of problems [85]. A medical history can be used to identify patients with risk factors involving small vessels. These risk factors include smoking, diabetes, hypertension, previous radiation, and preexisting scars [86, 87]. Complications may be reversible or irreversible. Early recognition and treatment can minimize complications and prevent them from becoming irreversible. Two main unwanted outcomes are flap failure and unacceptable cosmetic results.

Flap survival depends on early recognition of flap compromise. Signs of arterial ischemia include a pale and cool flap that does not blanch with pressure and typically does not bleed with a pinprick. Flaps are somewhat ischemic initially because the original tissue perfusion has been compromised by flap elevation. Most

tissues can survive on  $10\%$  of its average blood flow [85]. Whether the flap will undergo necrosis depends on patient-related and surgery-related factors that influence the risk of necrosis in facial flaps. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of flap failure. The deleterious effects of smoking on flap survival include hypoxemia and vasoconstriction. Patients should be advised to quit smoking during the perioperative period.

![](images/18ca14afac555db831e9e49d3612578104805f15061892e5dc79aa9b9aa9d164.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 42.20 Blood to the sternocleidomastoid muscle is supplied through three arteries

Ischemia is defined as inadequacy of perfusion in providing tissue needs.

Common causes of bleeding in facial reconstruction with local flaps include inadequate hemostasis and drug-induced coagulopathy. Hematoma formation should be identified and decompressed within  $24\mathrm{h}$  [88]. Decompression can be accomplished with aspiration using a 22-gauge needle or by taking out one or two sutures and applying gentle compression of the flap. Hematoma formation may diminish tissue perfusion and can lead to ischemia or necrosis by inducing vasospasm, stretching the subdermal plexus, or separating the flap from its recipient bed. Patients should be questioned carefully about the use of medications that affect coagulation such as acetylsalicylic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamin E. If possible, these medications should be avoided for 2 weeks before and 1 week after surgery.

Congestion is the most common vascular problem associated with facial flaps. Signs of a congested flap include warmth, edema, and a purple color that blanches with pressure then immediately refills. A pinprick will cause release of dark venous blood. Venous congestion can lead to arterial compromise and flap necrosis. Management of congested flaps may include temporarily releasing sutures to allow decompression at the flap edges or possible impingement involving the flap pedicle. Tight bandages around the flap should be removed. Medicinal leeches (Hirudo medicinalis) may be useful in decompressing congested flaps [89, 90] (Fig. 42.23). Saliva from the leech contains an anticoagulant (hirudin) and a vasodilator that facilitates continued oozing from the site even up to  $6\mathrm{h}$  after they detach. Leech therapy allows for continued venous outflow until

further revascularization occurs. Patients should be placed on combined antibiotic therapy consisting of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole during leech therapy to prevent infection, most commonly caused by Aeromonas hydrophilia [91, 92]. Additionally, hemoglobin levels should be monitored because of the risk of anemia; transfusion rate following leech therapy has been reported up to  $50\%$  [93].

Hyperbaric (HBO) has been shown to be beneficial in improving the vascularity of marginal tissues [94]. Prophylactic HBO therapy in cutaneous flap surgery in the irradiated tissue bed may be particularly helpful to combat the hypoxia and hypocellularity. HBO is beneficial in treating both venous and arterial ischemia by creating a local arterial vasoconstriction through the

rise in arterial oxygen content, which reduced the amount of inflow. The tissue oxygen levels continue to rise owing to the improved diffusion even though there is vasoconstriction and reduced vascular perfusion. The flap can maintain viability while neovascularization occurs. Other options include the use of heparin and dipyridamole to help increase the survival of an ischemic flap [95].

Infection can complicate flap healing [96]. The postoperative infection rate for clean wounds in facial surgery is as low as  $2.8\%$ , with higher rates in facial reconstruction with local flaps [97]. Tissue oxygenation is an important factor in prevention of wound infection and is closely related to blood supply. Infections involving local flaps may result in flap failure or poor cosmetic outcome secondary to wound dehiscence and scarring.

Late complications include scars, pin cushioning, keloids, and hypertrophic scars [8, 98]. Hypertrophic scars may be revised with excision, Z-plasty, or by defatt-ting the flap and/or adjacent tissues. Keloids may be managed by excision and steroid injection, although the patient should be informed that the keloid could possibly increase in size.

- Identification of risk factors and early recognition of flap compromise is essential for flap survival.

The most common vascular problem is congestion.  
- Bleeding is caused most often by inadequate hemostasis and drug-induced coagulopathy.  
Hyperbaric oxygen, heparin, and dipyridamole can help increase ischemic flap survival.

# Conclusion

A variety of facial flaps are available to the reconstructive surgeon for repairing facial defects. The goal of flap surgery is to restore form, function, and esthetics. There are many advantages to using local and regional flaps, which can lead to optimal esthetic results.
