# 17.1 Introduction

In the United States, over 11 million traumatic wounds are treated in emergency departments each year. Facial lacerations account for approximately  $50\%$  of these wounds, with motor vehicle collisions being the most prevalent cause of soft tissue damage to the face [1]. Craniofacial region injuries overall account for  $7\%$  of all emergency department visits [2]. Facial injuries affect both function and aesthetics. There is often a psychological aspect associated with the injury secondary to the patient's concern regarding permanent scarring and subsequent facial disfigurement. According to one survey, cosmetic outcome is the single most important aspect of care to the patient [3].

Goals of treatment are to achieve a repair without infection and to minimize scarring. Timely diagnosis and repair are important to improve outcomes of these injuries.

# 17.2 Principles of Management

The initial examination involves evaluating and stabilizing the trauma patient. Evaluation should follow the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, and any life-threatening conditions should be identified and managed immediately. The Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure (ABCDE) approach is utilized, followed by a general neurologic assessment with particular attention to cervical spine and cranial injuries. In severe injuries to the face, cervical spine injuries have been reported to occur in  $1.2 - 9.7\%$  of patients, with associated head injuries in  $45.5\%$  of patients [4]. A focused history and physical examination should be performed. The timeline and mechanism of the injury should be included in the assessment to help determine the treatment plan. Examples of wounds that may cause delayed tissue damage, and therefore different management, include high-velocity gunshot wounds and crush injuries. Photographs are useful to place in the

medical record and to educate the patient on the extent of their injuries. If there is significant swelling, previous photos of the patient may be useful to aid in closure and for future reconstruction [5].

It is important to achieve hemostasis when stabilizing and evaluating the patient who has sustained trauma. Most bleeding will respond to application of a pressure dressing. Occasionally, surgical exploration and packing of the wound under general anesthesia may be indicated. In rare instances, vessels in the neck may need to be ligated. Indiscriminate clamping inside the wound should be avoided because damage to important structures such as the facial nerve or parotid duct may result. It is unusual for bleeding from soft tissue injuries to the face to result in a shock state. Lacerations involving the scalp can occasionally be difficult to control with pressure and may require clamping, ligation, or electrocautery. Electrocautery should be used judiciously and only when direct pressure and tying of visible vessels fail because it may result in poor wound healing [6].

In soft tissue injuries not involving the face, the length of time from initial injury to treatment is important. Secondary risk of infection increases with the lapse of time [7]. Closure should therefore occur once the patient is stabilized, ideally within  $6\mathrm{h}$  but up to  $12\mathrm{h}$  after the injury to improve cosmetic outcomes and loss of important landmarks [8]. Because of the rich vascularity of the face, there is no "golden period" for suture repair of facial wounds. In fact, healing of facial wounds is unaffected by the interval between injury and repair [9]. Facial soft tissue injuries are common in pediatric patients. This patient population heals quickly, but also tends to develop hypertrophic scars. Proper wound management during the healing phase can help to minimize the risk of adverse scar formation [10].

Golden period refers to the time period following an injury it is safe to primarily close a wound.

Patients who are immunized and have received a booster injection within the last 10 years do not require tetanus prophylaxis if the wound is not tetanus-prone. Tetanus-prone wounds are those with heavy contamination from soil or manure, devitalized tissue, or deep puncture wounds. If the wound is tetanus-prone and the patient has not received a booster injection within 5 years before the injury, a  $0.5\mathrm{mL}$  tetanus toxoid (Tt) booster injection should be given. If the patient has not received a booster within 10 years before the injury, they should receive a booster injection for any wound. Patients who are not immunized should receive both a booster injection and

The primary goal in managing traumatic wounds is to achieve rapid healing with optimal functional and aesthetic results. Despite good wound care, some infections still occur. Prophylactic antibiotics have a role in the management of certain types of wounds [12].

Treatment of soft tissue injuries involves early reconstructive procedures addressing both the soft tissue and the underlying bony injury in a minimum number of stages [13, 14]. In a patient with large avulsion of tissue, definitive early reconstruction of the tissue loss with regional or microvascular flaps may be required [15, 16]. Various local flaps provide reliable and aesthetic treatment options for early repair of soft tissue defects secondary to trauma [17].

# Key Points

- Initial examination involves evaluation, stabilization, and immediate management of any life-threatening conditions.  
Pressure dressings will address most bleeding.  
- Soft tissue injury involves hemostasis, irrigation, debridement, and removal of foreign bodies.

# 17.3 Anatomic Evaluation

After the initial evaluation and resuscitation, injuries to the soft tissues should be evaluation during the secondary survey. Patients sustaining trauma often have associated soft tissue injuries. Facial injuries can be superficial but may extend to involve adjacent structures including bones, nerves, ducts, muscles, vessels, glands, and/or dentoalveolar structures. Associated injuries, including vascular injury, may develop acutely or days after the injury [18, 19].

A thorough head and neck examination determines the extent of associated facial wounds. Peripheral cranial nerves are commonly involved with lacerations involving the face. The facial nerve divides the parotid gland into deep and superficial portions (Fig. 17.1). Any injury to the gland should raise suspicion for associated facial nerve injury [20]. The facial nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen and divides into five branches within the parotid gland (Fig. 17.2). The House-Brackmann facial nerve grading scale is used to assess damage (Table 17.1) [21]. Proximal facial nerve injuries posterior to a vertical line drawn from the lateral canthus should be repaired using microsurgical techniques. Suspected injuries should be explored within  $72\mathrm{h}$  due to Wallerian degeneration [22].

Because of the significant peripheral anastomoses, repair of facial nerve injuries involving distal branches anterior to the canthal plane is unnecessary (Fig. 17.3).

The surgeon should have a true knowledge about the anatomy of the facial nerve branches [23]. The buccal branch has a close relationship with the parotid gland for over  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$  after it emerges from the parotid and is normally inferior to the parotid duct [24].

Injury to the parotid gland is often associated with penetrating wounds of the face and may lead to leak of saliva into the soft tissue [25]. Injuries to the parotid gland have been reported to occur in  $0.21\%$  of trauma

![](images/8725a88bba38c7c72d24dd4f2ed82beef2fc8ded96d709506b8bfa5c73dd40ec.jpg)

cases and are more common than injuries to the submandibular or sublingual glands [26]. Any penetrating injury from the tragus to the midportion of the upper lip should arise suspicion of parotid gland or parotid duct injury [27]. If the parotid gland is injured but the parenchyma remains intact, the injury may be treated conservatively. Damage to the parenchyma warrants treatment and careful evaluation of the facial nerve. In the absence of facial nerve injury, the capsule may be sutured along with the wound. A pressure dressing should be applied for  $48\mathrm{h}$  to prevent sialocele formation [20]. The dressing may also be changed at  $24\mathrm{h}$  to allow for reevaluation of the injury [28].

The parotid duct is approximately  $5\mathrm{cm}$  in length and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter. It exits the gland and runs along the superficial surface of the masseter muscle and then penetrates the buccinators muscle to enter the oral cavity opposite the upper second molar. Treatment of parotid duct injuries depends on the location of the injury. These injuries should be repaired in the operating room with the aid of magnification. If the injury involves the proximal duct while it is still in the gland, the parotid capsule should be closed and a pressure dressing placed. If the injury is located in the midregion of the duct, the duct should be repaired. Injuries involving the terminal portion of the duct should be drained directly into the mouth. Lacrimal probes are useful in cannulating the duct and identifying injuries [29]. A Silastic catheter is placed to bridge the defect. The severed ends are then sutured over the catheter, which is left in place for 10-14 days (Fig. 17.4).

Several protocols are available for the evaluation and treatment of penetrating injuries to the neck, face, and temporal bone. If there is suspicion that deep critical structures have been injured, the appropriate protocol should be followed (Fig. 17.5).

# Key Points

Injury to the facial nerve may occur with lacerations to the face.  
The facial nerve can be divided at the lateral canthus; proximal injuries should be repaired microsurgically, while distal branches do not require treatment due to anastomoses.  
- Parotid gland injuries are treated based on location - those within the capsule are treated closed with a pressure dressing, the duct may be treated with a sutured Silastic catheter, and distal terminal injuries may be drained into the mouth.

# 17.4 Sequence of Repair and Basic Technique

A decision is made to repair the wound in the emergency department or to perform the repair in the operating room under general anesthesia. Large, complicated lacerations demand ideal lighting and patient cooperation. In injuries in which there is a concern that deep structures have been damaged, a general anesthetic affords the best opportunity for exploration and repair. The patient may require repair of other traumatic injuries in the operating room, and often, definitive repair of associated facial soft tissue injuries may be performed at the same time.

A thorough evaluation of the seventh cranial nerve should be undertaken before injection of anesthetic or administration of a general anesthetic. Injecting local anesthetic before cleaning the wound will allow more effective preparation. Local anesthetics containing epinephrine have been used successfully in all areas of

the face but may not be optimal in areas where tissue monitoring is critical or where extensive undermining of soft tissue is necessary [30]. One should avoid injecting directly into the wound when important landmarks may be distorted. Regional nerve blocks are beneficial in minimizing the amount of local anesthesia required and to also prevent distortion of tissues [31].

After adequate anesthesia has been obtained, the wound is thoroughly debrided. Nonvital tissue is conservatively excised in an attempt to salvage most of the tissue. Devitalized tissue potentiates infection at a wound site and leads to release of inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and macrophages that delay wound healing. An anaerobic environment results and limits leukocyte function [32]. Soft tissue wounds are often contaminated with bacteria and foreign material. Treatment of these injuries involves copious irrigation

and is aimed at minimizing the bacterial wound flora and removing any foreign bodies. A large syringe with an 18-gauge needle is used to irrigate the wound; digital agitation can also be utilized to aid irrigation. With respect to infection rates, studies have shown no statistical difference in wounds irrigated with normal saline when compared with other solutions. Pulsatile-type irrigation devices may be helpful to remove debris, necrotic tissues, and loose material. However, its use should be reserved for use when other methods have insufficiently cleaned the wound because it has been shown to damage soft tissue [33]. Hydrogen peroxide impedes wound healing and has poor bactericidal activity. Careful and meticulous cleaning of the wounds primarily will avoid unfavorable results such as "tattooing," infection, hypertrophic scarring, and granulomas. A scrub brush and detergent soap may be necessary to remove deeply embedded foreign material.

# Tips

A good rule is to avoid irrigating the wound with any solution that would not be suitable for irrigating the eye.

Proper cleaning and good surgical technique are imperative in minimizing infection. Infections are rare when the wound is closed so that no dead space, devitalized tissue, or foreign bodies remain beneath the sutured skin. Hydrogen peroxide is minimally bactericidal and toxic to fibroblasts even when diluted to 1:100 [34]. Diluted hydrogen peroxide is useful in the postoperative period in cleaning crusts away from incision lines in order to minimize scarring.

Common methods for closing wounds include suturing, applying adhesives, and stapling. A layered closure is almost always necessary and eliminates dead space beneath the wound. If the dead space is not obliterated, accumulation of inflammatory exudates may occur. This leads to infection, which, in turn, may cause tension across the epidermis. Layered closure also aids in reducing tension across the superficial layer. Tension can cause necrosis of the skin edges due to impairment of the vascular supply and causes an increase in scarring [35].

Injuries involving anatomic borders such as the vermillion of the lip must be reapproximated precisely. Examples of these landmarks include eyebrows, lip margins, and eyelids. Lacerations should be closed by placing a suture in the center of the laceration to avoid excessive tissue on the end of the laceration (dog-ear). Deep layers should be reapproximated with 3-0 or 4-0 buried resorbable sutures. The superficial skin is closed with 5-0 or 6-0 suture. It is important to avoid causing puncture marks when grasping the wound edges.

Skin sutures should be removed 4-6 days after placement. By this time, the wound has regained only  $3 - 7\%$  of its tensile strength, and adhesive strips (Steri-Strips) help support the wound margins [36].

At 7-10 days after suture removal, the collagen has begun to cross-link. The wound is now able to tolerate early controlled motion with little risk of disruption [37] (Fig. 17.6). As the wound heals, it will contract along its length and width and become inverted due to collagen and fibroblast maturation. Initial management is aimed at producing a slightly everted wound edge. The wound continues to remodel up to a year after injury but never regains greater than  $80\%$  of the strength of intact skin.

Tissue adhesives are gaining in popularity. Some studies have suggested similar cosmetic outcomes in wounds treated with octylcyanoacrylate when compared with standard wound closure techniques for non-crushed-induced lacerations treated less than  $6\mathrm{h}$  after injury [38-40]. Closure of lacerations with octylcyanoacrylate is

faster than standard wound closure methods. Tissue adhesive may therefore be indicated in children or uncooperative patients with small, clean wounds. However, tissue adhesives often get within the wound, preventing exact approximation of the wound edges [33]. Therefore, its use should be avoided in complex lacerations involving the face where there are aesthetic concerns.

Skin staples are also an alternative method for wound closure. Staples are advantageous because they are fast, have minimal inflammatory reaction, and produce an everted wound edge. Their use, however, should be limited to hair-bearing areas. Compared to sutures, they have the added benefit of being faster to place and remove.

Suture materials and different surgical techniques do not show substantial differences in relation to outcome. General characteristics of the patient (i.e., sex and age) and of the wound (i.e., length and site) seem to be important predictors of adverse tissue reaction [41, 42]. Suboptimal appearance is associated with wounds that are infected, wide, or incompletely approximated or have sustained a crush injury. The total number of bacteria is more important than the species of bacteria contaminating a wound. Greater than  $10^{5}$  aerobic organisms per gram of tissue are needed for contamination, and crush-type wounds are 100 times more susceptible to infection [43].

Delayed primary closure may be necessary in some instances. Patients who may benefit from a delayed procedure include those with extensive facial edema, a subcutaneous hematoma, or wounds that are severely contused and contain devitalized tissue. Secondary revision procedures are usually undertaken months later to allow for scar maturation.

Clinical examination and radiographs are used to diagnose fractures of the face. Facial fractures are ideally treated before soft tissue repair. If the repair of the facial bones is delayed, it is optimal to close the lacerations initially. The wounds can be reentered and revised if needed to access the fracture site.

After evaluation of the facial nerve, local anesthetic should be administered. Avoid anesthetics with epinephrine and directly depositing into the wound to avoid distortion.

Excise nonvital tissue and thoroughly irrigate the wound to remove debris and bacteria and to minimize risk of infection.  
Wounds may be closed with sutures, skin staples, or tissue adhesive. Sutures are the material of choice in aesthetically demanding areas.  
- Closure should produce an everted wound edge with minimal dead space and tension. For closure of anatomic borders, first place a suture at the center of the laceration to avoid excessive tissue at the end of the laceration.

Fig. 17.6 Stages of wound healing

# 17.5 Types of Injuries

# 17.5.1 Abrasions

Abrasions are caused by shear forces that remove a superficial layer of skin (Fig. 17.7). The wound should be gently cleansed and irrigated with normal saline. These superficial injuries usually heal with local wound care. It is

important to determine whether foreign bodies have been embedded into the wound. Failure to remove all foreign material can lead to permanent "tattooing" of the soft tissue. After cleansing the wound, the abrasion is covered with a thin layer of topical antibiotic ointment to minimize desiccation and secondary crusting of the wound.

Reepithelialization without significant scarring is complete in 7-10 days if the epidermal pegs have not

$\square$  Fig. 17.7 Patient with extensive abrasions involving the superficial and deep dermis

been completely removed. If the laceration significantly extends into the reticular dermal layer, significant scarring is likely.

# 17.5.2 Contusions

Contusions are caused by blunt trauma that cause edema and hematoma formation in the subcutaneous tissues. The associated soft tissue swelling and ecchymosis can be extensive. Small hematomas usually resolve without treatment, but hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation of the involved can occur but is rarely permanent. Large hematomas should be drained to prevent permanent pigmentary changes and secondary subcutaneous atrophy.

# 17.5.3 Lacerations

Lacerations are caused by sharp injuries to the soft tissue that include the epidermis and dermis (Fig. 17.8). They can have sharp, contused, ragged, or stellate margins. The

depth of penetration should be carefully explored in the acute setting. Closure is performed using a layered technique. If the margins are beveled or ragged, they should be conservatively excised to provide perpendicular skin edges to prevent excessive scar formation. Rarely is there an indication for changing the direction of the wound margins by Z-plasty at the time of primary wound repair. Flaplike lacerations occur when a component of the soft tissue has been elevated secondary to trauma. Eliminating dead space by layered closure and pressure dressings is especially important in these "trap-door" injuries.

# 17.5.4 Avulsive Injuries

Avulsive injuries are characterized by the loss of segments of soft tissues and are the most difficult to repair. Undermining the adjacent tissue followed by primary closure can close small areas. When the primary closure is not possible, other options are considered. These include local flaps or allowing the wound to heal by secondary intention followed by delayed soft tissue techniques. If a significant amount of soft tissue is missing, then a skin graft, local flaps, or free tissue transfer may be necessary (  $\square$  Fig. 17.9).

# 17.5.5 Animal and Human Bites

Bite wounds are especially prone to infectious complications. Such complications can create more difficulties than the initial tissue damage itself for restoring an aesthetic appearance. Dog bites are most common in children, with more severe injuries occurring in those younger than 5 years of age. Animal bites occur mostly in the midface, specifically the nose, lips, cheeks, and periorbita [44, 45]. Canines can generate 200-450 psi, and examination for fractures should be performed [46]. Management of bite injuries involves liberal amounts of irrigation, debridement, and meticulous primary closure to reduce infection and improve aesthetic outcomes [47].

Animal and human bites are most often polymicrobial, containing aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Dog bites often open and lend themselves to vigorous irrigation and debridement. Cats have a large quantity of bacteria in their mouth, with the most frequent and important pathogen being Pasteurella multocida [48]. Cat bites are associated with a twofold higher risk of infection than the more common dog bite wounds. Because cat bites usually cause puncture wounds, they are difficult to clean. Having the patient follow-up  $24 - 48\mathrm{h}$  after the initiation of therapy allows the surgeon to monitor the wound for any signs of infection.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for animal bites continues to be debated with few good prospective studies available [48, 49]. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is the current drug of choice for bite wounds. Alternatively, clindamycin may be prescribed in the case of a penicillin allergy. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be directed at  $P_{\cdot}$  multocida for infections presenting within  $24\mathrm{h}$  of injury. For wounds that present after  $24\mathrm{h}$  of injury, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are more common, and antibiotic prophylaxis with a penicillinase-resistant antibiotic should be chosen [50].

Immediate closure of bite injuries is safe, even with old injuries [51]. There is approximately a  $6\%$  rate of infection when bite wounds are sutured primarily, and it is acceptable in lacerations where there are cosmetic concerns [52]. Extensive animal bite wounds involving the face should be treated according to the criteria of

aesthetic reconstructive surgery. Delay in presentation beyond  $24\mathrm{h}$  is not necessarily a contradiction to immediate repair, but extensive crushing of the tissue or extensive edema usually dictates a more conservative approach, such as delayed closure [53]. Rabies prophylaxis should be given for bite wounds that occur in unprovoked domestic dog or cat that exhibits bizarre behavior or an attack by a wild animal such as a raccoon, skunk, bat, fox, or coyote [54].

# 17.5.6 Gunshot Wounds to the Face

Gunshot wounds require careful attention and evaluation for associated facial fractures. Both entry and exit wounds should be evaluated. Entry wounds create a crush injury as the projectile enters. As the projectile

travels through the cavity, it destroys tissue, producing a permanent cavity; the pressure shock wave created has the potential to damage adjacent vasculature [33]. Exit wounds often produce marked tissue destruction and require acute debridement. The primary phase requires urgent airway management as well as control of any active bleeding. Bleeding is controlled though direct pressure, clamping of vessels, and packing. If there is suspicion to damage of the external carotid, angiographic embolization is indicated. The gold standard for imaging is computed tomography (CT). Early management should focus on removing all foreign debris and conservative debridement with a focus on preserving as much soft tissue as possible. Only necrotic tissues should be excised, and tissue manipulation should be minimized. Due to the high velocity of gunshot wounds, there is potential for damage peripheral to the wound; therefore, debridement should be performed every  $24 - 48\mathrm{h}$  [22, 33, 55]. Regional flaps can be useful in treating facial soft tissue defects caused by gunshot wounds [15] (Fig. 17.10). Many of the patients have combined

hard and soft tissue injuries and will require staged surgeries for reconstruction [56].

Ballistic facial injuries are grouped by etiology: gunshot, shotgun, and high-energy avulsive injuries [57]. Blast injuries, such as those caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs), show varying degrees of facial injuries in different patterns with or without flash burns. These patients are subjected to intense thermal inhalation that leads to oronasopharyngeal edema and toxic fume inhalation that may require the management of life-threatening airway compromise [58]. Over the past 20 years, advances in imaging and introduction of craniofacial approaches with rigid fixation have led to an evolution of treating facial injuries. The aesthetic and functional results of facial injury are improved dramatically by the combination of a definitive open reduction of bone with early replacement of soft tissue into its primary position. Immediate definitive reconstructions with rigid fixations of the facial fractures and closure of the lacerations are recommended. Standard incisions often need to be modified because of the soft tissue wounds.

# Key Points

Lacerations should be closed with a layered technique to avoid dead space.  
- Primarily undermining adjacent tissue may close small avulsions; otherwise, they may be repaired with a local flap or allowed to heal secondarily.  
- Bite wounds may be closed immediately unless contraindicated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is the antibiotic of choice in animal bites.  
Gunshot wounds require reconstruction of hard and soft tissues concomitantly for optimal results.

# 17.6 Regional Considerations

Certain anatomic areas deserve special consideration. Reestablishment of anatomic zones with proper orientation is critical in achieving optimal aesthetic results. The major aesthetic subunits include the scalp, forehead, periorbital, nose, perioral, ear, neck, and cheek [59].

# 17.6.1 Scalp and Forehead

Challenges to reconstruction of the scalp and forehead include tissue inelasticity, proximity to neurovascular structures, and hair-bearing areas such as the forehead and eyebrows [55]. Scalp wounds can occasionally cause a large amount of blood loss owing to the rich vascular supply in this region and the inelasticity of the scalp preventing contraction and closure of the vessels. The layers of the scalp (SCALP) include the skin (S), subcutaneous tissue (C), aponeurosis layer (A), loose

subepicranial space (L), and pericranial layer (P). With injuries to the forehead, the frontal branch of the facial nerve is at risk of being damaged. Prior to injecting anesthetic, the patient should be asked to raise their eyebrows to determine if nerve injury has occurred.

In patients sustaining scalp injuries, it is important to evaluate for associated intracranial injuries. Careful inspection should be performed to look for evidence of skull fractures. Because the scalp has an excellent blood supply in the subcutaneous tissues as well as the pericranial layers, avulsed tissue, skin grafts, and various flaps have a high rate of survival. One study showed no significant difference in rate of infection in scalp lacerations that were irrigated compared with those that were not [60].

Primary wound closure is the preferred method for the scalp and forehead. Defects in the scalp  $3\mathrm{cm}$  or less may be primarily closed; caution must be exercised in the central scalp and vertex due to the greater wound tension. To aid in primary closure, adjunctive techniques such as rapid intraoperative expansion and galeotomies may be used [61]. Originally described by Sasaki [62], rapid intraoperative expansion utilizes a balloon device such as a Foley catheter. Repeated expansion and deflation of the device can recruit  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  or additional tissue to aid in primary closure. Galeotomies, full-thickness incisions in the galea aponeurotica, may be incised parallel to the wound to reduce tension as well. Closure may proceed in a multi-layered fashion, with care to avoid distorting any hair-bearing structures such as the eyebrow or forehead.

Wounds in non-hair-bearing areas with a partial thickness defect may be reconstructed by healing by second intention. Consideration may also be given to patients who cannot tolerate a surgical procedure or are contraindicated for general anesthesia. Contraindications

for secondary healing intention include any intrinsic wound-healing deficits, such as smoking and local radiation. The time for the wound to granulate, contract, and reepithelialize is dependent on the size of the wound. It should be noted that the decision to heal by second intention requires commitment from the surgeon and patient, as wound care is essential. The wound must remain clean, moist, and covered for the duration of healing. Additionally, the scars produced from secondary intention healing can contract as much as  $60\%$ , carrying the potential for distorting adjacent structures [55].

In avulsive defects in which the pericranium is intact and primary closure is not possible, a split-thickness skin graft can be used. These have a limited role in the scalp due to their less than ideal esthetic outcome and lack of durability. Skin grafts work by passively absorbing nutrients through diffusion, with a vascular network forming by  $36 - 72\mathrm{h}$  [55]. A secondary reconstructive procedure involving various rotational and advancement flaps or tissue expansion can be undertaken after healing of the defect [63]. If the cranial bone is exposed with large avulsive defects, then various flap procedures are indicated primarily. If a flap is not indicated and healing by secondary intention is utilized, a bur may be used to drill through the calvarial table to expose the diploic vessels to create a vascular bed. Temporary skin substitutes may be used to protect the wound and provide a surface for tissue growth. Purse-string sutures may also be placed to decrease the size of the wound.

Alternatives to forehead and scalp reconstruction include dermal alternatives and tissue expansion. Initially developed for burn patients, dermal alternatives have found use in reconstructive surgery and chronic wounds [64]. Dermal alternatives may be used as an alternate method for reconstructing large scalp defects instead of microvascular free flap reconstruction when appropriate. Disadvantages to using dermal alternatives include the lengthy wound care period and necessity for a second procedure. Tissue expanders, originally described by Neumann [65] in 1957, tissue expansion recruits hair-bearing tissue with matching color and texture. Approximately  $50\%$  of the scalp can be reconstructed without significant hair thinning [55]. The tissue available from each expander can be approximated by measuring the convex length and subtracting the base diameter [55] (Fig. 17.11).

Reconstruction of the eyebrow is difficult secondarily, and efforts to repair lacerations without distortion are important. Eyebrows should never be shaved, because regrowth of the hair is unpredictable. Closure of lacera

tions should attempt to salvage as much tissue as possible. Care should be given to avoid damage to the remaining hair follicles. To minimize damage and resultant alopecia, the galea should be approximated to reduce the tension on the superficial skin that includes the hair follicles. Scars can be removed 6-12 months later with incisions made parallel to the hair follicles to avoid injury.

# 17.6.2 Eyelid and Nasolacrimal Apparatus

A thorough ophthalmologic examination is important to assess for injuries to the globe and to evaluate and document visual acuity. In particular, the lower eyelid should be evaluated for tightness. The lower eyelid may be retracted with fingers; if the eyelid does not snap back into position and appose the globe, there should be suspicion for damage to either the medial or lateral canthus tendons [22]. Closure of lacerations involving the eyelids is done in a layered fashion from the inside out conjunctiva, tarsus, and then skin (Fig. 17.12). Care should be taken to precisely reapproximate the eyelid margins and the tarsus (Fig. 17.13). The conjunctiva and tarsus are closed with resorbable sutures with the knot buried to avoid irrigating the cornea. The orbicularis muscle is then closed followed by closure of the skin. Injuries involving the upper eyelid may include detachment of the levator aponeurosis and Muller's muscle from the tarsal plate. The muscles should then be identified and reattached to the tarsal plate in order to prevent ptosis and restore levator function.

The lacrimal gland produces tears, which flow across the cornea and drain into canaliculi via the puncta of the upper and lower eyelid margins (Fig. 17.14). From the canaliculi, the tears enter the nasolacrimal duct and drain into the inferior meatus of the nose. Any lacerations that involve the medial third of the eyelid should be carefully inspected for damage to the canaliculus [66]. Suspicion of a lacrimal injury should prompt a Jones test, where fluorescein eye drops are introduced to the injured eye. After  $5 - 10\mathrm{min}$  , fluorescein present intranasally confirms a lacrimal injury and should be repaired with  $72\mathrm{h}$  [22]. Repair is accomplished by introducing a lacrimal duct probe into the puncta and into the wound (Fig. 17.15). The ends of the lacerated duct are identified and approximated over a Silastic tube (Crawford tube). The tube is left in place for 8-12 weeks. If only one canaliculus is intact and functioning, the patient most likely will have adequate drainage [67]. If the patient exhibits chronic epiphora postoperatively, then a dacryocystorhinostomy is indicated.

Fig. 17.14 Nasolacrimal system anatomy

Full-thickness eyelid defects less than  $50\%$  may be closed primarily. A lateral canthotomy with cantholysis may be included to reduce tension. Partial-thickness eyelid defects less than  $50\%$  may be reconstructed with a local flap, while those greater than  $50\%$  will require a skin graft from the opposite eyelid with excellent texture

and color match (Fig. 17.16). Avulsive injuries to the eyelids are treated with skin grafts and/or local flaps.

# 17.6.3 Nose

The nose occupies a prominent position on the face and is often injured. The most commonly injured sites are the nasal tip, dorsum, and nasal root [68]. When there is soft tissue injury to the nose, there should be high suspicion of associated bony damage and intranasal injury. The presence of midline deviation should also prompt suspicion of bony or cartilaginous injury. Injuries of the internal nose should be evaluated using a nasal speculum. The septum should be evaluated for the presence of a hematoma, which appears as a bluish elevation of the mucosa. Hematomas involving the nasal septum should be evacuated with a small incision or needle aspiration. Nasal packing or Silastic nasal splints can be placed to prevent recurrence of the hematomas and are removed in 7-10 days. A running 4-0 chromic gut mattress suture placed through and through the septum can prevent recurrence. Untreated hematomas can lead to infection and necrosis of the cartilage, which may cause collapse of the septum and a resultant "saddle nose."

There is an excellent blood supply to the nose. Lacerations of the external nose should be closed with 6-0 nonabsorbable sutures in a layered fashion. Key sutures should be placed to reapproximate anatomic landmarks to ensure proper orientation, especially around the nasal rim. In particular, the alar margin should be closed with vertical mattress sutures with exaggerated eversion to prevent notching. Bone, carti

lage, and/or skin grafts may be required to reconstruct avulsive defects of the nose. Skin grafts harvested from the periauricular regions provide excellent color and texture match [69]. Local flaps may be required to restore missing tissue, with the forehead flap being the gold standard for reconstruction [68] (Fig. 17.17). If a flap does not provide sufficient tissue, a free tissue transfer should be considered.

# 17.6.4 Ear

Injuries involving the external ear should alert one to the possibility of other injuries. An otoscopic examination of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane combined with a hearing assessment should be performed before treatment. Injuries to the auricle include ecchymosis, abrasion, laceration, hematoma, and partial or total avulsion.

Hematomas involving the ear usually occur when the ear sustains a glancing blow. These should be drained with a needle or incision. An incision is often preferable to simple aspiration because there is less of a chance of reaccumulation of the hematoma [70]. Evacuation of the hematoma prevents fibrosis and development of a "cauliflower ear" deformity. A bolster dressing should be placed to prevent recurrence of the hematoma. A stent can also be fabricated from polysiloxane impression material and kept in place for 7 days [71].

The ear has a very good vascular supply and can maintain tissue on a small pedicle. Injuries involving the cartilage often do not require sutures. If sutures are required, a minimal number are used to avoid devitalizing the region of cartilage (Fig. 17.18). Avulsive injuries of the ear can involve a portion of the ear or the entire ear. If the avulsed segment is  $1\mathrm{cm}$  or less, it can be reattached and allowed to revascularize [72]. For larger avulsive injuries, the ear should be examined for vessels for the possibility of microvascular reattachment. A more predictable method is to use the "pocket principle" described by Mladick and coworkers [73] (Fig. 17.19). The detached ear is dermabraded to remove superficial dermis and reattached to the stump. It is then buried underneath a skin flap elevated in the posterior auricular region to provide vascular supply to the reattached ear. Approximately 2-3 weeks later, the revascularized ear is uncovered and allowed to reepithelialize.

If salvage of the ear is not possible, other alternatives include staged reconstruction with rib cartilage, skin flaps, or silicone implants. The introduction of osseointegrated implants has made prosthetic reconstruction an appealing treatment option (Fig. 17.20).

# 17.6.5 Lip

The lip anatomy involves a transition of mucosal tissue to skin. Scars that affect the orbicularis oris may result in functional difficulties. Nerve blocks are helpful in

beneath a skin flap and allowed to revascularize for 3 weeks before uncovering

wounds involving the lip to prevent distortion caused from injecting directly into the wound. The infraorbital nerve block may be used for the upper lip, and the mental nerve block may be used for the lower lip and chin. A single suture should be placed initially to reapproximate the vermilion border exactly because misalignment of even less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  can cause cosmetic deformity [22]. Deep tissues are closed in layers followed by closure of the mucosa with 4-0 chromic and skin closure with 6-0 nylon sutures. The vermilion border in particular should be closed with a vertical mattress suture to prevent formation of a depression.

To manage defects in the philtrum, they can be managed depending on whether the vermilion is involved.

For defects only involving the skin, defects less than half the philtrum can be closed primarily. If the defect cannot be primarily closed, a preauricular full-thickness skin graft may be indicated with extension of the entire philtrum to conceal scars. Defects of the vermilion may be reconstructed with a local flap, such as a buccal mucosa advancement flap or V-Y advancement flap. When the defect is less than half the lip and contains skin and vermilion, it may be closed primarily in similar fashion to the skin-only defect. Those larger than half the lip will require reconstruction with an Abbe flap.

Avulsive defects of the lips require special attention. Up to one fourth of the lip can be closed primarily with acceptable functional and aesthetic results. Injuries that

involve a greater amount of tissue loss can be reconstructed with a variety of flaps (i.e., Abbe-Estlander or Karapandzic) (Fig. 17.21). In rare instances, traumatic amputation of the lip may occur. If possible, lip replantation is recommended to restore both function and aesthetics. The small caliber of the superior and inferior labial vessels makes lip replantation difficult.

Management of congestion is critical for the success of the replantation, with patients requiring leeching, anticoagulation, and prophylactic antibiotics [8].

# 17.6.6 Neck

Successful management of penetrating injuries of the neck depends on a clear understanding of anatomy of the region. Injuries can involve deep structures affecting the vascular, respiratory, digestive, neurologic, endocrine, and skeletal systems [74]. The neck is divided into three anatomic zones [75]. Zone I extends from the level of the clavicles and sternal notch to the cricoid cartilage. Zone II is from the level of the cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible. It is the most surgically accessible and is the easiest to evaluate intraoperatively without the aid of preoperative diagnostic testing. Zone III extends from the angle of the mandible to the base of the skull.

There is controversy regarding which penetrating neck wounds require exploration [74-78]. Serial physical examinations alone have been shown to be effective. In cases in which serial physical examinations are not possible, mandatory exploration of neck wounds may be beneficial. There should be a high index of suspicion for

esophageal injuries because complications can be devastating if repair is delayed. Primary repair is most often indicated in tracheal and vascular injuries.

# 17.6.7 Cheek

Of the aesthetic subunits, the cheek has the largest surface area. The smooth surface and convexity make hiding scars difficult on the cheek and require careful planning. Additionally, because of the movement of the cheeks in facial expression, reconstructing the cheek is inherently difficult. Small- to moderate-size defects are amenable to primary wound closure because of the inherent laxity, while larger defects may require a local or regional flap (Fig. 17.22).

When considering primary closure, it is important to assess the skin for its elasticity and thickness. Primary

closure may be performed up to  $4\mathrm{cm}$  if there are sufficient skin and laxity. If possible, sutures should be placed at aesthetic subunit borders while undermining of adjacent tissue to for tension-free wound closure. Circular or irregular defects may be converted into fusiform with M-plasty, while larger defects may benefit from a lazy S-plasty.

# 17.7 Postoperative Wound Care

Careful postoperative care and follow-up are important to optimize results. Wounds should be monitored closely to determine whether early intervention is indicated to minimize scar contracture or hypertrophic scarring. Local flaps and grafts may be indicated secondarily. Local injection of steroids provides an adjunct in the management of specific types of injuries. Facial scars

continue to mature over a period of 12-18 months. One study found no difference in outcome of surgical scars treated with pulsed carbon dioxide laser when compared with dermabrasion [79].

Keeping a wound clean and scab-free allows for more rapid reepithelialization [80]. Epithelial cells survive and migrate better in a moist environment. Antibiotic ointment can enhance this migration and is recommended from days 2 to 7. New ointment should be applied daily after removal of the previous dressing with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide, and dressing with polymyxin B sulfate and bacitracin zinc (Polysporin) ointment is standard. After the first week, an ointment without antibiotics such as petroleum jelly should be applied [33]. It is not epithelialization that provides strength to the wound but rather the collagen fibers supporting the surface. Rebuilding of fibers takes time, and suturing a wound splints the skin together until new connective tissue is built. Patients should avoid sun exposure for the first 6 months after the injury to avoid hyperpigmentation of the areas. After healing, the repaired tissues achieve  $70 - 80\%$  strength compared to the original tissues [33].

For simple, clean wounds that have been adequately irrigated and debrided, systemic antibiotics are not indicated. Consideration should be given for broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics in cases such as bite wounds, delayed closure, jagged wound edges, and immunocompromised patients [81].

# Conclusion

Soft tissue injuries involving the face can be devastating to the patient both physically and psychologically. Primary repair of these wounds is almost always advantageous over delayed secondary procedures. The primary goals of treatment are to restore the patient to his or her preoperative state of function and achieve an aesthetic result.
