# 28.1 Introduction

Trauma is the leading cause of death in children in North America and is a major cause of disability and financial burden to the healthcare system. Delays in evaluation and management of major trauma result in more ( $\sim 30\%$ ) early death in children who are seriously injured [1]. For these reasons, the injured child requires very expedient, careful and thorough evaluation and prompt management to achieve good outcomes. This is often challenging due to a number of issues, including transport issues, lack of dedicated pediatric emergency care, emergency room environs during evaluation—a hurt, anxious or non-communicative child, an absent caregiver or a distraught caregiver and family, and the urgency of quick assessments and interventions.

The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) [2] of the American College of Surgeons collects submitted data from level 1 and dedicated pediatric trauma centres every year in order to follow trends in and identify key epidemiologic factors relative to pediatric injuries in the USA. These data for 2016 suggest the following:

- An increase in the numbers of injured children and those requiring emergency and in-hospital management for their injuries.  
- Persistent bimodal increase in trauma in the early childhood years (age 0–2 years, infants due to falls) with a peak in adolescence, particularly males (motor vehicle crashes).  
- Most trauma is due to motor vehicle crashes, followed by falls, sport and recreation and interpersonal violence.  
- More children die from head injury (usually blunt trauma).  
The presence of severe extracranial injury doubles mortality and morbidity in head-injured children.  
Most pediatric trauma is considered preventable.

# 28.2 History

The history of an injured child is directed at mechanism, witnesses and circumstances leading to and surrounding the event [3]. This may give important clues as to the body regions injured, depth or extent of injuries, and important environmental clues, such as the possibility of penetrating injuries, dynamics of impact, acceleration-deceleration or airborne mechanisms, and exposure to drugs or toxins [3, 4]. Information must be gleaned quickly as to time since event, approximate blood loss, witnessed seizures or vomiting, lucid intervals followed by somnolence and regathering information to corroborate and confirm mechanisms of injury [5]. Any suspicion for non-accidental causes of injury must be pursued to determine possible abuse [4, 5].

# 28.2.1 Child Maltreatment

Although the rate of intentional injuries to children has levelled off in the USA, the morbidity and mortality associated with abusive head trauma in infants are still very high [6].

Overall, about half of the injuries seen from physical abuse are in the head and neck region [7]. Therefore, vigilance and understanding must be exercised by the physician in the initial evaluation of the injured child.

Figure 28.1 illustrates the tell-tale signs of child maltreatment and provides a ready visual of how the abused and injured child may present. Careful listening and appropriate queries as to mechanism and date of injury must be weighed in the context of the physical injuries. Delays in seeking treatment, conflicting mechanism or circumstances for injury, absent or confrontational caregivers or resistance to further testing all serve to put the examiner on notice [7]. Documentation of a child's presentation of apparent health (or lack thereof), nutritional status, varying degrees and distributions of bruising or injury patterns are important to note and record and should prompt for further investigations.

# 28.3 Physical Evaluation

Assessment of severe trauma in children must take into account anatomical and physiological differences from that in the adult (Table 28.1). Due to the small body size with relative increased body surface area, injuries to one region easily involve other regions [1]. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for multiple injuries, which are often unnoticed, must be exercised by the management team

during initial trauma evaluation. Also, the disproportion between the head, midface and neck may result in more airway collapse or compromise in the supine child and precautionary steps should be taken to address this potential issue. Airway compromise may further lead to worsening hypoxia in children due to increased respiratory rate and oxygen consumption and decreased residual volume [1, 3].

Emergent evaluation of the injured child must follow the established routines as outlined in ATLS, which generally follows that for adults with notable exceptions for pediatric anatomy and physiology [6].

Evaluation proceeds simultaneously and fluidly—A—airway; B—breathing; C—circulation; and cervical spine; D—disability; and E—exposure. This is a dynamic process of continual evaluation, intervention and re-evaluation. As stated in the introduction to a text on pediatric trauma [7], 'The ultimate common pathway leading to death in the injured child is profound shock: the inadequate delivery of oxygen to the tissues'. Since children may be more profoundly affected by a traumatic event due to more body surface exposure (head, chest and abdomen) to insult and having less reserve in volume status, evaluation and interventions are paramount. As Emeritus Professor Alex Haller [8] observed in the Scudder Oration on Trauma, there is the well-known 'golden hour' in adult ATLS, but it is the 'platinum half-hour' in children when immediate and meaningful assessments and treatment must take place in order to resuscitate the severely injured child. This initial survey is termed the primary survey and often indicates or determines whether the child will survive. Most recently, the "Stop the Bleed" campaign launched by the American College of Surgeons and in partnership with EMS.gov, has highlighted the necessity of identifying and addressing life-threatening injuries which result in massive blood loss, especially in children [9]. This campaign was initiated after the Sandy Hook school-shooting tragedy in 2012 which identified acute blood loss as the terminal event in many of the children.

# 28.3.1 Airway

Airway loss or obstruction is the mechanism, which can result in rapid deterioration or death in the injured child. Stepwise evaluation and procedures are as follows:

1. Clear secretions, foreign bodies, loose teeth or tissue  
2. Assess patency and ability to maintain such  
3. Have a low threshold for intubation  
4. Constant cervical spine protection

# 28.3.2 Breathing

It is important to assess the ability to not only maintain the airway but also the quality of respiration. Thorough evaluation of the respiratory drive, effort and efficacy is key and should also include the following:

1. Oxygen administration to all patients initially, and then any with  $< 93\%$ $\mathrm{SaO}_2$  on room air  
2. Blow-by or hood for infants  
3.  $100\%$  oxygen by high-flow mask or non-rebreathing mask for children not able to maintain patency  
4. Monitor end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and exchange (keep  $<  40$

# 28.3.3 Circulation

Hypovolaemia is key to identify; children compensate well initially in blood or volume loss by compensatory heart rate increase, but once hypotension manifests, the child is on a downward spiral, which quickly leads to collapse if not reversed. The following parameters should be noted and met:

1. Total blood volume is roughly  $80~\mathrm{ml / kg}$  in the child patient  
2. Place 2 IV lines, pediatric urethral catheter  
3. Initial fluid resuscitation should administer  $20\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$  of warmed, isotonic solution (normal saline or lactated Ringers) over 15-20 minutes with re-evaluation of volume status.  
4. Repeat administration twice to achieve volume stability as noted by blood pressure increase, return of pulses, capillary refill  $< 2$  seconds and improved sensorium; reversal of sunken fontanelles and increased skin turgor are late indications of normotension.  
5. Obtain cross-matched or O-negative blood for transfusion, initial bolus of  $10 - 20\mathrm{ml / kg}$  
6. Defer further studies until stabilized

# 28.3.4 Cervical Spine

Cervical spine injuries in children primarily manifest as soft tissue in nature due to the flexible and extendable

nature of the bony vertebral structures surrounding the more fixed spinal cord and nerve roots. The fulcrum is higher in young children, near the atlanto-axial spine. Ensure and document:

1. Cervical stability with a properly fitted collar  
2. Check for midline tenderness, swelling, ecchymosis  
3. Deficits or asymmetry in movement, sensation may indicate progressive spinal cord injury  
4. Worsening or changing examination to obtain MRI if time allows and patient stable

# 28.3.5 Disability

Quickly look for and identify potential life-threatening injuries:

1. Fractures, open or with significant deformity  
2. Look for spontaneous movement of limbs to external stimulae  
3. What is the response to voice? Repeat often  
4. GCS for children may be utilized with modification for verbal responses:

(a) Appropriate words, smiling, fixes, follows—5  
(b) Cries but is consolable—4  
(c) Persistently irritable—3  
(d) Restless, agitated, non-purposeful—2  
(e) None—1

5. AVPU to quickly assess disability; score of 'P' or 'U' suggests GCS  $< 8$

(a) A—alert  
(b) V—response to verbal  
(c)  $\mathbf{P}$  response to painful stimuli  
(d) U—unresponsive

# 28.3.6 Exposure

Careful exposure and examination of the child should be done expeditiously but thoroughly in order to identify any other areas of injury and threat to resuscitation and survival:

1. Examination in a warmed room with overhead warmers  
2. Cover and dress open fractures and wounds, especially burns.  
3. A trained person should stabilize the cervical spine while the neck is examined, and then an appropriately sized cervical collar is placed.

The secondary survey then follows, which involves a more comprehensive examination looking for other head/neck injuries, CSF leaks, and a quick cranial nerve examination (pupils, eye movement, grimaces, and facial symmetry). The neck should be evaluated for tracheal

deviation, discoloration (expanding haematoma) or tenderness. Chest rise, symmetry and bilateral breath sounds should be confirmed. Abdominal injuries are accompanied by guarding or tenderness, a tense or ecchymotic abdomen and absence of bowel sounds. Vascular integrity should be confirmed by checking peripheral pulses and colour or temperature of extremities.

The following mnemonic AMPLE is useful for consideration during this phase of data gathering and evaluation:

A-allergies  
M—medications  
P—past medical history  
Llast meal  
E—environment, events

Generally, this involves having the parent or caregiver present who can reliably respond to such queries.

# 28.4 Head Injuries

Over half of the fatalities associated with trauma in children are due to traumatic brain injury; indeed,  $20 - 30\%$  of severe head trauma results in death [1, 10, 11]. This is usually due to blunt trauma from motor vehicle crashes, followed by falls and recreation. Diffuse axonal injury often results from the head being violently jerked about which results in torsional and contrecoup forces applied to and through the brain. This results in a tearing of individual neurons with subsequent oedema forming throughout much of the injured brain matter [10, 11]. Less common are intracranial haematomas seen more in the adult population. Children have more epidural haematomas (Fig. 28.2), which are collections outside of the dura as opposed to subdural haematomas, which collect under the dura and are associated with venous rupture [1, 4, 10]. Epidural haematomas result from torn meningeal arteries. These are classically associated with the 'lucid' interval after injury followed by rapid neurological deterioration; it is a neurosurgical emergency, which must be quickly confirmed and treated.

Expanding haematomas result in exponential increases in the intracranial pressure (ICP) with initial displacement into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ventricular chambers and sinuses. It is important to avoid hypotension, hypertension and hypoxia in pediatric brain injury as these states quickly accelerate forces contributing to increased ICP and less perfusion pressure to the brain, thereby increasing ischaemia [1, 3, 10]. Adequate gas exchange must be assured to avoid hypercarbia, which also will contribute to brain vasodilation and consequent hypertension and

hypoxia. The following targets and treatments should be observed in relation to brain injury in children [10]:

$= {Pa}{O}_{2} > {80}\mathrm{\;{mm}}\mathrm{{Hg}}$  or  ${\mathrm{{SaO}}}_{2} > {95}\%$  
$\mathrm{PaCO}_2 \sim 35 - 40 \mathrm{~mmHg}$  
High normal blood pressure for age  
Normothermia  
Anticonvulsants early in injury  
$\mathrm{ICP}\sim 20 - 25\mathrm{mmHg}$  
Avoid hypoglycaemia  
For increased ICP, consider hypertonic  $3\%$  NaCl at  $3\mathrm{ml / kg}$  and mannitol  $0.5 - 1.0~\mathrm{g / kg}$

The physical assessment is critical in pediatric head injury. Pupillary size and reactivity should be documented initially and often. As noted above, the GCS is modified in children to obtain the best responses for age. Noting any changes in the established baseline should provoke further inquiry and studies. Brain herniation is accompanied by bradycardia, mydriasis (a critical lateralizing sign) and progressive obtundation.

# 28.5 Concussions

Afrooz et al. noted in a retrospective review of 782 facial fracture patients, from 2000 to 2005 at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, that a concomitant concussion was diagnosed in  $31.7\%$  of patients, suggesting a high index of suspicion is needed to make a prompt diagno

sis, as delays in diagnosis can result in worse outcomes [12]. Formal concussion management is recommended to assure that full recovery is achieved before exacerbating activities, such as sports or video games, are resumed [13].

# 28.6 Neck and Airway

Blunt and penetrating trauma to the neck comprises about  $7\%$  of head and neck injuries in children [14]. Approximately  $85\%$  are in zone II, and mortality increases significantly when injuries are located in zones I and III [15]. Due to a short, pliable and small neck in children, access for control of haemorrhage in zones I and III is very limited and represents areas of difficult intervention in the child (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 28.3).

Zone I and III injuries of the neck may require angiography to rule out injury to vascular structures as these are difficult to clinically assess in children due to cooperation (if conscious) issues, anatomy and reliability of pulsatile characteristics in children [15]. Oesophageal injuries are ruled out by a screening chest X-ray and barium swallow studies (oesophagram) if there is a strong suspicion of penetrating injury to the throat. Fluid in the intra-thoracic cavity or para-oesophageal space may disclose an oesophageal tear or rupture, which is a surgical emergency [15]. An unstable patient may require emergent exploration under controlled conditions.

Signs of laryngeal injury in children include the following [16, 17]:

Dysphonia  
Haemoptysis  
Subcutaneous emphysema  
Laryngeal ecchymosis and tenderness  
Tracheal deviation

# 28.7 Cervical Spine

Although cervical spine injuries are uncommon in children (<2% of pediatric injuries), they can be devastating if not properly identified and managed. Most of these injuries result from violent deceleration-acceleration mechanisms often seen in motor vehicle crashes and sports-related activities. Children less than 8 years of age are more susceptible to axial injuries (occiput C2), whereas older children have a tendency to lower cervical spine injuries [14]. Children suffer spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality (SCIWORA) more than adults and consequently develop traumatic myelopathy if steps are not taken to prevent further injury. This is the cord injury correlate of diffuse axonal injury of the brain [14].

The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study suggests that if the following criteria were present in trauma patients, then cervical spine imaging was not indicated: no midline cervical tenderness, no focal

deficits, no intoxication or sedatives, and no distracting injuries and fully alert [18].

# 28.7.1 Pediatric Perioperative Management

After the primary and secondary surveys have been completed and potential life and limb-threatening injuries have been determined and addressed, the child's health status should be confirmed. Usually, this can be determined through a reliable caregiver or access to the pediatric medical record. First, the immunization status needs to be confirmed and addressed if there are questions as to currency; tetanus prophylaxis is the most important status to confirm. Dirty, contaminated wounds should receive a tetanus toxoid booster  $(0.5\mathrm{ml})$  and consideration given to Tig (tetanus immune globulin) 250 IU for such wounds in patients who have not been tetanus vaccinated in the last 5 years or there is uncertainty as to proper immunization status [19]. Any conditions that may adversely impact upon the injured child's health and subsequent management should be identified, such as poorly controlled diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma and sickle cell disease, and steps taken to optimize the patient's medical condition.

Antibiotic administration for head and neck injuries in children follows similar recommendations for the adult population. Young children will usually have established skin and mucosa floral populations, the exception being the nasal cavity and sinuses, which harbour more Haemophilus (untypeable) and Moraxella organisms in the chronically colonized or infected sinus [20]. Injuries that involve the naso-sinus region may need to be treated with antibiotics directed at these organisms and the typical Gram-positive organisms. Clean wounds generally do not require antibiotics after the initial intra- and/or peri-operative doses. Exceptions to these wounds would be human and animal bites or avulsive/devascularizing type wounds. Bite wounds should receive 7–10 days of antibiotics directed at the mixed flora of the respective bite.

# 28.8 Soft Tissue Injuries

Most craniomaxillofacial injuries in children, particularly the young child, are soft tissue in nature. Trauma forces to the facial region typically result in soft tissue disruption injuries, lacerations and contusions; however, the facial skeleton often will be spared due to its elasticity [21].

Initial evaluation directed towards soft tissue wounds should take into consideration the viability

of injured tissues, even marginal tissues, and increased healing potential of children [22]. What may appear to be nonviable tissue in a severely avulsed or macerated wound may survive with good initial care. For these reasons, the surgeon should attempt to preserve tissue as much as possible within the frame of inherent tissue and patient health, particularly in regionally specific tissue zones like the eyelid and nose [23]. After initial resuscitation, these tissues will often respond favourably even after hours of ischaemia. All soft tissue avulsion flaps should be carefully returned to and supported in their anatomical position and kept protected and warmed until definitive repair can be undertaken. Care should be exercised to avoid undue pressure or tension on marginal wounds [21].

Because thorough evaluation of wounds in the injured child is paramount but also difficult to carry out and manage, many wounds will have to be initially addressed under controlled conditions in the operating theatre. If the child is conscious and crying, simple observation of facial animation and posturing may indicate depth of soft tissue injury to underlying neurovascular structures. After resuscitation and stabilization of the child, the surgeon can move to theatre to investigate large or penetrating wounds, document nerve and ductal injuries, and determine if eye injuries require specialist intervention. A stepwise plan for repair can then be made including the need for micro-reparative procedures, ophthalmological review and upper aerodigestive tract evaluation for penetrating neck wounds.

Large contaminated avulsive wounds should be thoroughly cleansed with pulse irrigation in theatre (Fig. 28.4), which dislodges particulate and reduces the bacterial load in the tissues [21, 23]. Antibiotic solutions usually are not necessary and have not been shown to be any more beneficial in reducing bacterial infec

![](images/048e9200b418ed6c1a2bd670774d4f006a359961da547bc9860bd328dde33789.jpg)

tions over saline solutions. Rather, the pulsed mechanical removal of necrotic tissue debris, foreign bodies and bacterial load is the key for improving the tissue bed and reducing infections. Completely avulsed tissue may be salvaged for use as a free graft and should be utilized for such as an initial reconstructive procedure with a view towards later serial staged revisions as healing and function warrant.

# 28.9 Regional Soft Tissue Wounds

# 28.9.1 The Ear

The ear is a prominent and protrusive facial structure, which has limited protection from injury secondary to its functional purpose of hearing. As a result, however, the ear is prone to a spectrum of traumatic injuries ranging from abrasion, simple laceration, complex

laceration, partial avulsion and complete avulsion. The aetiology or cause is critical to the treatment sequence; a clean, linear laceration differs greatly from a macerated dog bite. The examination must assess for cartilage exposure, haematoma formation, potential canal injury and tympanic membrane rupture. Secondary problems of canal stenosis or diminished hearing acuity can be prevented by noting and managing these injuries during initial treatment.

The ear is resilient in healing after injury due to its substantial vascular arcade. The blood supply to the external ear is primarily via the superficial temporal artery and the posterior auricular artery, branches of the external carotid (Fig. 28.5). These two main arteries create a vascular ring around the ear and supply an area approximately  $6 \times 11$  cm, extending from the tragus to  $5\mathrm{cm}$  posterior to the external auditory canal and  $6\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the mastoid. Additional branches arise from this vascular ring, and additional anasto

motic networks exist between the posterior auricular artery and the occipital artery. Some arterial twigs from the deep auricular artery (internal maxillary artery) supply the auditory canal.

Treatment of ear injuries begins with patient management and anaesthesia. Delicate repair of a pediatric ear injury requires significant patient compliance, and thus, in most pediatric patients, a general anaesthetic is warranted. Also, despite historical concerns regarding the use of local anaesthesia with epinephrine in the ear, judicious use via infiltration and nerve blocks is reasonable for the repair of most ear injuries unless there is questionable viability of tissues.

Ear injuries in children require prompt attention particularly if the cartilaginous units are disrupted or if haematomas are present as these injuries will result in progressive ischaemia and deformity during healing [24]. All haematomas should be drained and a bolster dressing applied to prevent haematoma re-accumulation (Fig. 28.6). Perioperative antibiotics are not necessary beyond the initial procedure unless there has been contamination or perichondrial and cartilaginous maceration.

Wounds must be profusely irrigated to debride and remove foreign bodies and haemostasis obtained with the judicious use of electrocautery. Irregular or necrotic skin edges are conservatively trimmed with sharp tissue scissors or small scalpel blade (e.g. 15C). Non-displaced ear cartilage fracture requires no sutures unless the ear cartilage is malpositioned or fragmented, in which case a 5-0 or 6-0 absorbable polyglactin suture can be used

to re-approximate the cartilaginous framework. The ear skin itself can then be repaired with 5-0 or 6-0 absorbable fast gut or nonabsorbable sutures (Fig. 28.7), but the absorbable suture will result in an appropriate cosmetic outcome and eliminate the trauma of suture removal in 5-7 days. Partially avulsed segments may be reattached in an attempt to allow for revascularization, but larger avulsions may benefit from microvascular repair or other staged reconstructive modalities [25]. Generally, micro-revascularization of one of the branch vessels of the superficial temporal or postauricular systems will suffice to maintain tissue viability, a key element to survival being venous outflow. Wound care should keep the reconstruction site clean, moist and protected. Avulsed components should be supported for 5-7 days with a bolster gauze dressing (Fig. 28.8).

# 28.10 The Eyelid and Lacrimal System

The eyelids are complex, and delicate structures therefore injuries require precise and careful treatment in order for a return to both form and function. Familiarity with eyelid anatomy is foundational to precision wound repair (Fig. 28.9). Ocular integrity is confirmed through careful inspection of the globe for lacerations, retention of foreign bodies, tissue loss and corneal abrasions with fluorescein and Woods lamp (UV light source) or a slit lamp examination if the child is cooperative. Any question of visual axis interruption should prompt immediate ophthalmological evaluation.

In children, other than superficial and accessible eyelid wounds, which can be safely repaired in the ED, most wounds will require completion of inspection and repair under general anaesthesia. For simple repairs and cooperative patients, topical anaesthetic drops or ointment and local anaesthetic applied with Q-tip applicators may allow for bedside simple closure. Corneal abrasions are typically treated with a short course of a combination antibiotic-anti-inflammatory/steroid agent [26, 27].

Anatomical subunits of the eyelid are addressed in a specific order: lid margin followed by extramarginal lacerations. Specifically, a vertical mattress stitch through the Meibomian orifices gently everts the margins of the eyelid to prevent notching. The suture tails are left long and taped inferiorly to prevent lash irritation of the conjunctiva [28]. Coaptation of the tarsal plate is important, followed by anatomical approximation of the orbicularis oculi and skin, as illustrated in  $\bullet$  Fig. 28.10. If extensive, the wound is dressed to support and protect the site during the healing phase.

In cases of avulsive tissue loss to the lids, partial thickness versus full thickness and small versus large defect size are critical elements to carefully determine prior to surgical repair. Partial-thickness defects  $(< 25\%)$  may heal by secondary intention, but due to eyelid skin laxity, primary closure can usually be achieved after selective undermining of native lid skin. Larger partial-thickness defects and total avulsion of tissues require tissue grafts or local flaps to achieve closure and avoid

healing-induced ectropion or lagophthalmos. Full-thickness skin grafts can be obtained from the posterior auricular area or foreskin in uncircumcised boys, resulting in a good tissue match [29]. A bolster should be applied to stabilize the graft and eliminate haematoma formation; a tarsorrhaphy or Frost suture may be necessary to immobilize the lid and resist natural tissue tension and scarring [30]. Generally, a period of 1-2 weeks is necessary for adequate healing when lid immobilization is done (Fig. 28.11).

# 28.11 Lacriminal Apparatus

An intact and functional lacrimal system is essential to ocular health, but the weakest part of the eyelid is the portion containing the canaliculus. As a result, eyelid trauma is likely to disrupt this system resulting in epiphora and chronic infection [31]. Immediate repair typically results in superior long-term outcomes. A thorough examination should be completed at the time of initial injury and concomitant naso-orbital ethmoid fractures should illicit concerns over the need for possible lacrimal duct repair. Acute injury will require evaluation in theatre under anaesthesia. Generally, lacrimal probe insertion, irrigation of canaliculi, and fluorescein application with detectable egress into the nasal cavity will confirm lacrimal disruption. Traumatic disruption to the canalicular system requires lacrimal intubation

with tailored silicone tubes passed through the superior and inferior canaliculi and via the nasolacrimal duct into the nose (Fig. 28.12) [32]. Lid repair can then proceed once the tubes have been affixed intranasally. Gentle eversion of the repaired puncta through suture tails left long and taped inferiorly will prevent entropion, untoward scarring and suture irritation (Fig. 28.13). The tubing is maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks and then removed. Topical ophthalmological antibiotics with anti-inflammatories should be used for a period of 5-7 days.

# 28.12 The Nose

The pediatric nasal complex is less pronounced and more pliable compared to the adult nose. However, tangential forces and dog bites can still lead to significant soft tissue injuries. Examination should evaluate nasal deformity and the presence of all anatomical subunits, including the cartilaginous framework [33]. Intranasal speculum examination should evaluate mucosal lacerations and

septal haematomas. Failure to identify such abnormalities can result in nasal stenosis and a 'saddle nose' deformity as a result of septal collapse, respectively.

# 28.13 Epistaxis

Often in nasal trauma, the intranasal mucosa and underlying skeletal frame have been disrupted or comminuted resulting in extensive bleeding, which may need to be

addressed. The external nose is primarily supplied by the angular, infraorbital and ophthalmic arteries, while internally the nose is supplied by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries and the sphenopalatine arteries. In children with a smaller blood volume, severe epistaxis can be life-threatening.

Haemostasis may be obtained with topical vasoconstrictors, followed by nasal packing. Packing with cellulose, fibrillar collagen, fibrin glue or in rare cases, with indwelling balloon catheters and Vaseline gauze,

![](images/599f7a87b38d1dc9a6fee2f04866858d229c5fba5bb8a009d2564e60c902961d.jpg)

into the lacrimal system (2) exiting the nasolacrimal duct in the inferior meatus. Note the sutures are secured intranasally high (3) in the vestibule with two nonabsorbable sutures. Closure of the wound (1) is commenced once the tubes are in place and secured

will usually tamponade trauma-related epistaxis until definitive repair can be performed [34, 35]. Nasal packing should not be used for more than 3 days in young children and 5 days in older children. While the nose is packed, children should be placed on systemic antibiotics to prevent toxic shock phenomenon [36, 37].

Surgical ligation of the anterior ethmoidal or sphenopalatine arteries or embolization of the bleeding nexus is reserved for uncontrollable and recalcitrant nosebleeds. Ligation of the sphenopalatine for high- or low-posterior bleeds is done nowadays through endoscopic means, either transnasal or transantral [38] High nasal vault bleeds, usually from nasal-orbital-ethmoidal injuries, can be controlled with direct anterior ethmoidal artery ligation via an external ethmoidectomy approach [39].

Once stabilized, definitive treatment of nasal soft tissue lacerations may commence. Anatomical landmarks are repositioned including the cartilaginous and bony framework. Closure then is achieved in three layers: (1) mucosa and vestibular lining, (2) cartilage and (3) skin. After drainage of a septal haematoma, the septal mucosa should be coapted with a 'quilting'

stitch using absorbable suture (4-0 gut) and polyvinyl acetyl sponges or silicone splints placed into the nasal passageways to prevent re-accumulation (  $\square$  Fig. 28.14) [40]. A supportive rubber stent wrapped in xeroform, or Vaseline gauze may be sutured to the entrance of the nare to prevent stenosis and maintain the aperture (  $\square$  Fig. 28.15). Custom-made soft silicone nasal tubes may be used for long-term prevention of stenosis once initial healing has taken place and the rubber stent has been removed. Small, avulsed (usually  $< 1\mathrm{cm}$ ) nasal tissue segments are likely to survive, once reattached, based on the extensive vascular anastomotic networks and vigorous vascular ingrowth characteristic of wound healing in children [22].

# 28.14 The Scalp

As the pediatric patient has a disproportionate skull-to-face ratio, the scalp is more exposed to injury. The scalp is generously vascularized and the blood vessels traverse the connective tissue layer, which rigidly 'stents open' the lacerated vessels resulting in profuse loss of blood.

The scalp is supplied by the internal and external carotid arteries (see Fig. 28.5). The internal carotid, via the ophthalmic artery and the supratrochlear and supraorbital arterial branches, supplies the anterior scalp to the vertex. The superficial temporal, occipital and posterior auricular arteries of the external carotid supply the remainder of the scalp.

Initial control of bleeding can be achieved with sutures or haemostatic clips and a firm pressure dressing. Once haemorrhage has been controlled, the wound should be inspected and digitally palpated for foreign bodies, gross contamination and skull fractures. Thorough irrigation of a contaminated wound should precede closure and may best be accomplished with pulse vacuum irrigation with an antibiotic-impregnated saline solution if gross particulate contamination is present. Nonviable or irregular margins should be conservatively trimmed and closure obtained in two layers. Suction drain placement is frequently necessary in the scalp to prevent haematoma formation.

For significant areas of tissue loss, split-thickness skin or acellular dermis grafts may be employed, for temporary coverage, if the pericranium is intact (Fig. 28.16) [41]. In cases requiring secondary reconstruction or if significant avulsive injury occurs with cranial bone exposure, reconstruction can be achieved with local rotational flaps or via staged tissue expansion and flap procedures (Fig. 28.17). Additionally, in cases of exposed cranial bone, a wound vacuum assistance device can develop a vascular bed for grafting, as well as keep the wound clean.

# 28.15 The Cheek

Injury to the cheeks may involve two critical structures: the parotid gland/duct and the facial nerve. As a general rule, lacerations distal to an imaginary vertical line drawn from the lateral canthus of the eye are less likely to cause critical injury to the facial nerve. Simple closure can then be undertaken without further delay. To evaluate parotid duct injury, the needleless portion of an angiocatheter is attached to a saline-filled syringe and Stenson's duct is cannulated. Saline is then flushed and if visualized in the wound site, a duct injury is confirmed. A silastic stent can then be placed into the wound via the proximal transected end via Stenson's duct opening. Repair is completed in theatre under microscopic magnification (Fig. 28.18). The silastic stent is left within the duct and the proximal end is sutured to Stenson's duct orifice or to the buccal mucosa and maintained a minimum of 2 weeks, allowing for duct healing and minimizing scar contracture within the duct lumen at the healing repair site (Fig. 28.19) [42]. In cases in which the parotid gland parenchyma is lacerated, the parotid capsule should be repaired and a pressure dressing is placed to prevent post-injury sialococele or chronic leak, though typically the condition self-resolves in several weeks [43].

Concomitant injury of the facial nerve is likely based on its anatomical proximity. Buccal and zygomatic branch injuries may be less disfiguring long term due to extensive cross-innervation and arborization (Fig. 28.20). Temporal-frontal and marginal man

![](images/d7a78619e4bcb03258656fb359513b07eb4b198a6cc7c544ab99796e29c695c1.jpg)

dibular branch injuries, however, require microsurgical repair (Fig. 28.21) if, as noted in the examination, the injury is proximal to the lateral canthal vertical [44]. Early repair may result in improved functional outcomes and should occur within 72 hours [45].

Deep contamination from embedded foreign bodies should be treated with thorough exploration and vigorous irrigation with a syringe and catheter to the depth of the wound. Due to the possibility of serosanguinous fluid accumulation, dead space and contamination particularly from environmental or agricultural substances (Fig. 28.22), a drain should be placed and daily irrigation carried out until the wound is clinically clean, after which time formal closure can be undertaken.

# 28.16 The Lip and Oral Cavity

Lacerations to the lip may occur as a result of a foreign body but often are secondary to the dentition piercing the tissue. A thorough examination must evaluate imbedded teeth within the tissue and radiography may be necessary to confirm the absence of teeth or foreign bodies. Washout of lip and oral wounds must be meticulous due to the potential contamination from saliva. Sequential closure of the lip mucosa, musculature and the skin is carried out with precise alignment of the vermilion border and white roll. Tissue adhesives work well in the lip region provided there is good tissue approximation deep to the skin. Parents should be informed of possible late mucocoele formation after lip injury.

Dental trauma is a common cause of intraoral injury, and examination should rule out embedded or displaced tooth fragments. Plain films are beneficial to evaluate teeth and foreign bodies. Aspiration of foreign bodies will usually manifest clinically with stridor, wheezing and respiratory compromise; a chest film may be indicated to rule out foreign body aspiration. Small anterior tongue wounds with no bleeding often will heal quickly without surgical intervention. Posterior penetrating tongue and soft palatal wounds may result in significant or delayed oedema and contribute to airway issues, and therefore, caution erring on observation may be warranted [46]. Also, seemingly benign palatal injuries to the soft palate and oropharynx can result in thrombus propagation through the pharyngeal anastomoses with the internal carotid artery and potential neurologic sequelae [47].

# 28.16.1 Wound Care Adjuncts

# 28.16.1.1 Wound Support

Wound support tapes (Steri strips™) may be utilized in conjunction with suture closure as an additional support and pressure dressing, especially in areas of tissue loss and tension. Studies have demonstrated similar cosmesis, decreased treatment time and improved parental perception of pain with the use of tissue adhesives (cyanocrylate) as compared to the traditional use of suture for simple lacerations [45]. As for any wound, it should be appropriately cleaned and debrided and with deep lacerations, the dead space still needs to be obliterated with sutures. Application to the skin of the tissue adhesive should be in a layered fashion with a scant amount used for the initial layer so as to avoid excess seepage

![](images/7a4565efb38c9d765c2825261cc4f9b902f363f9e587002fb6f8370a8145957a.jpg)

into the wound and an increased likelihood of wound complications. Additional layers should be applied once the skin is sealed.

Although absorbable sutures tend to increase the tissue inflammatory response via enzymatic degradation in natural materials and by hydrolysis in synthetic materials, use in the pediatric population is advantageous. Studies have demonstrated minimal to no significant changes in cosmesis as compared to closure of wounds with nonabsorbable suture when placed judiciously and carefully [48]. Over-suturing to overcome tissue tension is discouraged as swelling, increased tension and suture displacement into fragile tissues may lead to increased inflammation, wound dehiscence and more scar formation. Importantly, in the pediatric population, the use of absorbable suture eliminates the need for removal.

# 28.16.1.2 Antibiotic Ointments

Topical ointments maintain a moist wound and prevent contamination from common surface bacteria. A moist wound with protective covering results in improved wound healing and more rapid epithelial creep and wound margin bridging [49]. Antibiotic-laden ointments and white petrolatum jelly have been used as adjuncts to improving wound environment without significant risk of infection. Topical corticosteroid containing ointments may be utilized for short periods of time to decrease the exaggerated hyperaemic and inflammatory response, which will be observed in many children during wound healing.

# 28.16.1.3 Silicone Agents

Topical application of silicone gels or sheets (Fig. 28.23) on developing scars maintains tissue hydration, applies pressure and regulates dermal fibroblast proliferation and excess collagen production [50]. Constant pressure results in tissue ischaemia, release of metalloproteinase, decreased macroglobulin production and improved scar hydration, which discourages hypertrophy and induces remodelling, resulting in a softer

![](images/e09934697af48487f6623cab50b3d53053da2868c017ab20e53505baa24b8f5d.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 28.23 Self-adhering silicone pressure sheets are useful to decrease hypertrophic scar formation in children, particularly over areas of convexity, as in the malar or cheek area as demonstrated in this young child

and flatter scar. These agents are typically used in the late-wound healing stages and remodelling phases of scar maturation. Although these adjuncts are beneficial, long-term compliance with children is the limiting factor to efficacy [51].

Massaging hypertrophic scars has demonstrated marginal effects on the vascularity, pliability and height of the scars [52]. Frictional rubbing should be avoided as it can actually cause hypertrophy, but a 'kneading' type massage may provide benefit in conjunction with the use of a hydrating agent such as lanolin lotion.

In general, studies have failed to definitively demonstrate that any one modality is superior in optimizing wound healing and scar minimization [53]. McIntire and Pine note that pediatric patients, especially infants, have an immature epidermal-dermal bond and that topical ointments are preferred over adhesive dressings. Their 2014 review discusses the benefits of the more prevalent products in scar management [54].

# 28.16.1.4 Dog Bites

Dog bites are common in children, and the actuarial risk is quite high. The cause is multifactorial, but in general, children are closer to ground level, more inexperienced around animals, will often interact without supervision and thus more likely to unwittingly provoke an attack [55]. Most dog bites in children are from the family pet or from animals known to the family [56]. In general, based on a 3-year study of pediatric dog bites at a Level I Trauma Hospital, Pitbulls were responsible for the majority of dog bites, with German Shepards a distant second [57]. The physical and emotional sequelae (posttraumatic stress syndrome or PTSD) may be unpredictable, costly and long-term [58, 59].

Vigorous syringe lavage or pulse irrigation of wounds with conservative debridement is critical to reducing the chance of wound infection and optimizing the aesthetic outcome. In young children with fragile and torn tissues, low-pressure irrigation with a syringe and catheter suffices to dislodge most bacteria and cleanse the wound [60].

Dog bites uniquely contain Pasteurella multocida and Capnocytophaga canimorsus in about  $25\%$  of cases, as well as mixed anaerobes, Streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus [61]. Tetanus immunization records and rabies exposure must be considered in the comprehensive treatment of dog bite patient. Passive immunization with human rabies immune globulin provides immediate protection with a serum half-life of 21 days. Immune globulin  $(20~\mathrm{IU / kg})$  is dispensed with as much of the dose as possible infiltrated in and around the wound, with the remainder given intramuscularly in the gluteal region, using a needle long enough to ensure an intramuscular injection. Active immunization via the vaccine takes 7-10 days to induce an active immune

response, with immunity lasting approximately 2 years. The vaccine is placed in the deltoid or deep thigh with a dose of  $1\mathrm{ml}$  at 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days [62]. Domesticated dogs with a known vaccination status should be quarantined for 10 days, and post-exposure prophylaxis can be withheld unless signs of rabies develop in the quarantined dog.

Prophylactic antibiotics should be prescribed for 7 days with extended penicillin or cefuroxime, or doxycycline or TMP-SMZ as alternatives in penicillin-allergic patients [63]. The parents should be informed of the intense inflammatory response, which will result after a bite injury. This typically resolves 5-7 days after injury with prolonged lymphedema often observed.

# 28.17 Hard Tissue Injuries—Facial Bone Fractures

Estimates suggest that  $1 - 15\%$  of facial fractures occur in the pediatric age group. Fractures of the facial skeleton in children are less common than in the adult, and only about  $1\%$  of facial fractures occur in patients less than 5 years of age. This is due to the elastic nature of youthful bone and the smaller facial unit in children, which may be exposed to injurious forces. Also, the anatomical uniqueness of the midface in children—multiple unerupted teeth and small or undeveloped sinuses—but tresses against forces directed at the midfacial region, distributing these forces to surrounding areas and preventing actual fracture or fragmentation at the point of impact.

At birth, the cranium occupies roughly half of the craniofacial unit, and thus, the skull (frontal region) is more frequently injured or fractured than other facial bones. This tendency continues until roughly 6-7 years when a reversal in fracture ratios is seen between the skull and facial bones. This reversal corresponds to the development of paranasal sinuses, elongation and forward projection of the face beyond the frontal area and the eruption of adult teeth in the anterior jaws (Fig. 28.24).

Several studies have evaluated facial fracture incidences and patterns in childhood [64-68]. When summarized (Table 28.2), the trends observed above can be further broken down into subunits of the facial skeleton and age corresponding fracture patterns.

Fractures of the skull predominate in the very young and drop off significantly as the facial area develops and becomes more prominent (compare the adult and pediatric skulls in  $\square$  Fig. 28.24). The mandible, being a relatively more exposed area during most of childhood, appears to be a target of injury during most of the pediatric developmental period [66]. During later childhood

and adolescence, fracture patterns are also affected by environmental influences such as increased risk-taking behaviour observed in older, particularly male, children, and more recreational or sport-related activities, which result in jaw and nasal injuries [69].

# 28.18 Diagnosis of Facial Fractures

Although fractures are not as common as in adults, a high index of suspicion of underlying skeletal injuries needs to be exercised by the clinician when evaluating the injured child. Mechanism of injury is very important as this may indicate what kind and type of force have been imparted to the craniofacial unit. There will be typically an extensive component of soft tissue injury, both open wounds and oedema, which may mask underlying fractures. Also, what may appear as fracture displacement, particularly in the upper nasal region (Fig. 28.25), is the voluminous swelling young children develop owing to the rich and responsive lymphatic and vascular beds. After several days, the swelling resolves and the typical

greenstick fractures return to their anatomical positions much quicker than in the older adult patient.

Diagnostic imaging is fundamental to properly evaluate facial injuries in children; therefore, CT scans of the head and maxillofacial units are necessary. The contemporary high-resolution scanners with less radiation exposure afford the kind of thorough imagery necessary for pediatric facial fracture management. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans should be considered, if available, as they often achieve the concept of ALADA, 'as low as diagnostically acceptable', as they result in less radiation exposure while providing adequate image quality [70, 71]. One must keep in mind and correlate clinical findings when reviewing CT images in young children as reports of fractures may rather be wide sutures or diastasis in an existing anatomical suture, and not a frank fracture [72]. On plain skull films, sutures are not smooth but corrugated and irregular in appearance, whereas fractures have smoother margins with clear separation (Fig. 28.26). On the other hand, there may be traumatically widened sutures, particularly in the skull of young children, which represent true injury and result in haematoma formation or underlying dural tear and must be scrutinized in the early phase of acute management [73]. The underlying dura may become injured or entrapped resulting in the phenomenon of 'growing skull fracture' which forms from an underlying leptomeningeal cyst associated with a previous skull fracture.

# 28.19 Fixation—Absorbable Versus Titanium

Absorbable plates and screws address most of the fixation needs in pediatric fractures. It is felt by some that weakening and ultimate resorption of the fixation plates within 1 year will result in less growth disturbances and normalize the mineralization dynamic of the mandible [74-76]. If titanium fixation is employed, it is often

removed 3-6 months after surgery to prevent bone deposition over the plate and to minimize growth disturbance.

# 28.20 Anterior Cranial Fractures

# 28.20.1 Frontal Sinus

As noted above, skull fractures are relatively uncommon, particularly as children age. The frontal bone thickens with established cortices and a diploe space, which absorbs impact forces quite well before a fracture results. The frontal sinus represents an area more susceptible to fracture and fragmentation as the bone thins around the sinus cavity. The frontal sinus generally becomes radiologically evident around age 7 years in most children, though pneumatization is underway via the ethmoids by 12-14 months of age [77]. Higher kinetic blows to the upper naso-orbital-frontal region will sometimes result in frontal sinus and associated cranial or orbital roof fractures. Again, CT scans will document such fractures and indicate whether fragmentation involves vital areas, specifically the drainage system of the nasofrontal duct and orbital roof fractures, which approach the optic canal region.

Frontal sinus fragmentation with displacement of bone fragments into the sinus or extending intracranially is nearly always seen in older children or adolescents as they have developed the frontal sinus to some extent. Neurosurgical consultation should be obtained if there is intracranial extent of injury. Studies have shown that significant frontal sinus fractures in children are often accompanied by intracranial injury and ocular trauma and are also associated with a higher pediatric injury severity scale and poorer outcomes in recovery than what is observed in adults [78, 79].

Generally, contemporary management of frontal sinus fractures in children is treated conservatively with either observation or fracture reduction and sinus drainage procedures [78, 80]. Minimal fracture displacement will usually heal uneventfully, but the child should be followed throughout development for onset of sinus disease or worsening conditions in chronically diseased sinuses. Antibiotics are not necessary unless there is a history of chronic sinusitis or surgery is undertaken. However, antibiotics are typically warranted in cases with a dural tear and cerebrospinal fluid leak, though this remains controversial. Again, current trends maintain sinus cavity integrity with anatomical restoration through fracture reduction and fixation [81]. If sinus drainage is compromised, then endoscopic augmentation of the nasofrontal drainage can be performed [80-82]. or a drainage catheter placed through the nasofrontal duct for a period of several days or weeks (  $\text{口}$  Fig. 28.27). This catheter can be accessed for periodic lavage of the sinus to maintain the physiologic dynamic of naso-sinus health.

Frontal sinus comminution occurs less frequently in the pediatric patient compared to the adult [67, 78]. However, if this occurs (usually in the adolescent) and sinus health integrity is questionable, then obliteration may be undertaken as in the adult patient. In small frontal sinuses, usually stripping the mucosa and obliterating the ductal openings will result in cavity bony fill. If the posterior wall is comminuted, one may remove the wall, repair any dural tears and seal off the nasofrontal recess with a local pericranial flap (Fig. 28.28). This will allow the cranial contents to 'herniate' forward and obliterate any retrofrontal space; this will take place over

several days. In frontal sinuses larger in volume (typically adolescent males), fat or autogenous bone may be utilized to obliterate the cavity space after the ducts and mucosa have been eliminated.

Again, most frontal sinus fractures can be addressed conservatively in the majority of children; close follow-up with periodic CT scans to rule out sinus disease, including mucocoele formation, is important. In the event that untoward sequelae occur, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is often the initial treatment of choice.

# 28.20.2 Orbital Roof

Anterior cranial base fractures in children can be very serious with implications of intracranial injury, haematomas and CSF leaks and vision impairment when the supraorbital rim and orbital roof are involved [83, 84]. Studies have indicated that pediatric injury severity scores above 15 are often associated with significant orbital trauma including fractures, ocular adnexa injury and vision compromise or blindness [85]. When orbital roof fractures are identified, the clinician must radiographically follow the extent of the fracture posteriorly to rule out optic canal involvement. This may necessitate obtaining dedicated coronal views at  $1\mathrm{-mm}$  slices at the orbital apex to determine if the optic canal contents are involved. Subsequent swelling, pressure and ischaemia of the optic nerve or contents may result, which can be confirmed through serial examinations, if possible, by an ophthalmologist [84]. If swelling worsens with decreased vision then emergent decompression and medical management of papilledema may preserve the visual axis. Often, pediatric patients with entrapment may have none of the typical stigmata of an orbital fracture but will experience associated nausea and vomiting. This is consistent with a 'white-eyed' orbital fracture mostly seen in pediatric patients. In addition, unexplained bradycardia may suggest the Aschner phenomenon or activation of the oculocardiac reflex [86].

Implosion of orbital bone intracranially or into sinus cavities usually is greenstick in nature in children. For this reason, most orbital wall fractures will improve over several days of observation as the pieces self-reduce to their anatomical positions [87]. In very young children with growing brains, pulsatile mechanisms can result in both displacement of fractures and resorption of free bony pieces; therefore, orbital reconstruction should attempt to separate the intraorbital and intracranial contents when continuity defects occur [88]. Surgical intervention is warranted only with adnexal impairment by fracture fragments. Again, bone fragments displaced superiorly and intracranially may result in dural tears

and these require neurosurgical repair. If orbital volume has been lost and there appears to be little physiologic restoration of volume, then reconstruction should be undertaken with absorbable mesh or autogenous materials such as bone or cartilage (Fig. 28.29). The diploe space develops by age of 3 or 4 years in most children and may be split to use for orbital wall reconstruction. Rib can also be split, shaped and placed in the orbit for extensive wall defects.

# 28.20.3 Upper Facial Fractures

# 28.20.3.1 Naso-Orbital-Ethmoid (NOE) Complex

Naso-orbital ethmoid fractures are rare in children but have increased in prevalence due to increased survival after high-velocity injuries seen in motor vehicle collisions, likely as a result of enhanced safety regulations [68]. The NOE complex consists of the medial orbital walls, the nasal bones and the nasal projection of the frontal bone. Such fractures become more prevalent with the development of the paranasal sinuses, as is the case with frontal sinus fractures and maxillary fractures.

Physical examination demonstrates telecanthus and instability of the medial canthal ligament and central bony fragment. Clinical examination includes the bowstring and Furness tests as well as direct intercanthal measurements. Intercanthal distances are more variable in children, but on average, measurements are  $\sim 22\mathrm{mm}$  in infants and increase gradually until adulthood, when  $\sim 35\mathrm{mm}$  is the norm. An acute nasofrontal angle may be noted and ophthalmic nerve hypoesthesia noted.

Surgical management is complex and often requires secondary reconstruction. Initial emphasis is placed on restoration of orbital volumes, recreation of nasal contours, over-correction of the intercanthal distance and restoration of midface projection [89]. Access is optimized via a coronal incision, unless a significant laceration pre-exists in the area. Transnasal fixation with nonabsorbable sutures is a critical step in surgical reconstruction if the medial canthal tendon insertion is disrupted. Over-correction is suggested, and external bolsters are helpful to support the tissues and prevent pseudotelecanthus.

# 28.20.3.2 Nasal Complex

Nasal fractures are the most common facial fracture in both adults and children due to its prominent exposure [65, 66, 68]. The mechanism of injury is useful in focusing the clinical examination as a glancing or tangential blow with result in different injuries than a direct frontal force. Patients will often present with considerable nasal bleeding, which should be addressed immediately.

Clinical examination is usually diagnostic but may be unreliable and difficult in uncooperative children with extensive swelling. Plain radiographs are of minimal assistance and a maxillofacial CT scan should be obtained only if further modalities are required or more complex fractures co-exist.

Surgical intervention is required for drainage of a septal haematoma, cosmetic deformity and functional impairment [33, 90]. Generally, less is more as it relates to pediatric nasal complex fractures as more aggressive surgical intervention may adversely affect the naso-septal growth centre. Closed reduction is typically attempted first with open reduction reserved for complex fractures with loss of projection and stability. After surgical correction, extranasal splinting is ideally accomplished with a moulded thermoplastic splint and antibiotic-impregnated intranasal packs, absorbable cellulose or septal splints. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics for prevention against toxic shock syndrome and endocarditis should be utilized during the packing period [36, 37, 91].

# 28.20.4 Orbital Floor

The orbital floor bone is extremely thin and a direct blow to the globe usually results in dissipation of forces that fractures the floor of the orbit, resulting in a blowout fracture, or more commonly in children, the blow-in fracture [83, 84, 89]. Due to the pliable nature of bone in children, the orbital floor bone often recoils resulting in a 'trap door' phenomenon involving the inferior rectus muscle and associated periorbital tissues. Such a finding requires prompt surgical intervention to relieve the entrapment, allowing for free range of motion of the eye and prevention of long-term functional sequelae. Alcala-Galiano et al. reported up to  $24\%$  associated ocular injuries with orbital fractures in children, and therefore, ophthalmologic consultation should be part of the treatment algorithm [92]. Unless there is vision loss or compromise, allowing oedema to dissipate will allow for a more thorough and precise examination [21, 23]. Diplopia on upward gaze or restriction of extra-ocular movements (Fig. 28.30) should alert the clinician of entrapment of periorbita, which is usually confirmed on CT coronal imaging. Thin slice CT imaging is critical to correlate with the clinical examination as subtle findings may only be appreciated on such high-resolution scans.

Surgical repair of orbital floor fractures should be considered for (1) diplopia secondary to entrapment, (2) enophthalmos greater than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  after oedema has dissipated, and (3) CT scan measured orbital floor defects

![](images/5602f440a0910763e4c4a0f57a34d40903a1721b217da235458d8c5165ba50e8.jpg)

Fig. 28.30 Orbital floor fracture with entrapment in a 9-year-old child. a Note restricted left eye on upward gaze due to entrapped inferior periorbital soft tissue. b Orbital floor repair with absorbable fixation plate

greater than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  [93-95]. For cases that do not clearly require surgery, the surgeon must follow the patient closely as pediatric patients heal quickly. Surgical intervention is best performed within 7-10 days in pediatric patients [96]. However, in cases of entrapment, studies have demonstrated that the best results are achieved with early intervention [97]. Isolated floor defects in children should be reconstructed with either autogenous materials (split calvarium, rib) or absorbable mesh or membranes [93].

# 28.21 Zygomaticomaxillary Complex (ZMC)

The ZMC fracture is uncommon in younger children but as with other pediatric facial fractures, the incidence rises with the development of the paranasal sinuses and the maxillary sinuses in particular as well as the increased prominence of the zygoma with growth. Findings include maxillary nerve hypoesthesia, malocclusion, trismus, subconjunctival haemorrhage, increased transverse facial dimension and loss of malar

projection. Significant displacement results in increased orbital volume and enophthalmos that may initially be camouflaged by oedema, especially true in children. Ophthalmologic assessment is critical to establish a baseline ocular examination, visual acuity, extra-ocular movements and evaluating for globe injury (afferent pupillary defect, hyphaema, anterior chamber violation, etc.) [87, 88]. As with isolated orbital fractures, the aetiology of visual acuity abnormalities must be determined before facial fracture repair and positive findings require prompt attention.

Non-displaced fractures or minimally displaced fractures can be managed conservatively, but cases with coronoid impingement, enophthalmos or significant fracture displacement require intervention [64, 88]. Repair must be undertaken within 7 days in young children or healing will ensue, often necessitating refracture (not recommended due to possible splintering, tearing of maxillary arterial and pterygoid plexus and A-V fistula phenomenon) or osteotomies to mobilize the zygomatic complex. In pediatric patients, two points of fixation are usually adequate to stabilize the fractures and restore the facial projection [98]. Approaches include an intraoral Keene incision in the maxillary vestibule and an upper eyelid crease incision. Isolated zygomatic arch fractures can also be addressed via a transcutaneous temporal scalp Gillies incision, though the healed incision site may result in localized alopecia. Use of the brow incision should be minimized, especially in girls, due to the potential for post-operative alopecia. A limited transconjunctival approach for concomitant orbital rim and floor repair is well tolerated by children. Conjunctival sutures should not be placed, but rather all sutures (absorbable fast gut) should be placed well below the conjunctiva in the deeper tissue layers. Fractures are easily repaired with absorbable fixation (Fig. 28.31).

# 28.22 Lower Facial Fractures

# 28.22.1 Maxillary Fractures

Le Fort midface type fractures are rare until aeration of the maxillary sinuses occurs. After the age of 6, maxillary fractures occur more frequently, but the elasticity of the bone and the mixed dentition limits displacement. Generally, low midface or maxillary fractures occur as a part of a complex of fractures in children [65]. Findings include maxillary nerve hypoesthesia, malocclusion and maxillary mobility. CT imaging demonstrates transmaxillary fractures and separation of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone from the maxilla.

Correction of midface projection and restoration of occlusal harmony are the main goals of treatment. Simple maxillary fractures can usually be treated with maxillo-mandibular (MMF) fixation for 1-2 weeks. Vigilance must be exercised to guard against distraction forces placed across a fractured maxilla during MMF, which may result in vertical facial increase [95]. Open reduction should be reserved for significant displacement or concomitant facial fractures. In children with unerupted teeth, high Le Fort fractures can be fixated with absorbable fixation once occlusion is established. Low or dental component fractures will necessitate a combination of dental wire bonding and occlusal splint reduction in the maxillary arch for 2-3 weeks [99].

# 28.22.2 Mandible Fractures

Lower jaw fractures are the second most common pediatric facial fracture, generally involving the condyle or subcondylar region [100]. The mandible's U-shaped form and mixed dentition have a direct effect on fracture

![](images/3559821ca2aa82670cde6589c010b6eb06d52f4453b01ca10ee778fc9d5783c0.jpg)

patterns. Mandible fractures in young children are often 'greenstick' type fractures and tend to be single-site fractures as opposed to multiple sites in the adult.

Findings associated with pediatric mandible fractures are mandibular nerve hypoesthesia, malocclusion, trismus and chin point deviation towards the side of fracture. Soft tissue swelling associated with jaw fractures in children should be cause for concern regarding airway patency. Young children will typically swell more in response to injury and symphyseal or body fractures may result in acute and extensive floor of mouth and tongue swelling; therefore, observation and monitoring of the child are important.

Radiographic analysis is essential for the full evaluation of the mandibular components and the bilateral temporomandibular joints. An orthopantomogram is particularly helpful in evaluating the position of the inferior alveolar nerve, and a composite image of the mixed dentition facilitates surgical fixation. Associated fractures require CT imaging of the maxillo-mandibular region.

The goals of treatment are to restore facial form, premorbid occlusion, and mandibular function and range of motion. For greenstick, non-displaced mandibular fractures without malocclusion or other sequelae, a nonchew diet and limitation of activity can be instituted for treatment. Weekly examination to confirm return to normal form and function is important.

As a result of the shape of deciduous teeth and the mixed dentition phase in children, closed reduction via MMF may be challenging, especially with the traditional arch bar. Selective Ivy loops, bonded brackets or wires, Risdon cables (Fig. 28.32) may be utilized to accomplish closed reduction. Intermaxillary fixation screws may be used in older children [101]. An acrylic splint also may be fabricated and ligated to the teeth to maintain fracture alignment. As noted above, any child with MMF requires careful airway observation and astute caregivers who can monitor the child during the fixation phase. Such management should probably include at-home apnoea/O₂ monitoring and suction devices. Also, contraindications to MMF may include seizure disorders, asthma and poorly controlled psychiatric disorders.

# 28.23 Condyle

Intracapsular fractures are best treated with a soft diet and continued function and physiotherapy to prevent ankylosis due to the significant osteogenic potential in children. Extracapsular condylar fractures are best treated with a non-chew diet and closed reduction with elastic guidance in younger children, allowing controlled function and comfort. Maxillo-mandibular fixation should only be 1-2 weeks as extended periods may result in prolonged trismus and ankylosis [102,

![](images/4bc8b2205d58c17f47bda2fcccde03dd822055602bb73c8f3c52ddb615823b67.jpg)  
Fig. 28.32 Risdon Wire Cable as an alternative to Erich Arch Bars in the younger patient with mixed dentition

[103]. Open reduction has not been clinically proven to improve outcomes in children and thus should be limited for cases of displacement of the condyle or the presence of bilateral condylar fractures and significant loss of the lower facial third vertical height [104]. Physical therapy should be instituted after brief immobilization to encourage restoration of the functional and physiological dynamic of the immature condylar-ramal complex. Key parental participation in therapy modalities cannot be overstated.

# 28.24 Body and Symphysis

Brief periods of maxillo-mandibular fixation will suffice for most mandibular body and symphyseal fractures in young children (<6 years of age). Open reduction and internal fixation are reserved for selected young children and adolescents [75, 105, 106]. Key principles include (1) a superior border plate or tension band plate is not necessary in the mixed dentition phase, (2) placement of monocortical screws and (3) limited incision and dissection should be instituted (Figs. 28.33 and 28.34) [75, 106, 107].

# 28.25 Dentoalveolar Injuries

Dental trauma is a common occurrence at all ages as a result of dentoalveolar and jaw exposure, falls, assaults and sporting trauma. The anterior primary dentition has shortened root structure lending itself to fracture, intrusion, concussion, subluxation, partial avulsion and complete avulsion injuries [76]. Concomitant alveolar segment bony fractures may co-exist with tongue, mucosa and lip lacerations. Comprehensive evaluation should attempt to account for missing and possibly swallowed or aspirated teeth, especially in obtunded

![](images/e1cc4399313e3c62bcd4e1e8bfe6d578f951d9d6469c0c9d3419ebe1a1abd89d.jpg)

patients. CT imaging is best if associated facial injuries are noted. Plain films are useful to rule out the presence of foreign bodies within wounded soft tissues. Fractured, luxated or avulsed teeth are optimally treated by a pediatric dentist, but in general, deciduous teeth that are avulsed should not be reimplanted as damage to the underlying adult teeth may occur [99]. Significantly luxated deciduous teeth should be considered for extraction to eliminate any risk of sudden exfoliation and aspiration. Luxated or avulsed adult teeth should be repositioned and reimplanted ideally within 60 minutes [108]. Stabilization should then be instituted with bonded wires or arch bars, with care taken to avoid extrusion of the unstable teeth. Dentoalveolar segment fractures can usually be reduced and stabilized with arch bars or wires, as in luxated or avulsed teeth injuries [99, 108, 109]. Relief of occlusion is generally recommended to avoid trauma to the healing periodontal ligament and dental structures. Larger alveolar segments may best be treated by plate and screw fixation, especially if teeth are significantly fractured or absent. A non-chew diet is critical, and avoidance of contact activities is prudent. Interval evaluation by a pediatric dentist is suggested to evaluate the need of space maintenance and longitudinal monitoring of dental development.

# 28.26 Growth Disturbance

Fractures in children may affect growth and development. There are generally three main areas of growth, which may be affected by injuries: the orbital region, the nasomaxillary complex and the condylar-ramal elements. Fractures of the orbital region in very young children may result in periorbital tissue atrophy and subsequent orbital volume loss, particularly in a crush

![](images/cc43c4782dd41cd2dcffc2038e4817793e55dc25dd958055058d443296a8c63e.jpg)

injury [110]. After the age of 5 or 6, this growth disturbance issue of the orbit diminishes [96, 111].

Injuries to the nasomaxillary complex, particularly the cartilaginous unit, may affect midface projection and elongation [33, 90]. Surgical intervention at the time of injury probably does not confer physiologic protection from developmental perturbations in the nasomaxillary region. It is important to carefully and thoroughly review this with the parents and advise long-term follow-up during growth.

Condylar fractures involve the mandibular growth centre and may result in long-term growth abnormalities via growth restriction and development of a malocclusion and lower facial third facial asymmetry or deformity. Also, degenerative changes are likely to occur resulting in early-onset arthritis at the temporomandibular joint. Consequently, parental education is especially critical in the treatment process. Unlike

adult condylar fractures, children have the capacity for condylar remodelling and complete recovery of form and function [103]. However, as children age, the ability to remodel and spontaneously heal is attenuated.

# Conclusion

Craniomaxillofacial trauma in children is an increasing, debilitating and preventable entity in pediatric health care in America. There has been a shift of trauma incidence to the younger population due to increased independence of children and risk-taking behaviour among youth, particularly in adolescence, which puts children at risk of significant injury. Children require updated immunization status, and it is vital to have responsible caregivers who can partner with the surgeon and participate in trauma care and recovery.

Children require rapid intervention in trauma care, including facial injuries, to preserve tissue health and optimal results. Facial injuries are generally age-dependent in that cranio-orbital injuries are seen more in the very young, while midface and lower face injuries are seen more frequently in the older and adolescent child. Particular attention to soft tissue management of the eye, nasal and ear regions, including neurovascular entities, requires preservation of tissue, focused repair, support of repaired structures and scar management modalities in order to obtain a good result in form and function. Fracture management in the very young has undergone recent change with the advent of absorbable fixation materials and techniques as well as the increased appreciation for skeletal response to trauma, particularly for long-term facial development. It is important to recognize that jaw function in young children must be preserved and allowed during the healing period, and long-term growth assessed by regular follow-up with documentation. Adolescent fracture management mirrors that of adults, but nuances must be understood to achieve optimal results. Follow-up for growth perturbations should be documented into the early adult years, especially for mandibular condylar fractures.
