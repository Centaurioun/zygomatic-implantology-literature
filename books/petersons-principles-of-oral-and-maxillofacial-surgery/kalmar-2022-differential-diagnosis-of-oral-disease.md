# 30.1 Introduction

The practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery is based upon diagnosis. From small private practices in rural communities to large quaternary care medical centers, the OMF surgeon is called upon to evaluate and diagnose a wide variety of conditions affecting the face, jaws, head, and neck as well as the tissues of the oral cavity. The term *diagnose* comes from the Greek words *dia* ("through", "apart") and *gnosis* ("knowledge"), meaning literally to know apart or to distinguish. Clearly, the ability to correctly diagnose is important to virtually all professions, yet it is perhaps most strongly linked to the clinical practice of medicine and dentistry. For health care practitioners, a *diagnosis* is defined as the determination of the nature of a disease or pathologic condition. An accurate diagnosis is important and occasionally critical to the patient as it enables the most appropriate treatment to be initiated as soon as possible. The sooner the correct diagnosis is obtained, the more likely the patient will be able to avoid further expensive and possibly unnecessary laboratory studies, use of ineffective or improper medications, and the inconvenience of additional costly consultation(s).

Several terms are frequently associated with the diagnostic process. Occasionally, the diagnosis of a

lesion or condition is relatively straightforward with few, if any, reasonable alternative explanations or diagnoses. More often, however, a variety of conditions with similar clinical features need to be considered. In this situation, a differential or differential diagnosis (DDx) is prepared. The DDx represents a listing of the likely diagnostic considerations for a particular pathologic finding or condition, ranked in descending order of probability. The top consideration, therefore, is the culmination of the clinician's evaluation and training and is termed the clinical diagnosis (i.e., working or tentative diagnosis, clinical impression). Although initially based upon clinical signs, symptoms, and history, this list of diagnoses is subject to modification or refinement following additional studies such as radiographic imaging and hematologic or serum analysis (Fig. 30.1) [1, 2]. As is discussed below, the DDx will likely vary depending upon the experience and knowledge base of the treating clinician. Finally, when the clinician believes that the nature of the disease has been identified to a reasonable degree of certainty, the term final diagnosis is used. This progression from information (history and clinical presentation) to possible diagnoses to final diagnosis is known as the diagnostic process or method. A case example is provided below. The assignment of a final diagnosis often results from tissue biopsy and histopathologic interpretation and usually represents the end of the diagnostic process. Experienced clinicians, however, recognize that the "final" diagnosis only reflects the sampled tissue at a single moment in time and is not always correct. Follow-up evaluation of the patient's response to therapy and careful observation of the subsequent disease course are essential aspects of comprehensive patient management. Should a lesion or condition not behave in the expected manner, revision of the final diagnosis may be indicated and may ultimately require additional studies, including rebiopsy.

# 30.2 The Diagnostic Process

The diagnostic process begins with the gathering or accumulating of information. In some instances, this will include a significant historic component, whereas in other cases (e.g., asymptomatic lesions discovered upon routine examination) the information may be limited

strictly to the clinical findings, together with any necessary diagnostic studies or tests. Depending upon the experience and expertise of the practitioner, a confident final diagnosis may require nothing more than clinical inspection. In many cases, however, even the most experienced diagnostician requires additional information, ranging from appropriate imaging to laboratory studies.

# Case Study: From Differential Diagnosis to Final Diagnosis

A 37-year-old man presents with a history of gradual painless enlargement of the left anterior upper jaw over the past several years. His medical history is unremarkable, and he denies trauma to the area. Clinical examination reveals a  $2.5\mathrm{-cm}$  bony firm swelling of the right maxillary facial alveolus in the area of teeth no. 10 and 11 with an unremarkable overlying mucosa (Fig. 30.2). Slight mesio-angulation of the lateral incisor is observed and the mass is nontender to palpation. The adjacent teeth are unrestored and vital.

Initially, the DDx would focus on the most common conditions that might present clinically in a fashion similar to the lesion in this patient. Likely considerations could include central giant cell granuloma, central ossifying fibroma, calcifying odontogenic cyst, ameloblastoma, and odontogenic keratocyst.

Important additional information is easily obtained in this case through routine dental radiography. An intraoral film reveals a poorly corticated triangular multilocular radiolucent lesion of the right maxilla that appears related to the mesio-angulation of the lateral incisor tooth. The radiographic findings, in turn, warrant revision of the DDx to favor conditions associated with multilocular radiolucent presentations: central giant cell granuloma, ameloblastoma, odontogenic keratocyst, odontogenic myxoma, and glandular odontogenic cyst.

An incisional biopsy of the lesional tissue reveals a myxomatous, paucicellular proliferation of small benign-appearing spindle cells. The final diagnosis is odontogenic myxoma.

# 30.2.1 History

Development of a DDx often begins with data gathering; including a history of the specific problem being investigated as well as the patient's medical, dental, and social history. The patient's perception of lesion duration can be important as long-standing lesions may suggest a developmental or benign process, whereas rapidly evolving lesions often represent reactive, infectious, or malignant conditions. Exceptions to these generalizations are numerous, however, since mycobacterial infections may develop slowly, as do some neoplasms that are considered malignant (e.g., basal cell carcinoma). Furthermore, the reliability of the patient to provide an accurate history is occasionally compromised owing to the patient's inattention, limited mental capacity, or denial of disease.

Symptoms, particularly related to pain or tenderness, are important in formulating a DDx. Pain and tenderness (discomfort on palpation) are often signs of an inflammatory or infectious process, including reactive lymphadenopathy. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a salvary gland malignancy well known for the early onset of low-grade intractable pain. Other symptoms such as dysthesia or paresthesia can be associated with inflammatory conditions such as osteomyelitis or malignancies such as metastatic disease or lymphoma.

Reported changes in the physical features of a lesion may also provide important insights. A mass that demonstrated gradual enlargement would suggest a possible neoplasm while a mass that reportedly fluctuated in size would more likely represent a reactive process. Similarly, changes in symptoms may be significant. Decreasing pain or tenderness likely represents a resolving inflamma

tory or infectious process, whereas pain that develops within a long-standing previously asymptomatic mass may indicate malignant transformation of a benign tumor (e.g., carcinoma arising in pleomorphic adenoma).

# 30.2.2 Clinical Examination

Following a review of the patient's medical history and history (if any) of the present lesion or condition, the clinician typically proceeds to gather objective data through careful clinical examination. A variety of lesional attributes should be recorded, including (1) site, (2) size, (3) character (e.g., flat [macule], depressed [ulcer], raised [mass]), (4) color, including an assessment of homogeneity versus heterogeneity, (5) surface morphology (e.g., smooth, pebbly, granular, verrucous), (6) consistency on palpation, (7) the border (e.g., smooth, irregular, indistinct, sharply defined), (8) local symptoms, and (9) the distribution (with multiple or confluent lesions).

# Site

The precise anatomic site or location of a lesion can provide essential diagnostic information and is discussed later in greater detail.

# Size

Lesion size can have diagnostic implications, particularly when combined with an estimate of lesion duration to give an approximate rate of growth or enlargement. The finding of a large lesion may indicate a locally aggressive or malignant neoplasm, if the history suggests a relatively recent onset. Yet, even when abnormal tissue has been noted for several months or years, a history of progressive increase in the size of the affected area should be viewed suspiciously (Fig. 30.3). As mentioned above, relying on the accuracy (or veracity) of the patient history can be problematic and should be weighted accordingly in the DDx. Confirmation of the clinical history through other health care practitioners can be helpful in this regard.

# Character

Establishing the character of the lesion is an essential aspect of the clinical evaluation. Most ulcers are at least slightly depressed, covered by a shiny, creamy-white surface pseudomembrane of fibrinoid material and are associated with traumatic, infectious, or neoplastic conditions. Masses or swellings can indicate neoplasms, reactive proliferations, cysts, or enlarged lymph nodes. A history or evidence of vesicle or bulla formation might be suggestive of a viral condition, an immunobullous disorder, or possibly an inherited mucocutaneous disease.

Macular lesions, which are completely flat by definition, usually represent an area of color change. A brown or black macule is often the result of intraepithelial melanin pigment; a red or purple macule usually represents

hemoglobin in either its oxygenated or reduced form, respectively. A dull flat white implies keratin production while an area of translucent whitish change may mean increased epithelial edema. A blue or grayish macule is frequently associated with exogenous (amalgam, foreign body) or endogenous (melanin) pigment or particles deposited within the connective tissue below the epithelium (Fig. 30.4). Although additional information regarding the margin or border of a lesion is provided below, most pigmented lesions in the oral cavity are relatively homogeneous in color and have a smooth well-defined margin. By contrast, a pigmented lesion with significant border irregularity and color variegation should be considered as suspicious for melanoma (Fig. 30.4).

# Morphology

The surface morphology of a lesion can be virtually diagnostic for certain conditions. Examples include the "tapioca pudding" appearance of a lymphangioma or the papillary epithelial fronds of squamous papilloma (Fig. 30.3). In other settings, a papillary or granular surface architecture may indicate a malignant epithelial neoplasm such as verrucous carcinoma or granulomatous diseases ranging from deep fungal infections to foreign-body reactions to immune-mediated conditions such as Crohn disease or sarcoidosis.

# Consistency

Palpation is used to assess the consistency of a lesion, as well as its margins and the presence or absence of tenderness. Detection of a doughy-soft or fluctuant mass suggests a possible cystic lesion or a benign fatty tumor. A rubbery-firm character in the absence of symptoms can be encountered with a wide variety of conditions, ranging from benign connective tissue proliferations to salivary gland tumors to metastatic disease while a similar mass with associated tenderness could represent inflammatory lymphadenopathy. A hard or bony consistency naturally indicates a mineralized or calcified component to the lesion.

# Border

The border of a potentially malignant (premalignant, dysplastic) surface mucosal epithelial lesion may vary from smooth to markedly irregular but its outline is usually sharp or well-defined compared to the adjacent mucosa (Fig. 30.3). The border of a primarily submucosal or subcutaneous lesion can be described as encapsulated, well-demarcated, or poorly demarcated (infiltrative). An encapsulated process is often freely movable within the deep soft tissues, a finding common to a variety of benign neoplasms and cysts. The margins of some benign lesions (e.g., neurofibroma) and some low-grade malignancies (e.g., acinic cell carcinoma) may be well-demarcated, but they are generally less mobile compared with encapsulated lesions. The margins of many malignancies are indistinct, as the tumor invades and blends with the surrounding host tissues.

# Symptoms

As noted earlier, local symptoms such as pain or tenderness are usually associated with an inflammatory process, especially acute or subacute inflammation. Although benign or malignant neoplasms may also present with tenderness, this feature is often related to ulceration of the surface mucosa and is usually mild to moderate in intensity. With the possible exception of adenoid cystic carcinoma, severe pain or dysthesia is usually a late-stage development with oral malignancies,

often related to perineural invasion. Tenderness may also be a prominent clinical feature of certain benign tumors such as traumatic neuroma.

# Distribution

Finally, the presence of multiple identical or similar lesions can suggest a number of conditions, depending upon their particular character (e.g., ulcerations, papules, vesicles) and distribution. The finding of multiple small painful recurrent ulcerations bilaterally on the ventrolateral surface of the tongue in a young adult female patient would be most suggestive of the herpetiform variant of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. On the other hand, the finding of a unilateral focus of several small relatively painless ulcerations on the left hard palate would be more consistent with a recurrent intraoral herpes infection.

# Key Points

The diagnostic process involves the compilation and stratification of various information about a condition or abnormality, culminating in a final diagnosis or differential diagnosis.  
In some cases, information gathered through patient history, clinical examination, and routine radiographs can be sufficient for a confident clinical diagnosis; however, advanced imaging, laboratory studies, and/or biopsy may be needed when the diagnosis is less certain.  
- When performing a clinical oral examination, a variety of lesional attributes should be recorded, including size, character, color, surface morphology, consistency, border description, presence of local symptoms, as well as anatomic site and/or distribution of multifocal lesions.

# 30.3 Developing the Differential Diagnosis (DDx)

After collecting the historic and clinical information, the final diagnosis may be obvious; however, in many instances the diagnosis is not readily apparent and a differential diagnosis (DDx) is appropriate. Several approaches have evolved over the centuries of medical and dental practice to assist in the categorization or grouping of diseases. These grouping strategies permit the vast number of possible diagnostic considerations for a given lesion to be reduced to the more probable conditions. The focus provided by the DDx helps the clinician to determine initial patient management, ranging from conservative measures and follow-up evaluation to

selection of additional diagnostic tests that are most useful in determining a final diagnosis.

The major diagnostic strategies or approaches that have been used to group or organize the DDx are based on:

1. The history and clinical presentation  
2. The potential disease pathogenesis  
3. The disease location (more specifically, the frequency of a given condition in a particular location)

In actual practice, clinicians with specialty training or greater experience typically employ all of the strategies simultaneously. As a consequence, the specialist will typically produce a narrower more precise DDx that, in turn, leads more directly to the correct final diagnosis (see the Case Study below).

# History and Clinical Presentation

The physical characteristics of a given lesion in the context of the history and clinical setting often permit the clinician to arrive at a reasonable list of diagnostic possibilities, if not a likely final diagnosis. For example, the solitary, 1-cm pedunculated papillary epithelial lesion depicted in  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 30.3a was clinically thought to be a squamous papilloma with few alternative considerations. The lesion depicted in  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 30.3b received a clinical diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma; however, proliferative verrucous leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma were also included in the DDx. Given the size of this lesion, multiple incisional biopsies were obtained to determine a final diagnosis.

# Disease Pathogenesis

Another useful approach to developing a DDx is to consider whether the clinical and historical aspects of the lesion can be explained by any, some, or all of the broad categories of disease pathogenesis. These categories include developmental, inflammatory/immunemediated, infectious, neoplastic, and metabolic condi

tions. This is a time-honored systematic method of diagnosis, and many clinicians find it useful to systematically consider possibilities from each category. For example, an asymptomatic lesion that has been present for several years and feels encapsulated upon clinical palpation would be most consistent with a developmental or benign neoplastic process. Although inflammatory conditions, malignant neoplasms, and metabolic conditions might not be excluded completely, they would not receive primary consideration in the initial differential. Similarly, although a developmental etiology would be unlikely for a chronic ulceration of the lateral tongue in an adult patient, disorders from the neoplastic (especially malignancies), infectious (e.g., mycobacterial or deep fungal infections), and immunemediated (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) or Crohn disease) categories would have to be considered.

# Disease location

The third diagnostic grouping strategy relies on the identification of lesions that most commonly present in a particular anatomic location. The tendency for certain conditions to occur with increased frequency at certain sites is well recognized. For example, a nontender bluish fluctuant mass of recent onset involving the lower labial mucosa very likely represents a mucocele. By contrast, mucocele would not be included in the DDx of a painless persistent bluish mass of the attached gingiva as salivary gland tissue is not normally present at that site. This latter clinical setting would, however, be completely consistent with a gingival cyst of the adult. A nonhealing relatively asymptomatic ulceration of the lateral tongue in an adult patient who has no identifiable source of irritation or trauma would be highly suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma. Salivary gland neoplasia would be a likely consideration for a rubbery-firm mass of the posterior lateral hard palate.

# Case Study: Neophyte Versus Expert Clinician

An otherwise healthy 72-year-old woman complains of sores in her mouth for the past year. Her medical history is unremarkable and she takes no medications. She has not been aware of any blisters, and she feels the problem is getting worse. The lesions tend to wax and wane in severity and have affected several areas of the mouth, including the hard and soft palates, the labial mucosa, and the ventral tongue.

Examination shows several shallow erosions and ulcerations with ragged margins. The lesions range from 0.5 to  $1.0\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter and involve the lower labial mucosa, the

ventral tongue bilaterally, and the anterior soft palate. No vesicles or bullae are seen, and no white striae are evident.

The inexperienced diagnostician who is not very familiar with oral lesions might provide a differential diagnosis based on conditions that are primarily ulcerative: herpesvirus infection, aphthous ulcers, erosive lichen planus, and candidiasis. On the basis of this list, the patient would likely be placed on one or possibly more courses of antiviral medication. If the patient's condition did not improve, she might then be switched to antifungal medication(s). Assuming that approach fails to resolve the problem, topi

cal corticosteroids might be prescribed. Following several weeks of topical corticosteroid use with little or no impact on the patient's oral sores, the inexperienced diagnostician may then recommend that a biopsy be performed. In this scenario, the patient has invested several months' time and spent hundreds of dollars on inappropriate or ineffective medications—all in the absence of a clear diagnosis.

For the experienced diagnostician who is more familiar with oral conditions, the differential would be much smaller: cicatricial pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris. With a greater understanding of oral disease, the specialist would be able to eliminate many of the conditions considered by the novice clinician. For example, recurrent herpesvirus infection does not typically affect nonkeratinized mucosa in a healthy, immunocompetent patient and would not wax and wane in severity. Although aphthous ulcers may exhibit a waxing-and-waning course, the lesional margins are usually smooth, not ragged. Erosive lichen planus would be considered unlikely owing to the lack of radiating white striae at the periphery of the oral lesions, as well as the lack of buccal mucosa involvement. Finally, although candidiasis is occasionally associated with tenderness or irritation of the oral mucosa, it does not induce

true ulceration and would therefore have a low probability of representing the actual diagnosis.

Based on the patient's age, the distribution of the lesions, the history of the process, and the clinical appearance of the lesions, the expert clinician would favor a selective differential diagnosis of immune-mediated diseases. In this situation, biopsies for examination by both light microscopy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) would be requested or performed after the initial consultation. Routine histopathologic evidence of acantholysis was noted and DIF showed interepithelial deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement component 3 (C3), permitting a final diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris in a relatively rapid and cost-effective manner. Besides the monetary savings, a more timely and correct diagnosis often saves the patient from unnecessary suffering and mental anxiety, by permitting effective treatment to be administered earlier and by relieving the worry that many patients experience when the nature of their disease is uncertain. In addition, early diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris may halt or reduce disease progression or the need for more aggressive therapy.

# Key Points

The differential diagnosis for a lesion or condition is a list of possible diagnostic considerations arranged in descending order of probability below the clinical or working diagnosis.  
- Concurrent review of physical characteristics, anatomic location, and/or history of a given lesion or condition can help the clinician recognize specific patterns of disease.  
- Greater understanding of and experience with oral disease aids in the construction of a narrower, more selective differential diagnosis.

# 30.4 Determining the Final Diagnosis: Adjunctive Diagnostic Methods

If the final diagnosis cannot be determined based on history and physical examination alone, a variety of procedures and tests are available to assist in the diagnostic process. Generally, diagnostic tests should be used to either confirm or eliminate the most likely (clinical) diagnosis. A methodical approach together with a proper rationale for selecting each test typically leads to

the correct diagnosis in the quickest, most cost-effective manner. Tests that fail to address the top diagnostic considerations should be delayed, since it is unlikely that they would provide useful information, yet can dramatically increase costs to the patient. An exception to this statement would be a situation in which a particular test can rule out a rare or unusual condition of serious clinical significance. Finally, diagnostic tests should be interpreted by individuals with specialty training to that specific test or area whenever possible to ensure the most timely and accurate result or final diagnosis.

Diagnostic studies or adjuncts are not necessarily complex or expensive. For example, a putative vascular lesion can be readily evaluated by pressing it with a glass slide or probe to test for possible blanching (diascopy). The bruit of a vascular malformation may be heard upon auscultation using a stethoscope. Operative findings at the time of surgery occasionally provide important diagnostic clues, such as the presence of cheesy keratotic debris within a cystic lesion associated with an impacted tooth, suggestive of an odontogenic keratocyst, or the empty intraosseous cavity seen with traumatic bone cyst. Finally, simple follow-up evaluation of a lesion can provide important diagnostic insight with respect to biologic behavior. A lesion or condition that persists or progresses 2-3 weeks after

initial inspection may require additional testing to establish the diagnosis.

# Light-based adjuncts to conventional mucosal examination

Over the past decade, several devices have become commercially available to potentially assist in the screening examination of oral mucosa in healthy asymptomatic patients to detect potentially malignant or malignant epithelial lesions. Some of these products employ a disposable chemiluminescent light source while others are battery operated or use an AC power source to produce illumination. Numerous clinical studies have been published regarding these devices and summarized in several recent review articles [3-7]. Readers are directed to these reviews for more detailed summary information regarding each device. Overall, their conclusions were quite similar: there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that light-based adjuncts provide any benefit over conventional examination alone for routine evaluation of the oral mucosa. On the other hand, limited data with one light-based system suggest that it may be useful in another role, the surgical management of potentially malignant oral epithelial lesions or squamous cell carcinoma, by improving real-time margin delineation of previously biopsy-proven disease. Additional studies appear warranted.

# Salivary adjuncts

Several commercial products have recently become available to analyze saliva for elevated levels of protein and nucleic acid biomarkers purported to be associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Saliva tests for DNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes associated with oropharyngeal or tonsillar carcinoma are also available. Such salivary tests were also examined in the most recent review articles regarding diagnostic adjuncts [6, 7]. Overall, with a limited number of relevant clinical studies showing low specificity and variable diagnostic accuracy, routine use of salivary tests could not be recommended.

# 30.4.1 Diagnostic Imaging

Depending on the clinical setting, imaging studies may be both appropriate and necessary to the work-up of an oral lesion. Additional information on this topic is available in an excellent radiology text edited by Mallya and Lam [8]. Briefly, imaging studies can include plain radiographic films, sialography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET).

# Plain Films (Sensor-based, conventional imaging)

For evaluation of bone lesions, conventional two-dimensional images are the type most commonly acquired in dental settings and they continue to be both cost-effective and extremely useful. While film-based media remain available, it has largely been replaced over the past several years by the electronic sensor-based approach. Panoramic radiographs are frequently used as a screening study in many dental practices and it is not unusual for these views to reveal previously unidentified skeletal abnormalities. Evaluation of such abnormalities includes an assessment of features such as localization or distribution (single, multifocal, generalized), margins (well-defined, poorly defined), internal structure (radiolucent, radiopaque, mixed), effects on surrounding structures (teeth, inferior alveolar canal, cortical bone), and the relationship to any associated symptoms. For example, a corticated, unilocular radiolucent lesion at the apex of a nonvital tooth likely represents a periapical cyst or granuloma while a similar-appearing radiolucency below the level of the inferior alveolar canal in the posterior mandible more likely represents a Stafne (lingual mandibular bone) defect. Sharp margins indicate a benign process in most instances, whereas poorly defined margins can signify a malignancy. Notable exceptions to this rule include osteomyelitis and fibrous dysplasia, which typically have borders that blend with the surrounding bone. Radiolucent lesions reflect conditions that do not generate a calcified product. Radiopaque and mixed lesions represent conditions that can produce a mineralized product, such as bone, cementum, dentin, or enamel. It is generally safe to assume that the vast majority of lesions associated with the crown of an impacted tooth are odontogenic in origin. If the teeth are erupted, however, determining whether a lesion is of odontogenic origin can be problematic since there are few areas in the jaws in which a 2-cm lesion does not appear to be tooth-related. Symptoms such as pain or paresthesia may suggest infection or malignancy, but benign neoplasms can occasionally mimic this feature.

# Sialography

Sialography relies on retrograde injection of a radiopaque fluid, also known as contrast medium, into the duct system of either the parotid or submandibular salivary gland. A plain radiograph is made, and the pattern of distribution of the contrast medium is assessed. Many of the previous indications for sialography, such as evaluation of salivary gland neoplasia, have been supplanted by newer imaging modalities such as CT with and without contrast and MRI. Nonetheless, sialography can be useful in assessing chronic inflammatory changes, obstructive salivary gland disease, and gland

function. The characteristic sialographic finding of punctate sialectasis ("blossoms on a branchless tree" pattern) seen in patients affected by Sjögren's syndrome is helpful in supporting that diagnosis and combined use of sialography and CBCT have shown promise as a noninvasive diagnostic adjunct [9, 10].

# - Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography is an excellent tool for the evaluation of superficial soft tissue masses of the head and neck, including possible salivary gland, thyroid, and parathyroid tumors. It can help distinguish a solid mass from one that is cystic and has been used in the analysis of regional lymph nodes, to provide guidance for fine needle aspiration, to assess salivary gland stones, and atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid. More recently, some authors have suggested this technology may be useful in the work-up of suspected Sjögren's syndrome patients [11]. Ultrasonography uses a transducer to create high-frequency sound waves that pass into and interact with the subcutaneous tissues. Different tissue structures and densities result in different degrees of reflection or echo production that are detected by the unit and displayed visually on a monitor in real time. Although ultrasonography avoids patient exposure to ionizing radiation and office-based units have become increasingly popular in the practice of otolaryngology, tissue resolution is lower than that achieved with CT or MRI technology [12]. In addition, tissues subjacent to bone or adjacent to air-filled structures are not well visualized by ultrasonography [13].

# CT

CT is a cross-sectional radiologic imaging technique that is particularly useful in the analysis of bone lesions. As with all three-dimensional imaging, CT eliminates image superimposition from structures outside of the field of interest. By permitting three-dimensional reconstruction of the tissues, not only can the density and margins of a given lesion can be assessed with finer detail than plain films, but also precise localization and changes such as cortical erosion or expansion are more readily apparent. Contrast media extend the utility of this technique by improving the resolution of soft tissue pathology. Furthermore, more recent designs such as multidetector helical units or electron beam CT have made data acquisition more rapid with reduced doses of ionizing radiation to the patient while maintaining or improving image resolution. Limitations in the dental setting include streak artifacts from metallic dental restorations and significant radiation exposure compared to conventional imaging.

# CBCT

CBCT is a modified form of CT that uses a divergent (cone-shaped) radiation source and detectors to produce three-dimensional images [14]. Units dedicated to the oral and maxillofacial region became commercially available in 2001 and, with the introduction of smaller and less-expensive versions, CBCT has become increasingly popular in private practice dental and dental specialty offices [15]. Further advantages of CBCT include rapid image acquisition (usually less than  $30~\mathrm{s}$ ) and reduced radiation dose compared to conventional CT (an estimated 1.5-12.3 times lower when comparing medium CBCT scan volumes) that can be further lowered by using lower-resolution settings or selective collimation of the primary beam with resultant smaller scan volumes [14, 16, 17]. In addition, office-based units often include integrated software that facilitates image assessment and measurement for applications such as orthodontics or implant placement. Limitations include greater radiation exposure compared to routine panoramic radiography (ranging from 4- to 44-fold or more), reduced spatial resolution compared to routine intraoral radiographs, and greater image noise and reduced image contrast compared to routine head CT [14, 17-19]. In addition, concerns and legal issues have been raised by some authors; ranging from heightened caution in the use of CBCT with children, to selection of scan volume or field of view, responsibility for interpretation of the entire scan volume, and interstate referral of CBCT scans for the purpose of interpretation [20-24].

# MRI

MRI is a form of cross-sectional imaging that uses a powerful magnet rather than ionizing radiation to produce three-dimensional views of the patient. The magnetic field generated by these units is differentially absorbed and released by atoms, especially hydrogen atoms, within the body. The released energy is then detected and converted into an image of the patient's tissues. Although primarily used in the evaluation of soft tissue lesions, MRI can also provide diagnostically useful information about hard tissues. Two distinct views or images are typically generated: T1 and T2. In the T1-weighted image, adipose tissue has the highest signal and this view is often used for identifying anatomic structures. By comparison, the T2 image highlights tissues with high water content and is especially useful in depicting inflammatory processes and neoplasms. Functional or quantitative diffusion MRI is used to assess cell density and diffusion capacity, resulting in an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) [25, 26].

Neoplasms with high ADC values tend to have a poor prognosis and diffusion-weighted MRI has shown predictive value similar to that of combined PET and CT imaging [26, 27]. Limitations of MRI include relatively long scan times and problems with metals, especially those that are influenced by magnetic fields.

# Radionuclide Imaging

Radionuclide imaging relies on the specific uptake of any one of several isotopes by various types of tissues or cells. Localization of the isotope is determined by examining the patient with a gamma scintillation camera. The most commonly used isotope, technetium 99m pertechnetate, can demonstrate areas of high metabolic activity. It is useful in identifying areas of active skeletal growth or metabolism such as condylar hyperplasia, fibrous dysplasia or osteitis deformans as well as metastatic disease. Certain salivary gland tumors that are rich in mitochondria, such as Warthin tumor or oncocytoma, are highlighted by technetium and some authors have used this technique to evaluate patients with suspected Sjögren's syndrome [11]. Radionuclide imaging can also be used to identify areas of inflammation, such as osteomyelitis, but studies employing both positron emission tomography and CT are increasingly popular for this purpose.

# PET and PET/CT

PET is a recently developed form of cross-sectional imaging technology that relies on the identification of metabolically active cells, such as metastatic deposits of squamous cell carcinoma, through their preferential uptake of radionuclide-labeled substrate such as glucose. Positrons emitted from the radionuclide interact with local electrons, releasing energetic photons that are analyzed through a ring of detectors. While PET can be used alone, combined use of PET and CT (PET/CT) is considered by some authorities to be more accurate than either technology alone in detecting malignancy of the head and neck [28-30]. By contrast, other authors concluded that PET offered no benefit over conventional anatomic imaging methods for primary head and neck tumors and that PET/CT offered no significant improvement over PET alone in detection of recurrent head and neck cancer [31-34]. Similarly, although PET is viewed by many authors as essential to the staging of patients with head and neck cancer, a meta-analysis found that it provided only marginal improvements in sensitivity (from  $75\%$  to  $80\%$ ) and specificity (from  $79\%$  to  $86\%$ ) over conventional diagnostic tests (CT, MRI or ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration) [35]. PET has been a useful supplement to endoscopy and biopsy for identification of occult primary tumors in patients presenting with metastatic neck disease [28, 31, 36]. For the clinically node negative (cN0) head and neck cancer patients;

however, a recent review and meta-analysis showed PET/CT to have low sensitivity and moderate specificity for detecting cervical lymph node metastases [37]. Both PET and PET/CT have proved accurate in posttreatment surveillance by helping to distinguish altered anatomic landmarks or areas of fibrosis from recurrent tumor as well as the detection of second head and neck primaries although a recent meta-analysis by Wong et al. noted only modest sensitivity in detecting local or regional failure [28, 30, 38, 39]. In addition, PET and PET/CT have been used to monitor patient response to cancer therapy and, when necessary, as a guide for adaptive treatment regimens [28, 40]. PET is not recommended for neoplasms that are relatively inactive metabolically (e.g., low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma). Drawbacks include the increased cost of PET or PET/CT and potential false-positives, especially due to inflammatory changes.

# 30.4.2 Analysis of Lesional Tissue: Histologic, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Evaluation

A final diagnosis is often based on the results of histopathologic examination of lesional tissue. In most cases, the diagnosis is achieved through routine processing and staining measures. In others, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made without additional staining techniques or sophisticated immunohistochemical or complementary DNA studies are performed. Several sampling techniques are available to the clinician and a variety of analytical methods are available to the pathologist. Their selective use depends on the clinical setting and the diagnostic challenges posed by the individual patient specimen.

# Exfoliative Cytology

Exfoliative cytology is a relatively inexpensive noninvasive technique that may be used to provide additional information related to lesions of surface origin. Its utility in the diagnosis of conditions such as candidiasis, herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus) infections, and pemphigus vulgaris is well-documented.

A modified form of cytologic sampling that employs an oral brush instrument to collect epithelial cells followed by automated histopathologic evaluation was introduced in 1999 and is now commercially available as BrushTest®. Suggested advantages over conventional oral cytology include improved sampling of all epithelial layers and increased sensitivity and specificity in the detection of precancerous and cancerous lesions versus results with routine exfoliative cytology. The technique does not provide a definitive diagnosis, however, and cannot be used as a substitute for scalpel biopsy and

routine histopathologic examination (see below). Given the potential to delay diagnosis and subsequent treatment, therefore, brush cytology is not indicated in clinical settings where the index of suspicion for potentially malignant or cancerous change is high. Examples of these settings include: a lesion located in a high-risk area for oral cancer (i.e., ventrolateral tongue, floor of mouth, tonsillar pillars, soft palate), a lesion with suspicious physical features (e.g., large size, color variegation, persistent ulceration) or a lesion in a patient with significant risk factors (i.e., heavy smoking, heavy alcohol use, or both). When a mucosal lesion persists but the index of suspicion for malignancy is low, the brush cytology technique may be useful by excluding the presence of potentially malignant epithelial cell changes. For such innocuous lesions, a finding of abnormal cells could trigger scalpel biopsy (and definitive diagnosis) before a surgical biopsy was otherwise deemed necessary.

# Fine-Needle Aspiration

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a useful method for evaluating subcutaneous or more deeply situated mass lesions, although obtaining a diagnostic sample and interpreting the results accurately require specialized training. This type of procedure is most widely used in determining the nature of salivary gland or neck masses. Currently FNA is available in most large urban areas throughout the United States, often in conjunction with major medical centers.

# Incisional Biopsy

Incisional biopsy is generally indicated for large lesions  $(>2\mathrm{cm})$  and those that could represent unencapsulated or potentially malignant neoplasms. By definition, an incisional biopsy is a diagnostic surgical procedure in which a sample or portion of a lesion is removed for histopathologic review, leaving the remainder of the lesion at the biopsy site. In cases of suspected malignancy, an incisional biopsy is usually the procedure of choice unless the clinician performing the biopsy will also be involved in definitive treatment of the cancer (see below).

# Excisional Biopsy

Excisional biopsy is often used to manage clinically benign lesions that are  $< 2\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter. An excisional biopsy is defined as a diagnostic surgical procedure in which all clinically abnormal tissues are removed for microscopic analysis. Excisional biopsy should not be performed on a suspected malignant lesion unless the performing clinician will also be involved in definitive treatment. Otherwise, the surface mucosa may be completely healed by the time the patient is referred to the oncologist, obscuring the extent of the original lesion and needlessly hindering definitive treatment planning.

# Specimen orientation

Specimen orientation is recommended whenever a clinician suspects that a lesion may have recurrent or malignant potential, including conditions such as epithelial carcinoma-in-situ or pleomorphic adenoma. This can be accomplished through the use of suture(s), an accompanying sketch of the specimen with orientation to the surrounding tissues or both. Such anatomic orientation of the tissue sample allows the pathologist to properly subdivide and process the specimen so that the adequacy of excision can be assessed at all surgical margins. The terms negative or clear margins are used when the surgical margins appear free from tumor involvement. When tumor is transected or lies immediately adjacent to the surgical margin without evidence of a capsule, proper specimen orientation permits the location of the positive margin(s) to be determined as precisely as possible. With this information, the surgeon can then plan the most conservative surgical approach that will also accomplish the primary goal of therapy: complete removal of residual pathologic tissue.

# Specimen Information

Although obtaining an adequate biopsy specimen is an important result of proper surgical technique, it is critical that the surgeon also transmits relevant clinical information to the pathologist through use of the biopsy request form. Inflammatory, reactive, and even neoplastic conditions can have overlapping histopathologic features that are difficult (if not impossible) to distinguish without an adequate description of the clinical setting. Lacking this information, the pathologist may not be able to provide a completely accurate or specific diagnosis. Pertinent details from the medical or dental history, the history of the lesion, the location and physical characteristics of the lesional tissue, and, when applicable, the radiographic features can assist with the histopathologic analysis. Clinical findings at the time of biopsy can also provide essential information. A good example is the discovery of an empty cavity during surgical exploration of a radiolucent bone lesion. This situation often means that only minimal tissue can be submitted for review; however, the operative finding is virtually pathognomonic for traumatic bone cyst (simple bone cyst). Quality close-up clinical photographs or digital images can be helpful, particularly for specialists who have dental backgrounds or clinical training in orofacial diseases such as oral and maxillofacial pathologists. Biopsies of bony pathology should be accompanied by good quality plain views or other imaging whenever possible, as radiographic correlation is often helpful in distinguishing conditions such as fibrous dysplasia, ossifying fibroma, and focal cemento-osseous dysplasia.

# - Importance of the Clinical Diagnosis

A final piece of information that should always accompany the biopsy specimen is the clinical or working diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis is important at two levels. First, it provides the pathologist with an educated, chairside "best guess" from the clinician as to what the lesional tissue most likely represents. Should the initial histopathology of the submitted specimen differ substantially from the clinical diagnosis, the pathologist may request deeper sections, rotation of the specimen, or special studies to ensure that all aspects of the biopsy material have been thoroughly examined. Second, in cases where the final histopathologic diagnosis varies significantly from the clinical diagnosis, it is the clinician who should proceed cautiously. A direct conversation with the sign-out pathologist can help insure that no erroneous information or implications about the case had been received by either party. After discussing the case, the surgeon may be satisfied with the unexpected diagnosis and plan accordingly. In other cases, the clinician may request a second opinion on the original biopsy material or choose to perform a second biopsy procedure. In essence, the clinical diagnosis serves as a "litmus test" for both the pathologist and surgeon, an important safeguard that ultimately benefits the patient as well.

For the oral and maxillofacial surgeon, such "diagnostic discord" is usually minimized when the tissue specimen is reviewed by an oral and maxillofacial pathologist. The oral and maxillofacial pathologist receives highly specialized training in both clinical and microscopic pathology of the head and neck, including odontogenic cysts and tumors and salivary gland diseases. The typical general surgical pathologist, by comparison, has a modest degree of experience with respect to oral conditions and may be unfamiliar with the unique microscopic features of lesions from this area. To provide perspective, individuals trained in oral and maxillofacial pathology programs review tens of thousands of oral biopsy specimens prior to graduation. By contrast, it is unusual for general surgical (anatomic) pathology residents to examine more than a few hundred specimens from the maxillofacial region during their training. Furthermore, the oral and maxillofacial pathologist has a command of the terminology used by the dental profession and can more readily correlate a "clinical diagnosis" or the clinical and radiographic features of oral biopsy specimens with the microscopic findings. Just as a general surgeon may be able to remove a set of impacted third molars, the general pathologist may be able to provide an adequate diagnosis for an oral biopsy. In most situations, however, professionals who are trained specifically to diagnose and manage problems related to the oral and maxillofacial region are able to accomplish their respective tasks with greater efficiency, accuracy, and consistency.

# The Microscopic Differential Diagnosis

As previously mentioned, a final diagnosis cannot always be made on the basis of routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections alone. In such a situation, the pathologist is faced with a microscopic or histopathologic differential diagnosis. For some cases, special chemical stains may be useful in the detection of suspected microorganisms or the identification of tissue products such as mucin or amyloid. In other cases, particularly spindle-cell malignancies and a group of undifferentiated neoplasms termed small blue-cell tumors, the final diagnosis can be even more challenging. Thankfully, even though many of these tumors appear indistinguishable at the light microscopic level, they often continue to produce molecules that relate either to their cellular origin or to their newly acquired form of differentiation. To more accurately classify such tumors, these markers of origin or differentiation are routinely assessed in the lesional cells through the use of immunohistochemical (IHC) studies. IHC testing employs a wide variety of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that are directed against specific cellular or integrated viral antigens (e.g., those produced by the Epstein-Barr virus) that are often expressed even in otherwise "undifferentiated" neoplasms. The antibodies are linked to an enzyme that is capable of cleaving a selected chemical substrate. This activity produces a pigmented product (often brown; hence the term "brown stains") that is deposited in the tissues wherever the target antigens are expressed. The diagnosis of a particular tumor often requires the analysis of several antigens to fully explore the histopathologic differential. In cases of lymphoma, for example, it is not uncommon for a panel of 10 or more "antigen probes" to be used to fully classify the neoplastic process. Complete subclassification, in turn, allows the oncology team to design optimal treatment for that particular tumor, including newer forms of targeted therapy.

Although routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections can be used to perform most IHC studies, an important exception involves tumors that require analysis by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry permits rapid, highly specific subclassification of lymphomas and leukemias by IHC probe analysis, but the tissue samples must not be fixed and are best analyzed immediately following collection. Another exception to this rule concerns the definitive diagnosis of immunobullous disorders such as mucous membrane (cicatricial) pemphigoid. When these conditions are considered within the DDx, perilesional tissue should be obtained and submitted in a special holding medium known as Michel's solution or medium. A holding medium is necessary because the molecular structure of the diagnostic antigens in these conditions (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement, and fibrinogen) is typ

ically altered or degraded by formalin fixation. These specimens are processed as frozen sections and are evaluated by direct immunofluorescence (DIF), a special form of IHC that employs antibodies tagged with fluorescent markers. When a special ultraviolet (UV) capable microscope is used, these markers reveal the presence and pattern of immunoreactants necessary to confirm or refute a potential autoimmune disease process. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is used for conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris, in which elevated levels of circulating autoantibody are often seen. For indirect immunofluorescent studies, patient serum is first incubated with a segment of control substrate (typically monkey esophagus). The serum is removed and the substrate is then incubated with antibody probes similar to those used in DIF studies. As with DIF, ultraviolet microscopy is used to examine the substrate for evidence of antibodies derived from patient serum that bind to epithelial or basement membrane components.

Although novel, more selective IHC probes continue to be developed, immunohistochemical techniques have been increasingly supplemented and even replaced by newer molecular techniques. These techniques include sophisticated cytogenetic studies such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as well as probes that use complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) to identify disease-specific DNA sequences in human tissue samples. Examples include restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with Southern blot or antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis by polymerase chain reaction for the determination of clonality in B- or T-cell proliferations. These sophisticated techniques, while costly, can help identify medication-sensitive "targets" and the development of patient-specific or personalized treatment plans.

# Key Points

Light-based adjuncts have not been shown to add value beyond conventional visual and tactile examination alone.  
Diagnostic imaging in oral surgery remains largely based upon plain 2D imaging; however, selective use of CBCT is expanding and associated with responsibility for interpretive review of the entire scan volume.  
While the majority of tissue biopsies can be diagnosed by routine staining methods, advances in IHC and molecular techniques have increasingly improved the ability to diagnose and subclassify difficult or "undifferentiated" neoplasms.

# 30.5 Patient Follow-Up

One of the most important aspects in the diagnosis and management of a given oral lesion or condition is patient follow-up evaluation. At a follow-up appointment, the clinician can assess the abnormality for physical or symptomatic changes, gain insight into the kinetics of growth or rate of resolution, and assess the impact of initial conservative treatment measures or recommendations to the patient. These additional pieces of information may support the working diagnosis, and no further work-up may be required (see Fig. 30.1). Alternatively, the follow-up findings may indicate that further investigation, including tissue biopsy and histopathologic analysis, may be warranted. Finally, careful follow-up should be considered mandatory for patients who have been previously diagnosed with or treated for oral cancer or precancerous (potentially malignant) lesions.

Formal guidelines have also been suggested for the follow-up and management of oral lesions that are not clearly cancerous or potentially malignant [41]. Such guidelines provide a systematic protocol for the management of persistent oral pathologic conditions and serve to reduce the medicolegal risk associated with this critically important aspect of patient care (▶ Box 30.1).

# Box 30.1 Follow-up of oral pathology

1. Initial re-evaluation: 7-14 d following lesion detection/examination.  
2. If no evidence of lesional progression or suspicious clinical alterations, re-evaluate at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months intervals; thereafter, re-examine in conjunction with normal recall visits (every 6-12 months).  
3. If lesional progression or suspicious clinical changes noted, incisional or excisional biopsy should be performed as soon as possible, and specimen should be reviewed by oral and maxillofacial pathologist.  
4. If no evidence of preneoplastic change (dysplasia) or malignancy (carcinoma or sarcoma) reported, schedule follow-up as in step 2 and document subsequent findings in patient record.  
5. When diagnosis of dysplasia (premalignancy) or malignancy is reported, refer or schedule immediately for appropriate work-up and therapy; following definitive treatment, begin follow-up evaluations as in step 2 or similar protocol.

Adapted from Alexander et al. [41]

After initial evaluation and documentation of an oral lesion, a follow-up examination should be scheduled in 7-14 days, with or without treatment. In the absence of normal healing or signs of resolution or if the lesional tissue appears to have enlarged, biopsy would be indicated. If the lesion has remained essentially unchanged and the clinical suspicion of malignancy is low, the clinician should inform and advise the patient regarding the next course of action. Patient referral to an oral and maxillofacial pathologist for clinical consultation and second opinion may be one alternative. If specialty consultation is not readily available and the patient decides to defer biopsy, the informed decision should be recorded in the progress notes. Reevaluation of the area should be scheduled at increasing intervals, such as 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the initial examination. If a diagnosis is desired by the patient at any time during follow-up, tissue biopsy should be recommended. Importantly, evidence of significant lesional change should immediately trigger a recommendation of surgical biopsy. After a year, most unchanged lesions can be monitored at routine semiannual or annual dental visits.

Finally, it should be recognized that these recommendations, although sound, do not represent rigid guidelines or medicolegal standards of care that cover every clinical scenario. Each patient and abnormality deserves individual attention and management that may vary from the protocol above, based upon training, experience, and the clinical judgement of the practitioner.

# Key Points

Clinical follow-up is critical to the diagnosis and management of all forms of disease or tissue abnormality and guides the need for tissue biopsy and diagnosis in order to initiate proper therapy.

# Conclusion

The diagnostic process is central to all forms of healthcare, often reflecting careful data gathering combined with the provider's knowledge and experience. In the practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery, the diagnostic journey can be simple or complex but often relies on additional testing such as tissue biopsy to establish a clear diagnosis. For these cases, open communication between the maxillofacial clinician and pathologist optimizes the accuracy of the final diagnosis, which in turn leads to the most appropriate and effective treatment. Personalized patient follow-up helps complete the diagnostic journey and provides ongoing assurance regarding the patient's oral health.
