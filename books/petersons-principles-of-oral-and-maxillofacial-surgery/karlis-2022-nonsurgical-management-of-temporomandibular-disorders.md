Additional topics of interest will include thermal agents and electrical stimulation, as well as trigger point muscle injections, relaxation, biofeedback, acupressure, acupuncture, and psychotherapy. Finally, the reader will be able to discuss occlusal appliance therapy and possible causes of failure on nonsurgical treatments.

# 52.1 Introduction

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is the general term used to describe the manifestation of pain and/or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and its associated structures. Up to  $5\%$  of the population are affected by TMD, with significantly more frequent and more severe signs and symptoms appearing in women and older adults [1, 2]. The etiology of TMD is presumed to include trauma, parafunctional habits, malocclusion, joint overloading, arthritides, psychological factors, and ergonomic positioning of the head. The impact of psychological factors is difficult to calculate, but approximately  $10\%$  to  $20\%$  of patients with TMD also manifest some form of psychiatric illness [3]. As symptoms of TMD are quite variable and remain exceedingly difficult to attribute exclusively to one or more events (such as the true contribution or extent of involvement of muscles of mastication), the joint itself or psychological factors are best understood in terms of interdependence. When a diagnosis of TMD is suspected or confirmed, therapy should be directed to improve function and reduce pain and discomfort. There is ample literature to suggest that nonsurgical treatment modalities may account for as much as a  $74\%$  to  $85\%$  favorable response rate in patients with TMD [4, 5]. In one study, Suvinen and colleagues reported that  $81\%$  of their patients showed  $50\%$  or greater improvement after conservative physical therapy with a 6-month follow-up, attributing the improvement to a possible placebo-type effect [6]. Other sources report significant relief in  $30\%$  to  $60\%$  of patients when under some form of treatment [7]. Additionally, long-term follow-up studies have suggested that almost all patients with TMD will improve with time, regardless of the type of treatment they may receive [4, 8-12]. Thus, it appears well established in the literature that the majority of patients with TMD achieve some relief of symptoms with nonsurgical therapy. The dilemma for the surgeon is exacerbated by the broad spectrum of results and claims that use a seem

ingly endless variety of surgical and nonsurgical strategies. Since the extent or severity of symptomatology is apparently unrelated to etiology, and the overwhelming number of symptoms respond to conservative management, the question of whether and how to incorporate surgical and nonsurgical treatment into the care of these patients becomes challenging for the attending physician. There are absolute indications where surgical intervention would be of primary benefit, and the questions would be whether there is still a role for nonsurgical therapy in these patients, and if so, when it should be instituted and for how long.

One approach is to consider the concept of nonsurgical versus surgical therapy misleading and incomplete. There are many times when it is inappropriate to consider surgery. At other times, nonsurgical therapy precedes and almost always follows surgical intervention. Therefore, it is essential for the surgeon to have a deep appreciation of the available techniques and their limitations and the understanding to make a proper diagnosis in order to know when and how to manage TMDs. The purpose of this chapter will be to delineate those techniques that are adjunctive or discriminating to surgical considerations.

# 52.2 Treatment Considerations

The primary goal in treatment of TMD is to alleviate pain and/or mandibular dysfunction. Pain and alterations in function (i.e., mastication and speech) can become quite debilitating, greatly affecting oral health care and diminishing the quality of life for these individuals. Another critical objective relates to patient counseling and education on the predisposing factors for TMD. Depending on the degree of impairment, patients can often be assured that TMD is a benign condition, and clinical improvement can be expected with appropriate therapy. However, it is prudent if not incumbent upon the surgeon to inform patients that complete elimination of symptoms is at times unattainable. Nonsurgical techniques that can decrease unintentional overloading of the masticatory system, eliminate pain, reduce dysfunction, decrease chronicity, and promote healing are essential in all phases of therapy. A patient home care program may prevent further injury and allow for a period of healing. In general, patients can be instructed to limit mandibular function, modify habits, avoid stress, and start a home exercise program [8].

Clicking and popping of the TMJ is quite common in TMD and normal joints. It is difficult to eliminate, usually reoccurs, and there is inconclusive evidence to suggest whether this poses a problem for the patient.

# Box 52.1 Goals of Nonsurgical Therapy for Temporomandibular Disorders

Alleviate pain  
Decrease or eliminate jaw dysfunction  
Educate and counsel patients

There is considerable support that joint sounds without pain or dysfunction should not be treated (▶ Box 52.1).

Once a diagnosis of TMD has been established, frequent follow-up appointments are necessary once therapy is instituted, to determine whether there is any improvement. Initial impressions may require modification after several weeks of therapy, and further diagnostic procedures may be warranted to rule out vascular, neurologic, neoplastic, psychological, or otolaryngologic abnormalities. TMD is a complex disorder that is molded by many interacting factors, and strong consideration should be given to a multidisciplinary approach. The role of the dentist, physical therapist, neurologist, psychologist/psychiatrist, anesthesiologist, and oral and maxillofacial surgeon cannot be understated, and should be key constituents of any facial pain/TMD center. We cannot precisely dictate timing or length of therapy. This must still be determined by the surgeon and based on severity of symptoms and supporting diagnostic parameters. As with other joints, consideration must be given to rule out pathology, decrease inflammation, allow unimpeded joint motion, and restore range of motion. To accomplish this in a ginglymoarthroidal joint that is permanently attached to the opposite side and is intimately involved in oral health is indeed a challenge.

The remainder of this chapter provides basic guidelines for nonsurgical therapeutics. It is not intended to eliminate or preselect adjunctive dental or surgical treatment.

# 52.3 Nonsurgical Therapy Diet

A soft diet is often overlooked in the management of TMD. A soft diet prevents overloading of the TMJ and decreases muscle activity that may be hyperactive. The extent of time that a patient should be placed on a soft food diet is dependent on the severity of symptoms. Patients should be instructed to cut their food into small pieces and abstain from eating chewy, hard, or crunchy foods. Uncooked vegetables and meats represent examples of foods that should not be eaten by these patients. A strict liquid diet is reserved for those patients experiencing severe TMD symptoms (▶ Box 52.2).

# 52.3.1 Pharmacotherapy

Medications are often prescribed for managing the symptoms associated with TMD. Patients should understand that these medications may not offer the cure to their problem but can be a valuable adjunctive aid when prescribed as part of a comprehensive program. With pharmacotherapy, there is always a danger of drug dependency and abuse, particularly with narcotics and tranquilizers. Since many TMD symptoms are periodic, there is a tendency to prescribe medications on a "take as needed" philosophy. This can provide brief periods of pain relief, but more frequent pain cycles can result in less effectiveness of the drugs and ultimate overuse or abuse of the medications [12- 15]. The general recommendation is that when pharmacotherapy is employed, the medications should be prescribed at regular intervals for a specific period of time (e.g., four times daily for 2 weeks). The clinician must always be cognizant of potential personality traits that may contribute to drug dependence or abuse. Other obvious factors are concurrent medical ailments or medications, patient age, occupation, and each patient's attitude toward pharmacotherapy.

The most common pharmacologic agents used for the management of TMD are analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, anxiolytic agents, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and local anesthetics. Analgesics, corticosteroids, and anxiolytics are useful for acute TMD pain. Anti-inflammatory medications and antidepressants are primarily indicated for chronic pain management. Muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics can be used for both acute and chronic pain.

# 52.4 Analgesics

Analgesic medications are either opiate or nonopiate preparations. Nonopiate analgesics (salicylates and acetaminophen) can be added to the anti-inflammatory regimen to assist in pain relief. The salicylates (ASA) are commonly used in TMD and are the benchmark

medications to which other analgesics are usually compared. Salicylates are antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory. For those patients who cannot take aspirin, a nonacetylated aspirin such as choline magnesium trisalicylate or salsalate may be effective. As with all salicylates, however, choline magnesium trisalicylate and salsalate should not be prescribed for children or teenagers with chickenpox, influenza, or flu symptoms or exposure.

Opioid analgesics (oxycodone, propoxyphene, and hydrocodone) should be prescribed only for moderate to severe pain of limited duration, due to the high potential for addiction. These drugs are often administered in conjunction with NSAIDs or acetaminophen (Vicodin, Lortab, Percocet, Darvocet, etc.). They act on opioid receptors in the central nervous system, producing analgesia and sedation. Because patients can quickly become dependent on the narcotic analgesics, it is recommended that these drugs not be prescribed for longer than 2 to

3 weeks. Other side effects include constipation secondary to decreased gastric motility.

# 52.5 Anti-Inflammatory Medications

There are two types of anti-inflammatory medications useful in treating TMD: NSAIDs and corticosteroids (Fig. 52.1). Glucocorticosteriods prevent the release of arachidonic acid, a key component of the inflammation cascade. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, which inhibits prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid [16-18].

# 52.5.1 NSAIDs

The advantages of NSAIDs in TMD patients are analgesia and their anti-inflammatory properties (Table 52.1 and  $\triangleright$  Box 52.3). NSAIDs may offer relief for patients

with synovitis, myositis, capsulitis, symptomatic disk displacement, and osteoarthritis [19]. This type of therapy helps alleviate the inflammation, which thereby causes a decrease in pain perception. Side effects include gastric irritation, allergies, and kidney dysfunction. An ideal

NSAID would be one that has minimal gastric irritation, a quick onset with long-lasting effects, low-dosage requirements, is tolerated at high levels, and is low in cost. NSAIDs are divided into seven groups based on their chemical structure: salicylates (ASA), propionic acids (ibuprofen, naproxen), acetic acids (indomethacin, ketorolac), fenamic acids (meclofenamate), oxicams (piroxicam), and the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, rofecoxib, and meloxicam). The most common NSAIDs used are ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen, but because of purported fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and minimal effect on platelets, COX-2 inhibitors are becoming more popular. Recent studies have found that COX-2, an important inflammatory mediator, is present in the TMJ synovial tissue and

fluid of patients with internal derangements. This offers the possibility that the COX-2 inhibitors might be more effective for TMJ pain and arthralgias than other analgesics [20, 21]. Enteric coating, prodrugs (nabumetone), taking agents after meals or in conjunction with antacids, and taking gastric protective agents (ranitidine and sucralfate) have been reported to reduce the gastric irritation from NSAIDs [22].

# 52.5.2 Corticosteroids

By completely blocking the arachidonic acid cascade, corticosteroids produce a greater anti-inflammatory response than do NSAIDs. Systemic steroids are indicated only for short-term therapy (5 to 7 days) due to their long-term possible complications. Osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, electrolyte changes, and clinical Cushing's disease are sequelae of long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment [23]. Steroids have also been directly injected into the TMJ in an attempt to decrease inflammation or mediate the inflammatory response (i.e., following arthroscopy), but long-term or excessive use is associated with condylar hypoplasia or resorption by inhibiting osteoblastic activity and increasing loss of calcium in the urine and GI tract [24].

Antihistamines (promethazine and hydroxyzine) antagonize central and peripheral H1 receptors and have a sedative effect as well as anxiolytic properties. Antihistamines, unlike the benzodiazepines, do not have the potential for abuse. They can be used more safely in children and the elderly and for the treatment of vertigo and nausea that may accompany TMD [25].

# 52.6 Anxiolytics

Anxiolytic medications reduce the anxiety, insomnia, and muscle hyperactivity associated with TMD (Table 52.2 and Box 52.4). These drugs often help the patient reduce the perception of, or reaction to, stress. Benzodiazepines (diazepam) decrease anxiety, relax skeletal muscle, and cause sedation and may be selected according to their more favorable characteristics (i.e., less sedation). The muscle relaxant properties may be used to decrease the effects of bruxism secondary to hyperactivity of muscles of mastication. It is recommended that the benzodiazepines not be used for more than a 2-week period because of the high potential for dependency, although this can be increased up to 3 weeks only at bedtime to control bruxism [19]. Buspar (azaspirodecanedione) is an anxiolytic; however, it does not produce either sedation or muscle relaxation. It may

# 52.7 Antidepressants

Antidepressants include monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Table 52.3 and Box 52.5). They are prescribed for chronic pain, headaches, sleep disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and central-mediated pain disorders. The relationship between pain and depression is a challenge and often necessitates treating both simultaneously. Depression in the TMD or

chronic pain population is greater than in the general population. Studies report that up to  $30\%$  of TMD patients have major depression at the time of presentation for treatment, and up to  $74\%$  of patients with chronic TMD have had an episode of major depression [26, 27].

MAOIs are not routinely prescribed for TMD due to their numerous side effects and dietary restrictions. Benefits of tricyclic antidepressants have been well documented in chronic pain or depression populations and are probably due to analgesic and antidepressant actions. The analgesic properties are independent of the antidepressant effect, which requires higher doses. It has been shown that low doses of amitriptyline (10 mg) before sleep can have an analgesic effect on chronic pain but have no relationship to the antidepressant actions that require doses up to 20 times greater [28]. Tricyclic antidepressants may also help treat nocturnal bruxism and any sleep disturbance associated with TMD [29]. Side effects are related to anticholinergic activity causing xerostomia, constipation, blurred vision, and urinary retention. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can also be used for treating the depressed TMD patient. These medications often need to be taken for several months, and patients must be counseled appropriately. Fluoxetine (Prozac) may increase bruxism and anxiety and should be carefully monitored.

# 52.8 Muscle Relaxants

Centrally acting muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, and carisoprodol) may be used to relax hyperactive musculature associated with TMD (Table 52.4, Boxes 52.6 and 52.7). These relaxants may also act as sedatives, and they are commonly combined with NSAID use. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) has a similar chemical structure to the tricyclic antidepressants and if given over an extended period of time will produce antidepressant and sedative actions as well as the anticholinergic side effects of the tricyclics. Central muscle relaxants can be very effective for acute myofascial pain (i.e., trauma).

One peripheral muscle relaxant, baclofen, has been used in myofascial pain but is best reserved for severe muscle spasm or neurogenic pain. Recently, botulinum toxin has been used to treat severe bruxism. By providing muscle relaxation, inflammation of the masseter muscle and TMJ capsule can be reduced [30, 31].

# 52.9 Botulinum Toxin

Botulinum toxin (BTX) traditionally is used for cosmetic purposes; however, it has potential to aid in targeted treatment of myofascial pain disorder (MPD), masticatory muscle dystonia, and TMJ dislocation as an off-label use [32]. Proper patient selection is of utmost importance as it should be reserved for those who have failed conservative measures and/or have severe masticatory muscle spasm and dysfunction commonly with an etiology of parafunction.

Three mechanisms of action have been proposed, but not proven, in the literature which includes reduction in muscle hyperactivity through muscle paresis, reduction in muscle inflammation caused by muscle hyperactivity, and reduction of trigger points in the muscle fibers. Therefore, it is still unclear as to how it is effective in treatment and management of MPD [33].

The literature has shown some success in treatment of those individuals carefully selected above. Injection usually takes about 4 to 7 days to reach maximum potential, and duration of treatment can last anywhere from 12 to

16 weeks. Therefore, these are patients that are seen and reinjected on a regular basis. Use of BTX is not without its potential long-term complications including but not limited to muscle atrophy, prolonged headaches, and paresis to high-risk areas adjacent to the injection sites so the provider should be well acquainted with proximal anatomical structures during administration of BTX.

# 52.10 Local Anesthetics

Local anesthetics act on the nerve cell membrane to prevent generation and conduction of impulses (▶ Box 52.8). Local anesthetics can be used as diagnostic blocks intra-articularly and/or intramuscularly to alleviate pain and increase range of motion. For example, injection behind the maxillary tuberosity will permit the lateral pterygoids to be anesthetized, thereby allowing maximal protrusion and retrusion of the mandible. There should be no vasoconstrictor used in conjunction with the anesthesia, as the decrease in blood flow may increase muscular pain. The intrinsic vasodilation effect of the anesthesia may improve perfusion and thereby further alleviate pain. It has been shown that an intra-articular injection of mepivacaine along with physiotherapy in patients with anteriorly displaced disks has yielded favorable results in pain relief and masticatory efficiency [34].

# 52.10.1 Physical Therapy

There are many factors contributing to limited range of motion. They include muscular pain, anterior disk displacement (closed lock), and fibrotic scar tissue preventing rotation or translational movements. It is well accepted that immobilization has deleterious effects on both joints and muscles.

Immobilization may cause degenerative changes to the joint surfaces, synovial fluid, and surrounding tissues. Reduced motion also results in rapid muscle fatigue, muscle weakness, and contractures. Synovial fluid generation is reduced or halted when joints are immobile. Additionally, it has been observed that the synovial fluid of patients with pain and limited motion often contains inflammatory byproducts. Kaneyama and colleagues listed a variety of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10,

tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-6, and IL-8 in symptomatic joints, not observed in asymptomatic joints [35]. This high level of cytokine activity is believed to be related to the underlying pathogenesis of TMD. Cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-13 may induce the "inflammatory cascade." As a result of the release of proteinases, there may be destruction of articular cartilage and bone resorption. Each cytokine has its unique properties, not only affecting the surrounding tissues but also aiding in the release of other cytokines [35]. Thus, the role of functional motion and the synovium may be an indeterminate factor in the health of the TMJ (▶ Box 52.9).

# 52.11 Exercise Therapy

Physical therapy and exercise are an important part of any TMD program. Mild or acute symptoms can be initially managed with soft diet, jaw rest, heat/ice packs, jaw/tongue posture opening exercises, lateral jaw movements, and passive stretching exercises. Once again, the exact sequence of therapy is unknown but is usually based on degree of pain and limitation of function. Further reduction of pain and inflammation may require an office-based physical therapy program. From our experience, ultrasonography, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), soft tissue manipulation, trigger point injections, and acupuncture have also been advocated as effective in the management of the TMD patient.

Jaw exercise therapy can be described as passive, active, or isometric. Passive jaw exercise allows the

patient to manually (or with a device such as Therabite Jaw Motion Rehabilitation System, Atos Medical, Milwaukee, WI, USA) increase interincisal opening (Fig. 52.2). Passive jaw exercise has received a great deal of attention recently. Many authors report significant improvement in pain and mobility in the nonsurgical phase of treatment for TMD as well as for the postoperative TMD patients [36-39]. Passive jaw exercise is also very effective for patients experiencing muscular trismus and myofascial pain dysfunction (MPD). It may be contraindicated in patients with severely displaced disks, due to the possibility of damage to the disk or retrodiskal tissues.

Active exercise using the patient's jaw musculature may be incorporated into a home therapy program. One regimen allows the patient to activate, for example, their suprahyoid muscles (geniohyoid, mylohyoid, digastric, and stylohyoid), thereby inactivating the elevators of the jaw (medial pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis). This may allow for relaxation of hyperactive muscles of mastication and may assist in increasing maximal incisal opening. In the active stretch phase, patients are advised to keep their mouth open for several seconds and relax. They are instructed to open until they perceive pain and then advised to hold for several seconds and repeat this exercise several times a day. An active lateral stretch permitting the contralateral lateral pterygoid to be stretched may be accomplished by visualizing themselves in a mirror. In the active protrusion, also performed in front of the mirror, the mandible is protruded forward stretching the lateral pterygoids bilaterally. All active excursions are maintained for several seconds and slowly released.

Isometric exercises have been recommended for patients with severe pain and trismus. There is no move-

ment during this exercise, while the depressor muscles are activated, allowing for relaxation of the opposing elevator musculature (medial pterygoids, masseter, and temporalis). These exercises are performed by holding the mandible stationary as the muscles are activated isometrically. The lateral pterygoids may also be exercised in a similar isometric fashion.

Mongini describes a three-stage office technique of mandibular manipulation for patients with pain, decreased mobility, and disk displacement without reduction [40]. Right and left lateral movements are initiated by the patient. The patient continues the movement, while the clinician applies light pressure in the same direction, and in the last stage, the mandible is moved to the opposite side with patient assistance [40]. Kurita and colleagues described a technique of placing one thumb on the last molar on the affected side, while the other hand supports the head in the temporal region [41]. The mandible is then moved downward and forward. The patient is instructed to protrude and move their jaw laterally, and open their mouth while the clinician manipulates the jaw. Following this movement, the mandible is pushed back so that the condyle is positioned posterosuperiorly in the glenoid fossa. Only  $18\%$  of the patients received significant benefit from the manipulation, and the more advanced the displacement, the less the success of the treatment [41]. Yuasa and Kurita suggested that physical therapy along with administration of NSAIDs (for a 4-week period) is a more effective way to treat TMJ disk displacement without osseous changes [42]. Nonetheless, there is no shortage of recommended exercises, and care must be taken to do no harm (▶ Box 52.10).

# 52.12 Thermal Agents

Thermal agents are often incorporated in the management of TMD. The use of cold and heat can alleviate muscle pain and play an equal role during stretching and strengthening exercises [43-45]. Heat therapy has been reported to reduce muscle pain by increasing nerve con

duction velocity and local vasodilatation [45]. Superficial heat therapy can be implemented with conductive (hot packs, paraffin, whirlpool) or radiant (infrared) agents. The most common types used are a moist hot washcloth, heating pad, or hydrocollator, a pad filled with clay and heated in a water bath to  $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $88^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . It is wrapped in a towel and placed on the site for 15 to 20 minutes, causing a transient rise in skin temperature to about  $42^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The use of moist heating pads is an effective modality of treatment for myofascial pain associated with TMD [46].

Cryotherapy is often used as an aid in stretching muscles in an attempt to increase maximal incisor opening limited by pain [43]. The pain perception model described by Melzack and Wall explains why cold therapy stimulates the large A delta fibers (temperature) inhibiting pain, which is stimulated by the small C fibers [45]. A physical therapist would place refrigerants on the skin in a sweeping motion followed by stretching of the musculature. Cold therapy should be used with caution because of the potential for increased joint stiffness, contracture, and immobility. Cold can also have analgesic effects after a therapeutic exercise regimen. Ice wrapped in a towel, fluoromethane spray, and reusable ice packs can all be used to deliver cryotherapy to the temporomandibular joint and related muscles. The stretch and spray technique, initially described by Modell and Simons and later modified by Travell and colleagues, is still a mainstay of office physiotherapy [43, 44]. The therapist holds the fluoromethane spray about 30 to  $45\mathrm{cm}$  from the patient and sprays in a sweeping motion multiple times, and this is then followed by stretching exercises.

Possible side effects include frostbite and the potential for joint stiffness. Many therapists follow cryotherapy with moist heat to prevent the muscles from contracting.

# 52.13 Ultrasonography and Phonophoresis

Deep heat can be delivered by ultrasonography or phonophoresis. The ultrasound machine operates above audible frequency sound waves (0.75 to  $1.0\mathrm{MHz}$ ), which convert to heat while traveling through soft tissue. The ultrasound machine is applied to the skin along with an acoustic conductive gel and then moved slowly over the affected area in small circular movements. The operator must be careful not to keep the machine in one place for too long as it may cause overheating of the connective tissue, causing structural damage. The deep heat is intended to increase perfusion to the area, decreasing pain and increasing mobility [47]. Reported effects of ultrasound therapy include altered cell membrane per

meability, intracellular fluid absorption, decreased collagen viscosity, vasodilatation, and analgesia. The beneficial effects to joints are reduced capsular contracture, break up of calcium deposits, and decreasing hyaluronic acid viscosity [48]. Because ultrasonography delivers heat to the deeper structures, it may have some advantage in treating tendonitis, capsulitis, muscle spasm, and tight ligaments.

Phonophoresis is an application of ultrasound heat therapy that incorporates a pad filled with a steroid or anesthetic cream placed over the affected area. As the ultrasound waves are applied, the medications perfuse into the tissues. The most common indication for phonophoresis is synovitis associated with painful jaw hypomobility. Contraindications for the use of ultrasonography and phonophoresis include areas that may have a reduced circulation, fluid-filled organs, eyes, radiation therapy sites, and malignant tissue. Ultrasound therapy should be used with extreme caution over active bone growth centers [49].

# 52.14 Electrical Stimulation Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation

TENS has become a viable home therapy in treating TMD. The precise mechanism of action is unknown, but it has been suggested that the gate control theory, counterirritation, neurohumoral substance release, and peripheral blockade are all involved [50]. TENS uses a low-voltage electrical current that is designed for sensory counterstimulation in painful disorders. It is used to decrease muscle pain and hyperactivity and for neuromuscular re-education [51, 52]. TENS units are small and portable. Electrodes are placed along dermatomes or over acupuncture and trigger points. The patient can control the settings with variable frequency, amplitude, waveform, width, and pulse mode. Treatment can last several hours. TENS emits an asymmetric biphasic wave of 100 to  $500\mathrm{ms}$  pulse. The efficacy of TENS for analgesia and muscle relaxation in myofascial pain has been documented [53]. Electrode placement is contraindicated over the carotid sinus, transcranially, directly on the spine, on a pregnant womb, or on patients with demand-type pacemakers [54].

# 52.14.1 High-Voltage Stimulation

High-voltage stimulation units deliver currents of positive and negative polarity with voltages greater than  $100\mathrm{V}$ , which are delivered in a constant or intermittent

pattern. The positive polarity produces vasoconstriction, whereas the negative polarity produces vasodilatation. The positive polarity reduces nerve irritability, and negative polarity enhances it. Negative polarity softens the affected tissue, thus decreasing muscle tension. Treatment with high-voltage stimulation has improved jaw mobility and relieved pain intensity in TMD patients [55]. It can be used for pain relief, reduction of edema, and neuro muscular stimulation [55].

# 52.14.2 Iontophoresis

Iontophoresis transfers ions from a solution through intact skin by passing a direct current between two electrodes [56]. Positive ions are transmitted at the cathode, and negative ions are transmitted at the anode. Examples of negatively ionizing drugs are dexamethasone and methylprednisolone. Other drugs used in iontophoresis include lidocaine and salicylates. Iontophoresis was introduced in treating TMD and postherpetic neuralgia in 1982 [57]. It appears to be most effective against inflammation, muscle spasm, and calcium deposits. The deep penetration of the medication aids in the treatment of severe joint inflammation and pain (▶ Box 52.11).

# 52.15 Trigger Points and Muscle Injections

A trigger point is an area of hyperirritability in a tissue that, when compressed, is locally tender, hypersensitive, and gives rise to referred pain and tenderness [58]. Trigger point development may be due to trauma, sustained contraction, or acute strain. When a needle penetrates this area, it may cause a twitch response and referred pain [58]. Injection of local anesthetic agents without epinephrine may cause a temporary anesthesia, which enables the clinician to stretch the muscles in the affected area. A vasodilator effect of the local anesthetic may improve perfusion to the area, thus allowing harmful metabolites which may induce pain to be more readily removed by the vasculature.

# 52.15.1 Stress-Reduction Techniques

# 52.15.1.1 Relaxation and Biofeedback

Relaxation and stress-reduction techniques for patients with TMD can be very effective treatment modalities. Various techniques exist, an example being contracting and releasing skeletal muscles, starting from the feet and moving toward the head and neck region. Patients can also use audiotapes that teach breathing and specific relaxation techniques. Biofeedback techniques incorporate the use of electromyography (EMG) and skin temperature to measure the patient's physiologic function. The information is then conveyed back to the patient by a meter or sound. The patient can gauge their level of relaxation and measure progress accordingly [59]. The aim is to achieve psychological self-regulation and to monitor the relationship between muscular tension and pain. In a review of the literature, Crider and Glaros reported  $69\%$  of subjects rated as improved or symptom free following biofeedback and relaxation treatments, whereas only  $35\%$  of patients receiving placebo intervention showed any improvement [60]. Furthermore, on follow-up examination, the patients showed no decline from posttreatment levels [60]. Scott and Gregg advocate that relaxation techniques and EMG feedback can yield good results, especially in patients who are not depressed and have temporomandibular pain for a short period of time [61]. The chief hurdle is the difficulty to motivate patients in pain (▶ Box 52.12).

# 52.16 Acupressure and Acupuncture

Acupressure and acupuncture may be implemented along with other modalities during nonsurgical treatment. Acupuncture uses the relationship between energy flow through meridians, natural elements, and positive and negative life forces. Fine needles are used to reestablish proper energy flow. There are several theories on the

mechanism of action of acupuncture and acupressure. The first is the gate control theory, which states that the needle produces a painless stimulation, causing gates to close and preventing signal propagation to the spinal cord [62]. Other explanations include release of endorphins from the pituitary gland which block pain sensation, promotion of alpha waves (associated with stress reduction and relaxation), and rebalancing the electric ion flow pattern (when disrupted, it may elicit pain) [62]. There are several different acupressure techniques including Jin Shin (two acupressure points held for 30 seconds to 5 minutes), Shiatsu (more rapid, held 3 to 10 seconds), reflexology (acupressure on feet, hands, and ears corresponding to areas of the body), Do-In (self-acupressure and breathing exercises), and G-Jo (acupressure for first aid purposes). Some studies have reported favorable results when these techniques are combined with other modalities (splint therapy), but overall data are limited [63, 64]. These pain therapies can be offered as an alternative to conventional therapy.

# 52.17 Psychotherapy

In some cases, TMD may be the somatic expression of an underlying psychiatric or psychological disorder such as depression or conversion [65, 66]. The clinician should screen for personal or familial history of psychiatric disease, physical or sexual abuse, and substance abuse. Anxiety disorders occur at greater rates in patients with chronic pain [67]. Once identified, these patients should be referred to a psychiatrist and/or psychologist for adjunctive treatment. Psychological treatments include behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and self-management/support groups. Psychiatric treatments include medications with behavioral therapy. Often as a last resort, TMD patients are referred to pain clinics for treatment, whether a psychological component exists or not, often out of frustration.

# 52.17.1 Occlusal Appliance Therapy

An occlusal appliance is a removable device, usually made of hard acrylic, which is custom fit over the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular or maxillary teeth. The splint is constructed so that there is even occlusal contact with the teeth of the opposing arch in centric and anterior contact only, in lateral and protrusive excursions of the mandible. The physiologic basis of treatment is not well understood, but the effectiveness of the occlusal splint has been attributed to a decreased loading on the TMJs and reduction of the neuromuscular reflex activity. Alleviation of bruxism and MPD may be

due to the change in vertical dimension, altering the proprioception in the postural position of the mandible [68-70]. There are generally two types of appliances: stabilization (flat plane) and anterior repositioning.

# 52.18 Stabilization (Flat Plane) Appliance

A stabilization appliance covers all the teeth in one arch and is indicated to relax the muscles of mastication, aid in joint stability, and protect teeth from bruxism (▶ Box 52.13, Figs. 52.3 and 52.4) [70, 71]. Additional indications for stabilization appliances may include myalgia, inflammation, and retrodiscitis secondary to trauma. With a stabilization appliance, the condyles are placed in the most muscularly stable position, while the teeth are contacting evenly and simultaneously [72]. There must be bilateral equal posterior contacts so that an environment of stable physiologic posture is possible. Canine guidance is created for protrusive and lateral excursions. As the patient's symptoms improve, the splint should be adjusted to maintain even contacts bilaterally. The splint is usually fabricated on the maxillary arch because it covers more tissue, especially with Class II or Class III patients where fabrication of a mandibular appliance can be difficult. On the other hand, major advantages of the mandibular stabilization appliance include better speech and less visibility, which may contribute to better patient compliance [72]. The appliance should be worn 24 hours a day and taken out at mealtimes. Stabilization appliances can be weaned post-TMJ arthroscopy and/or as the patient's symptoms subside.

Major and Nebbe reported effective reduction in headaches and muscle pain using stabilization appliances, but occlusal stabilization appliances have limited value in reducing joint pain [73]. Lundh and colleagues concurred with the fact that the stabilization splints have little value in painful disk displacement without reduction [74]. Kai and colleagues reported that after treatment with a stabilization occlusal splint of the maxillary arch, clinical signs and symptoms of nonreducing anteriorly displaced disks decreased, but osteoarthritic findings increased [75].

# 52.19 Anterior Repositioning Appliance

The anterior repositioning splint is an interocclusal appliance that permits the mandible to assume a position more anterior than normal (▶ Box 52.14, Figs. 52.5 and 52.6). The purpose of these appliances is to alter the structural condyle-disk-fossa relationship in an effort to decrease joint loading [76]. Indications for this device are primarily disk derangement disorders. The maxillary appliance is preferred, and it is fabricated with a guide ramp that permits the anterior repositioning of the mandible [75]. Anterior repositioning appliances are used less frequently because repositioning of the mandible over a period of time can result in irreversible occlusal changes such as posterior open bites, which could require extensive prosthetic rehabilitation.

# 52.20 Occlusal Adjustment

There is a limited role for occlusal adjustment or selective grinding in the treatment of TMD [77]. The purpose of selectively grinding the teeth is to permanently posi

tion the dentition into a better occlusion. It is an irreversible process and is best suited for the acute TMD symptoms arising from overcontoured restorations or postorthognathic surgery. In these select cases, the occlusal equilibration allows for proper condylar positioning and prevents muscular problems associated with improper interferences.

# 52.21 Causes of Failure

As a singular modality, it is very difficult to assess the clinical success or failures of nonsurgical treatments over time. DeLeeuw and colleagues reported long-lasting satisfactory results for patients treated with nonsurgical therapy for internal derangements and osteoarthrosis with a 30-year follow-up [78]. Symptoms such as joint noises persisted, whereas pain and discomfort generally subsided.

There are several possibilities that could explain the cause of failure of nonsurgical therapy for TMDs: incorrect history taking, improper diagnosis and treatment, lack of patient compliance, emotionally debilitated patient, or coexisting morbidities [79]. When significant symptoms persist after 3 to 6 months of nonsurgical therapy, alternative therapies and/or diagnoses should be considered, including surgery.

# Summary

TMD is a complex disorder with common presenting signs and symptoms. In this chapter, we have presented nonsurgical strategies used to alleviate the pain and dysfunction associated with the TMJ. Since an exact correlation between diagnosis and treatment is not always possible, success or failure with nonsurgical modalities is not a reliable outcome, even though this therapy may aid in diagnosis and be the first step for most patients. When surgery is indicated or evidence-based, nonsurgical techniques are a crucial adjunct perioperatively, if not forever.
