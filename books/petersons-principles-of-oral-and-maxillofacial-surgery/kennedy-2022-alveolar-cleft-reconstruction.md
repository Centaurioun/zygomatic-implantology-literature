# 47.1 Introduction

In the management of patients with cleft lip and cleft palate, the decision regarding alveolar cleft grafting is one of the most controversial. Is grafting of the residual alveolar defect indicated? If so, at what age is it most appropriate, what material is most ideal, and should adjunctive procedures such as orthodontic expansion be used before or after grafting? Finally, what are appropriate measures of success? This chapter reviews what is known, discusses these controversies, and provides a rationale for the approach to the residual alveolar cleft defect.

# 47.2 Rationale for Grafting

Although some authors have advocated nongrafting techniques [1] or prosthodontic approaches, the general consensus is that achieving continuity between the cleft alveolar segments has significant advantages, regardless of how and when this is accomplished. Potential advantages include the following: [2]

Grafting achieves stability of the arch and prevents collapse of the alveolar segments. This provides improved orthodontic stability.  
Grafting preserves the health of the dentition. Grafting provides room for the canine and lateral incisors to erupt into the arch into stable alveolar bone and maintains bony support of teeth adjacent to the cleft [3, 4].  
Grafting restores continuity not only of the alveolus but also of the maxilla at the piriform rim. This supports the ala and provides improved stability and support for the nose. This may have a direct aesthetic benefit and may also prove to be of long-term benefit when formal rhinoplasty procedures are performed [3].  
Palatal and nasolabial fistulae are often present even after palatoplasty. Grafting of the alveolar defect provides an opportunity for the surgeon to address the residual oronasal fistula. This may have potential benefit for both hygiene and speech. Many cleft patients present with chronic upper respiratory and sinus disease, which may be related to reflux into the

nasal cavity and sinus. There is some evidence that the residual fistula, whether labial or palatal, can have an effect on speech articulation and nasality. There is evidence that closure of the fistula and grafting the cleft defect can improve nasal emission and nasality [5].

# 47.3 Measuring Outcomes

Before discussing the controversies associated with reconstruction of the residual alveolar cleft, it is important to accept some consistent measure of successful outcome. Most reports rely on descriptive data. This makes comparison of different approaches difficult. To evaluate bone graft success, Bergland and colleagues [6] described a semiquantitative approach that divided grafts into four types based on alveolar crest height. Although this is effective, it has been suggested that occlusal alveolar bone height does not adequately measure success [7]. Support of the ala and opportunity for successful tooth movement into the site or placement of an endosseous implant also require apical bone formation. A modification of the Bergland scale that measures both occlusal and basal bone height may be a better tool for evaluating graft success. Although the Bergland scale and modifications of it rely on a two-dimensional radiograph to evaluate bone fill within a three-dimensional cleft, studies show good correlation between bone volume as predicted by these two-dimensional radiographs and that shown on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans [8]. Investigators prefer to use three-dimensional imaging almost exclusively to quantify the results of alveolar cleft bone grafting techniques [9-12]. To date, no research has been conducted to show that a critical volume of bone is required at an alveolar cleft site in order for the graft to meet success criteria. Therefore, it appears at this time that three-dimensional imaging certainly has its place in research, but two-dimensional imaging continues to be sufficient for routine monitoring of clinical outcomes. An exception to this might include evaluation of the grafted site for the treatment planning of dental implants after skeletal maturity has been achieved.

# 47.4 Timing of the Graft

Perhaps the most controversial topic in managing the alveolar cleft is when grafting should be performed. In the traditional literature, terminology is not consistent. Outcome measures for various approaches are also defined inconsistently, which makes comparison diffici

>12 years: Late secondary grafting

cult. Here, alveolar grafting is grouped according to timing as defined later (▶ Box 47.1).

# Primary Grafting

Some define primary alveolar bone grafting as that which is performed simultaneously with lip repair [13]. Others have stated that any grafting that is performed at younger than 2 years of age is considered primary grafting. Still others have defined primary grafting as grafting performed before the palate is repaired [14, 15].

Primary grafting performed at the time of lip repair has failed to result in acceptable outcome. Long-term studies show abnormal maxillary development with maxillary retrognathia, concave profile, and increased frequency of crossbite compared with patients without grafts [16, 17].

Primary grafting performed after the closure of the lip and before the closure of the palate has proved successful in a limited number of centers when a very specific protocol is followed [14, 15]. A prosthesis is placed before the lip is closed to mold the alveolar segments into close proximity. The lip is then closed, which further aids in molding the segments. The segments must be in close proximity with good arch form before an onlay rib graft is placed across the labial surface of the cleft in a subperiosteal tunnel that is developed by limited dissection.

Advocates of this approach have not experienced problems with altered facial growth and malocclusion, most likely the result of the limited dissection used in these cases. They have reported improved occlusion and graft success in these patients compared with patients grafted at other ages [18]. It is still difficult to wholeheartedly endorse this approach. Several additional anesthetics and surgeries are needed at a young age. This technique may not be possible in all patients, such as

those with isolated alveolar clefts without palatal clefting or those in whom segments cannot be orthopedically aligned. In one center, because of these limitations, nearly one half of patients could not be treated with primary grafting [14]. Outcomes may also not be as good as with other approaches. In one study, there was an increased incidence of malformation of permanent lateral incisors in the primary graft group and decreased success of the graft, with only  $41\%$  of primary grafts  $(54\%)$  if pregrafting orthopedics was included) resulting in adequate bone height when measured with a Bergland scale [19]. This was compared with  $73\%$  success of those sites grafted in the mixed-dentition stage (after eruption of the permanent central incisors and before eruption of the maxillary canines).

# Early Secondary Grafting

Grafting after the child reaches 2 years of age and before 6 years is considered early secondary grafting. The literature does not support early secondary grafting.

# Secondary Grafting in the Mixed Dentition (After Eruption of the Maxillary Central Incisors and Before Eruption of the Canines)

Alveolar reconstruction with grafting during the eruption of the permanent dentition may be best for various reasons. Rationale for grafting and for timing of grafting during this time period includes the following:

There is minimal maxillary growth after age 6-7 years, and the effect of grafting at this time will result in minimal to no alteration of facial growth [20, 21].  
Cooperation with orthodontic and perioperative care is predictable. General anesthesia is not required for routine orthodontic procedures such as expansion.  
The donor site for graft harvest is of acceptable volume for predictable grafting with autogenous bone.  
Bone volume may be improved by eruption of the tooth into the newly grafted bone [22].  
Grafting during this phase allows placement of the graft before eruption of permanent teeth into the cleft site, which achieves one of the primary goals of grafting—to enhance the health of teeth in and adjacent to the alveolar cleft.

The landmark papers by Boyne and Sands [23, 24] established that grafting in the mixed dentition achieves many of the goals of reconstruction of the cleft alveolus. The ideal patient is between the ages of 8 and 12 years with a maxillary canine root that is one half to two thirds developed. This timing is supported by several well-documented studies [6, 25-29]. However, some authors have suggested that earlier grafting should be considered

as a means of preserving the lateral incisor as well [16, 30, 31]. These authors have suggested that grafting be considered as early as 6 years of age. There is some evidence that grafting between the ages of 6 and 8 years, in addition to achieving the expected goal of preserving the canine, can preserve the lateral incisor as well, but this remains controversial. Despite clear indications that grafting in the mixed dentition is preferable to either primary, early secondary, or late secondary grafting, it is not entirely clear whether this grafting should be performed early (age 6-8 years) or late (age 8-12 years). Various individual factors should be evaluated when determining the ideal time for grafting during the mixed dentition (▶ Box 47.2).

# Dental Versus Chronologic Age

Many outcomes of grafting are related to preserving health of the dentition adjacent to and erupting into the cleft site. It makes sense that the timing of the graft be determined on the basis of dental rather than chronologic age. When the maxillary central incisors begin to erupt, regardless of chronologic age, the patient should be evaluated for grafting, taking into consideration the other factors discussed later. In some patients, this may be much earlier than the traditionally recommended age for evaluation.

# Presence of the Lateral Incisor

Many proponents of earlier mixed-dentition grafting advocate this timing because of the opportunity to salvage the lateral incisor [16, 28, 30]. During the evaluation, attention should be directed to the presence of the lateral incisor and to whether this tooth appears to be normally formed. The incidence of congenitally missing permanent lateral incisors within the alveolar cleft is between  $35\%$  and  $60\%$  [19, 32]. If a lateral incisor is

present and appears to be well formed, earlier grafting may be beneficial. Even if the tooth is not perfectly formed, it may still be beneficial to attempt to preserve it. The grafted alveolus will often be thin to the point that alveolar width is not adequate for definitive reconstruction with an endosseous implant without additional grafting [33]. Retaining the lateral incisor will maintain bone width and perhaps eliminate the need for yet another graft at the time of implant placement.

# Position of the Lateral Incisor

If the lateral incisor is mesial to the cleft, it often has adequate space for eruption. However, if the lateral incisor is located in the posterior segment, earlier grafting may be necessary to preserve the lateral incisor [13]. In one review,  $36\%$  of patients with cleft lip and alveolus had missing lateral incisors [32]. Of the  $64\%$  who had lateral incisors,  $90\%$  of the lateral incisors were located distal to the cleft. In the same series of patients,  $57\%$  of those with cleft lip and palate had missing lateral incisors, and of the remaining  $43\%$ ,  $86\%$  of the lateral incisors were located distal to the cleft [32]. Therefore, a significant number of patients may benefit from earlier grafting to preserve the lateral incisor (Fig. 47.1).

# Rotation of the Central Incisor

The maxillary permanent central incisor will often erupt in a rotated and angled position (Fig. 47.2). This reflects the morphology of the underlying bone. In extreme cases, the crowding of the two incisors can preclude normal oral hygiene methods, and this can result in decay of the central incisor. The patient or parent may also be concerned with the position of the incisors for aesthetic reasons. If a decision is made to rotate these teeth into alignment, it may be necessary to graft the alveolar defect before this orthodontic tooth movement [34]. Failure to consider the morphology of the bone on the distal surface of the erupted central incisor can result in bone loss and periodontal defects as a result of orthodontic tooth movement. Because the incisor teeth erupt at approximately age 6 years, the surgeon may choose to graft at an earlier age so that orthodontic movement of the incisors can be accomplished.

# Social Issues

The window for mixed-dentition grafting is large (age 6-12 years). This is also during a period of tremendous social development for the patient. If a graft is necessary, the timing of surgery should respect the social and educational development of the child. Slightly earlier grafting, when it may cause less interference with education or other important opportunities for social development, may be preferable to grafting at an exact stage of dental development.

# Size of the Patient and of the Cleft

Petite patients with large cleft defects are challenging. Adequate closure of the defect may be difficult, and harvesting an adequate amount of graft material may be challenging as well. This is particularly true for large bilateral cleft defects. In these patients, the lateral incisor is often absent, the oronasal communication is often quite large, and the premaxilla is frequently in less than ideal position. In these large defects, later grafting is often better, to wait for growth of the patient and orthodontic alignment of the cleft segments.

# - Need for Other Procedures

Patients are often evaluated for velopharyngeal incompetence, minor aesthetic revision of the nose or the lip, and pressure-equalizing tubes for otitis media. It is rea

sonable to coordinate the timing of surgery for the alveolar cleft with other procedures that may be necessary. If velopharyngeal flap surgery is planned during the mixed-dentition phase, it should take precedence over the alveolar graft. Improved speech is more important to the child's development than achieving continuity of the alveolus. Alveolar grafting would be compromised if performed simultaneously with velopharyngeal flap surgery, and in these patients, it is appropriate to delay the graft until the velopharyngeal flap surgery is accomplished and speech therapy reinstituted. Minor soft tissue, nasal, and lip revision are often desired by the patient and parents. These can be accomplished with alveolar grafting. The grafting process can distort the nose and soft tissue; these soft tissue procedures should be performed first with alveolar grafting undertaken in

the same setting and with care not to disrupt the aesthetic procedures already performed.

# Dynamic of the Team

Cleft management should always involve a multidisciplinary team, with the wide expertise to develop a proper treatment plan. Difficulties may arise when the priorities of one specialty compete with those of another. If the surgical team is faced with an orthodontic provider who feels strongly that it is appropriate to align the maxillary central incisors as soon as they erupt, it will be necessary for the alveolar defect to be grafted earlier to prevent compromise of osseous support for the central incisors. Some orthodontists and surgeons believe that palatal expansion is necessary before grafting. These teams may find that it is more appropriate to graft patients at a later age, because it may take months to achieve the desired expansion before the graft.

# Secondary Grafting After Eruption of the Permanent Canine (Late Secondary Grafting)

Late secondary grafting has received some support; however, data show that when all the goals of alveolar reconstruction are considered, it has a less than acceptable outcome. Patients older than 12 years of age who undergo grafting have been reported to have decreased success when evaluated using the Bergland scale [6, 19, 29, 31, 35, 36], loss of osseous support of teeth adjacent to the cleft [22], and increased morbidity [31]. There is less opportunity to salvage the lateral incisor, and there is a delay in correction of the orthodontic condition. This delayed grafting does allow for increased options with regard to donor site for graft material because harvest of the mandibular symphysis becomes possible. Such grafts are difficult in the mixed-dentition stage,

where it is difficult to obtain adequate bone without damaging unerupted teeth.

# 47.5 Source of Bone Graft

The selection of the ideal grafting material is somewhat dependent on the timing of the graft. In primary bone grafting, the rib is the only site for adequate quantity of bone with acceptable morbidity. In the mixed-dentition stage, the rib is not as appropriate as other sites such as the calvaria or iliac crest. These options would also be possible sources for bone for late secondary grafting, as well as grafts from the mandibular symphysis and possibly the tibia.

Because the data suggest that grafting during the mixed dentition is ideal, discussion focuses on comparing various sources of graft material for this group of patients. The advantages and disadvantages of various potential sources of bone are outlined in Table 47.1.

# Iliac Crest

Potential advantages of the iliac crest bone graft include low morbidity and high volume of viable osteoblastic cells (cancellous bone); two teams may work simultaneously, and this procedure is well accepted by the patient.

Bone can be harvested from the iliac crest through various approaches. Some have suggested that a lateral approach is appropriate in the growing patient [38]. This procedure disrupts the iliotibial tract and has a higher incidence of gait disturbance and postoperative pain [39]. In theory, it may be appropriate to avoid the anterior crest, which does not complete its growth until after age 20 years [39]. However, the cartilaginous cap overlying the crest is reduced in thickness to about  $1\mathrm{cm}$  by age 9 years.

Adapted from Ochs [37]

Damage to the crest at this time could lead to disturbance in growth and cosmetic deformity of the crest; however, splitting the crest longitudinally, which allows access to the underlying cancellous marrow, has been used for harvest of bone in this age group with no reported growth alteration and less postoperative gait disturbance than with the lateral subcrestal approach [40, 41].

# Calvarial Bone

Calvarial bone has been recommended by some as an alternative to iliac crest grafting [42, 43]. Some authors have concerns about the potential for success when the calvarium is used as a graft source [44, 45]. This may be related to the technique of harvest. Bone grafts consisting of diploic bone have been shown to be more successful than those grafts harvested using a high-speed rotary device to shave off primarily cortical bone from the surface of the calvarium [45]. However, even when harvesting calvarial bone in such a way as to maximize diploic bone, results may not be as good as with iliac crest bone. In one study in which primarily diploic bone was carefully harvested from the calvarium, the results were still less successful (80% graft success) than with traditional iliac crest bone (93% graft success) [46]. It is likely that either source is effective as long as primarily diploic bone is used. This limitation may render calvaria as a less useful source for large clefts and bilateral clefts.

Calvarial grafts may have decreased morbidity compared with iliac crest harvest. There is less postoperative pain and no gait disturbance. Other potential advantages include decreased surgery time. Cranial bone grafts can be harvested more quickly than iliac crest grafts. If a single team is performing surgery, this may be significant. However, it is not possible to harvest the cranial graft simultaneously with the alveolar cleft repair. Grafting from the iliac crest if two teams are used can decrease overall operating time compared with calvarial grafting. Finally, the incision for graft harvest is hidden in the hairline, which may have a cosmetic advantage.

Grafting from the calvarium has potential disadvantages. There is a perceived increased risk by patients and their families, although several studies show that the morbidity of bone harvest from the calvaria is minimal [39]. As mentioned previously, the volume of diploic bone is limited, making this less predictable for large or bilateral clefts.

# Allogeneic Bone

In an effort to eliminate the morbidity and time necessary to harvest bone from any autogenous site, some authors have evaluated allogeneic bone as a potential source of graft material. Studies have shown that allogeneic bone can be used successfully to graft secondary alveolar cleft defects and that results can be compared favorably with those achieved with autogenous bone

[47]. However, the demands of bone healing in the alveolar defect where there is potential communication between the graft and the nasal and oral cavity may make this less predictable in large cleft defects or bilateral clefts. In general, bone healing with autogenous bone is biologically different than with allogeneic bone. Autogenous bone grafts initiate an angioblastic response early in the healing process, and some of the transplanted cells remain viable, resulting in a more rapid formation of new bone. In contrast, allogeneic bone grafts demonstrate slower revascularization, because no viable cells are transferred with the graft [47, 48]. There is also a theoretical risk of disease transmission from allogeneic sources of bone. Mathematically, the risk is quite small but may be of concern to patients and families.

# Recombinant Human Bone Morphogenic Protein-2

Recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is an attractive reconstructive option in the maxillofacial region. The potential benefits of avoiding a secondary surgical site and obtaining the same results as those with autogenous grafting have prompted surgeons to use the material in a variety of maxillofacial bony defects. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of rhBMP-2 for specific maxillofacial applications in adults but has conducted no research for its use in skeletally immature patients (INFUSE Bone Graft package insert, Medtronic).

The off-label use of rhBMP-2 for alveolar cleft grafting in skeletally immature patients with cleft lip and palate continues to be investigated in clinical trials [9, 11, 49]. In these trials, the investigators compared the results of cleft sites grafted with an autogenous iliac crest bone graft (AICBG) and sites grafted with rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS) in the same sample population. The mature bone volume obtained in both groups was measured by comparing pre- and postoperative CT scans. The cleft sites grafted with rhBMP-2 resulted in bone volume and density that was comparable with that in group grafted with autogenous bone in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. In addition, teeth erupted normally through these rhBMP-2-grafted sites. As expected, both the length of hospital stay and the amount of postoperative pain were less for those patients grafted with rhBMP-2 than for those grafted with an AICBG [9, 11]. As has been previously seen with the use of rhBMP-2 in the maxillofacial region, a few patients in each study developed severe swelling in the postoperative period that was not consistent with cellulitis and which resolved without intervention [9, 11].

The preparation of the cleft site for rhBMP-2 mirrors the technique used to prepare the site for a conventional bone graft. The buccal advancement flaps, palatal flaps, and nasal floor are developed followed by repair

of the nasal floor and palatal tissue. The absorbable collagen sponge is cut into small squares and soaked according to manufacturer's guidelines (INFUSE Bone Graft, Medtronic). After the sponge has soaked for the recommended time period, it is placed into the defect and the buccal flaps are advanced and the four-cornered flaps are closed.

The potential advantages of using rhBMP-2 are all related to eliminating a second surgical site. The patient will likely have a shorter hospital stay due to less postoperative pain. Gait and sensory disturbances can be completely avoided. Complications at a secondary surgical site are eliminated, and overall surgical time may be shortened. There are several potential disadvantages of using rhBMP-2 in the reconstruction of alveolar clefts. Although it resolves spontaneously, severe postoperative swelling that is unique to this material can be both worrisome to the patient as well as place tension across suture lines. In addition, the lack of structural integrity of the absorbable collagen sponge may lead to an unsupported ala [9]. In addition, the refining process to manufacture BMP is extremely expensive, which makes its routine use somewhat unlikely.

The clinical outcomes of using an AICBG or rhBMP-2 are similar in the amount and density of bone obtained as well as the ability to achieve dental eruption through the graft. Unfortunately, the use of rhBMP-2 makes this technique quite costly, and the material may not support the nasal soft tissues. At this point in time, it seems that even with the advantages that come with avoiding a secondary surgical site, the autogenous bone graft for the reconstruction of alveolar clefts continues to be the gold standard.

# 47.6 Pre-Versus Postsurgical Orthodontics

Controversy exists regarding the use of orthopedic expansion of the cleft segments and the relationship between expansion and grafting. This issue has not been

entirely settled. Most authors prefer presurgical expansion, citing easier expansion because of less resistance, improved access to the cleft for closure of the nasal floor, better postoperative hygiene, and less chance of reopening the oronasal fistula [27, 28]. Presurgical expansion may also allow orthopedic movement of the premaxillary segment in the bilateral cleft patient, which can eliminate traumatic occlusion that can negatively affect graft success. Proponents of expansion after grafting cite advantages of improved bone consolidation when the graft is placed under a dynamic load during healing, a smaller soft tissue defect to close, less difficulty in procuring an adequate volume of bone, and a narrower defect, which will regenerate bone more quickly [29]. Both approaches have been used in conjunction with autogenous grafting in the mixed-dentition stage with success [13].

In practice, both approaches are valid, and the decision should be based on individual clinical presentation [35]. Small unilateral clefts with collapse of the arch may be easier to graft with some presurgical expansion. In these cases, such expansion may not increase the size of the defect appreciably, and better alignment of the segments can improve hygiene of the teeth adjacent to the cleft and improve access (Fig. 47.3). In these cases, the end point of presurgical expansion is improved arch form, not necessarily resolution of crossbite. Bilateral clefts with collapse of the lateral segments may also benefit from presurgical expansion. Expanding the lateral segments may allow the premaxilla, which is often anteriorly positioned, to be brought back into better relation with the arch, improving arch form, and, in some cases, eliminating traumatic occlusion (Fig. 47.4). If this is not done before grafting, it may be difficult to obtain ideal arch continuity and positioning of the segments after grafting may be difficult. In patients with reasonable arch form, good alignment of the segments, and dental development corresponding to ideal timing for grafting, it makes little sense to delay grafting in order to expand preoperatively, even in the presence of a buccal

cross-bite. These crossbites may be related only to the anterior-posterior discrepancy, and even if they are truly representative of transverse deficiency, they can be treated easily with expansion after the graft. These clefts can be expanded without opening the oronasal fistula or having a negative effect on the graft.

Not only is there controversy regarding pre- versus postsurgical expansion, there are also two schools of thought regarding orthodontic movement of the erupted teeth adjacent to the cleft. Some authors suggest that aligning the teeth adjacent to the cleft produces better hygiene and an improved result [27]. However, orthodontic movement of teeth adjacent to the cleft is not typically desired [50]. Orthodontic movement of teeth adjacent to the cleft before grafting increases the risk of moving these teeth into the cleft site, compromising osseous support. Studies have directly correlated the success of grafting with the presence of adequate bone on the distal surface of the central incisor preoperatively [51]. These defects cannot subsequently be grafted because the bone graft will not adhere to the tooth surface. The central incisor adjacent to the cleft site is usually rotated and angled with the crown tipped toward the cleft. This rotation and angulation decreases the mesial-distal dimension of the tooth and allows for the best bony support of the tooth (see Fig. 47.2). Orthodontic forces of rotation and tipping will have the undesirable effect of increasing the mesial-distal dimension, encroaching on the bony support at the cementoenamel junction of the

tooth. Orthodontic root torque to correct the angulation of the tooth will have the undesired effect of pushing the apical portion of the root toward the cleft site. The underlying osseous cleft is frequently much larger than the overlying soft tissue defect may indicate, giving a false sense of security to the orthodontist who may want to move these teeth in the absence of a graft (Fig. 47.5).

# 47.7 Surgical Technique for Grafting the Cleft Alveolus

The ideal technique will meet the following criteria:

1. Predictable closure of the nasal floor produces a watertight barrier between the graft and the nasal cavity.  
2. There is access to closure of residual palatal and labial fistula.  
3. Keratinized attached tissue is maintained around the teeth adjacent to the cleft and in the site where the yet unerupted lateral incisor and canine will erupt.  
4. Mobilization of tissue is adequate to close large defects without tension, when such defects are present.  
5. The vestibule is not shortened, and scarring is not excessive.

Given these requirements, the technique most often used employs advancing buccal gingival and palatal flaps. This approach has some disadvantages including the following:

1. Difficulty obtaining closure in large bilateral clefts.  
2. Defects at the site of the releasing incision created by advancing the flap heal by secondary intention.  
3. A four-corner suture line that approximates the flaps directly overlying the graft, which may lead to dehiscence.  
4. The possibility that elevating large full-thickness mucoperiosteal flaps leads to growth alteration in young patients. However, when compared with finger flaps and trapezoidal flaps, which can shorten the vestibule and place nonkeratinized tissue around the dentition, this approach remains the best.

The procedure can be broken down as follows. The first step requires development of full-thickness mucoperiosteal buccal flaps (Fig. 47.6). Consideration may be given to a papilla preserving incision, but this is not required in the mixed dentition. Palatal flaps are then developed, incorporating whatever residual palatal defect may be present to allow for closure of the residual palatal fistula. Some diagrams show this incision being made from a palatal approach. This may be possible in wide clefts but, in practice, is more easily accomplished by starting reflection of the palatal flaps from a sulcular incision placed on the palatal side of the dentition followed by reflection of full-thickness palatal flaps toward the palatal defect. The palatal flaps can then be separated from the nasal tissue along the cleft margin by sharp dissection with scissors from the anterior extending posteriorly as the flaps are elevated (Fig. 47.7a). In this manner, the maximum palatal soft tissue is preserved for closure, while assuring adequate nasal mucosa to obtain a watertight nasal closure. Once the buccal and palatal flaps have been developed, access is readily obtained to the nasal mucosa, which is then reflected

and sutured, burying the knots to obtain a watertight nasal closure (see  $\square$  Fig. 47.7b and c). Most schematic diagrams of cleft closure show this portion of the procedure being performed from the palatal aspect. However, it is generally most readily accomplished in narrow clefts from the anterior through the cleft defect. Once the nasal mucosa is closed, the palatal defect is closed by first closing the palatal flaps, converting the cleft palate into a single flap (see  $\square$  Fig. 47.7d). The graft material is then placed into the cleft from the anterior, making certain to fill all voids completely to the piriform rim. Graft material can be condensed using an orthodontic band pusher or periosteal elevator (see  $\square$  Fig. 47.7e). It is helpful to place a malleable retractor to protect the nasal floor as the bone is packed into place. Finally, the labial flaps can be advanced, and they are sutured to each other and then to the palatal flap, producing the classic four-corner closure over the crest of the ridge (see  $\square$  Fig. 47.7f and g). In most cases, the sliding flaps will be advanced one papilla on either side of the cleft, or in some cases, only a single papilla advancement from the posterior segment is necessary. It may be necessary to perform a small backcut or to release or score the periosteum to obtain a tension-free closure. It is best to use a resorbable monofilament suture.

A palatal stent can be used to stabilize the cleft and protect the soft tissue closure. This may compromise hygiene and blood supply to the palatal flaps and, in most cases, is not required for success. In the bilateral cleft, if there is a traumatic occlusion to the anterior maxillary dentition, a mandibular bite plane is helpful to open the bite and prevent mobility of the premaxilla.

It is appropriate to use intraoperative antibiotics. Previous studies show that graft success and incidence of infection are not improved by the use of postoperative antibiotics [52]. Some surgeons feel more comfortable with a 1-week course of antibiotics, particularly when the soft tissue closure is questionable.

The postoperative diet should be limited to full liquids for approximately 5 days. This can be advanced to a soft mechanical diet. However, it is critical that the patient refrain from incising food with the anterior dentition; rather, the patient should cut food into small pieces and masticate primarily on the posterior teeth. In bilateral cases, this is particularly important because any trauma to the premaxilla will cause mobility of the segment, leading to graft failure. Radiographic evidence of graft consolidation should be visible within 8 weeks. The surgeon should confirm successful consolidation of the graft before any orthodontic manipulation of the teeth adjacent to the cleft.

# 47.8 Stepwise Approach to the Comprehensive Management of the Alveolar Cleft Patient

This chapter has outlined the historic benefits of grafting, discussed many of the controversies, and provided data on the benefits and disadvantages of several approaches.

The following is a stepwise approach to managing the alveolar cleft from one perspective:

1. At age 5-6 years, an orthodontic evaluation is performed. The ability of the patient to cooperate with orthodontic treatment is assessed, the arch is evaluated for collapse, and erupted supernumerary teeth in the area of the cleft are identified. Radiographic examination should include a panoramic film as well as an intraoral view that allows detailed evaluation of the cleft site. Periapical films can be used for this, but a lateral oblique occlusal film is best. An occlusal film is placed in the standard position while directing the beam obliquely to the midline along the long axis of the cleft (Fig. 47.8).  
2. If erupted supernumerary teeth are identified in the area of the cleft, these are extracted now or, at a minimum, 8 weeks before the graft (Fig. 47.9a).  
3. Orthodontic expansion is performed if there are specific goals that can be met before grafting. These would include decreasing traumatic occlusion to the premaxillary segment in bilateral cleft patients and correcting arch collapse that will compromise grafting. No attempt is made to correct the crossbite at this stage, and there is no attempt to orthodontically correct rotation of the permanent central incisor (see Fig. 47.9a).  
4. The alveolar cleft is grafted when the patient is between 6 and 8 years of age. Two teams perform the surgery with graft harvest from the iliac crest simultaneous with the cleft closure.  
5. The graft is evaluated with a lateral oblique occlusal radiograph 3 months after surgery (see Fig. 47.9b).  
6. Final orthodontic expansion is performed if indicated, and permanent incisor teeth are then rotated into proper alignment.

beam obliquely to the midline, along the long axis of the cleft. Note that the morphology of the cleft is better identified, as is the relationship of unerupted teeth to the defect

7. Conventional orthodontic treatment is performed at a more traditional age, after eruption of the remaining permanent dentition. Patients are periodically monitored for eruption of the canine in the cleft. Some authors have indicated that in  $30\%$  to  $73\%$  of patients, eruption of the canine into the alveolar graft requires surgical uncovering of the tooth or uncovering and orthodontic assistance [16, 53, 54]. Others have reported that nearly all of these teeth can be expected to erupt without surgical intervention [28] (see Fig. 47.9c). If uncovering is necessary, techniques to preserve attached tissue are used

as would be appropriate for impacted canines in noncleft patients.

8. Missing lateral incisors are managed with space development and implant placement as opposed to canine substitution. This is accomplished after definitive orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery, if indicated, after maxillary growth is complete. Even when bone height is adequate and teeth adjacent to the graft have good support, the graft undergoes resorption, resulting in a narrow ridge. This is not unlike the bone resorption found with congenitally absent lateral incisors in noncleft

patients. Successful implant restoration is possible, but further grafting is likely needed before adequate labial-palatal width is available for implant placement [34] (Fig. 47.10). Attention to soft and hard tissues is critical in these patients to achieve aesthetic results.

# Conclusion

Restoration of the cleft alveolus and maxilla by grafting is a critical part of the overall management of the patient with cleft palate. A systematic approach can improve predictability. This is best accomplished during the mixed-dentition stage and with an autogenous bone graft. Clinical outcomes can be evaluated with two-dimensional imaging. Adjunctive expansion may be accomplished before or after grafting depending on the needs of the patient.
