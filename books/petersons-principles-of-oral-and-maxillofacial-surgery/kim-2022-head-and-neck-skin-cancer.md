3. There are variety of management principles and surgical methods for the different types of skin cancers.  
4. Multiple methods of reconstruction of the skin cancer defects are available.  
5. As with any surgery, complications exist with the ablation and the reconstruction.

# 36.1 Introduction

One in five Americans will develop skin cancer by age 70 [1]. An estimated one million new lesions are diagnosed each year in United States alone [2], which equates to around 9500 people being diagnosed with a new skin cancer every single day. As one may conjecture, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer afflicting humankind.

Skin cancer is broadly grouped into two categories: nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. NMSC accounts for  $95\%$  of all skin cancers. Melanoma, of which around  $25\%$  occurs in the head and neck region, encompasses the remaining  $5\%$  [3-5]. Yet, melanoma, even with this low incidence is responsible for about  $75\%$  of skin cancer-related deaths. The overall mortality for NMSC is relatively low, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of  $95\%$  [6, 7]. All skin cancers may be locally aggressive, leading to significant morbidity, disfigurement, loss of function, and high healthcare costs [8]. This chapter outlines a comprehensive yet succinct overview of skin cancer from the epidemiology, etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Over the past decade, novel increments in care have yielded better results. Routine use of magnifying dermoscopy augments the success rate of margin excision by identification of deeper tumor spread, before excision. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy have added years to patients with melanoma metastasis. Mohs' excisions have proved beneficial in some thin melanomas. Delayed closures, as opposed to OR excision and immediate closure, with permanent margin assessment have proved their worth in reduced recurrences.

# 36.2 Background

A discussion about skin cancer cannot be complete without the discussion of the anatomy of the largest organ in our body: the skin. It is composed of two layers, epidermis and dermis. The epidermis is composed

of four distinct layers, from superficial to deep: stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. The epidermis turns over every 30 days, and epidermis contains four types of cells: keratinocytes, Langerhans cell, melanocytes, and Merkel cells. The NMSCs include basal cell carcinoma (BCC;  $75\%$  of NMSCs), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC;  $20\%$  of NMSCs), and a few rarer malignancies, such as Merkel cell tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and adnexal tumors ( $5\%$  of NMSCs) [6].

Langerhans' cells are antigen-presenting cells which capture and process antigens and present them to skin-specific lymphocytes. Aging and significant sun exposure both lessen the total number of Langerhans' cells. This is one partial explanation for the increase of skin neoplasms in the elderly, in addition to cumulative sun exposure [9]. Melanocytes are of neural crest origin and are found in the basal layer. Melanocytes produce melanin, which in turn protects the DNA damage of the skin cells from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. As with Langerhans' cells, numbers of melanocytes decrease with age, which may be an additional explanation for more skin cancers developing as we get older [10, 11]. This number of melanocytes is constant between different races, however, and pigmentation difference is explained by the activity of the melanocytes. For example, melanocyte activity in darkly pigmented skin is higher than in light-colored skin. This distinction is categorized by the Fitzpatrick skin types. It is important to note this categorization was not developed for purpose of evaluation skin cancer risk (Table 36.1).

The dermis, situated between the epidermis and the subcutaneous fat, adheres to the epidermis at the basement membrane. The basement membrane mechanically supports the epidermis and acts as a mechanical barrier, such as against UV rays. Although UV light does not penetrate the body deeper than the skin, it may be absorbed by different layers, depending on the wavelength of the UV light. Dermis also houses a rich nerve supply of the skin. Meissner's corpuscles, located in the papillary dermis, provide fine-touch sensation. Pacinian corpuscles, located in the deeper subcutaneous tissue, mediate deep pressure and vibratory sensation. Autonomic efferent nerves innervate blood vessels and appendageal structures. Hair-bearing skin is commonly referred to as nonglabrous and smooth non-hair-bearing skin as glabrous.

Skin conditions vary between individuals and from region to region in terms of mobility, color, scars, Fitzpatrick type, texture, thickness, and adnexal structures [12]. These characteristics should be considered when planning for excision as well as reconstruction.

The blood supply to the skin serves two functions: nutrition and thermal regulation. Two major routes of blood supply exist—musculocutaneous and septocutaneous arteries [13]. The musculocutaneous system traverses the muscle and enters the subcutaneous tissue in a random pattern (the basis for random skin flaps) through the subdermal plexus. The superficial vascular plexus, located in the reticular dermis, provides the capillary loops in the dermal papillae. The deeper vascular plexus, or subdermal plexus, lies between the dermis and the subcutaneous fat. A septocutaneous vessel travels through the septal fascia and courses parallel to the skin surface with an accompanying vein. Named septocutaneous vessels (e.g., supratrochlear) provide an axially based flap with a rich blood supply. Understanding the fascial vascular network, also known as angiosomes, is crucial in reconstruction and creating flaps that are predictable.

# 36.3 Epidemiology

Incidence data for the United States should be interpreted with some skepticism, because most NMSCs are treated in outpatient clinics or private offices and are not routinely reported to cancer registries, thus likely underestimating the incidence [4]. Skin cancers in general have taken an upward trend in terms of incidence, likely due to recreational UV exposure. For example, it is estimated that among Medicare patients incidence of procedures for NMSC increased around  $77\%$  from 1999-2006, and continues to increase. In the United

States, 1 in 5 people aged 70 years or older is diagnosed with NMSC [1].

Epidemiologic studies demonstrate a positive correlation between UV radiation exposure and the incidence of NMSC as well as melanoma. Thus, NMSC is predominantly a white ethnicity disease  $(= 98\%)$  but does occur in black or African American and Hispanics [4]. The risk of developing NMSC increases the closer one lives to the equator and the more one's outdoor activities increase the concentration of sun exposure through reflection [14, 15]. Examples of the reflection exposure include work around snow, water, cement, and roofing.

For all races,  $75\%$  of NMSCs appear on body areas most chronically exposed to sunlight, such as the head, face, neck, and dorsum of the hands [6]. The incidence of BCC and SCC at early ages is comparable for men and women, but men older than 45 years have a  $3\mathrm{x}$  greater incidence of NMSC, specifically SCC, than women [16, 17]. In men, common sites are the ears and nose, whereas in women, the nose and lower extremities are most common.

The incidence of NMSC had been increasing for decades, with current estimated  $5\%$  a year. The mortality rate, however, has recently leveled off and is now beginning to decrease, perhaps owing to public information programs [18]. Overall, NMSC has an excellent prognosis, but approximately 2000 deaths occur annually,  $75\%$  of which are from metastatic SCC [19, 20].

# Key Points

$\sim 75\%$  of skin cancer-related deaths are from melanoma  $\sim 75\%$  of NMSC skin cancers are BCC  
$\sim 75\%$  of NMSC appear on body areas most chronically exposed to sunlight  
$\sim 75\%$  of NMSC deaths annually are from metastatic SCC

# 36.3.1 Basal Cell Carcinoma

Typically, patients with BCC are Fitzpatrick types 1-3 with a history of sun exposure.  $80 - 93\%$  of the BCC occur on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck, and  $26 - 30\%$  of that occur on the nose [21]. Death from BCC is rare, with a rate of metastasis of  $0.0028 - 0.1\%$ . Size, depth of invasion, and histologic type are important predictors for metastasis [16]. Common sites of metastasis include regional lymph nodes, liver, lung, bone, and skin. This rare metastasis is  $2\times$  as common in males as in females [22].

# 36.3.2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma

SCC is the second most common skin cancer and accounts for  $20\%$  of all NMSC cases. The lifetime risk of developing SCC is  $4 - 14\%$ , and the incidence has

increased by  $20\%$  in the past decade alone [17, 23, 24]. Men with a fair complexion who are older than 50 years and have had heavy sun exposure in the recent years typically get multiple actinic keratoses (AK) and SCCs. The location of the primary lesion influences the rate of recurrence and metastasis. SCCs occurring on the lip, ear, melolabial crease, and periorbital and preauricular areas have higher rates of recurrence and metastasis  $(10 - 14\%)$  [24, 25]. The most common precursor for SCC is actinic keratosis. The rate of transformation of AK to SCC is 1 in 1000 per year [25]. Approximately  $40\%$  of people older than 40 years have had at least one AK. A patient with a prior history of NMSC has a  $36 - 52\%$  5-year risk of another cancer [26, 27].

# 36.3.3 Melanoma

The incidence of melanoma is increasing faster than any other cancer. It is estimated that the frequency of melanoma will double every 10-15 years, and that more than 9000 new cases of melanoma of the head and neck will be diagnosed this year in the United States alone [8, 28, 29]. Similar to NMSC, melanoma occurrence increases the closer one's residence is to the equator, and the majority involve the skin of cheek, scalp and neck. An estimated 1 in 75 people will be diagnosed with melanoma in their lifetime, with 1 in 4 of these people diagnosed before the age of 40 [30]. Melanoma accounts for more than three times more deaths than the combined fatalities from all other skin malignancies [31].

# 36.4 Etiology

The etiology of skin cancer is multifactorial but can be broadly categorized into host-related and environmental causes. Host factors include an individual's phenotype, genetic syndromes, precursor lesions, and immunologic issues. Environmental variables include exposure to UV radiation, ionizing radiation, and chemicals [3]. General pathophysiology of skin cancers are outlined below.

# 36.4.1 Host Factors

Tanning is the body's defense mechanism. One's ability to tan is directly related to the amount of melanin in the skin, which is genetically determined and cannot be influenced, except decreasing with age. Skin melanin determines a person's photosensitivity. The more melanin an individual has, the less damage UV radiation inflicts. Deleterious effects of UV radiation are attenuate by the presence of melanin.

ated by the stratum corneum via refraction, reflection, and direct absorption by melanin.

Fitzpatrick [32] group was categorized based on the results of 30 minutes of direct sunlight to the skin in the northern hemisphere. The groups are based on the amount of melanin an individual possesses, inherent pigmentation, and sensitivity to UV light. For example, a person in type 1 is the classic freckle-faced, light-eyed redhead who burns and never tans, a Celtic type. People in type 1 are highly susceptible to skin cancer but also heals well from reconstruction wounds with the least perceptible scar. Remarkably, as resistance to skin cancer increases, scarification becomes more obvious, often pigmenting or forming keloids.

# 36.4.2 Syndromes

Genetics plays a role in determining who gets skin cancer. Furthermore, several syndromes predispose a person to skin cancer:

Basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin's syndrome) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple BCCs, odontogenic keratocysts, bifid ribs, palmar and plantar pits, calcification of the falx cerebri, and hypertelorism. The BCCs that are produced look like small nevi (Fig. 36.1) but act just like common nodular BCC.  
Xeroderma pigmentosa is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in defects in repair of DNA. UV radiation results in skin DNA damage; therefore, xeroderma pigmentosa is characterized by hypersensitivity to sun exposure and the development of multiple skin cancers. Children with this disorder must modify their lifestyles to function as night people. Albinism is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in the absence of melanin with a subsequent increase in development of skin cancer, especially SCC.  
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It results in the development of BCC from flat warts in sun-exposed areas in homozygous individuals infected with human papillomavirus type 3 or 5.

# 36.4.3 Predisposing Lesions

Several congenital and acquired lesions predispose to skin cancer:

Adults with more than 100 clinically normal appearing nevi, children with more than 50 clinically normal nevi, and any patients with atypical or dysplastic nevi are at risk of melanoma.

- Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn is a well-circumscribed, slightly raised, hairless lesion on the scalp or face present at birth that becomes verrucous and nodular during puberty. Approximately  $10\%$  of such lesions undergo malignant transformation to BCC (Fig. 36.2).

- Actinic keratosis (AK), also known as solar or senile keratosis, is the most common precancerous lesion of the epidermis. AK is characterized by red, yellow, brown, or colorless macules or papules with scaly irregular surfaces, ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Left untreated, there is a

10–13% risk of malignant transformation of AK to SCC (Fig. 36.3); therefore, the American Academy of Dermatology recommends treatment [33–36]. All suspicious lesions should undergo biopsy.

Cutaneous horns are hard keratotic growths that protrude from the skin. Histologically, they are advanced AK. Approximately  $10\%$  of these lesions have an underlying SCC [37].

# 36.4.4 Immunologic Factors

Immunosuppression predisposes a person to several types of cancers including skin cancer. Immunosuppression alters the immune surveillance mechanism that typically destroys potentially malignant cells [4]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, lymphoproliferative disease, occult malignancy, organ transplantation, and a variety of other medical conditions result in immunosuppression. However, most studies suggest that some other risk factor such as ionizing radiation or viral infection, along with a decreased immune system, is necessary for the development of these tumors in this subset of patients [4, 38].

# 36.4.5 Environmental Factors

Ionizing radiation, certain chemicals, and skin damage from the environment can also cause skin cancer. UV radiation has been noted as the primary environmental culprit. There are three types of UV radiation: UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (290–320 nm), and UVC (200–280 nm). UVB rays are the most carcinogenic, triggering skin cancer via photochemical damage to DNA, injury to DNA repair mechanisms, and partial suppression of cell-mediated immunity [6, 39]. UVA, originally thought to be harmless, is now known to enhance the effects of UVB as a cocarcinogen [4]. Most UVC is filtered out by the ozone layer. As the ozone layer thins on Earth, UVC enhances the development of skin cancer. The most common historic reports for NMSC as well as melanoma are  $2 \times -3 \times$  childhood blistering sunburns or 3 years or more of intense sun exposure.

There are two methods of tanning used in tanning parlors. The method using UVA light enhances new skin cancers [39]. Skin cancers are described even in teenagers who have used tanning parlors. There is correlation of increased risk associated with early age of first use as well as cumulative amount of use. The "California" spray tan, a skin dye that lasts for 3-5 weeks, does not cause skin cancer.

# 36.5 Prevention

Although a doctor may be capable of treating skin cancer effectively, the informed patient is the greatest resource against the development of new cancers. Preventive measures can be classified into three types: sunscreens, clothing, and education. Sun protection is rated by sun protection factor (SPF). The SPF is a ratio of the smallest amount of radiation needed to produce erythema on protected skin compared with the same degree of redness produced on unprotected skin. Sunscreens function either chemically or physically.

Chemical sunscreens reduce UV skin penetration by absorbing solar rays. Physical sunscreens include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and kaolin. It is important to note patients should be told that the application of SPF 30 does not eliminate the need for behavioral modification. For example, a farmer who applies SPF 30 at the start of the day will have the protection wear off shortly after a few hours of sweating.

Contrary to common belief, clothing, especially summer clothing, may provide only minimal protection and a wet T-shirt has an SPF of 0-1 [40]. A darker colored clothing and long clothing do offer better protection, and specifically sun protective clothing with UV protection factor  $>50$ , are available. In addition, sun protection behaviors may play a better role, which includes staying indoors during midday sun, using an umbrella, avoiding tanning, and seeking shade. However, shades can decrease direct exposure, but indirect via reflection is still considered significant.

Education can include methods mentioned above, but also can include self-examination and early detection with a medical provider. This is especially true for those with fair skin or history of skin cancer, and can include total body skin examination, which yields high sensitivity around  $90\%$  for detecting skin cancer.

# 36.6 Diagnosis

# 36.6.1 Biopsy

Regardless of the obvious appearance of some cancers, a biopsy should be performed for histologic confirmation. The histologic characteristics influence clinical behavior, recurrence, and metastatic potential. Determination of margin size for tumor clearance should be based on a compilation of all available information.

Biopsy techniques vary widely between surgeons. Any technique that delivers adequate histologic material for diagnosis is acceptable. Shave biopsy with a scalpel or curved razor blade is simple. Shave biopsy leaves a  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  saucer-shaped defect, removing epidermis and some dermis. The only drawback to shave biopsy is that histologic and prognostic features may be deeper than the shave. Thus, a shave biopsy might potentially be so superficial as to limit pathologic differentiation between an in situ and an invasive lesion.

Punch biopsy garners a full-thickness specimen. The punch has a circular cutting edge, which is pushed and turned into a suspicious lesion. The punched-out defect may be sutured or may heal secondarily. Punch biopsies are worthwhile for melanoma in which depth discernment is critical. However, some critics note that for superficial lesions, you may transfer tumor deeper into the tissue.

Incisional and excisional biopsies are well known to surgeons. Deciding whether to use one versus the other revolves around whether the diagnosis is obvious (e.g., a dysplastic nevus in a patient with a history of them), the tumor size, and whether a small biopsy will influence the excision clearance margin. When indicated, excisional biopsies should be oriented with sutures or dye for tumor margin clearance.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may also be used to obtain specimens for histologic examination of deep material. FNA is worthwhile to differentiate a dermal cyst from a parotid tumor in the periauricular region. With FNA, the surgeon aspirates tissue with a 23- or 25-gauge needle and stains and fixes the material on a glass slide or placed in a solution to be sent to a pathologist. It is particularly useful when the clinical question is to rule in or rule out malignancy, and in skin cancer, useful when parotid or cervical masses are detected in the nodal basin.

# 36.6.2 Basal Cell Carcinoma

BCCs can be divided into several subtypes: superficial, noduloulcerative (or nodular), pigmented, sclerosing, mixed infiltrative, micronodular, morphheaform, and basosquamous.

Superficial BCC represents approximately  $10\%$  of all BCCs (Fig. 36.4) [41]. They present as slightly elevated plaques or discrete macules that may be scaly. They can resemble eczema or fungal infections.  
Noduloulcerative BCC is the most common type, accounting for approximately  $75\%$  of all BCCs (see Fig. 36.4) [41]. Clinically, they present as well-defined translucent pearly nodules that are either round or oval with rolled borders and occasional ulcerations. Telangiectasia are commonly seen coursing through the lesion.  
- Pigmented BCCs range from brown to blue-black and can be mistaken for melanoma. Morpheaform BCCs present as firm plaques that are yellow or white with an ill-defined border. They can be quite large and do not show more than  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  elevation. This tumor is likely to have positive margins after excision.  
- Basosquamous carcinomas have both basal and squamous cell differentiations. They have a higher growth rate as well as a higher metastatic potential than do other BCCs.  
Micronodular, infiltrative, and morpheaform BCCs are the more aggressive variants of BCC and together account for  $10\%$  of BCCs [8].

High-risk pathologic subtypes, noted with more aggressive growth pattern, includes the morphheaform, basosquamous, sclerosing, mixed infiltrative, and micronodular.

# 36.6.3 Squamous Cell Carcinoma

SCC presents as a painless poorly defined erythematous nodule with raised borders (Fig. 36.5). Cutaneous horns or a hyperkeratotic crust with ulcerations may be present. The surrounding skin may reveal signs of chronic sun damage. Unlike BCC, SCC may grow rapidly and metastasize. Metastasis is most common in lesions greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  deep. The cumulative rate of metastasis is between  $2\%$  and  $6\%$ , and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic SCC is only  $34\%$  [17, 24]. Thus adjuvant treatment is commonly recommended for metastatic squamous cell skin cancer to the parotid or cervical lymph nodes. Metastasis can occur either through the lymphatics or by hematogenous spread, with common sites being the regional lymph nodes, the lungs, and the liver.

Keratoacanthoma is commonly confused with SCC, both clinically and histologically. Keratoacanthoma is a self-healing raised growth lesion with a central keratin-filled plug. It grows quickly but often spontaneously involutes after 2-6 months, leaving only a depressed white scar.

Bowen's disease is an in situ SCC presenting as a slow-growing erythematous scaling plaque with an irregular but sharp outline. These lesions rarely transform into invasive SCC.

SCC may evolve from chronically unhealed or unstable wounds, burn scars, or ulcers. These lesions, sometimes called Marjolin's ulcers, have a  $20\%$  higher rate of lymph node metastasis than does UV-induced SCC [28, 30].

# 36.6.4 Melanoma

The mnemonic ABCDE is useful in categorizing the characteristics of melanomas: asymmetry, border irregularity, color changes or variation, diameter of lesion (< or  $>6\mathrm{mm}$ ), evolving lesion. The practitioner should not place the patient under casual observation (i.e., not perform a biopsy) just because these common indicators might be absent. Approximately  $40\%$  of board-certified dermatologists and more than  $50\%$  of other clinicians do not identify melanoma correctly by clinical intuition alone. Furthermore, a subset of melanomas (amelanotic, desmoplastic, nodular) lack the common features in ABCDE physical examination. Other suspicious factors include pink color in dark lesion and persistent itching.

Melanoma in situ is an intraepithelial lesion that can progress to an invasive lesion. When it is still in the epithelium, it is described as being in a horizontal growth phase, but when it invades dermis and approximates blood vessels, it progresses in a vertical growth phase and thickens. Hence, deeper melanomas are deadlier. Histopathologically, melanoma presents as a prolifera-

tion of atypical melanocytes. The tumor originates at the epidermal-dermal junction, where melanocytes reside. The cells then invade upward into the epidermis or extend downward into the dermis.

Melanomas are categorized into four main clinical and histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, and acral-lentiginous melanoma. Superficial spreading melanoma accounts for  $70\%$  of all melanomas. Clinically, superficial spreading melanoma is a flat or slightly elevated dark lesion with asymmetrical borders; it can be present for up to 5 years before invasion of the dermis.

Nodular melanoma is the second most common variant, accounting for  $15 - 30\%$  of melanomas. It appears as a raised black, brown, blue, or red nodule, perhaps with ulcerations, bleeding, or crusting. It may look just like a BCC, but contrary to BCC, the lesion grows rapidly over a few months. Approximately  $5\%$  of nodular melanomas lack pigmentation and are pinkish "amelanotic" melanomas. Nodular melanomas are thicker and metastasize rapidly.

Lentigo maligna melanoma accounts for  $4 - 10\%$  of melanomas. It arises in sun-exposed areas and occurs in the elderly.

Acral-lentiginous melanoma accounts for  $2 - 8\%$  of all melanomas in whites but is the most common type in African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. Clinically, they present as pigmented lesions frequently at the soles or palms and has irregular borders. Papules and nodules are frequently seen within the lesion.

Biopsy is the only fail-safe method to prove or disprove melanoma. If melanoma is suspected, incisional and excisional biopsies are much more diagnostic and prognostic than is a shave biopsy. Regardless, if a shave biopsy is performed and melanoma returns as the diagnosis, the next step is to obtain a full-thickness specimen (via punch or incisional biopsy) to ascertain the diagnosis and confirm true depth. Neither incisional nor excisional biopsy disseminates tumor in our experience.

# 36.7 Treatment

Once the pathologic diagnosis of skin cancer is confirmed, the surgeon plans for tumor destruction/ ablation by correlating tumor characteristics with patient's age, skin history, medical history, social history, and cosmetic expectations. Treatment options might include liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, standard excision, Mohs' micrographic surgery (MMS), radiation, curettage and electrodessication (C&E), topical chemotherapy, laser ablation, photodynamic therapy, interferon, and retinoids. We review most of these options below.

cial SCCs or BCCs, which may be treated by other modalities [42]. Excision may be done under local anesthesia or in the outpatient surgery setting. Tables 36.2, 36.3, and 36.4 outline acceptable margins for clearing most lesions.

The lesion and indicated margin for clearance are outlined with a marking pen. Local anesthesia with epinephrine does not affect pathologic margin assessment but may reduce the surgeon's ability to monitor vascularity to an adjacent random flap. In the cases of BCC and AK, preexcision curettage delineates tumor margins more accurately. Some BCCs, morphemaform and infiltrative, may not be as curetable, but the BCCs that are curetable have a  $25\%$  higher chance of being cleared with the first excision than if excised without curettage (Fig. 36.6) [42].

Ideally, specimens should be examined histologically on the entire lateral and deep margin. Circumstances may reduce the likelihood of this beneficial extensive evaluation. For example, frozen histologic evaluations (while the patient is under anesthesia in the operating room) are often three to four representative "loaf-ofbread" slices. You can imagine how much time would be consumed should the pathologist section and examine a large tumor in total [3]. To abrogate the inherent limitations of frozen sections, many surgeons routinely delay reconstruction until after all margins are cleared by permanent histology or send the patient to a specialist in Mohs' Micrographic Surgery (MMS.)

Histologic features, such as the degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, lymphovascular invasion, perineural involvement, as well as tumor size are prognostic indicators that may dictate the surgical margin width. Typically, more differentiated lesions have a lower invasive tendency and, hence, a better prognosis. Larger tumors and those that invade deeply along tissue planes have a greater risk of recurrence and metastasis. Tumors greater than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  have a twofold increase in recurrence rate and are three times more likely to metastasize. Tumors arising in scars or wounds are usually more aggressive and have a metastatic rate between  $18\%$  and  $38\%$  [8]. With SCC, the first shot at cure is crucial because recurrent SCCs have a metastatic rate of  $24 - 45\%$ ; if they metastasize, the 5-year survival rate is approximately  $34 - 50\%$  [8, 17, 24].

Permanent histopathology review after office excision and subsequent delayed reconstruction provides benefits to surgeon and patient alike. Office excision allows the patient to visualize the extent of the defect and to add input into personal reconstructive desires and expectations. The surgeon has the option to research effective methods of reconstruction away from the operating room and to subsequently go to the operating room with a plan. Then the patient will know, before the surgery, exactly where the scars will be located. Delayed reconstruction has been proved beneficial for patients receiving skin grafts, because the delay eliminates the potential for hematoma and may allow buildup of a more proud granulation base.

MMS offers the same "delayed" opportunity. The patient's entire tumor is resected before reconstruction, which may be performed the same day or delayed, often up to a week later. The only surgical difference between immediate (within 24 hr.) and delayed reconstruction  $(\geq 48$  hr.) is that the defects reconstructed later require margins to be refreshed, circumferentially excised for  $0.5 - 1\mathrm{mm}$ . Debris may also need to be cureted from the base. Regardless, this step-by-step delayed technique is almost painless and does not foster infection (Fig. 36.7) [43, 44]. Antibiotics are not necessary.

# 36.7.2 Mohs' Micrographic Surgery (MMS)

MMS is based on two principles: (1) most tumors spread by contiguous growth and (2) all tumor cells must be excised for cure. Dermatologist Frederic E. Mohs, MD, originated his method in the 1930s and published results in 1941. Mohs' technique evaluates the entire circumference and deep margins after frozen sections. Unlike the representative bread loaf method, in which the pathologist might suggest further removal of an entire positive superior margin of the tumor, Mohs' technique pinpoints the actual location of tumor extension. Identified tumor extensions are re-excised and re-scrutinized until the tumor is totally removed. Hence, MMS is more predictable for total cure, and tissue sparing as well [45-47].

For a 1 cm noduloulcerative BCC, Mohs' technique proceeds as follows: the lesion is debulked with a curette and then excised with a  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  margin angled at 45 degrees toward the center of the tumor. The specimen is

anatomically oriented, subdivided into numbered color-coded sections, and mapped. Mapped segments are pressed flat on their freshly cut border, frozen, and sectioned so that the entire fresh border is visualized, and so on.

Over the years we have noted certain limitations to Mohs' technique, such as overconservative treatment for some aggressive tumors. This deficiency, not inherent in Mohs' technique, is proved by the fact that not all microscopic extensions are visible to the human eye; therefore, even tumors excised with Mohs' techniques may recur. As a result, a large SCC of the scalp is better served with an aggressive non-Mohs' excision, in our experience.

# Key Points

Even tumors excised with Mohs' Techniques may recur, and large SCC may be better served with aggressive non-Mohs' excision.

anesthesia.

No scabs should form.

The cure rates for primary BCCs less than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  treated with MMS approach  $99\%$ , compared to  $90 - 95\%$  by routine pathologic examination [47, 48]. Standard vertical bread loaf sections evaluate less than  $1\%$  of the surgical margins. Recurrent BCC cure rates range from  $94\%$  to  $96\%$  with MMS versus  $85\%$  with other modalities [47, 48]. For primary SCC, MMS boasts a cure rate from  $94\%$  to  $99\%$  as opposed to  $90\%$  for non-Mohs' techniques [25, 45, 49]. Recurrent SCC cure rates with MMS approach  $90\%$  as opposed to  $76\%$  for other treatment modalities [45].

Under these circumstances, MMS is indicated for the treatment of recurrent BCCs, histologically difficult BCCs (i.e., micronodular, infiltrative, and morphheaform), and BCCs in which conservation of tissue is critical (e.g., on the nose, lip, ear). For SCCs, MMS might be indicated for lower lip cancer, some poorly differentiated

SCCs, and areas in which maximum tissue preservation is essential [8].

# 36.7.3 Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy (RT) has been mentioned for treatment of skin malignancies for almost a century, but currently it plays a role as an adjunctive or salvage measure and rarely a curative role. The advantage of radiation is preservation of normal tissue next to the irradiation site. RT might, therefore, be considered for the lip, nose, and ear. Unfortunately, RT conveys some unwanted potential side effects: cutaneous erythema, necrosis, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, atrophy, fibrosis, hair loss, delayed healing, and risk of the development of future NMSCs when administered in younger patients [50].

RT of tumors less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  has a cure rate of  $90\%$  and  $85\%$  to  $95\%$  for BCC and SCC, respectively [51, 52]. However, larger lesions have a much lower success rate. For melanoma, local recurrence rates of up to  $50\%$  have been reported [53]. Thus, RT for melanoma is a viable option only for medically compromised patients who cannot withstand surgery or for patients who refuse surgery.

# 36.7.4 Cryosurgery

Cryosurgery destroys skin cancers and some adjacent tissue by freezing. Cryosurgery cure rates for AK, BCC, SCC, and lentigo maligna melanoma range from  $94\%$  to  $99\%$  [54, 55]. Liquid nitrogen may be sprayed on the lesion directly or through a cryoprobe. Rapid freezing of the treated skin occurs as heat is transferred from the skin to the probe. Intracellular ice crystals form, and cell membranes disrupt as the temperature is lowered to  $-50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $-60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . When thawing occurs, electrolytes recrystallize, resulting in vascular stasis and local alterations in the microcirculation, thus producing further tissue damage [3, 56].

Most doctors freeze lesions plus a  $4 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  margin to account for tumor extension. Freeze-thaw cycles may be repeated for maximal effect. Healing occurs by secondary intention, with a flat hypopigmented scar.

The side effects of cryosurgery include pain, erythema, edema, blistering, exudation, and scarring. This technique is inexpensive, and there are no costs for pathology. Hence, a lesion chosen for cryotherapy should be relatively small and well demarcated.

# 36.7.5 Curettage and Electrodesiccation (C&E)

C&E is a cost-effective but technique-sensitive therapy of NMSC. The lesion and adjacent area is cleaned with alcohol, outlined with a provisional margin by a skin marker, and anesthetized. The lesion is curetted aggressively with the skin tensed, then electrodecciation (hyfrecation) for hemostasis and adjacent tissue destruction occurs. This cycle may be repeated three to five times. Typically, it is not recommended to perform this in areas of hair-bearing areas such as scalp. If during curettage, if subdermal fat is reached, surgical excision is recommended.

The major advantage to C&E is the speed, fostering treatment of multiple lesions within a single visit. Disadvantages include prolonged healing, often weeks depending on size and care, hypopigmentation, and possibly hypertrophic scar. Material from curettage may be sent for initial pathology, but margin control for C&E is not possible (unless curettage is used as a precursor to excisional pathology).

The clinician's experience and the tumor's anatomic site and size are prognostic factors limiting success after C&E. BCCs less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  have an  $8.5\%$  recurrence rate after C&E by an experienced clinician [57]. Lesions of the nose, ear, and perioral and periocular areas may recur at a rate of  $16\%$ . This rate soars to  $26\%$  for lesions larger than  $20\mathrm{mm}$  [57]. Therapeutic C&E is, therefore, contraindicated for larger lesions, poorly differentiated SCCs, or melanoma.

# 36.7.6 Topical Chemotherapy

Topical 5-FU or  $5\%$  imiquimod medically eliminates surface lesions. Retinoids are occasionally used concurrently. 5-FU is a thymine analog that interferes with DNA synthesis causing cell death by acting as an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. Imiquimod induces production of interferon-alfa and messenger RNA cytokines. Application of 5-FU is recommended twice daily for 2-3 weeks for superficial AK and for 3-6 weeks for more diffuse worrisome lesions. Imiquimod is applied only three times per week but is much more expensive than 5-FU. Cure rates with 5-FU and imiquimod range from  $92\%$  for SCC in situ, and  $95\%$  for superficial BCC and AK [3, 58].

Patients need to be warned that there is an inflammatory reaction during topical therapy, but the cosmetic outcome is usually very good as long as compliance is nurtured.

# 36.7.7 Lasers

The CO2 laser focuses a beam of light with a wavelength of  $10,600\mathrm{nm}$ . Laser light is absorbed by water and nonselectively vaporizes the skin. The CO2 laser can be used as a cutting instrument (in the focused mode) to excise, or to ablate lesions (in a defocused mode) such as multiple AKs, superficial BCCs, and SCCs. We have found its greatest benefit in ablation of superficial AKs and superficial SCCs, both on the skin and the lower lips. Presurgical skin preparation with retinoids may foster more rapid healing. We have not prescribed preoperative antibiotics or antivirals for small localized areas but is recommended when large areas of the face are treated.

# 36.7.8 Photodynamic Therapy

Photodynamic therapy is not widely accepted for skin cancer therapy but has been applied to lung, breast, colon, and bladder cancers. Aminolevulinic acid is wiped on a lesion; it is metabolized in cancer cells to produce porphyrins, which act as photosensitizers. After 4-6 hours, the area is irradiated with visible light from a

laser or noncoherent light source. Reactive O2 species are generated within the cells producing cell death [59].

Cure rates for photodynamic therapy for AKs, superficial SCCs, and BCCs are reported to be greater than  $90\%$  in some studies, but tumors thicker than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  are photoresistant [60].

# 36.7.9 Interferons

Interferons are cytokines that may affect cell growth and differentiation and accent immune responses and antiviral activity. Intralesional injection of interferon-alfa can attain cure rates of greater than  $80\%$  for superficial and noduloulcerative BCC [61, 62].

# 36.7.10 Retinoids

Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that are crucial for control of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Topical retinoids are somewhat effective against AKs but much less so against even superficial BCCs and SCCs. Retinoids do appear to act synergistically with 5-FU and may be applied in an exfoliation regimen. Noted complaints include dryness and flaking, minor side effects compared with the clinical effects of 5-FU.

# 36.7.11 Targeted Therapy

For nodal or distant metastatic lesions, multiple therapies are currently available. For BCC, after multidisciplinary tumor board consultation, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor such as vismodegib and sonidegib are currently FDA-approved [63]. For SCCA, EGFR inhibitors are available along with other cytotoxic agents. For recurrent or metastatic diseases, there are checkpoint immunotherapies, such as FDA-approved inivolumab and pembrolizumab. Similarly, for cutaneous melanoma, immunotherapy as well as other BRAF or BRAF/ MEK inhibitors are available [63].

# 36.7.12 Follow-Up

In general,  $18\%$  of SCC and  $44\%$  of BCC patients develop new lesions at 3 years. For BCC,  $30 - 50\%$  of patients will develop another BCC in 5 years [63]. In addition, they have increased risk of developing SCCA and cutaneous melanoma. For SCCA, for the first 2 years, 3 months or less follow-up intervals are recommended; 4-6 months for 2 years or later, and annually for life.

For melanoma, annual full body skin exam is recommended for life. With regional disease, ultrasound exam may be recommended 3-12 months the first 2-3 years. For general follow-up, every 4 months for the first

2 years, then every 6 months till year 5 is recommended [63].

# 36.8 Reconstructive Surgery

# 36.8.1 Flaps, Grafts, and Healing by Secondary Intention

The removal of any tumor leaves a defect. The hole created after tumor excision may be called the primary defect. The secondary defect is the wound created after tissue is transposed to close the primary defect. Every flap creates a potential secondary defect. Ideally, secondary defects should be easy to close, within relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs), in areas of loose adjacent tissue, and within anatomic boundaries [64].

Options for defect repair include (1) primary closure, (2) local or distant flap, (3) graft including free tissue transfer, and (4) healing by secondary intention. Elasticity and movability are two inherent skin characteristics that enable relocation and, perhaps, primary closure. Elasticity is the ability of the skin to stretch. Skin in the cheek and neck is very elastic. Movability is not related to elasticity. Temple skin is less movable than cheek skin, and the scalp is relatively immobile.

Flaps move skin and subcutaneous tissue from one area to another with an accompanying vascular supply. Flaps can be cosmetic, use well-matched skin, and functionally protect underlying structures such as bone or cartilage, which may not have adequate blood supply to support a graft. Three types of "impure" flap movements are classically defined—advancement, rotation, and transposition—although some suggest there are only two types of movement: sliding and lifting [64-66]. Sliding refers to stretching or mobilizing tissue from one site to another (advancement and rotation). Lifting tissue across a bridge of normal tissue to close a defect is similar to transposition [64]. All flaps, except free flaps, have some pivotal restraint, whether it be adjacent skin, subcutaneous tissue, or blood vessels.

Delayed flaps where the flap is raised and replaced and moved at a later time increases viability to a flap by enlarging and realigning the subdermal vasculature plexus. Delayed flap may augment reliability. Methods of delayed flap include raising and suturing tissue without disturbing the pedicle and tissue expansion. Subsequently (9-12 days later), the flap is mobilized [64, 67]. The mechanisms proposed for increasing the reliability is by increasing the blood flow with delay, depletion of vasoconstricting substances, formation of vascular collaterals and reorientation of vascular channels, stimulation of an inflammatory response, and release of vasodilating substances.

Well-designed flaps are not mere defect fillers. They are designed to complement natural aesthetic units and facial borders. Defects that trespass multiple aesthetic

units are designed to reproduce these independent units. For example, a cheek tumor defect that encroaches on the nose might be reconstructed with different flaps and/ or grafts for the cheek and nose, such as the paramedian forehead flap with cervicofacial advancement flap.

Skin grafts are easy to position into recipient defects and are ideal for monitoring tumors. Grafts must be placed on a well-vascularized bed. Sometimes, exposed bone should be allowed to build a granulation base before grafting, and adjunctive materials such as Integra, or wound VAC may be utilized to promote a healthy wound bed. Grafts may be of full thickness or split thickness. Harvesting methods include punching, shaving with a dermatome, and excision. Graft donor sites are selected based on aesthetic and tumor considerations. Ideally, grafts to the nose are well matched with preauricular skin, but any supraclavicular graft matches the facial color better than any torso or thigh graft.

Healing by secondary intention is a painless but time-consuming process. It is indicated for patients who do

not want more surgery, who can accept or obtain the daily care, and who can accept a scarred result. Secondary healing can be used for small defects  $(< 1\mathrm{cm})$  ,or for larger defects in areas where the resulting scar would be inconspicuous or tumor observation is critical. Healing by secondary intention is similar to open-wound therapy. Following tumor excision and hemostasis, the wound is dressed with antibiotic ointment (e.g.,bacitracin and/or polymyxin B sulfate). The outer edges of the wound are coated with an adhesive (e.g., adhesive bandage or tincture of benzoin). A non-adherent dressing is applied over the wound and a small rim of peripheral tissue. This is topped with a dry piece of gauze to absorb any blood, which is then covered with a contour mesh tape. When the defect is atop bone, the raw bone may be covered with two layers of moisture-retaining wet gauze, but any method that abrogates desiccation is acceptable (Fig.36.8). Three days later, the dressing is removed and the wound inspected. Any oozing and crusting should be removed with a 50:50 peroxide and water solu

tion. The wound then can be redressed in three layers – antibiotic ointment within the wound followed by a non-adherent dressing, which is then covered with mesh tape. The patient redresses the wound in this fashion on a daily basis to keep the area moist and free of scabs. Areas amenable to secondary epithelialization include the scalp, the retroauricular area, and some concavities away from mobile apertures. Secondary epithelialization would be a poor choice around the mouth or nasolabial region, for example, where retraction might distort the lips or the eyelid.

Three caveats regarding secondary healing are useful to keep in mind. First, scabs should not form. Scabs hinder epithelialization and harbor bacteria. Second, continuous application of antibiotic ointment can lead to allergic reactions and yeast infections. This is more common with ointments that contain neomycin sulfate than with bacitracin. Alternatively, petrolatum can be substituted for the antibiotic ointment. Finally, some patients can be so incapacitated by their medical illnesses that they cannot dress their wounds. Home healthcare nursing can be enlisted to aid in their daily wound care.

# 36.8.2 Skin Biomechanics

Skin is a heterogeneous material with unique mechanical properties. As skin is stretched, the randomly oriented collagen and elastic fibers are stretched in the direction of the applied force. This continues until all of the available collagen and elastic fibers are recruited and no further lengthening occurs. After the maximum amount of stretch is reached, the skin may rupture. Permanent striae may scar the skin surface, as is often noted in pregnancy. Overstretching the skin collagen effaces the blood vessels under tension; thus, necrosis secondary to decreased perfusion to a distal flap may occur (Fig. 36.9) [68]. Skin tension exists in all directions on the face but is greatest along the RSTLs. Ideally, elective incisions should be placed parallel to the RSTLs. Incisions made perpendicular to RSTLs (or in the lines of maximum extensibility [LMEs]) gape and heal with more obtrusive scars [69]. The rhombic flap, once considered by many as the "workhorse" facial flap, has been used less over time because some of the final legs lie within the LMEs. Today, flaps are more commonly designed with topographic units and RSTLs as the primary consideration.

Mechanical creep refers to the change in length that is seen when skin is held under a constant stress or force. The force that is exerted to stretch skin decreases with

time [68]. The surgeon routinely notes this mechanism at work after he or she tightly sutures an avulsive forehead wound. Two days later, the forehead is relaxed again. High stress loads, therefore, produce a degree of creep. The skin may not be totally relaxed for several months. For example, serial excision is a technique that harnesses the relaxation of skin over time. Wide defects may be closed sequentially over time.

Stress relaxation is the decrease in stress that occurs over time when skin is held under tension at a constant strain or is cyclically loaded [68]. It may be effected intraoperatively with the placement of a towel clamp on the skin or by scoring the scalp galea and pulling the skin. In addition, skin stretchers are made for this purpose (Fig. 36.10).

Finally, biologic creep is a slow methodic stretching of skin, yielding brand new skin [68]. Skin expanders do just that (Fig. 36.11).

sues can be stretched for centimeters without undermining, whereas others must be separated from tethering subcutaneous tissues. Conversely, a subcutaneous island flap, totally separated from the tether of the skin, depends on the mobile vascular subcutaneous pedicle.

Undermining releases the vertical attachments between the dermis and the subcutaneous planes, thereby reducing shearing forces and allowing the skin to slide and redrape in another position [70]. The mobilization benefits from undermining facial skin usually occur within the first  $2\mathrm{cm}$ . Animal studies reveal that undermining beyond  $4\mathrm{cm}$  produces little skin edge advance and possibly a more difficult stretch of tissue [71, 72]. A correct undermining level provides the criti

cal balance between mobility and blood supply. For example, simple random flaps, undermined in the superficial fat, are easy to raise on the cheek. Submuscular flaps maintain a robust blood supply to small, relatively immobile nasal flaps.

# 36.9 Flap Designs

# 36.9.1 Advancement Flaps

An advancement flap is advanced linearly over a defect. It consists of a classic elliptical closure with adjacent undermining; there are no rotational or pivotal move

ments. Tissue elasticity provides adequate horizontal motion with a flat closure effected as Burow's triangles are removed from the ends. The length of the ellipse is three to four times the width of the defect.

Advancement flaps can be constructed with multiple modifications: simple, square, bilateral, Burow's triangle repositioning, and A- or O- to T-shaped designs [73].

The experienced surgeon realizes that the tethering forces of advancing skin also constrict the size of the leading edge. Modifications are useful in specific instances. All flaps, including simple advancement flaps, requires that the surgeon can disguise, adjust, transpose, or eliminate "dog-ears" or excess tissue that gathers as tissue is transposed.

There are seven ways to deal with dog-ears [74-77]:

1. Do nothing. This approach works well on the scalp because bunched-up tissue lies down with time.  
2. Close opposite lines of uneven lengths by spreading out the problem - halving (Fig. 36.12a).  
3. Remove the excess to a hidden area - an end or middle triangle (see  $\square$  Fig. 36.12b).  
4. Lengthen the incision. This eliminates bunching (see Fig. 36.12c).  
5. Perform an M-plasty (sometimes called a T-plasty), which shortens the problem (see  $\square$  Fig. 36.12d).  
6. Reverse the S loop and hide the excess elsewhere (see Fig. 36.12e).  
7. Advance the dog-ear as a flap (subcutaneous "island") or use it as a free graft (see Fig. 36.12f).

# 36.9.2 Rotational Flaps

Curvilinear rotation flaps rotate from a tethered pivot point. These flaps fill triangular defects. The length of the arc is dependent on many variables, such as existing laxity, the size of the defect, the location, and blood supply to the flap [65, 78-82]. Rotation flaps rarely fit perfected geometric schemes of success. Rather, the surgeons often find themselves adjusting to the specific variables of a given situation (Fig. 36.13). There are two exceptions to this complexity that have been worked out fairly precisely:

1. The nasal bilobed flap of Zitelli has excellent results when applied toward lower or middle nasal defects of  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  or less [83]. This occurs as long as the second lobe of the flap is perpendicular to the alar rim and the first lobe does not cross deep concavities such as the alar groove.  
2. The scalp rotation method of Ahuja fills defects of up to  $3\mathrm{cm}$  with minimal adjustments [84].

Advantages to rotational flaps include a reliable broad-based vascularity, flexibility in design, and easy placement of scars into aesthetic/cosmetic zones or RSTLs. A major advantage is that the flap can be rotated again should additional tissue need to be removed secondary to tumor concerns or should laxity be lacking[79, 85]. Disadvantages to rotational flaps include the problems associated with any pivotal flap such as standing cutaneous deformities and the need for larger flaps. Regardless, rotational flaps may be ideally designed to reconstruct medium to large defects of the cheek, neck, scalp, and forehead.

# 36.9.3 Transposition Flaps

Transposition flaps transfer defined tissue along an arc of rotation, often over normal tissue, to repair a primary defect. Actual tissue movement may be rotational, linear, or both (Fig. 36.14). Transposition flaps tend to

be more confined than rotation flaps, and design is critical for success. The design/location of the pivot point is the most important factor. After tissue is transposed, flap tensions should be diffused to prevent strangulation of tissue and distortion of adjacent structures. The regional differences in tissue mobility affect the geometry of the flap design, with the classic transposition being a rhombus.

The rhombic flap is an equilateral parallelogram with oblique angles. The (Limberg) rhombic flap, first described in 1963, was an equilateral rhombus with 60- and 120-degree internal angles [86]. According to the classic (Borges) design, eight potential rhombic flaps may close a defect. These flaps are constructed as umbrellas, drawn off the obtuse side of two potential parallelograms. These parallelograms each have two sides parallel to the LMEs. These LMEs are always perpendicular to RSTLs and run in the direction that tissue stretches most efficaciously. The rhombic flap, whose short diagonal line parallels the LMEs and whose mobilization does not interfere with adjacent structures, is usually chosen for the rhombic transposition. The resulting tension vector in rhombic flaps lies 20 degrees from the short diagonal in a loose tissue plane.

Dufourtmental, Webster, and others modified the classic rhombic design [87]. The Dufourtmental flap was designed to close rhombic defects with acute angles approximating 90 degrees or a square defect. As with the Limberg design, the peripheral lines were equal in length, but unlike the rhombic flap, the short diagonal differed in angle size. Dufourtmental designed two isosceles triangles situated base to base. Once the sides of the triangles were drawn, the short diagonal was extended, as was one of the adjacent sides. A third line bisecting these two lines creates the first flap. The cutback line was drawn paralleling the long diagonal completing the second flap. The Webster 30-degree flap allowed for easier closure by bisecting the 60-degree angle into two 30-degree angles via an M-plasty. Here, the short diagonal had to be at least 110 degrees to prevent puckering and to maintain flap viability.

# 36.9.4 Axial Pattern Flaps

Axial pattern flaps are based on named vessels in the head and neck. Classic designs include the Abbé (Fig. 36.15) and Estlander flaps and the paramedian forehead flap [78]. A full description of these flaps is discussed in another chapter.

# 36.9.5 Skin Grafts

Skin grafting involves the removal of donor skin (epidermis and varying levels of dermis, fat, or muscle)

from one area to revascularize at another. The success of skin grafts is based on factors that affect angiogenesis and capillary ingrowth into the graft. Recipient bed vascularity and intimate graft-host contact as well as overall host health or condition affect graft

success. Wounds with a poor vascular supply may not support a graft or may need to be prepared before grafting. Cartilage base, irradiated tissue, fibrosis, and foreign, crushed, or nonviable tissue can compromise success.

Wound bed vascularity may be compromised by bleeding or cautery to arrest bleeding. Thus, there is an inherent benefit to delaying grafting or placing a pressure bolster bandage on top of the graft to prevent bleeding and allow healthy granulation tissue to build. We do not touch full-thickness graft bolsters for 6 or 7 days. Mechanical shear forces may disrupt contact between the graft and the recipient bed, leading to graft

failure. Although this may be minimized with appropriate suturing techniques as well as the placement of dressings, the force of a hard scrubbing such as during a shower can dislodge a graft and should be avoided.

Wound infections rarely jeopardize skin grafts in the head and neck. It is common for surgeons to confuse the dark eschar of a failing graft with infection. Regardless, some local measures that decrease wound bacteria

# 36.9.6 Full-Thickness Skin Grafts

Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) are chosen when local or distant flaps are not feasible or when the FTSG would offer acceptable cosmesis and function. Examples include the multioperated face, upper nasal surface defects, nasal lining, and medial canthal area. FTSGs resist contraction and may possess the texture and color of normal skin. In children, FTSGs have the potential to grow [79].

The FTSG is preferred over the split-thickness skin graft (STSG) in areas where a wound contracture may lead to a functional deformity. An example is the lower eyelid, where wound contracture would result in ectropion. An excellent FTSG for this example would include upper eyelid skin and orbicularis oculi muscle, which has been shown to predictably revascularize.

need to be removed in the future, but the submental fat removal was highly aesthetic

Selection criteria for a head and neck FTSG directs the surgeon to carefully consider particulars of a variety of sites - the upper eyelid, post- or preauricular skin, and lateral neck or supraclavicular region. For example, postauricular skin is photoprotected and has few adnexal structures, which may not be suitable for nasal defects. Preauricular skin grafts in males can lead to sideburns asymmetry. Supraclavicular and neck skin is thin and may be more photodamaged than the face. In addition, a supraclavicular scar may be a nuisance for women who wear clothing with low necklines.

The harvesting of most FTSGs involves cutting out a simple template of the defect (e.g., from suture packaging) (Fig. 36.16). Because an FTSG contracts by  $10 - 15\%$  after harvest, the donor graft pattern must be enlarged by around  $20\%$  [83]. This contracture issue is critical in areas of mobility such as in the lower eyelid. Here, grafts should be enlarged by  $150 - 200\%$  vertically to avoid ectropion/contraction occurring [79, 82].

The FTSG may be defatted with serrated scissors or by scraping with a blade. Defatting is complete when the shiny dermis is homogeneously exposed. FTSG should

fit into a wound bed with maximum surface contact without any tenting. Basting sutures may be used to affix the graft to the underlying bed to reduce dead space before peripheral suturing [79, 84]. Peripheral sutures are easier to insert when passed from the graft through the host skin with a tapered needle. Any nonadherent (to the graft) bolster of cotton, gauze petrolatum dressing, or plastic, for example, secured a few millimeters outside the grafted tissue is acceptable.

FTSGs undergo an evolutionary sequence. Initially, a graft is white followed by a period of cyanosis or a bluish/violaceous hue. Subsequently, there is a period of hyperemia or a red state, which fades over time until the graft assumes its normal color. If the graft fails, the entire epidermis turns black and sloughs off, followed by reepithelialization [79]. The necrotic graft acts as a biologic dressing, allowing healing to occur by secondary intention from the wound edges as well as from adnexal structures, thus should not be removed unless infected.

# 36.9.7 Split-Thickness Skin Grafts

An STSG is defined as thin if its thickness measures  $0.02 - 0.03\mathrm{cm}$ , medium from 0.03 to  $0.046\mathrm{cm}$ , and thick from 0.046 to  $0.076\mathrm{cm}$ . Thinner STSGs have

improved survival rates compared with thicker ones because there is greater exposure of the graft to the underlying vasculature, and less blood supply is needed for revascularization. STSGs have a higher degree of contraction than do FTSGs and do not grow in children. The graft dimensions should be at least  $25\%$  larger than the wound defect [79]. Thin grafts afford less protection to the underlying tissues and do not withstand repeated trauma well. For example, if STSG is chosen to cover a bare pericranium/skull after removal of a scalp tumor, the patient may report breakdown sites or scabs from sleeping on the grafted sites.

STSG donor sites for facial reconstructions include the lateral neck and supraclavicular area and the scalp, owing to their similarity in color and texture. The hip, thigh, buttock, abdomen, torso, and inner aspect of the arm are also applicable at times [79, 81, 85] (Fig. 36.17).

To harvest a STSG, the sterile donor site is lubricated with mineral oil. Traction and countertraction are applied, and the dermatome is engaged and advanced with a slight downward and forward pressure. The donor site bleeds if it is cut in the correct plane. After pressure or thrombin control, a semipermeable occlusive dressing covers the donor site and is left in place for

grafts are able to maintain the thinness and contour of the structure with minimal contracture. The most common donor site for composite grafts is the ear, including the crus of helix, rim, antihelix, tragus, and earlobe.

A major disadvantage to composite grafts is the risk of graft failure, which is higher than for FTSGs and STSGs and is attributed to the high metabolic demands

of the grafts. Regardless, composite grafts are technique sensitive. Generally, composite grafts should be no larger than  $1.5 - 2.0\mathrm{cm}$ . At placement, the graft is white or blanched. Within 6 hours, it becomes pink, and by 24 hours, it is cyanotic. By postoperative day 3, it resumes its pink color. Grafts that fail develop an eschar with subsequent necrosis and sloughing.

# 36.9.9 Free Tissue Transfer

It not uncommon to require free tissue transfers for very large skin cancers, and when the defect leads to significant functional or aesthetic defect. Furthermore, some defects leave critical structures such as great vessels exposed, thus requiring coverage and protection. Depending on the size of defect, these can range from radial forearm, anterolateral thigh, latissimus dorsi, scapular fasciocutaneous flap, and more. The specifics of free tissue transfers are discussed in another chapter (Fig. 36.18).

# 36.10 Complications

As there are risks inherent to all procedures, patients who receive skin cancer procedures should be warned of the potential for recurrence of the tumor as well as revision, and complications associated with the reconstructive procedure. Flap problems include failure/necrosis, infection, hematoma, wound dehiscence, and scarring.

# 36.10.1 Smoking

Smoking greatly increases the risk of necrosis. Patients who smoke one pack per day triple the risk of flap or

graft necrosis compared with nonsmokers. Smoking affects the blood supply via two mechanisms. First, nicotine is a potent vasoconstrictor that may lower tissue oxygenation by greater than  $50\%$ . Nicotine effects are visible within 10 minutes and can last up to 50 minutes. Second, carbon monoxide is a competitor with oxygen for hemoglobin. It has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen, resulting in high levels of carboxyhemoglobin. This leads to tissue hypoxia and increases the chance for flap compromise and poor wound healing.

# 36.10.2 Infection

Infections are rare in well-vascularized head and neck tissue, and necrosis may be mistaken for infection. More common causes of redness include stitch abscesses, which are foreign body reactions, and allergies to antibiotic ointment. Infections are handled by drainage (when indicated), irrigation, antibiotics, and usually resolve readily.

# 36.10.3 Bleeding

Bleeding may be caused by patient factors or surgical issues. Patient factors include medical conditions such as renal failure, liver failure, collagen vascular disease,

various cancers (hematopoietic malignancies), and medications. Medications that can cause bleeding include warfarin, heparin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cold remedies. Furthermore, commonly used herbal medications such as garlic, gingko, and vitamin E can inhibit thrombocyte function. However, a recent analysis by Harbottle et al., as well in personal experience, patients who are within therapeutic levels while taking warfarin, can be operated on safely without significant increased bleeding risk. As with any surgical procedure, the surgeon must weigh the benefits of discontinuing anticoagulants against the risks of surgery. Consultation and coordination with the patient's internist and appropriate preoperative laboratory data are helpful. There is essentially no need to discontinue any anticoagulant before performing a biopsy.

Surgical issues may arise intraoperatively or during the postoperative period. Decisions must be made concerning judicious cautery, the use of drains, the effect of vasoconstrictors, and postoperative pressure. Slow oozing occurs with any flap and is expected, but hematoma may lead to necrosis of the flap. A hematoma, in the space created between the flap and the underlying tissue, is detrimental to flap circulation because it creates tension on the graft and acts as a physical barrier preventing healing to the underlying tissue base. In addition, stagnating blood may promote wound infection. An early hematoma may often be pushed out and washed away, but a reforming hematoma must be explored.

# 36.10.4 Poor Cosmetic Results

Facial flaps should restore anatomic continuity, maintain functional integrity, and provide an aesthetically pleasing result. In spite of well-executed surgical techniques, less than optimal results may occur. As with any surgery, preoperative counseling and setting realistic expectation with the patient are recommended.

# Conclusion

Head and neck skin cancer is a disease that can be preventable in many instances. When treatment is required, various methods exist. As with other head and neck malignancies, best care is offered when multidisciplinary approach is employed. Complete and thorough ablation with reconstruction and function in mind yields the best results, and judicious follow-up is the rule, not the exception.
