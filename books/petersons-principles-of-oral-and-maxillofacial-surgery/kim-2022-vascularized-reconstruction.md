# 44.1 Introduction

Flaps can be classified based on their proximity to the recipient site. This results in the clinically useful terms: local, regional, and distant flaps. Most regional and distant flaps are based on a vascular pedicle that provides the nutrient inflow and outflow of blood to the transferred tissue. Understanding the variations of the different classifications of muscle containing flaps is extremely important for the reconstructive surgeon and the studies of the blood supply to muscles reported by Mathes and Nahai [1] are primary to this understanding (Table 44.1). Of course, this classification system only involves muscles but the understanding of the blood supply to the skin has been elucidated by Taylor and Palmer's [2] anatomic study of the human body's angio

somes. The angiosome theory proposes that the human body is composed of approximately 40 blocks of composite tissue each with its own cutaneous territory supplied by a discrete source vessel. Simply stated, all arteries to the skin travel either directly to their destination (direct perforators) or first travel through other tissues which is usually muscle (indirect perforators). These studies allow the reconstructive surgeon to classify flaps according to the type of vascular supply and predictably determine the vascular territory of the flap's pedicle.

The utilization of vascularized reconstructive techniques for head and neck reconstruction has a long history dating back centuries with the early history concentrated on rotational flaps. The development of microvascular instrumentation and techniques along with advances in surgical magnification brought about the ability to perform procedures that are more intricate. Although the first reported free tissue transfer in humans occurred in the 1950s, their use in head and neck reconstruction was limited until the 1990s. Prior to this period, microvascular free flaps were considered the "Hail Mary" of head and neck reconstruction and utilized only if other, more traditional techniques failed. As experience and success with microvascular techniques increased, so did their acceptance to mainstream surgical treatment for head and neck defects. Today, we practice in an environment where microvascular reconstruction is considered the first and most reliable reconstructive technique for many head and neck defects. Indeed, the advancement of microvascular reconstruction has provided the ability to reconstruct defects that were previously thought to be impossible. Of course, microvascular reconstruction is not appropriate for all head and neck defects or patients. Rather, it should be viewed as another technique that is available to the reconstructive surgeon to provide the best and most functional outcome with the least morbidity.

# 44.1.1 Microvascular Techniques and Setup

The microvascular free flap patient should undergo routine preoperative work up as any patient may receive for major surgery. This may include laboratory testing, chest imaging, and pulmonary and cardiac work up. Specific to microvascular reconstruction, identifying patients who may be at risk for vascular thrombosis and flap failure is the primary motivation for these preoperative tests. Identification of inherited hypercoagulable states such as Factor V Leiden mutation, Protein C and S deficiency, and anti-phospholipid syndrome will trigger the utilization of anticoagulation protocols that may not otherwise be utilized in the perioperative and intraoperative setting. Likewise, identifying severe athero

sclerotic disease through history, physical exam, and imaging may also effect the type of reconstruction utilized for the patient as well as what donor site may be most appropriate. Although many authors have identified various risk factors to flap loss and poor outcomes in microvascular reconstruction, there has been no consensus on any absolute contraindications [3-5].

The decision to perform a tracheotomy for the patient should be made based on the extent of the resection/reconstruction and the potential for airway compromise and swallowing dysfunction. The operating room table should be reversed or positioned so the head of the bed has more under-table space away from the table base. Once the airway is secured, the table is turned  $180^{\circ}$  away from anesthesia to allow space for positioning of the microscope (Fig. 44.1).

If a two-teamed approach is planned, the room is separated into a "clean" and a "dirty" side so flap harvest instrumentation is kept separate from the ablative instruments. Excellent communication between surgeon and operating room staff is necessary to avoid cross-contamination of the fields. As a general rule, items may pass from the flap harvest field to the ablative field but not the other way around.

Once the flap is inset and the microvascular portion of the procedure is about to begin, microvascular instrumentation is placed on a small table that is within easy reach of the surgeon, assistant, and surgical technician. Generally, this is positioned at the head of the bed with the surgeon and assistant positioned across from each other and the surgical technician seated near the instrument table (Fig. 44.2).

The microvascular portion of the procedure can be a stressful portion of the operation but this can be minimized by proper setup and adherence to microvascular principles. The procedures performed under magnification must be technically perfect but the procedure is essentially the same or very similar for most flaps.

First, identification of appropriate recipient vessels is necessary. This is typically done under loupe magnification. The authors' first choice for arterial anastomosis is usually the facial artery, followed by the superior thyroid and lingual arteries. In the vessel depleted neck, it is sometimes necessary to utilize the external carotid for vascular anastomosis if sufficient branches are not identified or if those branches are too small and present a considerable size mismatch. Venous outflow choices are somewhat more variable due to the considerable variation in anatomy from patient to patient as well as the ability to preserve venous branches of sufficient length and caliber during the ablative procedure. Furthermore, in the previously operated neck or the neck that was treated with full dose radiation therapy, venous outflow options can be particularly sparse. However, when ample venous options are available, branches of the common facial vein are usually a first choice for venous outflow followed by the external jugular vein (Fig. 44.3). Direct end-to-side anastomosis to the internal jugular vein can be performed when branches are not identified, extreme size mismatch with available recipient veins exists or if the external jugular vein is not present. It is the experience of these authors that this is typically performed as a last resort primarily because it is technically more demanding and time-consuming than an end-to-end venous anastomosis. Previous studies have shown no significant difference in overall thrombosis rates for either type of anastomosis [6].

The end-to-end anastomosis is the primary microvascular technique used for microvascular anastomosis. When vessel diameters closely approximate each other and adequate length of the recipient and donor vessels exist, the procedure is very straightforward. Specifics of the technique can vary from surgeon to surgeon, but in general terms, the vessel ends are trimmed and placed in an approximating microclamp. The initial sutures are placed at the very extreme ends of the visible vessel wall

and tied. The authors' preference is to leave one of the suture ends long on each side to serve as retraction sutures. The remainder of the front wall of the anastomosis is sutured utilizing interrupted sutures placed equidistant from each other (Fig. 44.4). The typical diameter of the vessels being sutures usually will require 3-4 sutures on each side for adequate approximation. The sutures are placed without tying until they have all been placed. Once the anterior wall is complete, the anastomosis is flipped over and the back wall is observed. The quality of the anterior wall anastomosis is examined making sure no "back walling" has occurred. The same interrupted suture technique is performed for the back wall. Prior to tying the sutures, the lumen of the vessel should be filled with heparinized saline.

The use of a microvascular coupling device (GEM Coupler™ Synovis Micro Companies Alliance, Inc.) for venous anastomosis has been shown to be a fast and reliable technique for establishing venous outflow (Fig. 44.5). The device and associated instrumentation are simple and intuitive to use and can greatly

decrease the time necessary to perform venous anastomoses. It is the author's preference to utilize this device whenever feasible for the venous anastomosis. The device also offers a variation which combines an ultrasonic Doppler probe to provide additional postoperative flap monitoring options.

# 44.2 Microvascular Soft Tissue Flaps

The continued penetration of microvascular reconstructive techniques into head and neck surgery has been astounding. Once thought to be radical, last resort procedures that were fraught with failure and complications, these procedures have come to the forefront of head and neck reconstruction and have unsurpassed reli

ability and versatility. These reconstructive techniques have allowed for customized reconstruction options for tumor and trauma patients where previously a "one-size-fits-all" approach was the norm. The use of microvascular reconstruction many times allows for more comprehensive ablative surgery without the limitations placed on the ablative surgeon that local or regional flaps have incurred in the past. Furthermore, in anatomic regions like the maxilla, midface, and skull base where reconstructive options were particularly limited and resulted in poor cosmetic and functional outcomes, free tissue transfer has proven to be invaluable in providing meaningful surgical outcome improvements. Finally, several studies have shown that microvascular reconstruction does not incur a higher cost for treatment compared to conventional reconstructive techniques [7, 8].

Though the benefits of microvascular surgery are numerous, the limitations of these techniques are also clearly delineated. The need for specialized training and instrumentation are certainly obstacles that are becoming decreasingly prevalent with more training facilities exposing residents and fellows to microvascular reconstruction. Also, patient factors such as hypercoagulability states or vessel depletion after ablative surgery must be taken into consideration. Finally, the increased operative time required for these procedures may make medically compromised patients poor candidates for this type of reconstruction.

It is difficult to classify many microvascular flaps into soft tissue or bone flaps as many have variations in harvesting that can easily incorporate composite tissue. However, this section attempts to describe some of the more common flaps used in soft tissue reconstruction of the head and neck.

# 44.2.1 Radial Artery Fasciocutaneous Flap

In many institutions, the radial artery fasciocutaneous flap (RAFF) or radial forearm free flap has supplanted the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap as the "workhorse" soft tissue flap for head and neck reconstruction. Popularized by Soutar in 1983 [9], the RAFF has become one of the most commonly used and reliable soft-tissue free flaps for head and neck reconstruction. This versatile flap offers thin, pliable skin that can be as large as nearly the entire forearm from the flexor crease of the wrist to the antecubital fossa except for a small strip over the ulnar aspect of the forearm. The flap may also be harvested with partial thickness radial bone, palmaris longus tendon, brachioradialis muscle, and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. The characteristics of the skin of the forearm allows for this flap to be nearly ideal for reconstruction of areas in the head and neck that

require thin, mobile tissue such as the tongue, floor of mouth, and soft palate. The skin paddle should be centered over the radial vessels but the design of the flap can be tailored to the particular reconstructive situation. Bilobed, double paddle, folded, tubed, and fascia-only flaps have been described [10-12].

The radial and ulnar arteries are the terminal branches of the brachial artery and supply the hand and fingers through an arterial array known as the superficial and deep palmar arches. The radial artery ends in the deep palmar arch and the ulnar artery ends in the superficial palmar arch. In most individuals, the superficial palmar arch alone can supply adequate blood to the hand and fingers either directly by sending branches to all five digits or by communicating branches to the deep palmar arch to supply the thumb and forefinger. However, in an estimated  $12\%$  of individuals [13], the superficial palmar arch is incomplete and no communication between the deep and superficial palmar arches exists. It is these patients that harvesting the radial artery along with a RAFF can have catastrophic consequences to the distal upper extremity. If the ulnar distribution is undisturbed, the third, fourth, and fifth digits should still remain viable but the thumb and forefinger are at risk for ischemia should the above circumstances be present. To avoid this complication, the performance of an accurate Allen's test is essential and in cases when this test is equivocal, radial and ulnar artery duplex studies may be performed to objectively observe the pattern of flow and the reversal of flow with total occlusion of the radial artery.

# Key Points

The Radial Artery Fasciocutaneous Flap can be harvested as a composite flap containing skin, fascia, muscle, bone, and nerve.  
A negative Allen's Test would indicate poor collateral circulation in the hand from the ulnar artery and Duplex studies may be indicated or an alternative flap donor site selected.

# 44.2.1.1 Flap Harvesting

The arm should be prepped circumferentially up to the axilla and draped accordingly for access to the entire arm. The distal portion of the radial artery should be palpated and marked as well as the distal location of the cephalic vein in the "snuff box" region. Flap design should be carefully considered to approximate the center of the flap over the radial vessels as much as possible with particular care in selecting the orientation of the pedicle relative to the skin paddle (Fig. 44.6). Once marked, the arm is exsanguinated with an elastic wrap

![](images/a67366c5fa9063fcb9bf7b5110787f0cf81a7670c7c4df2876bba04d59b7abc4.jpg)  
Fig. 44.6 Skin markings for radial artery fasciocutaneous flap

and the tourniquet around the upper arm inflated to  $250~\mathrm{mmHg}$ . As in all extremity procedures where a tourniquet is used, the tourniquet time should be recorded as should the overall ischemia time to the flap.

The initial incision is along the palmar crease of the forearm and initial identification of the distal radial artery and venae commitantes as well as the cephalic vein are performed. These should then be isolated and ligated. The superficial branches of the radial nerve will also be encountered here and can be preserved or transected leaving an area of anesthesia over the dorsum of the thumb and forefinger. Once the distal vasculature is secured, the remainder of the skin paddle incisions can be made. The flap is then raised off the deep forearm muscles and tendons from medial to lateral in a subfascial plane. This dissection will traverse the flexor tendons of the forearm which must maintain a thin layer of paratenon to facilitate skin graft healing. This dissection continues until the lateral intermuscular septum is approached. Similarly, on the radial side, the flap is elevated from lateral to medial in the same subfascial plane. Here the superficial branches of the radial nerve can again be preserved by breaking the subfascial plane of dissection or sacrificed. Once complete, the flap can then be elevated from distal to proximal by carefully elevating the radial artery and veins along the intermuscular septum. Vascular clips or bipolar cautery are recommended to control the numerous branches to the surrounding muscles and radial bone.

The remainder of the vascular pedicle is dissected by first making a curvilinear incision from the antecubital fossa to the proximal portion of the skin paddle. This incision is taken to subcutaneous tissue only and the skin is undermined in this subcutaneous plane medially and laterally. Care must be taken not to injure the proximal cephalic vein during this dissection. The cephalic vein is identified as it exits the skin paddle and is circumferentially dissected. A vessel loop is passed around the vein, and the entire length of vein is dissected up to the

![](images/dec4183a22e949ee90394934a618ed1ed7197394ee7a794f326fb8701bc8a1a9.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 44.7 Radial artery fasciocutaneous flap elevated up to antecubital fossa

desired length. Finally, the proximal radial pedicle is accessed by separating the brachioradialis and the flexor carpi radialis muscles and retracting the brachioradialis laterally. The remainder of the pedicle can then be elevated up to the brachial artery if necessary (Fig. 44.7).

The flap is then allowed to reperfuse for  $15 - 20\mathrm{min}$  by releasing the tourniquet. And hemostasis can be achieved at this time. The flap is then harvested and passed to the ablative field. A suction drain should be placed in the deep tissues in the proximal forearm and the curvilinear incision can be closed primarily. A full-or split-thickness skin graft is normally required to close the skin paddle site. The skin graft is covered with a nonadherent dressing and the arm is then padded generously with cast padding and a volar splint is fabricated with the wrist in slight extension to immobilize the arm during skin graft healing.

# 44.2.1.2 Applications

The quality of the skin of the forearm lends itself for use in a wide variety of head and neck reconstruction applications. Most commonly used for reconstruction of tongue, floor of mouth and buccal mucosa defects, this flap also has the versatility for use in facial skin or scalp reconstructions. The generous pedicle length allows for placement in areas quite remote from recipient vessels and the relatively low morbidity of the procedure makes the radial artery fasciocutaneous flap a workhorse in microvascular soft tissue reconstruction.

# 44.2.2 Anterolateral Thigh Flap

The Anterolateral Thigh Flap (ALTF) is based on the cutaneous perforators of the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, which is a branch of the profunda femoris. The pedicle travels in the inter

muscular septum between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles along with the motor nerve to the vastus lateralis. The cutaneous perforators may travel through the intermuscular septum between these muscles (septocutaneous perforators) or travel through a portion of the vastus lateralis (musculocutaneous perforators). It is this latter variation that appears to be the more common configuration. The skin of the lateral thigh may also be supplied by the transverse branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery or directly from the deep femoral artery. Though the flap has enjoyed a recent explosion in popularity, it is these variations in vascular anatomy that have detracted from the flap's overall acceptance in head and neck reconstruction.

Profunda femoris is also known as the deep femoral artery or the deep artery of the thigh and travels in a deeper plane than the superficial femoral artery and does not leave the thigh, whereas the superficial femoral artery continues as the popliteal artery behind the knee.

The pedicle to this flap can support a large area of relatively thin and flexible skin, which is dependent on the patient's overall body habitus. Up to  $800~\mathrm{cm}^2$  has been reported [14] encompassing an area from the greater trochanter of the femur to a line  $3\mathrm{cm}$  above the patella. No preoperative evaluation is required prior to flap harvesting [15]; however, the use of a hand-held Doppler can identify the dominant perforator to the thigh skin. The most likely position of this perforator can be estimated by drawing a line from the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the superior-lateral corner of the patella. At the midpoint of this line, a  $3\mathrm{cm}$  radius circle is drawn and the most likely position of the skin perforator will be in the inferior-lateral quadrant of this circle. The skin paddle should be centered on this point (Fig. 44.8).

The main disadvantage to this flap is the inconsistent size and location of the cutaneous perforators. These perforators have been reported to be completely missing [15]. Celik, et al. argue that many of these reports result in a lack of recognitions of small perforators or due to the surgeon's inability to dissect the musculocutaneous perforators through the vastus lateralis muscle [16]. The reconstructive surgeon should be prepared to convert to an anteromedial thigh flap or a tensor fascia lata flap if this situation were to arise [17].

Fig. 44.8 Skin markings for anterolateral thigh flap. Identification of dominant perforator within inferior-lateral quadrant of circle drawn at midpoint from anterior superior iliac spine to the superior-lateral pole of patella

# 44.2.2.1 Flap Harvesting

The surface landmarks for the ALTF are drawn as described above. A Doppler probe is used to confirm the location of the dominant perforator. The flap's skin paddle should be designed to be centered on this perforator. The initial incision is made on the medial aspect of the skin paddle and extending superiorly toward the ASIS down through the deep fascia to the rectus femoris muscle. The skin is elevated laterally off the muscle until a cutaneous perforator is identified. Once the perforator is identified, the remainder of the skin paddle can be incised. The perforator is followed through the intermuscular septum between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis (septocutaneous perforators) or through the vastus lateralis muscle (musculocutaneous perforators) until the source artery is identified (Fig. 44.9). The descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery can be dissected proximally for the desired pedicle length or up to  $16\mathrm{cm}$  [10]. Running along with the source vessels is the nerve to the vastus lateralis muscle. This nerve must be preserved to maintain motor innervation to this muscle.

Once the flap is harvested, any muscular dissection should be reapproximated and a suction drain placed in the deep tissues. The area of the skin paddle can generally be closed primarily with a modest amount of undermining of the surrounding skin if the skin paddle's dimensions do not exceed  $6 - 9\mathrm{cm}$ . Otherwise a skin graft may be required.

$\square$  Fig. 44.9 Dissection through vastus lateralis muscle for musculocutaneous perforators

# 44.2.2.2 Applications

For many reconstructive surgeons, this flap has supplanted the radial forearm flap as the primary soft tissue flap for head and neck reconstruction. Indeed, the low morbidity and the ability to primarily close the donor site are key advantages to utilizing this flap. However, the inconsistent nature of the perforators remains as the primary deterrent for the widespread adoption of this flap. Furthermore, the nature of the thigh skin varies with the patient's overall body habitus and is generally thicker and less pliable than the radial forearm skin. In patients who have had axillary node dissection, the radial artery harvested for coronary bypass grafting, or previous trauma to the forearm, the ALTF can be an excellent alternative source of soft tissue for head and neck reconstruction.

# 44.2.3 Rectus Abdominus Myocutaneous Flap

The rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap (RAMF) is based on the deep inferior epigastric artery and vein (DIEA and DIEV) and has been a reliable flap for many areas of reconstruction. These vessels are of good caliber and a fairly long vascular pedicle can be obtained. The flap can transfer a large volume of skin, fat, muscle, and fascia which is dependent on the patient's body habitus. This volume will decrease over time as the denervated muscle will atrophy significantly. The RAMF is well suited to cover defects that require a large volume of tissue such as total maxillectomy, total glossectomy, skull base, or scalp defects. Pedicled and free flaps based on the inferior or superior epigastric arteries have been well described for breast reconstruction. A variety of different skin paddle orientations are available for this flap depending on the needs of the reconstruction.

A perforator flap based on the DIEA and DIEV allows for harvesting the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia without the rectus muscle [18]. This is known as the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP) and the cutaneous perforators are dissected through the rectus muscle to the vascular source and allows for a much thinner flap.

The rectus muscle receives its blood supply from both the deep superior epigastric artery and vein (DSEA and DSEV) and the DIEA and DIEV. The DIEA and DIEV have approximately twice the diameter of the DSEA and DSEV and the paraumbilical musculocutaneous perforators are directly associated with the DIEA and DIEV, whereas they must anastomose to the DSEA and DSEV through a series of small vessels where flow can be reversed [19].

The DIEA branches from the external iliac artery just cephalad to the inguinal ligament. It travels superiorly and medially to penetrate the transversalis fascia  $3 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  caudal to the arcuate line on the undersurface of the rectus muscle. It courses superiorly through the muscle giving off branches to the skin near the umbilicus.

The anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall is important when harvesting this flap because preservation of fascial sheaths is crucial to preventing postoperative hernia formation. The rectus sheath extends from the pubis to the xiphoid process and is formed by the fibrous aponeurosis of the abdominal muscles. The arcuate line is estimated by a line connecting the anterior superior iliac spines and indicates the change in composition of the posterior rectus sheath. Above the arcuate line, the posterior sheath is comprised of the transversalis fascia and a portion of the internal oblique aponeurosis. This double layer of fascia is adequate to prevent hernias. Below the arcuate line, the posterior sheath is formed only by the transversalis fascia. If not reinforced, this area is prone to bulging or hernia formation. In this region, the anterior rectus sheath must be preserved and used to reinforce the transversalis fascia (Fig. 44.10).

# Key Points

The arcuate line is estimated by connecting the anterior superior iliac spines.  
Below arcuate line indicates the area where the posterior rectus sheath is only comprised of the transversalis fascia, whereas the area above it consists of the both the transversalis fascia and the internal oblique aponeurosis.  
Preservation of the anterior rectus sheath below the arcuate line will help to prevent postoperative abdominal wall herniation.

Fig. 44.12 Caudal portion of rectus abdominus muscle exposed

# 44.2.3.1 Flap Harvesting

Surface landmarks for the RAMF include the midline of the abdomen and the estimated width of the rectus abdominus muscle as well as both anterior superior iliac spines with a line connecting them to estimate the arcuate line. The ipsilateral femoral vessels should be palpated and marked as well as the costal margin (Fig. 44.11). A concentration of cutaneous perforators exists around the umbilicus, and the skin paddle design should be centered in this area. Flap elevation begins by creating the superior and inferior skin paddle incisions down through the anterior rectus sheath to expose the rectus muscle. The rectus sheath is divided horizontally until the medial and lateral edges of the muscle are identified. The lateral edge of the muscle indicates the linea semilunaris and the medial edge of the muscle indicates the linea alba. Once these fascial divisions are identified, the lateral skin paddle incision can be created down to Scarpa's fascia and then undermined from lateral to medial to the linea semilunaris. The same can be performed medially. The rectus sheath is then incised along the linea semilunaris and the linea alba.

Fig. 44.11 Skin markings for rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap

To access the DIEA and DIEV, a vertical incision is made from the inferior portion of the skin paddle down toward the femoral vessels down to the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus sheath is incised at the midpoint of the long axis of the muscle and undermined laterally and medially to expose the caudal portion of the muscle (Fig. 44.12). This split anterior rectus sheath will serve as the hernia preventing layer inferior to the arcuate line to preserve the integrity of the abdominal wall. Once completed and the caudal rectus muscle is exposed, the flap may be elevated from superior to inferior off the posterior rectus sheath. The mixed motor/sensory nerve supply from the intercostal nerves will be encountered laterally as the flap is elevated and can be ligated and divided. These nerves have been reported to be useful in segmentally reinnervating the rectus muscle. On the undersurface of the muscle, the DIEA and DIEV will come into view. The pedicle should be protected while the inferior portion of the rectus muscle is transected at any point inferior to the vascular pedicle. The pedicle is followed inferiorly and laterally toward its origin until the desired length is achieved or until the external iliac vessels are reached. The paired DIEVs will usually join to become a single vein just before its take-off from the external iliac vein which may be beneficial depending on the size of the recipient vein. The pedicle is then divided and the flap passed to the ablative field.

Closure of the donor site begins with reapproximation of the inferior portion of the cut anterior rectus sheath. Again, this layer will serve to restore the integrity of the abdominal wall inferior to the arcuate line. The superior portion of the anterior sheath that was harvested with the flap may also be reapproximated by large slowly absorbable suture. Care should be exercised to prevent visceral injury with suture needles or other sharp instruments. Finally, a layered primary closure of the skin can be achieved with wide undermining and suction drains placed in the dead space.

# 44.2.3.2 Applications

Due to the large volume of skin and muscle that is available for reconstruction, the RAMF is ideally suited for applications where a large bulk of tissue is necessary. Total maxillectomy and total glossectomy defects are the most common indications though it may also be useful in scalp or facial skin reconstructions. The potential for reinnervation of the muscle by anastomosis of the segmental nerves to a recipient nerve in the ablative field makes this flap feasible for facial reanimation surgery.

# 44.2.4 Latissimus Myocutaneous Free Flap

The latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap (LDMF) is a very versatile flap for head and neck reconstruction. Due to its flat, broad nature and large amounts of soft tissue available, this flap can cover huge defects of the head and neck. Indeed, the LDMF was the first musculocutaneous flap to be reported in the literature in 1896 [20] but it was not reported for use in the head and neck until 1978 [21].

The latissimus dorsi muscle arises from the thoracic spine (T6 - T12), the lower four ribs, the iliac crest, and the thoracolumbar fascia. The muscle converges around the teres major and inserts into the intertubular groove of the humerus. Like the pectoralis major, the latissimus dorsi is classified as a class 5 muscle by Mathis and Nahai [1], with its one dominant pedicle being the thoracodorsal artery and its segmental secondary pedicles consisting of the paraspinal perforators. The thoracodorsal artery is a branch of the subscapular artery which is itself a branch of the third part of the axillary artery. The thoracodorsal artery also gives off branches to the teres major, serratus anterior, and subscapularis muscles as well as the angular branch to the inferior tip of the scapula. The vascular territories of the skin over the latissimus dorsi can be divided into three angiosomes. Zone one is the superior third of the muscle which is supplied by perforators from the thoracodorsal artery. Zone two is the middle third of the muscle which is mainly supplied by the paraspinal perforators. Zone three is the caudal third which is fed by the lumbar arteries [2]. Placement of a skin paddle over this distal zone may be at risk of necrosis due to this "once removed" relationship of that angiosome. It is the anterior free margin of zone II where an abundance of perforators exist and the skin paddle can be most ideally placed.

# Key Points

The angiosomes over the latissimus dorsi muscle are separated into three zones  
Zone 1 derives blood supply from perforators of the thoracodorsal artery

Zone 2 derives blood supply from paraspinal perforators  
Zone 3 derives blood supply from lumbar artery perforators  
- Placement of the skin paddle of the Zone 3 (the most distal zone) may result in skin paddle necrosis due to unreliable communication to the thoracodorsal artery.

# 44.2.4.1 Flap Harvesting

The most cumbersome aspect of utilizing this flap is patient positioning. The flap can be approached in a supine position with the ipsilateral arm extended across the chest and rolls placed under the ipsilateral shoulder and hip to expose the back. However, a lateral decubitus position allows for easier access to this flap though it requires multiple prepping and draping of the head and neck to avoid contamination. Once properly positioned, the surface landmarks should be identified and marked. These include the midpoint of the axilla, the midpoint between the anterior and posterior superior iliac spines, the scapular tip, and the spinous processes of the vertebrae. A line connecting the midpoint of the axilla and the midpoint of the iliac crest approximates the anterior free border of the latissimus dorsi muscle. The thoracodorsal artery runs 3-4 centimeters posterior to the edge of the muscle and divides into a horizontal and vertical branch just below the scapular tip. A skin paddle can be designed over the anterior edge of the muscle overlying Zone II as described above (Fig. 44.13). This design provides adequate perfusion of the overlying skin as well as good pedicle length.

Incision of the anterior margin of the skin paddle and extension along the line estimating the anterior edge of the muscle up to the axilla allow for identifica

tion of the muscle's leading edge. At this point, an attempt to identify the pedicle can be made by elevating the muscle off the posterior chest wall. A branch off the thoracodorsal pedicle will be encountered supplying the serratus anterior muscle and can be traced proximally to identify the main thoracodorsal pedicle. Once the thoracodorsal artery is identified, the branch to the serratus is ligated. Alternatively, the remainder of the skin paddle can be incised down to the underlying muscle and can be sutured down to the underlying fascia to prevent shearing of the cutaneous perforators. The surrounding skin is then undermined to expose the origins of the muscle and can be detached from its origins using electrocautery. Working from inferior to superior, the muscle is raised off the posterior chest wall with identification of the vascular pedicle on the undersurface of the muscle near the tip of the scapula. Once identified, the pedicle can be followed proximally ligating and dividing the muscular branches as well as the angular branch to the tip of the scapula. The humeral attachment of the latissimus dorsi muscle must be detached carefully to avoid damage to the underlying pedicle. Finally, the circumflex scapular vessels will be identified at the most proximal portion of the pedicle dissection and can be ligated to provide even more pedicle length (Fig. 44.14).

# 44.2.4.2 Applications

The flap is useful in head and neck reconstruction when a large surface area of soft tissue is necessary. This flap is used routinely as a rotational flap for breast reconstruction and as a free flap for coverage of extremity wounds and decubiti. In the head and neck, it is suitable for large avulsive scalp, skull base, or neck defects (Fig. 44.15).

# 44.2.5 Lateral Arm Free Flap

Introduced in 1982 by Song et al. [22] the lateral arm free flap derives its blood supply from several septocutaneous perforators through the lateral intermuscular septum from the posterior radial collateral artery and vein(PRCA and PRCV, respectively). The PRCA is itself a branch of the profunda brachii artery which is a branch off of the brachial artery. The flap has the potential for dual outflow with the PRCV venae commitantes serving as the deep venous system and the cephalic vein as the superficial system. The flap may be harvested with skin, soft tissue, nerve (posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm or PCNA), muscle (triceps), and bone (partial thickness humerus). Large amounts of harvested skin and soft tissue have been reported, the largest being  $18\mathrm{x}11\mathrm{cm}$  [23], but most are limited to one-third of the upper arm circumference in order to facilitate primary closure of the donor site defect.

The lateral arm flap's primary advantage is a potentially thin, pliable soft tissue paddle without the concern of ischemic injury to the upper extremity as with the radial forearm flap. Also, the donor site defect can often be closed primarily without the need for an additional skin graft donor site. The primary disadvantages to this flap are the relatively short vascular pedicle and the proximity of the profunda brachii artery to the radial nerve with potential for injury during dissection.

# 44.2.5.1 Flap Harvesting

The arm should be circumferentially prepped and draped exposing the upper forearm to the axilla. The surface landmarks include the lateral epicondyle of the

![](images/4858d84468cd28153f60e8eae010899a9a575389d30b4bab1575950d6c5db159.jpg)  
Fig. 44.16 Skin markings for lateral arm flap

humerus and The V-shaped insertion of the deltoid muscle is drawn and a line between the "V" and the lateral epicondyle is estimated to be approximately 1 cm anterior to the lateral intermuscular septum (Fig. 44.16). The skin paddle is designed in a fusiform shape with its long axis 1 cm posterior to this line.

The initial incision is made at the anterior margin of the skin paddle down to the brachioradialis and brachialis muscles. The posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm (PCNF) may be encountered in the distal portion of this incision and may be preserved or sacrificed creating an area of anesthesia in the upper forearm. The dissection continues in a subfascial plane posteriorly toward the intermuscular septum where septocutaneous perforators will be identified. The posterior skin paddle incision can then be made down to the triceps muscle and dissected in the subfascial plane anteriorly toward the intermuscular septum and identification of the septocutaneous perforators. Following these perforators proximally will lead to the source artery and vein (PRCA and PRCV). The same vessels are then identified from the anterior dissection by separating the brachioradialis from the intermuscular septum. The radial nerve will be encountered in this dissection and must be preserved.

Fig.44.17 Elevated lateral arm flap with generous pedicle length

The flap is elevated from distal to proximal by first ligating the continuation of the PCRA distally to become the recurrent interosseous artery and separating the septum from the humerus. The posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm (PCNA) and the PCNF run along with the pedicle. The pedicle is followed proximally through the intermuscular septum toward the spiral groove of the humerus. Part of the deltoid attachment to the humerus may be divided to allow access to the proximal pedicle (Fig. 44.17). The pedicle is severed when the desired pedicle length is achieved.

A suction drain may be placed in the deep tissues. The brachialis and triceps muscles can be lightly reap- proximated and primary closure can be achieved in most cases.

# 44.2.5.2 Applications

The applications for the lateral arm flap mirror those of the radial forearm and ALTF. The skin quality of the upper arm is generally thin and pliable and a generous vascular pedicle is available for harvest. Of the main advantages of this flap over the radial forearm is that the distal circulation of the arm and hand is not dependent upon the PRCA and, like the ALTF, may serve as an effective alternative in patients where a radial forearm flap is contraindicated.

# 44.3 Microvascular Composite Bone Flaps

# 44.3.1 Osteocutaneous Radial Forearm Flap

The radial forearm flap has enjoyed tremendous popularity since its initial description. The vast majority of radial forearm flaps (RFFF) used in head and neck reconstruction are soft tissue only flaps. The use of these flaps as bone containing flaps was first described by Soutar [24]. The use of the radial forearm flap as an

osteocutaneous flap has been surpassed by other bone flaps such as the fibula, scapula and the deep circumflex femoral artery (DCIA) flap. The reason for the poor performance of the osteocutaneous RFFF in head and neck reconstruction has been twofold; first: its poor bone quantity, and second: the potential for significant donor site morbidity.

The anatomy of the RFFF has already been covered earlier in this chapter. The surgical anatomy of the bone containing RFFF is related to the bone perforators from the radial artery. The nutrition to the bone is by the periosteal and direct bone perforators through the flexor pollicis longus muscle.

# 44.3.1.1 Flap Harvesting

Under tourniquet control, the harvest is performed in a distal to proximal fashion. An incision is made at the most distal point of the flap and is carried to the subcutaneous fascia, directly overlying the muscles and the tendons. The tendons of the flexor carpi radialis, the brachioradialis, and the palmaris longus are identified. A subfascial plane is dissected while maintaining the paratenon over the tendons. The radial artery and the accompanying venae committantes are identified and isolated. Two 2-0 silk sutures are passed under the vessels. The vessels are then ligated and divided. Dissection continues on the radial side and the cephalic vein is identified, ligated, and divided. The cephalic vein is commonly harvested by the authors in order to increase the venous drainage to the flap. Continued subfascial dissection is carried out toward the radial pedicle while taking care to identify and preserve the sensory branches of the radial nerve. At this point, attention is turned to the ulnar aspect. The skin paddle on the ulnar side is incised to the fascia and a subfascial elevation of the flap is similarly carried out toward the radial vascular pedicle.

At this point, the proximal portion of the flap is then incised and a subcutaneous flap is then elevated toward the antecubital fossa. The cephalic vein is further dissected until the desired length is exposed.

An Allis clamp is used to retract the flexor carpi radialis muscle and dissection of the vascular bundle is carried out between the flexor carpi radialis and the brachioradialis.

Dissection in this region is performed in a very meticulous fashion taking care to preserve the perforators to the flexor pollicis longus muscle and the radius. A cuff of the muscle is then incised to maintain the perforators to the bone. Using a periosteal elevator, the bone is exposed from both sides of the pedicle. A measurement of the desired bone length is marked. Using the oscillating saw, the bone is cut from the opposite side of the pedicle and in a curved fashion to avoid a sharp angle, and therefore stress risers. Once the bone cut is created

the desired length of pedicle is dissected, the tourniquet is deflated and the flap is allowed to reperfuse.

The residual radial bone can be plated using the dynamic compression plate over the harvested bone site. Prophylactic plating diminishes the incidence of radial bone fracture.

The arm is closed by reapproximating the proximal flap and closing it over a suction drain. The cutaneous donor site defect is repaired with a full or a split thickness skin graft. A volar splint is placed with the wrist in a  $45^{\circ}$  extension. The splint is left in place for at least 2 weeks.

This flap has rapidly lost popularity and has been supplanted by superior bone flaps due to its limited bone stock and significant incidence of postoperative radius fracture. Early reports showed an incidence of fracture as high as  $28 - 43\%$  [25-28], while larger series reported incidences of  $23\%$  [29] and  $31\%$  [30]. Refinements in osteotomy technique and prophylactic internal fixation have reduced this functionally disabling complication to  $15\%$  [31]. Serious frequent sequelae of pathologic radius fracture include wrist deformity, and reduced wrist and grip strength from impaired flexor pollicis longus function. Postoperative radius fracture can be minimized by strictly adhering to bony dimensions not exceeding  $30\%$  of its cross-sectional area, and  $40\%$  of its circumference [32]. Additional radius protection can be offered by external support with an above elbow cast, or by the use of a splint to ensure 6-8 weeks of immobilization. However, fracture rates remain as high as  $19\%$  [33]. Prophylactic internal fixation with dynamic compression plate (DCP) is the most effective method of increasing both the torsional and bending strength of the osteotomized radius, supported by several large clinical series [34-37].

# Key Points

To minimize the risk of radius fracture, the dimensions of harvested bone should not exceed  $30\%$  of the radial cross-sectional area and  $40\%$  of its circumference.  
- Prophylactic plating of the residual radius is the most effective method of prevention of fracture.

# 44.3.1.2 Applications

The use of the osteocutaneous radial forearm flap is fairly limited in the authors' opinion. Due to the minimal volume of bone and significant risk for radial fracture if not prophylactically plated, the indications for the bone containing variation in the radial forearm flap are few. The flap may be utilized in cases where other bone reservoirs have been determined to be poor options

for that patient or possibly for midfacial reconstruction where a small amount of bone paired with a thin skin paddle and relatively long pedicle may suffice.

# 44.3.2 Osteocutaneous Fibula Flap

Hidalgo in 1989 performed the first case of mandibular reconstruction with the fibula using multiple defined osteotomies to reproduce the shape of almost an entire mandible [38]. Since then the fibula free flap has enjoyed much popularity in mandibular reconstruction and has continued to undergo technical developments.

The fibula is a long thin non-weight bearing bone of the lower extremity. It has a tubular shape with a thick circumference of cortical bone providing it with significant inherent strength. Approximately 22 to  $25~\mathrm{cm}$  of bone may be harvested, while preserving 6 to  $7\mathrm{cm}$  of bone proximally and distally to maintain integrity and functional stability of both the knee and ankle joints, respectively. Preservation of the proximal portion of the fibula also protects the common peroneal nerve that can be injured as it wraps around the neck of the fibula resulting in a foot drop postoperatively.

The peroneal artery and vein comprise the dominant blood supply and vascular pedicle to the fibula osteocutaneous flap. The popliteal artery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries below the knee, with the posterior tibial subsequently giving rise to the peroneal artery. The peroneal artery and its paired vena commitantes descend in the lower leg between the flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior muscles as they course toward the foot.

The peroneal artery via a nutrient medullary artery provides a rich endosteal vascular supply to the fibula along with multiple periosteal feeding vessels. The vascular supply to the skin over the fibula arises from numerous fasciocutaneous perforators running in the posterior crural septum. Their position and course can be highly variable. The fibula can be harvested as a free osseous or free osteoseptocutaneous flap. The inclusion of an overlying skin paddle is possible as septocutaneous or musculocutaneous perforators from the peroneal artery and vein provide a viable blood supply to the area of skin of the lateral lower leg. The amount of skin that can be harvested can be limited by the ability to primarily close the defect, although skin grafting the donor site defect is also frequently performed successfully.

The sensory supply to the skin over the lateral calf is derived from the lateral sural cutaneous nerve, a branch of the common peroneal nerve, arising within or above the popliteal fossa. When harvested as part of the osteocutaneous fibula flap it can provide variable sensation to the accompanying skin paddle.

Preoperatively, clinical assessment begins with a thorough patient history and general physical examination. Claudication should alert the clinician of underlying arterio-occlusive disease. A more detailed examination of the perfusion status of the lower leg and foot is performed by looking for signs of limb deformity, previous surgery or trauma. Stigmata of peripheral arterial and/ or venous vascular disease include skin pallor or cyanosis, ulceration, cool skin temperature, sparse hair growth, and thickened nail beds. Palpation of the popliteal, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis pulses is mandatory. Questionable or absent pulses should be investigated further with Doppler flow assessment. Additional vascular imaging of the lower extremity is advocated to provide visual confirmation of adequate blood flow to the foot. CT angiography (CTA) (Fig. 44.18) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), although more invasive than Doppler ultrasound, provides superior anatomical detail and functional assessment of limb perfusion adequacy and quality of the donor vessels. Today, these modalities are utilized to provide the requisite information regarding distal blood flow and also to provide individualized patient data that can be used to perform virtual planning and patient specific implants and cutting guides

(Figs. 44.19 and 44.20). The goal of preoperative arteriography with respect to the free fibula flap is to identify patients in whom the harvest of this flap would result in either a nonviable flap or compromised extremity.

# Key Points

Along with physical exam, CTA or MRA are utilized to identify patients with poor distal blood supply, severe atherosclerosis or a dominant peroneal artery (Peroneal Artery Magna)  
- This data can then be utilized for individualized virtual planning for custom plates, cutting guides, and templates

# 44.3.2.1 Flap Harvesting

The patient is positioned supine on the operating table with the hip and knee slightly flexed and internally rotated and maintained in that position. The entire

lower extremity is prepared and draped in the standard fashion with circumferential exposure up to the groin. The sole of the foot is supported with a sandbag or a 1 L saline bag. Pertinent landmarks such as the head of the fibula, lateral malleolus, and peroneal nerve are outlined on the skin. A vertical mark joining the proximal and distal fibula represents the intermuscular septum. The necessary skin island is outlined over the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the fibula to capture the largest possible caliber septocutaneous perforators. A Doppler will reliably aid in identifying these perforators, ensuring the skin island is centered over them. A sterile tourniquet is applied, the lower extremity is exsanguinated and the tourniquet inflated to  $350~\mathrm{mmHg}$  (Fig. 44.21).

The incision begins at the anterior margin of the skin island and extends proximally and distally to within  $6\mathrm{cm}$  of the fibula head and lateral malleolus respectively to a level below the superficial fascia. Subfascial dissection in the lateral compartment proceeds toward the intermuscular septum where attention focuses on identi

fying and ensuring incorporation of the relevant perforators. Exposure and anterior retraction of the peroneus longus and brevis muscles allow their dissection off the fibula directed toward the anterior crural septum. Incision through the anterior crural septum provides entry into the anterior compartment exposing the anterior tibial vessels and deep peroneal nerve beneath, which are preserved and gently retracted anteriorly. The interosseous membrane is exposed and incised to reveal the tibialis posterior muscle and its typical chevron appearing fibers. Further dissection through this muscle at the distal portion of the fibula will reveal the peroneal vessels lying beneath running close to the medial aspect of the fibula. Attention now focuses on proximal and distal exposure of the fibula with circumferential subperiosteal dissection  $6\mathrm{cm}$  below the fibula head and  $6\mathrm{cm}$  proximal to the lateral malleolus. With the aid of curved periosteal elevators protecting the peroneal vessels immediately deep to the fibula, appropriate osteotomies can be made with the oscillating saw removing a small segment of fibula distally to provide space to retract the bone laterally. The pedicle can now be ligated and divided distally and the fibula is now able to be rotated laterally enabling easier and safer dissection of the pedicle in a distal to proximal fashion. Upon reaching the tibioperoneal trunk the peroneal artery and venae commitantes are isolated. The posterior incision of the skin island can now be performed down to the soleus muscle where it is optional to include a small cuff

of soleus and flexor hallucis longus in cases where musculocutaneous perforators are encountered. With the composite flap now isolated on its pedicle, the tourniquet is deflated and hemostasis of the donor bed is achieved (Fig. 44.22).

In instances where a bone-only flap is required, one need only make a linear skin incision without inclusion of a skin island. Preservation of the skin perforators in the lateral crural septum is unnecessary but the remainder of the flap harvest technique proceeds as described above.

Donor site closure is performed with loose approximation of muscles, with the flexor hallucis longus sutured to tibialis posterior to optimize postoperative great toe flexion. A suction drain is placed and secured. When the skin paddle dimensions are larger than  $4 - 5\mathrm{cm}$  in width, a split thickness skin graft may be necessary. Compartment syndrome from wound closure under excessive tension can produce disastrous ischemic complications. This can be harvested from the thigh and sutured to the skin paddle donor defect, followed by application of a bolster and posterior splint. While the patient is non-ambulatory, leg elevation is advised to minimize dependent edema. The cast and bolster are removed after 7 days at which time ambulation may commence.

Following division of the pedicle, the flap is transferred to the prepared recipient site. Preparation of the fibula at this stage is dependent upon the site of the

mandibular defect. For reconstruction of straight segments, fibula preparation is minimal, often with no osteotomies required. For defects where osteotomies are required to reproduce mandibular contour, one or more osteotomies may be necessary. The osteotomized fibula is then fixed to a pre-adapted reconstruction plate using fixation screws, and subsequently fixed in situ to the native mandibular defect.

The ever-increasing use of virtual surgical planning has provided reconstructive surgeons a new tool for providing preplanned, accurate, and customized reconstructive options for patients. With the use of patient-specific CT data from the head and neck as well as the lower extremity, reconstructive models, cutting guides, and custom plates can be provided by various vendors and potentially improve the accuracy of reconstructive efforts as well as save valuable operative time. Utilizing the cutting guides while the fibula is still attached to its pedicle will significantly decrease the amount of ischemic time of the flap that can lead to irreversible tissue damage or flap failure. Once the cutting guide is secured to the fibula, circumferential subperiosteal dissection is performed at the areas of the planned osteotomies which allows the pedicle to be protected while performing osteotomies with an oscillating saw. Once osteotomies are complete, the reconstruction plate can also be placed onto the fibula while still connected in the leg and the entire construct transferred to the head and neck field for insertion (Fig. 44.23).

Potential complications include acquired vascular insufficiency of the lower extremities that may be associated with atherosclerosis particularly in elderly patients. Preoperative imaging with CT angiography, MR angiography, or routine angiography can avoid limb-threatening ischemia. Almost all patients develop limited flexion capability of the hallux consistent with inclusion of the flexor hallucis longus muscle with the

flap. The common peroneal nerve is the nerve at risk during fibula flap harvest. It has both sensory and motor functions, with sensory disturbance reported in up to  $24\%$  of cases in either the superficial or deep peroneal nerve distribution [39]. Motor disturbances lead to weakness in dorsiflexion in about  $7\%$  of cases resulting from damage to peroneal nerve branches and associated equinovarus deformity [40]. Common peroneal nerve damage is avoided by limiting proximal dissection to greater than  $6\mathrm{cm}$  from the fibula head and avoidance of overzealous traction during proximal dissection.

# 44.3.2.2 Applications

The fibula flap has become the primary bone containing flap for use in head and neck reconstruction. Its use for mandible reconstruction is well described and was the recipient site for the first cases reported by Hidalgo [38]. It can also be used for maxillary reconstruction for partial or total maxillectomy defects. The flap's potentially long pedicle makes it particularly well suited for maxillary reconstruction; however, for larger defects the pedicle length may be compromised.

# 44.3.3 Scapula Free Flap

The scapula free flap was first transferred by Gilbert in 1979 [41]. This was after the anatomical description was done by Saijo [42].

The scapula free flap has proven to be an extremely valuable reconstructive option in head and neck surgery. Its ability to carry multiple skin flaps, latissimus dorsi muscle, serratus anterior muscle, and scapula bone, all based on a single pedicle, makes this system of flaps uniquely suited for the complex three-dimensional sculpting necessary in the head and neck. A distinct advantage in the elderly population is the unimpeded early postoperative ambulation not shared by the fibula and iliac crest flaps [43]. The main disadvantage of this flap is the need to reposition the patient in order to harvest the flap, preventing a two team approach.

The scapula is a triangular-shaped bone. A number of muscles attach and originate from the scapula. The triceps brachii muscle, teres minor, and teres major originate along the lateral aspect of the scapula from a superior to inferior direction. The medial aspect of the bone is the location of the insertion of the rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and the levator scapula in an inferior-superior direction. The infraspinatus occupies the regions inferior to the spine of the scapula while the supraspinatus the superior portion. The deltoid muscle originates along the inferior aspect of the spine of the scapula while the superior region is the location for the insertion of the trapezius muscle.

The blood supply to the region begins with the subscapular artery, a branch of the axillary artery. The circumflex scapular artery originates from the subscapular artery and divides into the superficial skin branches; a transverse, a descending branch, and a deep periosteal branch. The deep periosteal branch travels along the lateral border of the scapula giving perforators to the periosteum and bone.

# 44.3.3.1 Flap Harvesting

The harvesting of the scapula flap is done by placing the patient in a lateral decubitus position with the arm fully prepped.

In cases where a scapular skin paddle is to be included in the harvest, the area is marked taking advantage of the transverse cutaneous branch from the circumflex scapular artery or a dual skin flap may be designed with inclusion of the descending cutaneous branch in addition to the transverse (Fig. 44.24).

The incision is initiated medially and progresses laterally toward the lateral border of the scapula. The skin flap is raised in a suprafascial plane taking care to identify and not injure the transverse branch. Once the lateral border of the scapula is approached, the dissection is directed into the triangular space to identify the deep branch of the circumflex scapular artery. The bone perforators are identified and preserved. The teres minor and major muscles are incised from the bone taking care not to injure the periosteal feeders. The latissimus muscle is reflected from the inferior border of the scapula and the subscapularis muscle is freed. The area of bone to be harvested is marked out and the infraspinatus is reflected to expose the bone. A malleable retractor is placed under the scapula to protect the thoracic cavity and the bone cut is then made. Care should be taken superiorly to make sure that this cut does not encroach on the glenoid fossa or compromise the vascular pedicle

Fig. 44.25 Completed dissection of scapula flap with bilobed skin paddle, scapula bone and portion of latissimus muscle

to the bone or skin paddle. With the bone cut completed, the subscapularis muscle is then divided. The pedicle is then dissected toward the circumflex scapular artery and vein and the flap is mobilized and harvested (Fig. 44.25).

The closure of the scapula demands special attention in order to prevent winging of the scapula. Several bone holes are placed along the lateral aspect of the scapula and the teres muscles are then approximated to the scapula. The skin is mobilized and suction drains are placed followed by closure in a layered fashion.

Shoulder weakness results from division of the rotator cuff muscles teres major and minor, from the lateral border of the scapula during flap harvest. Restricted arm elevation, extension and adduction are the most common impaired shoulder movements [44]. The most significant and feared complication associated with the scapula flap harvest is compromise of the joint space during the osteotomy. Another potential complication is the winging of the scapula that can result from poor attention to closure with lack of approximation of the teres muscles to the bone using drilled holes or from injury to the long thoracic nerve. Intense postoperative physical therapy has also been shown to maximize shoulder mobility with return to premorbid function by 6 months post surgery [45, 46].

# 44.3.3.2 Applications

Due to the flexible nature of the skin paddle relative to the bone of the scapula flap, this flap has been described as an ideal reconstruction method for maxillary and midfacial defects. The flap does have a relatively short pedicle length when compared to the fibula osteocutaneous flap and therefore the reconstructive surgeon should be prepared to harvest a vein graft for this indication. Its use for mandibular reconstruction is relegated as an

alternative bone reservoir for patients who may not be fibula flap candidates due to severe atherosclerosis or anatomic variation of the distal extremity. Though the bone of the scapula can be substantial, in some patients, it may not be adequate for dental implant placement. Furthermore, the length of bone that can be utilized from the scapula is also limited. These factors as well as the patient positioning are primary considerations for use of this flap if a fibula flap is not available.

# 44.3.4 Iliac Crest Free Flap

The iliac crest free flap arguably provides the greatest quantity of bone stock for head and neck reconstruction. Its site distant from the ablative head and neck team permits synchronous harvest, while its inherent shape is well suited for reconstruction of the facial bones [47]. This flap is avoided by many surgeons due to a technically demanding flap harvest, relatively short vascular pedicle, and small caliber vessels. Others however have shown excellent outcomes with this flap [48].

Taylor et al. [49], and Sanders and Mayou [50] in 1979 separately identified and reported the deep circumflex iliac artery and vein as the most reliable and favorable pedicle for free transfer of the ilium. Taylor et al. [51] further elucidated the endosteal and periosteal blood supply of the ilium through dye injection studies. Experimental work by Ramasastry et al. [52], in 1984 identified the ascending branch of the DCIA as the primary blood supply to the internal oblique muscle allowing for composite flap transfer.

The iliac crest possesses a natural curvature that makes it ideal for reconstruction of mandibular defects. The height of bone that can be harvested from this site allows for the restoration of the height of a native dentate mandible. The anterior ilium is located between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the tubercle of the ilium. The inguinal ligament attaches to the ASIS laterally and medially to the pubic symphysis. Inferior to the attachment of the inguinal ligament is the sartorius muscle attachment. Lateral to the sartorius is the origin of the tensor fascia latae muscle. This muscle attaches along the inferior aspect of the lateral crest for a few centimeters in a lateral direction. Directly lateral to the tensor fascia latae, is the iliotibial tract. Behind the iliotibial tract is the gluteus medius muscle. The medial surface of the ilium is covered by the iliacus muscle. The primary blood vessel in this region is the deep circumflex iliac artery which courses superficial to the iliacus muscle medially. The lateral cutaneous branch of the iliohypogastric nerve (L1, L2), and the lateral cutaneous branch of the subcostal nerve (T12, L1). The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve crosses over the artery medially as it approaches its take off from the external iliac vessels.

# 44.3.4.1 Flap Harvest

The patient is placed in a supine position with a bump under the hip to be harvested. The incision for the harvest of the DCIA flap is begun just lateral and above the palpable femoral pulse. The incision in then continued in a curved fashion following the contour of the iliac bone in a posterior superior direction (Fig. 44.26).

After the incision of the skin and subcutaneous fat, the external oblique muscle is incised allowing for the visualization of the internal oblique muscle. This muscle is readily identified due to the direction of the muscle fibers which run in an opposite direction from the external oblique muscle. The internal oblique is incised  $2\mathrm{cm}$  cephalad and along the crest. Once the oblique muscles are transected, the transversus abdominus is then visualized. The DCIA may be palpated at this time. The DCIA runs in a fibrous tunnel between the transversus abdominus and the iliacus muscles and is identified by incising the transversus abdominus approximately  $2\mathrm{cm}$  medial to the iliac crest. Alternatively, the ascending branch of the DCIA can be found on the undersurface of the internal oblique muscle and traced proximally to its take off from the DCIA. The DCIA is then dissected medially to its take off from the external iliac artery. To expose the bone of the ilium, an incision of the iliacus muscle is performed a safe distance inferior to the path of the DCIA. The muscles along the lateral/gluteal aspect of the bone are reflected and the planned amount of bone to be harvested is marked. The bone cuts are made while protecting the pedicle. Once the pedicle dissection and osteotomies are complete, the flap is can be harvested (Figs. 44.27 and 44.28). The bone harvest can be achieved in two forms, full thickness or split thickness. The advantage of the latter is decreased donor site deformity (Fig. 44.29).

Ventral hernias results from weakening of the abdominal wall through harvest of the internal oblique muscle and denervation of the rectus muscle whose motor nerves run in the neurovascular plane between

Immediate postoperative and short-term effects on ambulation are common following iliac crest free flaps, with antalgic gait and weakness of the operated hip being usual sequelae. Reports in the literature have demonstrated through controlled orthopedic objective testing that ambulation resolves by 6 months postoperatively [54, 55].

# 44.3.4.2 Applications

Due to the DCIA flap's excellent bone stock, its use for mandibular reconstruction has been touted by some as ideal. Indeed, the flap provides excellent height and width of bone that the other donor sites cannot provide. Similarly, it has also been described for use in maxillary reconstruction. However, the flap's difficult harvest, short and small caliber pedicle and need for abdominal wall reconstruction at closure has decreased the appeal of this flap for head and neck reconstruction. When used for mandible reconstruction, the bone volume is excellent for relatively short and lateral defects of the mandible. This flap is less desirable for longer defects or for defects that involve the symphysis or condyle/ramus portions of the mandible. The flap's short pedicle is of little concern for most mandible reconstructions as long as the neck vessels are not depleted due to previous surgery or radiation therapy. For maxillary reconstruction, its use is limited primarily by its short pedicle length which will require vein grafting in nearly every case. If a soft tissue component is required, the skin associated with the DCIA is typically very thick and inflexible. Utilizing the internal oblique muscle instead of a skin paddle can decrease the bulk of the soft tissue component of this flap.

# Conclusion

The application of microvascular reconstruction to head and neck defects has a nearly 70-year history with the early utilization consisting of perilous, high-risk procedures that were rarely implemented. Today, these procedures have become nearly ubiquitous in head and units around the world. The application of these techniques to head and neck defects has provided much needed options in the reconstructive algorithms for the challenging cases oral and maxillofacial surgeons encounter, but they also provide a reliable and, in many cases, the best suited option for optimal primary reconstruction for our patients. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to microvascular flap options available to the head and neck reconstructive surgeon. Certainly, other flaps and techniques exist outside what has been presented here. However, the vast majority of head and neck defects can be managed with these flaps and they represent the bulk of what is utilized in practice today.
