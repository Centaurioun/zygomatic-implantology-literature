# 73.1 Introduction

For many cosmetic surgeons, rhinoplasty is one of the most challenging surgical procedures. A clear understanding of nasal anatomy is critical in order to provide an aesthetic result that does not compromise nasal function. Developing a pattern of analysis of the nose is vital for proper diagnosis and for determining the most appropriate treatment plan. Numerous rhinoplastic techniques have been described. Some surgeons favor an endonasal approach, whereas others believe that an external approach is more desirable. Each surgeon must become familiar with all technique options in order to address the wide variety of challenges of rhinoplasty surgery.

The goal of this chapter is to give a broad overview of the diagnosis and treatment of nasal deformities. It is by no means exhaustive because multiple textbook volumes have been written on this subject. The reader should gain an understanding of nasal anatomy and determine how to systematically analyze the nose. Both endonasal and external rhinoplasty are described.

Fig. 73.1 Spatial descriptors. In describing the relationship of one anatomic unit to another, many terms are used. The standard relationships are anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior. The nose is also described in terms of dorsal, basal, caudal, and cranial (or cephalic) positions. (Adapted from Austermann [50], p. 1378.)

# 73.1.1Nasal Anatomy

A clear understanding of nasal anatomy is important to successfully perform nasal procedures and decrease the incidence of complications.

# 73.1.2Surface Anatomy

The terms used to describe the surface anatomy of the nose are important in nasal form analysis and for treatment plan formulation (▶ Box 73.1). For descriptive purposes, the spatial relationships are described as cephalic, caudal, dorsal, basal, anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior (Fig. 73.1).

# Box 73.1 Surface anatomy of the nose

Glabella: the most forward projecting point of the forehead in the midline at the level of the supraorbital ridges

Radix: the junction between the frontal bone and the dorsum of the nose

Rhinion: the anterior tip at the end of the suture of the nasal bones

Dorsum: the anterior surface of the nose formed by the nasal bones and the upper lateral cartilages

Supratip break: the slight depression in the nasal profile at the point where the nasal dorsum joins the lobule of the nasal tip

Infratip lobule: the portion of the tip lobule that is found between the tip-defining points and the columellarlobular angle

Tip-defining points: there are four tip defining points: the supratip break, the columellar-lobular angle, and the most projected area on each side of the nasal tip formed by the lower lateral cartilages

Alar sidewall: the rounded eminence forming the lateral nostril wall

Alar-facial junction: the depressed groove formed on the face where the ala joins the face

Columella: the skin that separates the nostrils at the base of the nose

![](images/d638e6ec5f6221947455acb7bae573d7cad35aa954f655b8d43414a1de704f6b.jpg)  
Fig. 73.2 Nasal musculature. The muscles of the nose are grouped into the elevators (light blue), the depressors (dark blue), the compressors (light gray), and the dilators (dark gray). (Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 17.)

# 73.1.3Skin and Soft Tissue

The soft tissue that overlies the bone and cartilage may influence the final result of rhinoplasty. The thickness of the skin will determine how it will redrape after performing a rhinoplasty. The skin thickness varies along the dorsum of the nose. The skin is fairly thick and mobile in the region of the nasion. It quickly thins over the nasal dorsum and is generally the thinnest and most mobile in the middorsal region (rhinion). In the distal third of the nose, the skin tends to be more thick and adherent and has an increased sebaceous content.

A patient with thin skin will show dramatic changes with alteration of the underlying bone and cartilage, and this limits room for error because little is camouflaged by the thickness of the skin. Conversely, for thick-skinned individuals, more aggressive sculpturing of the nasal skeleton must be performed in order to effect significant changes. Although thick skin may mask imperfections, it does not redrape as well and can result in underlying fibrosis and the formation of a pollybeak deformity (supratip scarring). Better results are possible with thin-skinned patients; however, the margin for error is smaller. The surgeon must sometimes modify the technique depending on the type of skin of the patient.

# 73.1.4Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System and Nasal Musculature

The muscles of the nose are encased in the nasal superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). This is a fibromuscular layer that separates the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the nasal cartilage and bone. The SMAS of the nose is in continuity with the SMAS of the face. During rhinoplastic surgery, the dissection is performed beneath the SMAS. Violating the SMAS will often result in increased bleeding, scarring, and postoperative edema.

# Dissection should be in the sub-SMAS plane to avoid bleeding, scarring, and postoperative edema.

The muscles of the nose can be divided into four categories: the elevators, the depressors, the compressors, and the dilators (Fig. 73.2). The muscles of significance are the paired depressor septi nasi. These muscles can result in drooping of the nasal tip during smiling. This added tension on the nasal tip must be recognized preoperatively and addressed by resection in order to achieve a cosmetic result [1].

Fig. 73.3 Arteries of the external nose. The arterial supply of the external nose comes from the branches of the external carotid artery (dark blue) and the internal carotid artery (light blue). (Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 18.)

# 73.1.5Blood Supply

There is a rich blood supply to the subdermal vascular plexus of the nose that arises from branches of both the internal and the external carotid arteries. The blood supply from the internal carotid artery that supplies the external nose includes the dorsal nasal artery and the external nasal artery. The dorsal nasal artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery. The external nasal artery is a branch of the anterior ethmoid artery.

The external nose is also supplied by branches of the facial artery and the internal maxillary artery, which originate from the external carotid artery. The facial artery branches include the angular artery, lateral nasal artery, alar artery, septal artery, and superior labial artery (Fig. 73.3).

The internal nose is supplied by the internal and external carotid branches. The ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid, branches into the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. The anterior ethmoidal artery supplies the anterosuperior part of the septum and the lateral nasal wall. The posterior ethmoid artery supplies the septum, lateral nasal wall, and superior turbinate [2].

The internal maxillary artery branches include the sphenopalatine artery and the greater palatine artery. The sphenopalatine artery supplies most of the posterior part of the nasal septum, lateral wall of the nose, roof, and part of the nasal floor. The greater palatine artery supplies a portion of the anterior and inferior portion of the nasal septum (Fig. 73.4) [2].

The surgically significant area for internal nasal bleeding is known as Kiesselbach's plexus (also termed Little's area). This is the area in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum that is a common site of epistaxis. It is where the sphenopalatine, greater palatine, superior labial artery, and anterior ethmoid arteries anastomosis (Fig. 73.5) [2]. The venous drainage of the nose is primarily from the facial and ophthalmic veins.

$\Theta$  Kiesselbach's plexus (also termed Little's area) is a common site of epistaxis. This plexus is formed by the confluence of the sphenopalatine, greater palatine, superior labial, and anterior ethmoid arteries.

One concern during nasal surgery is the possibility of compromised blood flow to the nasal tip if the surgeon performs an external rhinoplasty. The blood supply to

Fig. 73.4 Arteries of the lateral nasal wall. The arterial supply of the lateral nasal wall arises from branches of the external carotid artery (black) and the internal carotid artery (blue). (Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 23.)

the nasal tip has been analyzed by lymphoscintigraphic studies, cadaver dissections, and histologic sections [3, 4]. The conclusion is that the primary blood supply to the nasal tip comes from the bilateral lateral nasal arteries that course in a plane superficial to the alar cartilages in the subdermal plexus approximately  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  above the alar groove. Thus, a columellar incision does not compromise tip blood supply. Also, there are no significant veins and minimal lymphatics in the columellar region [3, 4]. Some surgeons believe that external rhinoplasty remains more edematous for longer postoperative periods than an endonasal rhinoplasty.

# 73.1.6Bone and Cartilage

The structure of the nose consists of the paired nasal bones as well as the frontal process of the maxilla. The bone is thickest near the junction with the frontal bone and tapers as it joins with the upper lateral cartilages.

The upper lateral cartilages are in intimate contact with the nasal bones and underlie the nasal bones for approximately  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$ . The connection between the nasal bones and the upper lateral cartilages should not be violated because this may disrupt the internal nasal valve, causing nasal obstruction and asymmetry. The internal nasal valve is formed by the junction of the upper lateral cartilages and the nasal septum.

The lower lateral cartilages compose the lower third of the nose and connect to the upper lateral cartilages in a union described as the scroll. There are various configurations of the scroll [5, 6]. The scroll is described as interlocked (52%), overlapping (20%), end to end (17%), or opposed (11%) (Fig. 73.6). The scroll provides significant support to the nasal tip. When performing an endonasal rhinoplasty, this area is violated by the intercartilaginous incision (Figs. 73.7, 73.8, and 73.9). The lower lateral cartilage is divided into medial and lateral crura. The medial crura are in intimate contact with the nasal septum and provide tip support. The lateral crura extend superiorly and form dense fibroareolar tissue attachments with the pyriform aperture. The intermediate crus is the diverging of the medial crus before turning to become the lateral crus proper. The highest point of the intermediate crus is an important surgical landmark known as the tip-defining point (Fig. 73.10).

The nasal septum is formed by both bone and cartilage. The ethmoid and vomer provide bony support posteriorly. The quadrangular cartilage provides support anteriorly (Fig. 73.11).

Support for the nasal tip is classified into major and minor divisions. The major tip support comes from the size, shape, and strength of the lower lateral cartilages,

![](images/793b66b5b1daab5587488a7fddb7e1d891196d75e546fee9cea36f1295c487db.jpg)  
Fig. 73.6 Configurations of the scroll. The relationship of the upper lateral and lower lateral cartilages is termed the scroll. Anatomic studies have identified four common configurations: interlocked  $(52\%)$ , overlapping  $(20\%)$ , end to end  $(17\%)$ , and opposed  $(11\%)$ . (Adapted from Lam and Williams [5])

the attachment of the medial crura of the lower lateral cartilage to the caudal septum, and the fibrous attachment of the lower lateral cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage. The minor tip support comes from the nasal spine, the membranous septum, the cartilaginous dorsum, the sesamoid complexes, the interdomal ligaments, and the alar attachments to the skin (▶ Box 73.2) [5].

# Box 73.2 Tip support mechanisms

The three major tip support mechanisms are as follows:

1. The size, shape, and strength of the lower lateral cartilages  
2. The attachment of the medial crura to the caudal septum  
3. The attachment of the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages

The minor tip support mechanisms are as follows:

1. The interdomal ligament  
2. The sesamoid complex extending the support of the lateral crura to the piriform aperture  
3. The attachment of the alar cartilages to the overlying skin  
4. Cartilaginous septal dorsum  
5. Nasal spine  
6. The membranous septum

Fig. 73.8 Intercartilaginous incision. The intercartilaginous incision, between the upper and the lower cartilage, allows access to the nasal dorsum. Note the incision does not violate the nasal valve

# 73.1.7Nerves

The sensory nerve supply to the skin of the external nose is provided by the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Branches of the supra-trochlear and infratrochlear nerves supply the skin in the region of the radix and rhinion. The lower half of the nose is supplied by the infraorbital nerve and the external nasal branch of the anterior ethmoidal nerve (a branch of the nasociliary nerve that arises from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve) (Fig. 73.12).

![](images/8308c6ba4e77555271451ca85ae43cb6f00089671e4c16ad3286b8ea556b7976.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 73.9 Connecting intercartilaginous and partial transfixion incisions. The intercartilaginous incision extends along the upper edge of the lateral crus to connect with the transfixion incision. This will provide access for a septoplasty during internal rhinoplasty

The main sensory nerve supply to the nasal septum comes from the internal nasal nerve (a branch of the anterior ethmoidal nerve) and the nasopalatine nerve (Fig. 73.13). The lateral nasal wall sensation is supplied by the anterior ethmoidal nerve, branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion, branches of the greater palatine nerve, the infraorbital nerve, and the anterior superior alveolar nerve.

Parasympathetic innervation is derived from branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion, which are derived from cranial nerve VII. Some sympathetic branches reach the nasal cavity via the nasociliary nerve [2, 7].

# 73.1.8Nasal Valve

The airflow through the nose is regulated by the internal and external nasal valves. The external nasal valve comprises the lower lateral cartilage and the nasal septum and floor. Collapse of the external nasal valve can sometimes be noted when the nares become occluded on even gentle inspiration. This problem is seen in patients with narrow nostrils, a projecting nasal tip, and thin alar sidewalls. External nasal valve collapse is usually seen in patients who have had previous rhinoplasty surgery and excessive trimming of the cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilages. It is also seen with increased age and in facial nerve paralysis. The external nasal valve collapse can be corrected by deprojecting the overprojected nose, realigning the lateral crura into a more caudal orientation, and placing alar batten grafts to provide structural support and prevent collapse [8].

Fig. 73.10 a-c, Anatomy of the lower lateral cartilages. The lower lateral cartilages are often described as having a lateral crus, a medial crus, and an intermediate crus. The intermediate crus is the

most projected portion of the lower lateral cartilages, and these form two of the tip-defining points seen on nasal tip analysis. (a-c, Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 21.)

$\bullet$  Fig. 73.11 Anatomy of the nasal septum. The nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, the vomer, and the quadrangular cartilage. (Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 22.)

The external nasal valve formed the strength and support of the lower lateral cartilages. Previous rhinoplasty or weak lower lateral cartilages can result the nares to become obstructed even with gentle inspiration. Treatment may involve cartilage grafts to support the lateral crus of the lower lateral cartilage.

The internal nasal valve is formed by the junction of the septum with the upper lateral cartilages. The angle formed should be a minimum of  $10^{\circ} - 15^{\circ}$  to maintain patency. Deviation of the nasal septum or separation of the upper lateral cartilages from the nasal bones can lead to obstruction. This problem is also seen after

rhinoplasty, if the patient has had weakening of the upper and lower lateral cartilages. These patients often have a pinched appearance in the supra-alar region. The Cottle test is used to evaluate obstruction at the internal valve by using a finger to distract the cheek and lateral wall of the nose, thereby opening the valve. If nasal airflow is dramatically improved, then the internal valve may require correction. These patients often have symptomatic relief by the use of external taping devices. Surgical correction involves the placement of spreader grafts between the septum and the upper lateral cartilages to increase the angle at this junction [8-10].

Fig. 73.12 Sensory nerves of the external nose. The sensory innervation of the nose is derived from the V1 (ophthalmic: black) and from V2 (maxillary: blue) divisions of the trigeminal nerve. (Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 19.)

![](images/3320c39f11e1aae41dbe5242733254068c26de4d4d8b4aec79f76eee8a16fcb4.jpg)  
Fig. 73.13 Sensory nerves of the nasal septum. The main sensory nerve supply comes from the internal nasal nerve (a branch of the anterior ethmoidal nerve V1 (black) and the nasopalatine nerve V2 (blue). (Adapted from Jewett [51], p. 19.)

The internal nasal valve is formed by the junction of the septum and upper lateral cartilages. Dorsal reduction or scarring of underlying mucosa can result in a decreased angle between the upper lateral cartilages and the nasal septum and reduce nasal air flow. Spreader grafts are commonly used to open the internal nasal valve.

# Tip

A Cottle test can be used to assess the internal nasal valve. Using a finger, distract the cheek and lateral wall of the nose laterally. If breathing improves, consider corrective measures for the internal nasal valve such as spreader grafts. Another sign of internal valve collapse is patients that wear external taping devices at night to be able to breathe better.

# 73.2 Cosmetic Evaluation

The cosmetic evaluation begins in the same way as with any examination, by eliciting the chief complaint of the patient. The patient should be given a mirror and a cotton-tipped applicator to point out specific cosmetic concerns. Following this, a thorough medical history should be obtained. Specific attention should be directed toward obtaining a history of nasal trauma, nasal obstruction, previous nasal surgery, and medications (including over-the-counter and herbal medications).

# 73.2.1 Psychiatric Stability

In addition to analyzing the nose, the surgeon needs to assess whether the patient is psychologically prepared for a cosmetic procedure. Patients should have realistic expectations and motivations. A patient who is internally motivated (e.g., wishes to improve self-esteem) to have the procedure is a better candidate than one who desires the procedure for external reasons (e.g., spouse wants them to have it done) [11, 12].

The surgeon should beware of patients who are indecisive, rude, uncooperative, or depressed, who have unrealistic expectations, or who have significant personality disorders because they may never be satisfied. Other warning signs of poor patients are those who overly flatter, are talkative, consider themselves to be a very important patient, have minimal or no deformity, are surgeon shoppers, are price hagglers, or are involved in litigation. Most importantly, do not operate on a patient that you do not like [11-14].

# 73.2.2 General Facial Analysis

Before performing a specific analysis of the nose, a global assessment of the face and its proportions should be done. Refer to  $\triangleright$  Chap. 53 for additional information on facial analysis in orthognathic surgery.

# 73.2.3 Nasal Analysis

The nasal examination should be performed in a systematic manner so that the proper diagnosis is obtained (Figs. 73.14 and 73.15).

# 73.3 General Assessment

# 73.3.1 Skin

The skin should be assessed for its thickness, mobility, and sebaceous gland content. Any pigmottations or scars should also be noted. Thick skin does not redrape well after rhinoplasty.

Surgical changes made to patients with thin skin will be easily seen. Surgical errors are also more visible in these patients. Patients with thick skin will require more aggressive changes to the underlying structures in order to see noticeable change.

Any gross asymmetries in all views should be noted.

The radix should lie in a vertical plane somewhere between the lash line and the supratarsal folds. In addition, it should be  $4 - 9\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the corneal plane (see Fig. 73.16).

# Nasal Dorsum

In women, the nasal dorsum should lie approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to a line drawn from the radix to the nasal tip. In men, the nasal dorsum should lie on this line or slightly in front of it (see  $\square$  Fig. 73.16).

The length of the nose (radix to tip) can be measured clinically or on photographs taken during the initial examination. The ideal nasal length should approximate the distance from stomion to menton if the lower facial height is proportionate to the middle facial height (glabella to subnasale). If the lower face height is not proportionate, it is best to estimate the nasal length as 0.67 times the middle facial height.

# Nasal Tip Definition

The nose should have four tip-defining points that when drawn on the nose in the frontal view appear as two equilateral triangles (Fig. 73.17). These points include the supratip break, the columellar-lobular angle, and the two tip-defining points (the most projected portion of the nasal tip).

The nasal tip should have four tip defining points including the supratip break, the columellar-lobular angle, and the most projected points of each lower lateral cartilage. Aggressive tip refining with cartilage resection or aggressive suturing can result in a single point of projection of the lower lateral cartilages. This is a giveaway for a poorly done rhinoplasty.

# Nasal Tip Projection

Nasal tip projection can be defined as the distance that the tip (pronasale) projects anterior in the facial plane [15]. Perception of nasal tip projection can be influenced

Fig. 73.18 Goode's method of nasal projection. This method is sometimes used to determine adequacy of nasal projection. If the nasofrontal angle is between  $36^{\circ}$  and  $40^{\circ}$ , then the length of a perpendicular line through the nasal tip should be 0.55–0.6 the length of the nasal dorsum.  $\mathbf{x} =$  nasal length. (Adapted from Austermann [50], p. 1380.)

by many factors: upper lip length, nasolabial angle, nasofrontal angle, dorsal hump, and chin projection. There are several methods to determine whether the nasal tip projection is adequate. Most cosmetic rhinoplasty procedures are designed to preserve tip projection.

The simplest method to remember is Simons' method, which states that the lip-to-tip ratio is 1:1. Essentially, the length of the upper lip (from subnasale to labrale superioris) should be equal to the nasal projection (measured from subnasale to pronasale). This method may be invalid because of the wide variation in lip lengths [16].

The Goode method is another way of determining nasal projection. Using the Goode method, a line is drawn from the radix to the nasal tip. A second line is drawn from the radix to the alar columellar junction. A third line is drawn perpendicular to this and passes through the nasal tip. Goode's analysis states that if the nasofacial angle is between  $36^{\circ}$  and  $40^{\circ}$ , then the length of the perpendicular line passing through the nasal tip should be 0.55-0.6 of the length of the nasal dorsum (Fig. 73.18) [16].

![](images/79ba00e2de3a66b13d91d5834b231e2c0577dfc11e83a4fd647a67bc2af6b4f1.jpg)

Gunter and Rohrich [17] describe another technique of assessing nasal tip projection. If the nasal dorsal length is appropriate, the tip projection should be 0.67 times the ideal nasal length. The ideal nasal length should be equal to the distance from stomion to menton or 1.6 times the distance from the nasal tip to stomion. The tip projection is measured from the alar facial junction to the nasal tip [17]. This method is subject to a great deal of facial variation.

In addition, a vertical line drawn from the most projected portion of the upper lip should divide the nose in two equal halves between the alar facial groove and the nasal tip. If the anterior portion is greater than  $60\%$ , then the nose is likely to be overprojected (Fig. 73.19) [17].

# Nasal Tip Rotation

The nasal tip rotation is evaluated by the nasolabial angle and the columellar-lobular angle. Nasolabial angle is defined as the angle formed by lines that are tangential to the columella of the nose and the philtrum of the lip and intersect at the subnasale. In women, this should be approximately  $95^{\circ} - 110^{\circ}$ , whereas in men, this should be  $90^{\circ} - 95^{\circ}$ . Lip position may be dependent on tooth position. The columellar-lobular angle is defined as the angle formed by the intersection of a line tangential to the columella and a line tangential to the infratip lobule. This angle is normally between  $30^{\circ}$  and  $45^{\circ}$ .

![](images/2465b9d3fc0fedeaedc3b8c6031a5fa9b25e5abf023548c5254d5332f928591f.jpg)  
Fig. 73.19 Nasal projection. A vertical line through the most projected part of the upper lip should divide the nose into two equal parts. If the nasal tip is greater than  $60\%$ , then the nose may be over-projected

# Tip Support

The strength of the cartilage in the tip of the nose is apparent when one presses on the tip. A nose with poor support may require cartilaginous struts to counteract the inherently weakened tip from the rhinoplasty. The effect of facial animation should also be noted. Some patients have overactive depressor septi nasi muscles, which result in a drooping nasal tip on smiling. The columella show on a lateral view should be  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  below the inferior alar rim [13].

# 73.3.2.2Frontal View

# Width of Nasal Dorsum

The width of the nasal body and tip should be approximately  $80\%$  of the alar base width. This is assuming that the alar base is in proper anatomic proportions. The alar base width should approximate the intercanthal distance. If the width of the nasal dorsum is significantly greater than  $80\%$ , then the lateral nasal osteotomies should be considered. The eyebrows should gracefully flow into the nasal dorsum analogous to a gull wing in flight.

The alar rims and columella should also be a gently curving line that appears as a bird in flight.

# Alar Width

The alar base width should approximate the intercanthal distance. Seldom is the nasal width less than the intercanthal dimension.

Fig. 73.20 Columella-to-lobule ratio. The columella-to-lobule ratio should be 2:1

# 73.3.2.3Basal View

From a basal view, the columella-to-lobule ratio should be 2:1. Nostril size and shape should also be noted. An aesthetic nostril is teardrop-shaped, but there is a great amount of ethnic variation (Fig. 73.20).

# 73.3.2.4Oblique View

The oblique view is most natural and sometimes more revealing than standard photographs. It demonstrates the flow of subunits and facial harmony. The three-quarter view is how we usually see each other in routine interaction.

# 73.3.3Functional Considerations

Although the patient desires cosmetic correction of the nose, the functional significance of the nose should be closely considered. Nasal airflow through both the internal and the external nasal valves should be evaluated. The septum should be evaluated for deviation and perforations. The septum is often a good site for harvesting autogenous cartilage for grafting. The turbinates should be evaluated for hypertrophy. Rhinoscopy with a nasal speculum can be performed both before and after the administration of a topical decongestant.

# 73.3.4Photographs

The examination is not complete without standardized facial photographs. The standard facial photographs should include frontal, right, and left lateral views; right and left oblique views; and a high and low basal view. Close-up views are taken if warranted. The photographs are beneficial from a medicolegal standpoint, and they

also allow the surgeon to study the nose in more detail and to develop a surgical plan.

# Tip

Take two sets of presurgical photographs: one set at the preoperative appointment and one set the morning of surgery. You can take all the after pictures you want, but if your preoperative photos are not good, you will not be able to show the changes you made.

# 73.4 Anesthesia

Proper anesthesia of the nose is important to ensure minimal distortion of the tissues and to provide adequate hemostasis. Before injecting the nose, cottonoids or cotton-tipped applicators soaked in  $4\%$  cocaine or oxymetazoline are placed in each nostril to constrict the mucous membranes of the turbinates. If the rhinoplasty is to be performed under sedation, cocaine is preferred because of its anesthetic properties. If the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, oxymetazoline is sufficient.

Three cottonoids are placed in each nostril: one along the middle turbinate, one along the superior nasal vault, and one along the inferomedial septum.

Local anesthesia is achieved with  $2\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. In an endonasal rhinoplasty, the following areas are injected:

$0.5\mathrm{mL}$  deposited at the junction of each upper and lower lateral cartilage (intercartilaginous area)

$0.5\mathrm{mL}$  deposited in the region of each marginal incision  
$3\mathrm{mL}$  along the nasal dorsum and lateral nasal bones (hugging periosteum)  
1 mL along the nasal septum  
$0.5\mathrm{mL}$  at each alar base  
1 mL at each infraorbital nerve  
1 mL at the nasal tip

For external rhinoplasty, the following additional area is injected:

1 mL to the columella

# 73.5 Incisions/Sequencing

Multiple incision techniques are used to gain access to the cartilage and bone support of the nose.

# 73.5.1 Complete Transfixion

This incision provides access to the caudal septum, medial crura, and nasal spine. The incision is made with

a no. 15 blade, beginning just caudal to the superior caudal end of the nasal septum. The incision extends inferiorly through the membranous septum, following the cephalic margin of the medial crura (Fig. 73.21a; see also Fig. 73.7). It results in ptosis and deprojection of the nose.

# 73.5.2Partial Transfixion

This incision is similar to the complete transfixion incision except that it stops at the level of the medial footpads of the lower lateral cartilages. The advantage of this incision is that the attachments of the medial footpads of the lower lateral cartilages to the caudal septum are not disrupted (see Figs. 73.7 and 73.21b).

# 73.5.3Hemitransfixion

This incision is a complete transfixion incision that is performed on only one side of the membranous septum. It does not traverse both mucosal surfaces, and therefore, some attachments of the medial crura to the caudal septum are maintained. Access to the nasal septum is good with this incision; however, delivery of the lower lateral cartilage on the side opposite to the incision is difficult (see Figs. 73.7 and 73.21c).

# 73.5.4Killian Incision

This incision is seldom used in rhinoplasty. It is a useful incision to gain access to the nasal septum if only a septoplasty is to be performed. The incision is made several millimeters cephalad to the caudal edge of the septum. It can be extended onto the nasal floor if needed.

# 73.5.5Intercartilaginous Incision

This incision is made at the junction of the upper and lower lateral cartilages. The nare is elevated superiorly with a double skin hook. A no. 15 blade should pass below the lower lateral cartilage and above the upper lateral cartilages. This incision is typically made after a transfixion incision. The intercartilaginous incision is then connected to the transfixion incision (Fig. 73.22; see also Figs. 73.8 and 73.9).

# 73.5.6Intracartilaginous Incision

This incision is made through both the vestibular nasal mucosa and a portion of the lower lateral cartilages. This incision is similar to the intercartilaginous incision

Fig. 73.21 Transfixion incisions. a A complete transfixion incision is made caudal to both the medial crura and through the membranous septum. b A partial transfixion incision is similar except the incision stops short of the medial footpads of the medial crura. c A  
hemitransfixion incision is a complete transfixion incision that is performed on only one side; therefore, the other medial crura and footpad are not violated

except that it is made  $3 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the junction of the upper and lower lateral cartilages. This incision in effect performs a complete cephalic strip of the lower lateral cartilages without the need for delivering the cartilage. The disadvantage is that the lower lateral cartilage is not directly visualized, and it may, therefore, be difficult to achieve symmetry between the right and the left sides.

# 73.5.7Rim/Marginal Incision

This incision parallels the caudal edges of the lower lateral cartilages. The incision is used in combination with an intercartilaginous incision in an endonasal rhinoplasty. The two incisions allow the lower lateral cartilage to be delivered and visualized. This allows the surgeon to more accurately trim the cartilage if needed. In an

open rhinoplasty, this incision is combined with a trans-columellar incision in order to gain access to the lower lateral cartilage and nasal dorsum (Fig. 73.23).

# 73.5.8Transcolumnellar Incision

This incision is made through the thinnest portion of the columella at a level just superior to the flaring of the medial crura. The incision can be made with a notched V in the center of the columella or as a "stair step." This

will break up the scar and assist in closure. This incision is connected with a marginal incision bilaterally for open rhinoplasty (see  $\square$  Fig. 73.23).

The two principal techniques are the endonasal and external rhinoplasty. Each of these techniques is described in general terms, in the order in which the authors perform them. Other surgeons may perform the sequence in a different order (▶ Boxes 73.3 and 73.4).

# 73.6 Septoplasty

In rhinoplasty surgery, there are several reasons to access the nasal septum: (1) to correct nasal airflow obstruction, (2) to assist in the correction of asymmetries, and (3) to harvest cartilage for tip grafting.

$\Theta$  Reasons to access the nasal septum include correcting septal deviation and airflow obstruction, correcting nasal asymmetries, and harvesting of cartilage for grafting.

Access to the nasal septum in an endonasal approach is through a partial-transfixion incision, which is connected to bilateral intercartilaginous incisions. The partial-transfixion incision can be extended to the nasal floor on the side on which the septoplasty is to be performed. After completing the incisions, the caudal aspect of the nasal septum is exposed by dissecting the mucoperichondrium from one side. Two tunnels will be developed, one superior and the other inferior, that will ultimately be joined so that wide exposure of the septum is obtained [18]. Initially, sharp dissection is done with a no. 15 blade or scissors to expose a portion of the caudal septum. The perichondrium is gently scored using a no. 15 blade. A dental amalgam condenser is then used in a sweeping motion to develop a plane between the perichondrium and the nasal septum (Fig. 73.24). Once this plane of dissection is started, a Freer or Cottle elevator can be used to complete the septal envelope (Fig. 73.25). The mucoperichondrium is tightly bound at the junction of the septum and the maxillary crest.

# Tip

After gently scoring the septal perichondrium with a #15 blade, rub a large amalgam condenser in a sweeping motion over the area scored to assist in the elevation of the perichondrium. Many surgeons think they are subperichondrial and are not, and this will result in mucosal tears and postsurgical bleeding.

Once the septum is exposed, it can be treated in one of four ways: (1) resection, (2) morselization, (3) segmental transection, and (4) swinging door flaps [18]. Submucosal resection allows a significant portion of cartilage to be harvested for grafting. At least  $1\mathrm{cm}$  should be maintained superiorly and anteriorly in an L-shaped configuration to provide support for the nose (Fig. 73.26). In order to resect the cartilage, a Cottle elevator is used to cut the cartilage. Fomon scissors may be used to make the superior and inferior cuts through the bony septum. The cartilage can also be removed with a Ballenger swivel blade. If no cartilage is needed for the rhinoplasty, the resected cartilage can be morselized and replaced. Morselization can be

Fig. 73.25 Elevation of mucoperichondrium. The Cottle elevator is specifically designed to elevate the nasal envelope without perforation

performed in situ. Another technique for aligning the septum is through a segmental transection. In this technique, the mucoperichondrium is elevated on one side of the septum. Cross-hatching with a no. 15 blade is performed to weaken the cartilage (Fig. 73.27). The mucoperichondrium on the other side of the septum provides support. Some 4-0 gut mattress sutures can be positioned through the septum to assist in realignment. A septal splint is placed for 1 week. Finally, a swinging door type flap can be used to reposition a large segment of flat cartilage that is improperly angulated. The mucoperichondrium is elevated on one side. Through and through, incisions are made on either side of the deviated cartilage. The cartilage is also separated from the maxillary crest so that it can hinge into a more normal position. Septal splints may be required for 1 week. In all septal procedures, a 4-0 gut on a straight needle is routinely used to perform a mattress suture through the septum and mucosa. This decreases

the likelihood of a septal hematoma formation and circumvents the need for nasal packs.

It is important to preserve  $1\mathrm{cm}$  of septal cartilage superiorly and anteriorly to provide structural support for the nose.

Tears in the septal mucosa are not uncommon. However, it is not problematic as long as the tears are only on one side of the septum. Unilateral tears require no elaborate closure. If the tear is through and through, at least

one side should be closed. This is best done with a 5-0 chromic gut suture.

# 73.7 Turbinectomy

Although the focus of this chapter is the cosmetic rhinoplasty, some mention needs to be made on maintaining the function. Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is a problem that can result in nasal obstruction after cosmetic rhinoplasty, if the problem is not recognized preopera

![](images/6cf83b0d22a6e244365e5d74f059348cd43e333b5e7bc08a5ee0e549c240a4b5.jpg)  
Fig. 73.28 Removal of a dorsal hump. a The dorsal hump is removed by first using a scalpel to incise through the upper lateral cartilages. b Next, a Rubin osteotome is used to reduce the bony

tively. Hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates is the most common cause of nasal airway obstruction [19, 20]. Hypertrophy can be caused by numerous factors. Most commonly, it is related to allergic symptoms. Hypertrophy caused by allergy should be managed medically with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. If this fails, surgical management can be considered [21]. In cases of a deviated nasal septum, the turbinate on the side at which the nasal passage is enlarged can become hypertrophic with time. In patients with anatomic enlargement of the turbinate, the problem needs to be recognized so that the nasal passage does not become obstructed when the septum is straightened.

Hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates is the most common cause of airway obstruction. The surgeon should do appropriate preoperative nasal exam to evaluate for this. Hypertrophy should be managed medically or surgically to preserve nasal air flow.

Management of inferior turbinate hypertrophy is controversial and outside the scope of this chapter. The surgical procedures used to treat this problem have included corticosteroid injection, turbinate outfracture, electrocau

prominence. Care is needed to keep the osteotome from being directed too far posteriorly, thereby overreducing the dorsum. (a and b, Adapted from Austermann [50], p. 1389.)

terry, cryosurgery, laser reduction, partial turbinate resection, total turbinate resection, submucous turbinate resection, and vidian neurectomy [20-24]. Each of these procedures has various advantages and disadvantages; the procedure chosen depends on the patient. The most common complications from turbinate surgery are hemorrhage, atrophic rhinitis, and ozena.

# 73.8 Nasal Dorsum

# 73.8.1 Reduction

One of the most dramatic changes that can be achieved in rhinoplasty surgery is the correction of a dorsal hump. There are many ways to remove the hump. Some surgeons use a scalpel and osteotome, others use rasps, and a few use power rasps. The principal author prefers sequential rasping unless the reduction is large. In cases of large dorsal reductions, first incise the cartilaginous convexity below the nasal bones and then to use a Rubin osteotome to remove the bony hump (Figs. 73.28, 73.29, 73.30, and 73.31). Care must be taken to keep the osteotome directed superficially, because it can deflect

Fig. 73.29 Dorsal reduction. An Aufricht retractor lifts the dorsal drape and can protect the skin during hump reduction. A no. 15 blade is used to incise the cartilaginous dorsum. Working through this incision, an osteotome or rasp is used to reduce the bone of the dorsum

Fig. 73.30 Dorsal reduction. The dorsum should be about two-thirds of the cartilage and one-third of the bone

downward and result in overreduction. After removing the gross hump, sequential rasping can be used for refinement. After removal of any significant dorsal hump, the patient is left with an open roof deformity. This must be closed with lateral nasal osteotomies (see Fig. 73.31).

# 73.8.2Augmentation

Augmentation is indicated when there has been excessive reduction from previous rhinoplasty or from a posttraumatic defect. Several techniques are used to augment the nasal dorsum.

![](images/b033afe82b0f088d20687601ece616b61b800a5a0e51a98582173e2a7109de24.jpg)  
Fig. 73.31 Lateral nasal osteotomies. Removal of a large dorsal hump will often leave a flat open roof deformity; this can be reduced by lateral nasal osteotomies with an invert chisel saw, or rasp

# 73.8.2.1Autogenous Augmentation

In the setting of acute trauma, cranial bone grafts can be used to provide support. These are cantilevered off the frontal bone with a miniplate. The graft must be properly shaped so that it provides support but does not distort the shape of the nose [25-27]. Rib cartilage can also be harvested for augmentation of the nasal dorsum. Silicone sizers can be used to estimate the size and shape of graft needed. Once the graft is harvested, a 0.035-inch K-wire can be placed in the center of the graft to stabilize it. Rib grafts have a tendency to distort with time, and the K-wire may help limit this tendency [28].

For a less aggressive augmentation, autogenous cartilage harvested from the nasal septum can be used. This can be layered and sutured together. It is then placed through traditional rhinoplasty incisions [29-31].

# 73.8.2.2Alloplastic Augmentation

Another technique is to use cadaveric dermis along the nasal dorsum. The advantage here is that no harvesting is required and the material is pliable. However, the resorption of this material is unpredictable. Other implantable materials include silicone and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) implants. These can be contoured to the appropriate size intraoperatively. The issue with implants is that the grafts can extrude or become infected. Meticulous placement is essential [31-34].

# 73.8.3Osteotomies

Osteotomies are performed after the nasal reduction has been performed. The purposes of lateral nasal osteotomies include reduction of the open nasal roof, correc

tion of deviated nasal bones, and narrowing of a wide nasal base (see  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 73.31).

The two principal types of nasal osteotomy are lateral and medial. The lateral nasal osteotomy can be performed at different levels. It typically begins low on the piriform rim and can end either high or low in its relationship to the nasal bones. Thus, the osteotomy is often termed a low-to-low osteotomy or a low-to-high osteotomy. These osteotomies can be performed via an internal or external technique. Regardless of which technique is used, limited periosteal dissection is favored so that support is provided to the nasal bones. Medial osteotomies are seldom needed but can be used to obtain a controlled fracture in patients with thick nasal bones or when a low-to-low technique is used. Also, regardless of the osteotomy technique, the osteotomies should not be carried above the intercanthal line. The bone above this point becomes much thicker, and mobilization becomes difficult. Care should be taken when performing medial osteotomies, because the thicker portion of the nasal bone can be included in the lateral osteotomy segment and result in widening of the upper nasal dorsum. This is termed a rocker deformity.

Medial nasal osteotomies are used most commonly to obtain a more controlled fracture of the nasal bones when a low to low lateral nasal osteotomy technique is used and can prevent a rocker deformity.

A rocker deformity is a term used to describe when a lateral nasal osteotomy extends into the thick portion of the nasal bones above the intercanthal line. When the nasal bone is pushed medially, the upper nasal bone rotates laterally and creates a wider nasal dorsum.

Lateral nasal osteotomies are not always required to close an open roof deformity after dorsal hump reduction. Some surgeons believe it is better to place spreader grafts in those patients with short nasal bones so that compromise of the internal nasal valve does not occur. If an osteotomy is performed in a patient with shorter nasal bones, a low-to-high technique is preferred.

# 73.9 Nasal Tip

Understanding the mechanisms of nasal tip support is critical when performing rhinoplasty. The surgeon must understand both the desired and the undesired changes that occur from the surgical approach or technique [35].

# Key Points

The three major tip support mechanisms include the following:

1. The size, shape, and strength of the lower lateral cartilages  
2. The attachment of the medial crura to the caudal septum  
3. The attachment of the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages

The minor tip support mechanisms include the following:

1. The interdomal ligament  
2. The sesamoid complex, extending the support of the lateral crura to the piriform aperture  
3. The attachment of the alar cartilages to the overlying skin  
4. The cartilaginous septal dorsum  
5. The nasal spine  
6. The membranous septum [36, 37]

Certain surgical procedures can affect tip support. For example, a complete transfixion incision will disrupt the fibrous attachments of the caudal septum to the medial crura, thus leaving little support for the nasal tip. Suturing techniques and cartilage strut grafts may be necessary to reestablish support if this incision is performed. Intercartilaginous incisions, which are useful to gain access to the nasal dorsum, interrupt the ligamentous connections of the upper and lower lateral cartilages. This can result in cephalic tip rotation, which may or may not be desirable. A cephalic strip procedure creates even further disruption and rotation of the lower lateral cartilages. Most often, tip rhinoplasty is designed to refine and decrease the tip lobule while maintaining or even increasing rotation and projection.

The cartilaginous support of the nasal tip is often described in terms of a tripod concept [38, 39]. The medial crura of both the lower lateral cartilages together form one strut of the tripod, and each of the lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilages forms a strut. By selectively shortening or lengthening any of these struts, the tip position can be altered.

The tip position changes are referred to in terms of both projection and rotation. Tip projection is the distance from the tip of the nose to the alar-facial junction. Increasing tip projection is one of the most difficult procedures to perform in rhinoplasty surgery. Nasal tip projection can be increased by both grafting and nongrafting techniques.

Most of the surgical approaches and dissection technique for rhinoplasty will result in some increased tip rotation and loss of tip projection. Knowing this, techniques to counter these effects must be used in noses that are already over rotated or have insufficient tip projection.

# 73.9.1Tip Projection

# 73.9.1.1Increasing Tip Projection

Nongrafting techniques to increase nasal projection include the following:

1. Suturing of divergent medial crura: For this technique to be effective, there must be diverging medial crura. Intervening soft tissue may require excision before suturing with mattress sutures [40].  
2. Lateral crural steal: The lower lateral cartilage is skeletonized, and the lateral crura cartilages are sutured with a mattress suture so that the lateral crura now contributes to the medial crura (Fig. 73.32). This results in increased projection and some rotation as well [41, 42].

Grafting techniques to increase projection include the following:

1. Columellar strut: This technique involves the placement of a strut of septal cartilage between the feet of the medial crura and abutted against the nasal spine. The medial crura are elevated superiorly with double skin hooks, and the cartilage strut is sutured to the medial crura via mattress sutures. Only a minor amount of tip projection can be increased with this method.  
2. Peck graft: This is an onlay graft in the region of the nasal tip. Layers of cartilage are placed in the domal region to increase projection. The graft material is either conchal or septal cartilage. The cartilage is secured to the dome by sutures. This technique can increase projection by  $2 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  (  $\square$  Fig. 73.33).

3. Umbrella graft: This technique involves the creation of a cartilaginous structure that resembles the appearance of an umbrella. It is useful when both tip projection and support of weak medial crura are required. The umbrella graft is constructed from harvested septal, ear, or rib cartilage. It is then sutured in position so that the "handle" of the umbrella is between the medial crura and the "canopy" of the umbrella rests atop the dome. The canopy portion can be modified to incorporate the Peck graft technique by stacking layers of cartilage (Fig. 73.34) [43].  
4. Shield graft: This graft was first described by Sheen [30]. A piece of septal cartilage is shaped to form a trapezoidal configuration measuring  $6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  superiorly and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  inferiorly. The graft is usually  $10 - 12\mathrm{mm}$  long and is beveled so that the corners are blunted. The graft is placed in a pocket through an endonasal approach or sutured in position via an open approach. The superior and lateral aspect of the graft forms the tip-defining points (Fig. 73.35) [30].

# 73.9.1.2Decreasing Tip Projection

Decreasing tip projection involves reduction of the tip-supporting mechanisms. Achieving acceptable results when decreasing projection can be difficult because nasal definition can be lost [44]. If the nasal projection needs to be decreased, be certain to first confirm that the problem is not the result of an optical illusion caused by a low radix position. If the problem is a low radix, a dorsal radix graft is the appropriate treatment.

Methods to decrease projection include the following:

1. Complete transfixion incision: As discussed previously, a complete transfixion incision will decrease tip support. Intercartilaginous incisions or cephalic strips will also weaken the tip support but will increase tip rotation.  
2. Lower the septal angle: If the septum is providing significant support for the nasal tip, the septal angle must be lowered. This is done by excision of a portion of the caudal septum. In addition, the medial crura can be separated from the caudal septum to decrease projection.

![](images/dac9015357d970bca8d6ffc7f0df0956efa8972c07cf9e2740c8ef3bac699991.jpg)  
Fig. 73.36 Crural excision. This is used when the nasal tip needs dramatic deprojection. A portion of the lateral crura is excised, and the ends are sutured back together

3. Crural excision: To dramatically decrease tip projection, the medial and lateral crura may need to be sectioned, overlapped, and sutured into a new position with less projection. This technique maintains the natural shape of the tip at the domes (Fig. 73.36). Excision of a segment cartilage in the domes and suturing them back together can be done, but it will change the shape of the nasal tip. Sometimes, after decreasing the nasal projection, the patient may have flaring of the ala and increased infratip columellar show. This can be treated with an alar base resection, but this should be used judiciously.

# 73.9.2Tip Rotation

# 73.9.2.1 Increasing Tip Rotation

Understanding the tripod concept and tip-supporting mechanisms is important when determining which of the following methods to use to increase tip rotation:

1. Removal of dorsal hump: A subtle way to increase rotation of the tip is to reduce a dorsal hump if present.  
2. Resection of the caudal septum: A small triangular piece of caudal septum can be removed. The base of this triangular shape is at the nasal dorsum.  
3. Cephalic strips from lower lateral cartilages: A complete strip of cephalic cartilage from the lower lateral cartilages will result in increased tip rotation. Even an intercartilaginous incision will result in some tip rotation (Fig. 73.37).

![](images/0879ccbf8231b3d1cf2c2dd905bb28bbcc1e22b0ecdfbeabe5f8141397cfbfdd.jpg)  
Fig. 73.37 Delivery of lower lateral cartilage. The lower lateral cartilage is best delivered by a marginal incision or exposed through an open rhinoplasty for direct visualization and surgical manipulation. Tip refinement is improved in this case by complete tip reduction to reduce the volume of the tip

4. Shorten the lateral crura.  
5. Shield graft: A shield graft gives the illusion of increased tip rotation.  
6. Augmentation of premaxilla: Placement of cartilage or ePTFE in the premaxilla region below the anterior nasal spine will also give the illusion of increased tip rotation.

# 73.9.2.2Decreasing Tip Rotation

Decreasing tip rotation is done by two methods:

1. Trim the caudal septum near the anterior nasal spine.  
2. Augment the nasal dorsum: this creates the illusion of decreased tip rotation.

# 73.9.3Tip Shape

In addition to changing the tip position, the tip shape must also be considered. Historically, changes to the nasal tip were performed by selective cartilage excision and reapproximation. The Goldman tip is an example of such a technique. The current trend is to preserve and reorient existing cartilage and place cartilaginous grafts if required [45]. Excessive grafting can be unpredictable in the long run.

Although cartilage preservation is emphasized, there is still sometimes a need to remove cartilage. There are three principal techniques of cartilage excision in the nasal tip region: a complete strip technique, a weakened complete strip technique, and an interrupted strip technique. A greater resection generally results in more dramatic tip narrowing and rotation.

![](images/b68cccede07bf310e2b349f0bc159bd904883e9e9d1810ee158612d44e6379c0.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 73.38 Complete strip technique. This involves the excision of a strip of cartilage on the cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilage. This will result in increased tip rotation. It is important to maintain a minimum of  $6\mathrm{mm}$  width of cartilage for structural support of the nose. (Adapted from Taylor [54], p. 58.)

It is best to preserve as much cartilage in the nose as possible. It is preferable to reshape cartilage with suturing techniques than to aggressively excise cartilage. Treating a nose that has lost structural support is difficult.

Complete strip techniques involve the removal of a complete piece of cartilage from the cephalic end of the lower lateral cartilages (Fig. 73.38; see also Fig. 73.37). This procedure is thought to be more stable because it leaves an intact strip of the inferior border of the lower lateral cartilage. Aggressive resection can result in the loss of tip support, alar notching, alar retraction, and the appearance of increased columellar show. Most surgeons feel that a minimum width of  $6\mathrm{mm}$  is required to maintain the structural integrity of the lower lateral cartilage.

The weakened complete strip technique involves the removal of a complete cephalic strip followed by weakening of the cartilage by selective morselization of the medial and lateral crura with a scalpel blade.

An interrupted strip involves division of the lateral crura from the dome (Fig. 73.39). This technique not only provides greater rotation than a complete strip but also can result in complications, including the loss of tip

![](images/98030a0db4e6d94ba09b6e9ad4f9181882dca9632131a46bec2ab37dc76d4be8.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 73.39 Interrupted strip technique. This is similar to the complete strip except the remaining cartilage is also divided in a vertical fashion. This allows for even greater tip rotation, as indicated by the arrow; however, it can result in a pinched nasal tip and functional problems. The cartilage can be weakened by scoring it in a vertical fashion, and this is termed a weakened complete strip technique. (Adapted from Taylor [54], p. 59.)  
Fig. 73.40 Goldman tip. This is an interrupted strip technique in which the lateral crura are divided lateral to the tip-defining points. The medial segments are then sutured together to increase nasal tip projection and to narrow the nasal tip. (Adapted from Willis [55], p. 61.)

support, alar notching, and alar retraction. In addition, the nasal tip can develop a pinched appearance. The classic Goldman tip is an example of an interrupted strip technique (Fig. 73.40). In this technique, the lateral crura are divided laterally to the tip-defining points. The medial segments are sutured together, which results initially in increased tip projection. The lateral crural segments are left alone as independent units. This procedure is no longer commonly used because of problems with tip asymmetry, pinched appearance of the nasal tip, and long-term tip ptosis.

For patients with a broad nasal tip, transdomal suturing techniques are often used to narrow the tip. Volume reduction is performed first if needed by cartilage excision as described previously. Next, excision of excessive interdomal soft tissue is performed. A 4-0 polydioxanone transdomal suture is placed in a horizontal mattress fashion to narrow and reorient the alar cartilages. The advantage of this technique is that the suturing can be done multiple times until the surgeon is satisfied with the result. In addition, the long-term results of this technique have been favorable [46-48].

# 73.10 Nasal Base Alar Reduction

The alar base should approximate the intercanthal distance and be no more than  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  wider than this. The nostrils should have a symmetrical appearance. Asymmetry of the nostril is often due to a deviated nasal septum, and this should be reevaluated before consideration of an alar base resection.

The primary procedure to reduce the alar base width is an alar base resection. Alar modification is often considered in cases in which the nose has to be deprojected or to balance the anatomy in certain ethnic types. It is mandatory to be conservative when performing alar reduction because it is difficult to correct an overreduction. If there is any doubt, the surgeon should delay the alar base reduction until a later date [49].

The procedure is performed by excising a small wedge of vestibular mucosa and skin. The angulation can be adjusted so that greater reduction of the outer perimeter of the ala is reduced and only limited reduction of the internal perimeter is performed [49]. The excision should be conservative and will rarely be greater than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  in width (  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 73.41).

# 73.11Postoperative Management

After performing the rhinoplasty, the surgeon must decide whether intranasal stents or packing is necessary. We generally do not place nasal packing. If the septum requires additional support during healing, silicone stents are placed. These stents are also used if there are mucosal tears or if a turbinectomy was performed. The stents help reduce the incidence of synechiae formation. The stents are secured to each other by a 3-0 silk suture passed through the columella and are typically left in place for 1 week.

Nasal synechiae: adhesion of two opposing mucosal surfaces that results in scarring and can interfere with nasal airflow.

Next, the nasal dorsum is splinted. Benzoin or Mastisol is painted on the nasal dorsum, and  $1/4>$ -inch brown paper tape is applied. After placement of the tape, the splint is applied. A metal Denver splint or thermoplastic splint is contoured and applied. Additional paper tape can be placed over the splint.

# Conclusion

Cosmetic rhinoplasty is one of the most challenging cosmetic procedures. Understanding the surgical anatomy and normal nasal proportions forms the foundation for planning the surgical technique. Both endonasal (closed) and external (open) rhinoplasty techniques can be used to modify nasal shape and function. External (open) rhinoplasty is favored by the principal author for teaching purposes and the improved visualization of anatomic structures. Choosing surgical techniques that are least destructive of the anatomy are favored over aggressive resection techniques. Cartilage grafting should be considered for preservation of the internal nasal valve and providing nasal tip support. Primary cosmetic rhinoplasty should be carefully planned and executed since secondary rhinoplasties are fraught with difficulties including compromised blood supply, scar tissue, and depleted cartilage available for grafting.
