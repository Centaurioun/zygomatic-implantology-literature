# Learning Aims

The reader will develop an understanding of the various odontogenic and non-odontogenic pathologic processes common in the pediatric age group and available treatment modalities.  
The reader will develop an understanding of how other pathologic processes can affect or involve the maxillofacial skeleton in the pediatric age group.  
The reader will develop an understanding of the most common salivary gland pathologic processes that are encountered in the pediatric age group and available treatment modalities.

# 39.1 Introduction

Cysts and tumors in the maxillofacial skeleton are traditionally classified as odontogenic or non-odontogenic based on the tissue of origin. The contributing tissue, epithelium, or mesenchyme is used to further subclassify odontogenic pathology, while non-odontogenic tumors are grouped based upon the cell line of origin, and their histologic appearance or behavior [1-3] (Tables 39.1 and 39.2). However, treatment should be based not only on the histologic appearance of these entities, but also on their known clinical and biologic behavior. Finally, salivary gland tissue pathology is unique to the maxillofacial skeleton and certain inflammatory conditions, cysts, and tumors may more commonly occur in children rather than in the adult patient.

# 39.2.1 Odontogenic Cysts

Gingival cysts of the newborn, or dental lamina cysts of the newborn, or Bohn's nodules are superficial, raised nodules of edentulous alveolar ridges in infants and neonates. These are thought to originate from entrapment and proliferation of primary dental lamina after tooth formation and consist of a keratin-producing epithelial lining. The proliferation of the dental lamina remnants is limited in overall extent and potential, and these cysts degenerate involute or rupture spontaneously in the oral cavity by 3 months of age.

Epithelial inclusion cysts that form along the midline of the palate are known as palatine cysts of the newborn, or Epstein pearls. Similarly, these cysts are developmental in origin. During the fusion of the palatal shelves and nasal processes entrapment of keratin-producing epithelium at the interface may occur that is thought to be the origin of these cysts. Epstein pearls fuse with the overlying epithelium and generally require no treatment. The vast majority of these cysts are clinically undetectable, and an incisional or excisional biopsy to confirm the diagnosis is typically not required or justified. In most cases, reassurance for the parents and the pediatrician may be all that is needed [4-7].

Developmental cysts associated with impacted teeth in children are more common in the maxillary canine and mandibular second molar region, while in teenage years, as in adulthood, the third molar region is the most common location. Delay in eruption of teeth necessitates radiographic investigation that may reveal the absence of the tooth or the presence of a radiolucent lesion associated with the crown of an impacted permanent or a supernumery tooth. By definition a dentigerous cyst is precisely this; a cyst that attaches to the tooth cervix (cemento-enamel junction) and contains the crown of the impacted tooth. The tissue of origin is considered to be the reduced enamel epithelium, or remnants of the enamel organ. Simple enucleation and curettage at the time of removal of the impacted tooth, in cases of third molar involvement, is usually adequate treatment. When the canine or second molar teeth are involved, extraction of teeth should be avoided, especially if the teeth can be orthodontically moved into the arch, thereby effectively treating the cyst. The recurrence potential of a dentigerous cyst is negligible, but these cysts may cause bone expansion, local destruction, root

resorption, or displacement of teeth which occur more commonly with long-standing lesions (Fig. 39.1). Rarely neoplastic transformation to ameloblastoma (i.e. mural ameloblastoma) has been described although the possibility of a misdiagnosis should be considered in these cases and re-biopsy may be required [4-7].

# 39.2.2 Epithelial Odontogenic Tumors

Although ameloblastoma is the most common epithelial origin odontogenic tumor and should always be included in the differential diagnosis of radiolucent lesions in the jaws, it is a rare tumor in children. In general, there is an equal gender predilection and can potentially occur in any location, but the overwhelming majority of these

$\square$  Fig. 39.2 Ameloblastoma involving the left posterior mandible extending into the ramus (14-year-old boy)

tumors are reported in the posterior mandible. Among the variants described, the unicystic type is the one encountered with some higher frequency among adolescents, and thus will be further discussed here. Clinically and radiographically this tumor resembles a cyst and is associated with an impacted tooth (Fig. 39.2). Common findings associated with the unicystic ameloblastoma include asymptomatic bony expansion, cortical perforation, unilocular appearance, tooth and root displacement, and root resorption. In the majority of cases the diagnosis of ameloblastoma is made after a "cystic" lesion is removed and submitted for histopathologic diagnosis. Clear serous fluid is usually aspirated from this lesion, and a bony cavity is usually encountered upon surgically entering the lesion.

Classically, there are three histologic patterns of cystic ameloblastoma, determined based on histopathologic examination upon removal of the entire lesion. The term luminal (unicystic) ameloblastoma is used when examination of a cystic lesion composed of a

fibrous tissue wall reveals ameloblastic epithelium. The classic ameloblastoma-like characteristics of a palisading cuboidal basal cell layer with hyperchromatic nuclei and reverse polarization are present, but are contained within the cystic wall itself. When these typical tumorlike elements are found to project into the lumen of the cystic lesion as nodules, but are still contained within the cystic lining, the term intraluminal ameloblastoma is applied. Lastly, when ameloblastic epithelial nests or islands are found to infiltrate through the cystic wall, the term mural ameloblastoma is employed, and these tumors demonstrate a more aggressive-type behavior. Enucleation and curettage of cystic ameloblastomas is generally considered sufficient treatment in children, but long-term follow-up studies to support this approach are lacking due to the overall rarity of these tumors. The recurrence potential, however, should be carefully considered especially in cases of mural ameloblastoma, and this will dictate the need for long-term follow-up. In the 2017 WHO classification of odontogenic cysts and tumors it is recommended that mural unicystic ameloblastoma is considered comparable to conventional ameloblastoma given its biological aggressiveness [8]. Solid, or multicystic, ameloblastomas do occur in children, although rarely, and on occasion, extension of a unicystic ameloblastoma through the fibrous capsule may be encountered. On these occasions, surgical resection to the next anatomic barrier with a one centimeter linear bony margin should be performed as adequate treatment [9-15].

Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) is an epithelial odontogenic tumor, or more accurately a hamartoma, that most likely originates from the reduced enamel epithelium. AOT may occur in children as young as 5 years of age, is more common in females (in two-thirds of the cases), is associated with an impacted tooth (in two-thirds of the cases) and show predilection for the anterior jaws (in two-thirds of the cases), and occurs in the maxilla (in two-thirds of the cases) more often than the mandible; as a result, the AOT is commonly referred to as the tumors of "two thirds." Radiographically, AOT presents as a well-circumscribed radiolucency that may contain opaque foci, and is associated with an impacted tooth, most commonly the maxillary cuspid tooth. Histologically, a thick capsule contains the nodular epithelial proliferation and calcified material. Ductal-like structures (pseudoducts) and rosettes are pathognomonic histologic findings for this tumor while the amount of calcified material dictates its degree of mixed radiographic appearance. Simple enucleation and curettage is adequate treatment since AOT has no recurrence potential [6, 7, 13, 16-18].

Philipsen in 1956 described the odontogenic keratocyst as a distinct entity for jaw cysts exhibiting

keratinization and a specific pattern of characteristics of the epithelial lining. These lesions may appear as early as the first decade of life, have a strong predilection for the posterior mandible, and are more common in male patients. They are usually asymptomatic, but may cause bony expansion, tooth mobility, or tooth or root displacement. Radiographically the presentation is that of a small or large unilocular or multilocular, well-demarcated radiolucency (Fig. 39.3). The tissue of origin is either the dental lamina  $(60\%)$  or the reduced enamel epithelium  $(40\%)$ . Two histologic types are commonly described: the parakeratotic type, (Forsell and Sainio group Ia), that is considered more aggressive, and the orthokeratotic type (Forsell and Sainio groups II and III). The aggressive nature of this entity, as well as the high recurrence potential, has been clearly demonstrated in clinical practice and supported by molecular evidence (Table 39.3). In 2005 the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of odontogenic lesions, the following change for this entity was made: "odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is recognized as neoplasm and the term Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor (KCOT) is recommended to replace the previous terminology reflecting the neoplastic nature and characteristics of this entity." In the 2017 WHO classification though the entity was placed back into the cyst category as odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). OKC in children is often associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) (Table 39.4). Several OKCs appear at any one time in NBCCS patients and tend to behave more aggressively. About  $85\%$  of NBCCS-associated OKC (and  $30\%$  of sporadically occurring OKCs) demonstrate PCTH gene (a tumor suppressor gene) mutations that may explain in part their aggressive behavior. Mutations in SUFU gene (involved in the hedgehog

pathway) and several others CDKN2A, TP53, MCC, CADMI and FHIT have also been reported in the literature. Several treatment modalities have been recommended for these lesions, but special consideration should be given towards decompression, followed by enucleation and curettage, especially in children with or without NBCCS (Fig. 39.4). Recurrence rates reported in the literature range from  $0\%$  in cases treated with en block resection, to  $56\%$  in those treated with simple enucleation. The choice of treatment, especially in children, should take into consideration not only the size and location or degree of soft tissue involvement, but the age of the patient at diagnosis as well as the specific histologic variant. The goal of therapy is to choose the treatment modality that carries the lowest risk for recurrence and the least morbidity, while ensuring eradication of the lesion. Studies have found certain positive prognostic changes in the OKC following treatment with decompression, including thickening of the cystic wall, inhibition of Il-1a, epithelial dedifferentiation, loss of cytokeratin-10 production, and transformation from a parakeratotic type to an orthokeratotic type. These changes may be responsible for the less aggressive behavior and decreased recurrence seen after employing such a treatment strategy. Following the decompression procedure, allowing time for these changes to occur as well as shrinkage of the lesion radiographically (months-years), enucleation and curettage should always be performed since remnants of the epithelial lining, even with

complete radiographic resolution, are almost always present, and may contribute to recurrence. The need for patient compliance and cooperation with close follow-up, if decompression is used as the treatment modality, is imperative, and parental involvement is essential for the pediatric patient. Long-term follow-up is recommended since recurrences have been reported as late as 10 years following initial successful management of OKCs [1, 8, 9, 19-32].

# 39.2.3 Mesenchymal Odontogenic Tumors

Odontogenic myxoma is a rare mesenchymal origin tumor of the jaws, but more commonly encountered in childhood, as early as 10 years of age. There is no gender or jaw predilection. Histologically this tumor resembles the dental papilla or follicular connective tissue and is believed to be derived from the periodontal ligament or pulpal tissue. Bony expansion that causes facial asymmetry, or merely an incidental finding on radiographic examination, warrants further investigation in order to diagnose this particular tumor (Fig. 39.5). The myxoma is composed of a bland, relatively acellular, myxomatous connective tissue and does not produce or contain calcified material. The residual bony islands in the jaws are responsible for the classic radiographic appearance of a "soap bubble" or honeycomb pattern, but the lesions are always radiolucent, not mixed in nature. Myxomas by themselves are not aggressive per se, but the production of apoptotic proteins in addition to the lack of capsule and the tumor consistency may result in recurrence or persistence if adequate resection with complete eradication is not achieved surgically. Clinical challenges result when the diagnosis of myxoma is provided via biopsies of developing dental pulp or hyperplastic follicular tissue since histologic differentiation is therefore not possible. Clinical and radiographic correlation are essential in order to prevent inappropriate management of these patients [9, 12, 13, 18, 33-35].

Cementoblastoma or true cementoma is a rare benign neoplasm occasionally encountered in children or young adults. There is a predilection for the molar regions of the mandible, but no gender difference exists. Cementoblastomas are intimately related to the roots, and may even replace the roots of the teeth radiographically. Cortical expansion may be present, and patients often report intermittent pain associated with these lesions. Classically radiographs will reveal an opaque lesion surrounding and replacing the root(s) of the involved teeth. The presence of a radiolucent rim representing the periodontal ligament space, and potentially the advancing front of the lesion, along with the radiographic appearance described above are pathognomonic for this entity. Unfortunately, removal of the lesion typically necessitates sacrificing the involved tooth.

Similarly, cementifying fibroma (or cemento-ossifying fibroma  $(COF)$ ) occurs most often in the premolar- molar region in the mandible, and may be histologically and radiographically indistinguishable from fibrous dysplasia; typically, COF has been described radiographically as a "disease in bone" such that a margin may be present between the lesion and normal surrounding bone, while fibrous dysplasia is a "disease of bone" radiographically with indistinct radiographic borders with adjacent normal bone. The COF may demonstrate rapid growth and cause bony expansion. It generally affects young individuals of less than 15 years of age. Other terms used often for these lesions include: cemento-ossifying fibroma, ossifying fibroma (juvenile), psammomatoid ossifying fibroma. The histologic examination will reveal cementum or bone like substance and fibrous connective tissue with no findings indicative of aggressive behavior. Treatment is therefore based upon the clinical behavior of the lesion, and not the radiographic or histologic appearance. Clinical differentiation from fibrous dysplasia is important, and, as mentioned, is based mainly upon the fact that cementifying fibroma is well demarcated and can be easily separated from the surrounding normal bone as opposed to fibrous dysplasia. Enucleation and curettage is the treatment of choice for the COF, and these lesions have no recurrence potential.

The term "cementoma" refers to a variety of odontogenic lesions, all of which are derived from the periodontal ligament tissue, and occur more commonly in the adult patient. The most common lesion in this category is periapical cemental dysplasia. In these cases, the lesions may begin as periapical radiolucencies that can progress to radioopaque or mixed lesions, and may involve multiple vital teeth, and no treatment is usually required [13, 18, 36].

# 39.2.4 Mixed Odontogenic Tumors

Ameloblastic fibroma (AF) is a benign odontogenic neoplasm, that occurs more commonly than ameloblastoma in childhood, and is composed of both epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Similar to ameloblastoma, it may be associated with a tooth, involves the mandible more often than the maxilla, although the location of occurrence favors the parasymphysis region. Radiographically the ameloblastic fibroma may present as a unilocular or multilocular radiolucency with sclerotic borders, without evidence of root resorption or bone destruction. Histology the lesion reveals fibro-myxoid connective tissue with interposed strands, or "cords," of odontogenic epithelium. Enucleation and curettage is adequate treatment since these neoplasms have a relatively low recurrence potential (up to  $20\%$ ). When calcifications or tooth-like structures, representing a mineralized component similar to odontoma, are present in the lesion, and causes a radiographic appearance of a mixed radiolucent-radioopaque lesion, the lesion is referred to as an ameloblastic fibro-odontoma (AFO). There is adequate evidence to support that some AF are neoplastic, do not produce hard tissues unlike their histologically identical counterparts (AFO) that start maturing and produce dental hard tissues. The treatment involves enucleation and curettage similar to ameloblastic fibroma, and some data has demonstrated that these specific lesions are hamartomatous in nature, essentially preceding the development of complex odontomas. This theory seems to be supported in the 2017 WHO classification as well [13, 18, 36, 37].

Odontoma is the most common odontogenic neoplasm in children, and is typically found incidentally on radiographic surveillance or upon investigation of disturbance of tooth eruption. The odontoma is mixed in

origin since it contains enamel, dentin, and pulpal tissue elements. The specific organization of these elements may result in the formation of either a lesion that appears like a tooth (compound odontoma) or a lesion with a haphazard arrangement of these tooth-like structures (complex odontoma). The specific histopathologic structure of the lesion will result in the radiographic appearance, which is usually representative of the odontoma subtype (Figs. 39.6 and 39.7). Tooth displacement by the odontoma, or the presence of an odontoma in place of a missing tooth, are common clinical presentations. Odontomas usually do not cause bony expansion or root resorption. "Extraction" or enucleation of the odontoma, is the treatment of choice, and is easily performed since these lesions are well encapsulated and can be easily separated from the surrounding bone [13, 18, 36, 38, 39].

# 39.3 Non-odontogenic Pathology

# 39.3.1 Benign Mesenchymal Tumors

The most common benign mesenchymal lesions encountered in the pediatric patient population include: giant cell lesions, fibro-osseous lesions, and the desmoplastic fibroma. In the giant cell lesion group three entities are usually included: the central giant cell granuloma, the brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism, and the giant cell tumor. The latter is not common in children and it is not discussed in this chapter. Among the fibro-osseous lesions, those most commonly encountered in the pediatric population are: fibrous dysplasia, cherubism, ossifying fibroma juvenile (aggressive), and osteoblastoma. Ossifying fibroma, also referred to as cementifying fibroma or cemento-ossifying fibroma, has been

discussed in this chapter. Odontogenic myxoma is included under benign mesenchymal tumors by some authors, but has also been discussed in this chapter under mesenchymal origin odontogenic tumors.

# 39.3.1.1 Giant Cell Lesions

Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) occurs almost exclusively in the jaws, and predominantly affects children and young adults, and females more often than males. Unlike giant cell tumors of the long bones, the H3F3A mutation is not found in the GCG of the maxilla or mandible. Clinically there is a painless expansion involving the anterior or premolar regions mainly in the mandible (Fig. 39.8). On radiographic examination the lesion is usually mutililoculated, well-demarcated with scalloping borders, and may cause tooth or root displacement. Classically it is described as the principle lesion that crosses the midline of the jaws. In some cases,

CGCG may behave more aggressively with pain and rapid growth, root resorption, cortical perforation, and a higher recurrence potential. On histologic examination, a proliferation of fibroblasts, with various amounts of collagen, create a uniform connective tissue stroma with multinucleated giant cells dispersed throughout, as seen typically with all giant cell lesions. Several treatment modalities have been proposed for the CGCG lesion. Traditionally enucleation and curettage has been the preferred treatment method, while resection is reserved for more aggressive, or recurrent, lesions. Several authors and clinicians have utilized intralesional corticosteroid injections (with local anesthetic agents), exogenous calcitonin (subcutaneous or intranasal), and most recently interferon alfa (2a or b) with variable success rates. The use of corticosteroids is based upon the assumption that these lesions are predominantly inflammatory in nature; however, the lack of consistent successful clinical outcomes indicates that this hypothesis may not be valid. Calcitonin administration, via subcutaneous injections or nasal administration, has been employed by some and proposed primarily for multiple, recurrent, or particularly aggressive lesions. The use of calcitonin is based upon the theory that the cells of origin of the CGCG are osteoclasts, but, again, the unpredictable results as well as the recurrence of some lesions treated with this approach do not fully support this theory. The most recently suggested hypothesis is that these lesions should be considered proliferative vascular in origin, or at least angiogenesis-dependent, and therefore the use of interferon alfa is clinically indicated. Excellent results have been reported with 3,000,000 units/ $\mathfrak{m}^2$

injected subcutaneously,  $48 - 72\mathrm{h}$  following enucleation and curettage, and for a period of 6-8 months for large, aggressive, high-risk, or recurrence lesions [40-54].

Brown tumors may represent a clinical manifestation of secondary, or hereditary, hyperparathyroidism in children and the lesions are consistent with the expected osseous changes associated with the disease process (Table 39.5). Bone demineralization and fibrous replacement that occurs in long bones. In the jaws, these appear as multiple radiolucent lesions that histologically are identical to CGCG lesions. Jaw lesions that show typical radiographic findings such as loss of the lamina dura, or the presence of pulpal calcifications, may be among the first indicators that further laboratory studies (e.g. calcium, phosphorus, PTH) are required for definitive diagnosis of the disease process. Management of the associated underlying disease process, should result in resolution of jaw lesions, but occasionally enucleation and curettage, similar to the CGCG, may be required [12, 48, 55-58].

# 39.3.1.2 Fibro-osseous Lesions

Fibrous dysplasia (FD), a disease of bone, is a condition most commonly encountered during the first and second decades of life, with a tendency for stabilization at puberty, and slow growth, or regression, thereafter. Fibrous dysplasia results from the replacement of normal medullary bone by abnormal fibrous connective tissue and new bone formation. FD has been recently linked to postzygotic GNAS1 gain of function mutations. The clinical forms of fibrous dysplasia include: monostotic, polyostotic, McCune-Albright syndrome and Jaffe-Lichenstein syndrome (with no bone involvement) (Table 39.6). The maxilla is most commonly

involved, and, in the polyostotic form, the ribs, femur and tibia may also be affected. There is a slow painless unilateral expansion that radiographically appears as a diffuse "ground glass" or "peau d'orange" (orange peel) opacity of the involved bones, usually confined to the craniofacial skeleton. This radiographic description however is not pathognomonic, since lesions may appear as unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies, especially when the long bones are involved (Fig. 39.9). Histologic examination reveals a cellular fibrous connective tissue stroma with irregularly shaped trabeculae

of immature bone in a relatively constant ratio. Classically, the term "Chinese characters" has been used to describe the irregular immature woven bone that appears to arise directly within the fibrous stroma. Characteristically there are no inflammatory cells or osteoclasts, and only a few osteoblasts may be found. Prominent uniformly distributed capillaries are present in the connective tissue matrix. Normal laboratory values are expected for serum calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase in the monostotic and polyostotic forms of fibrous dysplasia.

Treatment of fibrous dysplasia may include surgical recontouring of the involved bones in the facial skeleton for cosmetic reasons. It is best to delay this surgery until after cessation of the growth spurt, or after puberty, unless the condition causes such a severe deformity that earlier intervention is required for psychosocial reasons. There is typically a  $25\%$  failure of reintouring in cases of fibrous dysplasia treated too early, and, in fact, the surgery itself may induce exacerbation of the disease process with overgrowth and/or extension beyond the involved areas. Low-dose radiation has been used in the past for treatment of polyostotic disease; however, there is a suggested association of radiation with malignant transformation of the lesion. In general, malignant transformation is a rare complication reported in  $1\%$  of

fibrous dysplasia cases, and more commonly in patients with the polyostotic form of the disease. Osteosarcomas may rarely occur in these patients, possibly years or decades after the initial diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia, and these malignant tumors require aggressive treatment and have a poor prognosis [9, 13, 48].

McCune-Albright syndrome is a triad that includes polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, endocrine dysfunction (precocious puberty), and cutaneous hyperpigmentations (café-au-lait spots). It is a less common variant of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia representing only  $1 - 3\%$  of the cases, but it tends to occur in the first decade of life. A mutation in the gene for the a-subunit of Gs (a G-protein that stimulates cAMP formation) is found in this syndrome. This results in substitution of arginine (at position 201) by either cysteine or histidine. These mutations lead to increased activation of adenylyl cyclase and elevation of cAMP. High concentrations of cAMP lead to increased proliferation and inappropriate differentiation of the mutated cells. This genetic alteration may ultimately affect the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts that form the disorganized immature fibrotic matrix. The lesions are hormonally regulated and undergo alternating phases of intense activity and quiescent asymptomatic periods. During active phases, patients may report throbbing pain or discomfort, while clinical edema is evident, and the lesions appear "hot" on radionuclide bone scans. Unlike other forms of fibrous dysplasia, in McCune-Albright syndrome, laboratory values demonstrate elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and urinary hydroxyproline, indicative of intense bone metabolic hyperactivity.

The use of bisphosphonate medications, specifically pamidronate, has been employed in the management of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome in both children and adults. Pamidronate inhibits osteoclastic function, and has shown some promising therapeutic results with a significant decrease in bone pain and incidence of bony fractures from the disease. Furthermore, laboratory metabolic indices of cessation of bone turnover such as a decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary collagen type I N-teropeptide (elevated prior to treatment), have been demonstrated clinically. While no significant adverse side effects were reported, clear evidence that the use of pamidronate has a positive effect on the dysplastic lesions is lacking, and further research studies are warranted [5, 12, 13, 48, 59-67].

A benign hereditary condition of the jaws usually found in children less than 5 years of age is cherubism, which occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder. Cherubism shows a strong association with SH3BP2 mutations. There is a 2:1 male predominance with  $100\%$  genetic penetrance. The condition is self-limiting and

usually stabilizes around the time of puberty. The classic presentation is bilateral painless expansion of the posterior regions of mandible, including the alveolar process, which occurs more often than in the maxilla. When the maxilla is involved, the classic "cherubic (angelic) face" is evident with increased scleral show between the inferior limbus of the iris, and superior positioning of the globes, with possible dystopia, from involvement of the orbital floor. The process may involve any one site of the maxilla or mandible, while changes in all four quadrants of the jaws can be found as well. Radiographic examination will reveal multiple well-defined multilocular radiolucencies, and often with displacement of the inferior alveolar canal. Additional radiographic findings include involvement of the coronoid processes, while the condyles are often spared; the teeth may appear to be "floating" in cyst like spaces. Histologically a vascular connective tissue stroma with multinucleated giant cells can resemble the CGCG lesion. The symmetrical presentation, as well as the radiographic findings, will assist with the diagnosis. No treatment is required for this condition since spontaneous regression generally begins in puberty, and resolution is often achieved by age 30. In rare cases of severe deformity and functional impairment, curettage of these lesions and bony reintouring may be required (Fig. 39.10) [68-71].

Osteoblastomas are uncommon lesions of the bone that occur in the posterior mandible or in the maxilla during the second decade of life. Other common sites include the vertebra, skull, sinonasal tract, and temporal bone. The etiology remains unknown, but osteoblas

![](images/53e6f756f431fa18bde6c50dce20f640ae9235d8a123d68ecb99d519995e0fbf.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 39.10 Lateral ceph film of a child with cherubism and bimaxillary involvement

tomas are considered benign neoplasms that demonstrate a 2:1 male to female predilection. Clinical characteristics include localized swelling, bony expansion, and pain. Radiographically a mixed lucent and opaque pattern exists, that may be predominantly lucent or predominantly opaque (sclerotic), and occasionally may appear as a sun-ray pattern. These characteristics, together with the histologic findings of occasional hyperchromatic osteoblasts and irregular osteoid with variable degrees of maturation, may lead to a misdiagnosis of osteosarcoma. The lack of cytologic atypia, abnormal mitotic figures, and a heterogeneous pattern that are present in osteosarcoma though will assist in establishing the appropriate diagnosis. These lesions are adequately treated with enucleation and curettage, or complete local excision is performed when found to infiltrate surrounding tissues. Recurrences, although rare, have been reported, as well as rare cases of malignant transformation to osteosarcoma.

The osteoid osteoma is considered a smaller version of an osteoblastoma, although certain differences make these lesions clinically distinct. Osteoblastomas are larger lesions, typically over  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$ , and the pain experienced does not follow a circadian rhythm (e.g. nocturnal predilection) nor is the pain relieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or aspirin. Treatment is the same as for osteoblastoma, and includes enucleation and curettage [9, 48, 72].

Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare benign, but locally aggressive, lesion of bone that involves the long bones and pelvis and may occasionally be found in the mandibular ramus. This lesion is considered the central, or intraossesous, counterpart of fibromatosis that arises in young patients, with a mean age of 14 years. The origin of these tumors is not clear. Progressive, asymptomatic growth eventually results in swelling of the jaw. Radiographic examination is not helpful in identification of this lesion since a variety of presentations may be found. Desmoplastic fibromas may appear as unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies, with ill-defined, or well-defined, borders and can cause cortical perforation or root resorption. Histologically there is an even distribution of benign-appearing fibroblasts in a collagenous stroma. No cytological atypia or mitotic figures are seen, thereby confirming the benign nature of this neoplasm. The treatment of choice is en bloc resection, and teeth in the area must be sacrificed in order for the lesion to be completely eradicated. High recurrence rates, up to  $25\%$  have been reported with simple curettage, and there appears to be a correlation between recurrence and tumor cellularity, as well as inadequate initial surgical removal [13, 48, 73].

# 39.3.2 Hematopoietic Reticuloendothelial Tumors

The hematopoietic reticuloendothelial malignancies that involve the head and neck in children discussed here include: Burkitt's lymphoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The latter two lesions combined, account for  $50\%$  of all pediatric malignancies with an equal frequency. A discussion of leukemias, which are extremely common in children, is beyond the scope of this chapter, and extensive available literature and textbooks are devoted to these pediatric blood cell malignancies.

Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is an undifferentiated (non-Hodgkin's) lymphoma, first described in 1958 and typically classified into two forms, endemic and non-endemic, that frequently results in extranodal involvement. The endemic (African) form is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus and affects children in Africa. The non-endemic BL has no clearly established association with the virus and is also found in other parts of the world. The endemic form involves the jaws more frequently, with the maxilla affected twice as often as the mandible, although a bimaxillary presentation is not uncommon.  $90\%$  of cases demonstrate a rearrangement involving MYC (8q24), most commonly with IGH (14q32) or less frequently to IGK (2p12) or IGL (22q11). The patient may present with swelling, mild pain, and premature loss of teeth with no associated neurologic findings. When the maxillary sinus is involved, proptosis of the globe may be evident. On radiographic examination, a nonspecific radiolucency without distinct cortical outlines and loss of lamina dura around the teeth will be seen. Diagnosis is made by histological examination of lesional tissue that will reveal the classically described "starry sky" appearance due to numerous small round cells in a background fibrous connective tissue stroma. Aggressive chemotherapy, with high doses of alkylating agents, will lead to remission in about  $90\%$  of the cases. Surgical debulking to reduce tumor burden has been used, mainly in abdominal involvement, but the benefit of such an approach remains controversial. In addition, surgical complications may impact on the timely initiation of chemotherapy with devastating results. At present, surgery for head and neck disease is limited to biopsy for diagnostic purposes. If relapse occurs after adequate treatment, the tumor generally will respond well to additional chemotherapy, while untreated disease has very poor prognosis [9, 12, 74-80].

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a very common neoplastic disorder in children and may present in one of the following three forms: eosinophilic granuloma, generalized or chronic disseminated histiocytosis

(Previously known as Hand-Schuller-Christian disease), and Letterer-Siwe (acute disseminated) disease. Eosinophilic granuloma represents an isolated bone disease and has the best response to treatment. The chronic disseminated form involves punched-out bone lesions, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos. The most aggressive acute disseminated form is highly lethal and is characterized by multi-organ involvement. LCH is a proliferation of cells exhibiting phenotypic characteristics of Langerhans cells. The similar microscopic appearance of all three forms provides the rationale for grouping these lesions together, despite the diverse clinical presentation between them.

All forms of LCH have their onset early in childhood (peak between 1 and 4 years) and often symptoms from involvement of the maxillofacial region warrant further work-up and diagnostic testing. Lytic lesions in the jaws or other bones are found commonly and appear as "punched out" radiolucencies. In the tooth-bearing regions of the jaws, the involved teeth give the characteristic appearance of "floating in empty space." Definitive diagnosis of the disease process via biopsy and a thorough investigation for the extent of involvement of the rest of the skeleton and other organs are crucial. Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count to investigate for bone marrow involvement, and electrolytes, urinalysis, urine and serum osmolality, and bone marrow biopsy should be considered when indicated.

Prognosis and response to treatment is mainly dependent on the organs involved and their functional status. Chemotherapy with alkylating agents, folate antagonists, and steroids alone or in combination, usually has a good response. Localized lesions however may respond well to radiotherapy, but this form of therapy is usually avoided due to the devastating impact of radiation on growth in children. Eosinophilic granuloma lesions are treated with enucleation or intralesional steroids and have a good prognosis. Recurrences of LCH are encountered commonly and remain difficult treatment challenges. New chemotherapeutic agents are continuously introduced, while good responses are being reported with bone marrow transplantation for refractory cases [9, 12, 81-86].

Approximately  $80 - 90\%$  of Hodgkin's disease cases involve the neck, most commonly the submandibular  $(90\%)$  and less often the supraclavicular  $(10\%)$  lymph nodes. Adolescent boys are affected more often than girls. The lymph nodes involved appear as firm, enlarged rubbery masses accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma more commonly affects extranodal sites and, when present in children, occur typically at a younger age than does Hodgkin's disease. Various

regions of the maxillofacial skeleton are involved including Waldeyer's ring, nasopharynx, mandible, and orbit. Cervical lymph nodes lower in the neck are involved more often than the submandibular nodes. For both groups, prognosis and outcome depend on the stage and histologic pattern, although Hodgkin's disease has an overall better prognosis. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a persistent cervical mass, which does not respond to antibiotic therapy, is accompanied by constitutional symptoms, and has no clear etiology, should be considered immediately. Once the diagnosis is established, an appropriate staging work-up should be undertaken. Currently, computerized tomography (CT) remains the gold standard for staging, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are useful alternatives. The Ann Arbor staging system for lymphomas and the International Prognostic Index (IPI) for each subcategory combined are shown to provide valuable information not only for staging purposes but also for critical decision-making with regards to treatment recommendations [87-90]. Also, various chemotherapeutic regimens and radiotherapy are available and employed in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Radiotherapy is obviously reserved for localized disease. Failures and relapses occur often years after initial treatment, and usually the new tumor responds to the same chemotherapeutic regimen as the original lesion. If relapse occurs during treatment, it is usually due to the development of drug-resistant clones, and is a sign of poor prognosis [91-96].

# 39.3.3 Neurogenic Tumors

Congenital gingival granular cell tumor (congenital epulis) is a relatively rare tumor of neural origin that appears on the anterior gingiva of newborns. The lesion generally presents as a non-inflamed pendunculated mass, occurring more often in the maxillary anterior gingival regions, and it affects girls more often than boys. The cell of origin is believed to be the Schwann cell, as with the granular cell tumor, based on immunohistochemical studies (S-100 positivity and actin negativity). If the lesion does not spontaneous regress with eruption of the deciduous tooth, then surgical excision is adequate treatment, since there is no recurrence potential.

Mucosal neuromas appear early in life in children with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN) type III. MEN type III is an autosomal-dominant disorder, consisting of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland, and mucosal neuromas. The neuromas are small discrete nodules that

appear on the lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, larynx, or conjunctiva. Of significant clinical importance is the fact that these lesions may be the first manifestation of the MEN-III syndrome that can be fatal if not diagnosed early. Surgical excision of the neuromas is usually adequate treatment.

Neurofibromas in the oral cavity in children may be familial due to neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen disease of the skin) Type 1 (NF 1), or occur sporadically. Histological examination reveals haphazardly arranged spindle cells that represent Schwann cells, in a delicate connective tissue stroma. The plexiform neurofibroma subtype is thought to be characteristic of NF and most often is found to involve the parotid and less commonly the submandibular or sublingual glands. Treatment is surgical excision, which can be challenging for the plexiform type since it frequently has multiple extensions. Superficial parotidectomy with sparing of the facial nerve can be used in order to accomplish tumor debulking [12, 97-101].

Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is thought to originate from neural crest tissue, and is a rare benign neoplasm found in infants younger than 6 months of age, usually occurring in the maxilla. The tumor cells produce melanin that imparts a dark (brown or dark blue/black) pigmentation to the lesion, while the overlying epithelium remains intact. Radiographically it will appear as poorly defined radiolucency often containing multiple deciduous teeth. Histologically the tumor demonstrates an alveolar pattern with nests of tumor cells and small amounts of connective tissue that are found between the tumor nests and there is typically a well-defined margin around the tumor. Surgical excision, en bloc resection, or enucleation are curative treatment measures and the recurrence potential is relatively low with a reported  $15\%$  from a few reported case series.

# 39.3.4 Vascular Pathology

Vascular anomalies are very common in the head and neck and frequently occur in the pediatric age group. Their management can be challenging, and evidence-based decisions about treatment are complicated by an inconsistency in the nomenclature for these lesions found in the literature. In 1982, Mulliken and Glowacki proposed a biological classification for these lesions based on their clinical and histologic findings. Based upon this classification scheme, which has been supported by subsequent radiographic and biochemical studies, vascular anomalies are classified as: hemangiomas and vascular malformations (Table 39.7). The aneurysmal bone cyst is discussed here, since it is believed

Table 39.7 Classification of vascular anomalies

to originate from a vascular malformation that is usually initiated by an unrelated bone lesion ultimately resulting in the formation of a pseudocyst.

Hemangiomas are the most common tumors in infancy, especially in premature babies weighing less than  $1000\mathrm{g}$ , with girls affected three to five times more often than boys. Caucasians are more prone to the development of hemangiomas, while the incidence in African-Americans and Asians is low (1.4% and 0.8%, respectively). Hemangiomas are proliferative lesions characterized by increased turnover of endothelial cells. They appear as solitary lesions in 80% of children, and 60% of the tumors are found in the cervicofacial region. They occur sporadically, although there are some tumors that may follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in familial cases. Hemangiomas may be superficial, deep, or visceral, and, although the location does not alter the biologic behavior, it does affect the clinical manifestations.

Hemangiomas typically appear during the first 2 years of life, if they are not present or evident at birth, as an erythematous patch, telangiectatia, or blanched area, when they are located superficially. Deep lesions may appear bluish, or a deep purple color, while the visceral ones will generally not be evident on clinical examination. There is classically a proliferative phase of rapid enlargement that follows and outpaces the child's body growth, which may last for 4-8 months before it plateaus to be consistent with body habitus growth. During this phase, the bright coloration exhibited by the lesions gives the characteristic "strawberry" appearance. Clinical appearance, however, may be misleading, and Mulliken and Young emphasize that "not all strawberries are hemangiomas, and not all hemangiomas look like strawberries." By age 12 months the involution phase starts and usually continues for the next 5-7 years. Roughly half of the lesions become involuted by age 5, and  $70\%$  by 7 years of age, but the process may continue

until adolescence. Even with complete involution, some clinical signs of the tumor may still be evident on physical examination.

A derangement of angiogenesis, which is characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of vascular elements, results in the formation of a hemangioma. Various tumor factors and markers of angiogenesis (e.g. fibroblastic growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen) are increased during the rapid proliferative phase, and begin to decrease with the initiation of involution. None of these factors can be identified in lesions that have become completely involuted. Histologic examination will reveal abnormal plump endothelial cells with increased mitotic activity, increased number of mast cells in the extracellular matrix, and these histopathologic findings will differ during the various stages of progression of the lesion.

Clinical examination is adequate for the diagnosis of hemangioma in  $95\%$  of the cases, and if additional information is required to study the extent of the lesion or the level of involvement of adjacent anatomy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred diagnostic modality. In T2-weighted MRI images, the lesions will have similar signal intensity to adjacent muscle tissue, while gadolinium enhancement will reveal a mass with a high signal intensity. Treatment is not required for lesions that involute completely unless there is scarring or excessive overlying skin remaining that may need to be removed for cosmetic reasons. Lesions that undergo only partial involution, and those that may cause severe cosmetic deformities, may require earlier surgical intervention. For periorbital lesions that may interfere with visual axis development and with a risk of amblyopia development, treatment should be considered in a more prompt time frame. Intralesional steroids, or surgical resection, have been the proposed treatment modalities based upon the size and location of the

hemangioma. Intrabony lesions and deep visceral involvement may cause uncontrolled life-threatening bleeding, or iron deficiency anemias, due to occult blood loss. The most common complication of hemangiomas is overlying skin ulceration that is managed with local wound care and topical or systemic antibiotics with surgical excision in recurrent cases.

The second group of vascular lesions, the vascular malformations (VM), represent an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels. Further subclassification of VM is based either on the type of vessels involved (capillary, venous, arterial, lymphatic, or combined forms) or on the flow characteristics of the lesion (low- vs. high-flow VM). High-flow VMs are arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or arteriovenous fistulas, while low-flow lesions are capillary, venous, or lymphatic VMs. VMs are present at birth since they represent errors in morphogenesis, but, unlike hemangiomas, may go undetected until later in life even into the teenage years. The lesion "grows" with the child and is usually affected by hormonal changes with occasional accelerated growth during puberty (Fig. 39.11). The clinical appearance and characteristics vary according to the type of VM lesion. A palpable thrill or audible bruit may be evident in highflow lesions, while diascopy can help to distinguish

![](images/93aaea0a4c4d388cb6f1b368c2350f3cf7c1641d721e86317a77c19e9a3cc2ce.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 39.11 Low flow vascular malformation in the tongue that demonstrated sudden increase in size with puberty. Patient is 16 years old

venous malformations from subcutaneous or deep hemangiomas since both appear bluish on clinical examination. Diascopy is performed by pressing a glass slide over the lesion and observing for blanching of the bluish/deep purple color as blood is evacuated from the VM; while in contrast, no color change is noted when diascopy is performed on a hemangioma.

Angiography will provide valuable diagnostic and treatment planning information for AVMs and assist in identification of any major feeding vessel(s) that can be subsequently embolized as the sole treatment, or as a treatment to attempt to shrink the lesion prior to resection. Intralesional sclerosing agents (e.g. sodium tetradecyl sulfate, bleomycin) can be used for venous malformations with good results, while capillary malformations may be treated with any one of the several commercially available pulsed dye lasers. Lymphatic malformations can be more challenging to treat especially those comprised mainly of small cystic spaces. When large cystic spaces are present, injection of streptococcal OK-432 into the large spaces has proven to be successful in shrinkage of these lesions. Excision may be difficult when extensive lymphatic malformations involve the neck (cystic hygromas), since vital structures may be encompassed by the mass and there may be no clear plane for surgical dissection resulting in inadvertent sacrifice of associated structures [102-113].

Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), or more appropriately termed a pseudocyst, represents a benign lesion of bone that can involve the jaws as well as any other bone in the body. The involvement of the craniofacial skeleton is reported to be approximately  $5\%$ , with the majority  $(40\%)$  of cases involving the mandible (Fig. 39.12). ABC is generally considered to be a reactive process, and some underlying bone condition such as fibrous dysplasia, or central giant cell granuloma or ossifying fibroma, is usually identified as the antecedent lesion to the formation of an aneurysmal bone cyst. There is a female predilection, and pain is described in  $50\%$  of the cases. Nonpulsatile bony expansion is evident on clinical examination without a bruit or a thrill. Radiographic examination may reveal tooth displacement due to the presence of a unilocular or multilocular radiolucency that may appear to be destructive in nature. On histologic examination, there are sinusoidal blood spaces devoid of endothelial lining that may contain a large number of multinucleated giant cells, extravasated blood cells, and hemosiderin breakdown products. Reactive bone formation may be noted as well. Simple curettage of the lesion may contribute to recurrence, and additional modalities such as cryotherapy have been proposed as an adjunctive therapeutic measure [6, 114].

# 39.3.5 Congenital Head and Neck Masses and Cysts

Congenital masses (some representing cystic lesions) are classically divided based upon their location in the neck as midline, or lateral, and include a wide variety of specific cysts and tumors (Table 39.8). The dermoid and thyroglossal duct cyst from the midline group and the branchial (cleft) cyst from the lateral group are discussed here since they occur most commonly in the pediatric patient population.

Approximately  $7\%$  of all dermoid cysts occur in the head and neck region, and  $20\%$  of these are located in the cervical region. They are considered developmental in origin due to entrapment of pluripotential cells or epithelium implantation during embryogenesis. Clinical features are dependent upon the location of the mass with regards to the relationship to the mylohyoid muscle. Those located superior to the mylohyoid muscle may cause displacement the tongue superiorly and posteriorly and appear as a midline swelling in the floor of the mouth. Those dermoid cysts located inferior to the myo- hyoid muscle will present externally as a midline neck mass. These cysts are painless, do not demonstrate constitutional symptoms, exhibit a slow growth pattern, generally remain small  $(<  2\mathrm{cm})$  and, although present at birth, may go unrecognized until later in life. Palpation of the dermoid cyst reveals a soft-doughy mass due to the keratin and sebum contained within the cyst. Histological examination will reveal various secondary skin structures contained within the lumen of the cyst which is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. If all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) are present in the lesion, then the mass is designated as

Table 39.8 Congenital neck masses based on location in the neck  

<table><tr><td>Midline congenital neck masses</td><td>Lateral congenital neck masses</td></tr><tr><td>Ranula</td><td>Branchial cleft cyst (BCC)</td></tr><tr><td>Thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC)</td><td>Lymphangioma</td></tr><tr><td>Dermoid cyst</td><td>Hemangioma</td></tr><tr><td>Epidermoid cyst</td><td>Laryngocele</td></tr><tr><td>Teratoma</td><td>Fibromatosis coli</td></tr><tr><td>Thymic cyst</td><td></td></tr></table>

teratoma. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, and recurrence is unusual [6, 115, 116].

Thyroglossal duct cyst is the most common developmental cyst in the neck, and accounts for two-thirds of the lesions in this group. They can be present as early as the fifth year of life, and appear with equal frequency among boys and girls as a midline neck mass anywhere between the tongue and the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland. The etiology is related to the embryology and formation of the thyroid gland, and involves failure of the thyroglossal duct to involute, which should occur between the fifth and 8 week of gestation. The cyst is lined with respiratory epithelium that undergoes a squamous metaplasia with repeated infections. Occasionally thyroid glandular tissue may be identified within the cyst as well. Due to the fact that the decent of the thyroglossal duct occurs before formation of the hyoid bone, the

cyst is usually located posterior to the hyoid bone, but can also be found within the hyoid bone as well. A classical clinical finding that helps narrow the differential diagnosis is that the thyroglossal duct cyst moves during swallowing as well as tongue protrusion. Once a thyroid scan confirms that a normal thyroid gland is present, and that there is no associated pathology with the gland itself, and that the cyst does not contain the majority of functional thyroid gland or parathyroid gland tissue, the thyroglossal duct cyst can be surgically removed via a transcervical approach (Sistrunk procedure) [6, 115, 117, 118].

Branchial (cleft) cysts (BCC) are the most common congenital masses located in the lateral compartment of the neck. The intraoral counterpart, the lymphoepithelial cyst, is most commonly found in the floor of the mouth or the lateral tongue, and contains, as the name implies, both lymphoid tissue as well as epithelial tissue. The BCC is thought to be the result of incomplete obliteration of a branchial arch, cleft, or pouch during embryogenesis. There are five branchial arches, all of which are mesodermal in origin, which are responsible for the formation of specific structures (bone, muscles, cartilage, nerves, and vessels) in the head and neck (Table 39.9). The BCC will generally follow a pathway between the derivatives of the responsible branchial arches, and this is critical information that will dictate

the technique for surgical removal. Fistulas and sinus tracts associated with the branchial apparatus can also form and may be present at birth, but are much less common that branchial cleft cysts. The most common branchial cleft cyst is the one derived from the second branchial arch, and is referred to as a cervical lymphoepithelial cyst. The other BCCs account for approximately  $95\%$  of the branchial apparatus anomalies. These appear as asymptomatic masses anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with equal frequency among males and females. On occasion, upper respiratory tract infections may cause an increase in the size of a BCC due to the respiratory epithelial component of the cyst. Histologically, the BCCs are epithelial-lined and contain a nodular or lymphoid infiltrate often containing germinal centers. Treatment is surgical excision.

# 39.3.6 Epithelial Neoplasms

Epithelial neoplasms of the head and neck, specifically squamous cell carcinomas, are extremely rare in children. Lesions suspicious for malignancy should undergo a standard incisional biopsy following basic surgical principles. All cases of malignancy should be presented and discussed at an institutional multidisciplinary head and neck tumor board, and appropriate consultations

with internal medicine colleagues and radiation oncologists should be obtained. If these malignancies are encountered in childhood, they are treated as for adults following the basic oncologic principles, with treatment consisting of resection with adequate tissue margins (1 cm linear margins, with resection to the next anatomic barrier), and neck dissection, when indicated. Appropriate reconstruction, with consideration for use of free vascularized hard and soft tissue flaps, when indicated, should take into account the child's continued growth, and the future need for dental implants and prosthetic reconstruction (Fig. 39.13).

# 39.3.7 Mesenchymal Neoplasms

Ewing's sarcoma (ES), first described by James Ewing in 1921, is a lethal round cell sarcoma of unknown etiology that represents approximately  $6\%$  of all bone malignancies. It has been related to primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) due to the presence of the same karyotype

![](images/5d238d41bd8240e700eac58a2f498094d8fa38bfc4685b839bb3571288a55068.jpg)

translocations, which are evident in  $90\%$  of ES cases.  $1\%$  of the head and neck tumors involve the jaws, most commonly the mandibular ramus region. The mean age of occurrence of these tumors is approximately 11 years of age, and over  $50\%$  of the cases affect male patients. The classic presentation is the rapid onset of pain and facial swelling that may be confused with an infectious process. An elevated white blood cell count, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein may further support an infectious process and delay diagnosis and treatment. There is rapid bone destruction and loosening of teeth with an overlying soft tissue mass present in some cases. Radiographically a moth-eaten destructive process of the medullary bone with cortical erosion is present, while a periosteal reaction with proliferation or "onion-skinning" may also be evident. On histologic examination a uniform distribution of tightly packed cells is identified. The cells will stain positively for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain that indicates the presence of glycogen in the tumor. The anaplastic and undifferentiated nature of this tumor is encountered in various other childhood malignancies and clinical differentiation is essential in order to confirm the diagnosis of ES. The differential diagnosis should include lymphoma, osteosarcoma (small cell type), mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and metastatic carcinoma. In addition, facial bone involvement may represent a metastatic process from other distant sites. Special immunohistochemical studies as well as electron microscopy may be used in difficult diagnostic dilemma cases so that appropriate treatment can be initiated without delay.

Treatment of ES requires control of the local disease as well as treatment of the metastatic process (often pulmonary) that occurs commonly with this malignancy. In fact, the majority of ES cases will present with micrometastasis at the time of initial presentation and a comprehensive metastatic work-up is essential. The various protocols developed, which include intense chemotherapy with aggressive surgical resection, have dramatically improved survival. In the past, only a  $10\%$  5-year actuarial survival rate was reported, but recent developments have resulted in significant improvement, with a reported  $80\%$  2-year, and  $60\%$  5-year, disease-free survival. When chemotherapy fails, and surgery is not possible, radiotherapy has been advocated with a modest response, but with serious potential effects on the growth of the maxillofacial skeleton in the pediatric patient. Poor prognostic and treatment indicators for Ewing's sarcoma include a presentation before 10 years of age, metastatic disease present at the time of initial presentation, and lack of response to aggressive chemotherapy regimens [9, 12, 119-123].

# 39.4 Salivary Gland Pathology

# 39.4.1 Inflammatory Salivary Gland Disease

Mumps is the most common viral non-suppurative condition that involves the parotid glands and usually occurs bilaterally. Since the introduction and routine administration of an attenuated vaccine for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) in 1967, the yearly incidence of mumps in the United States has decreased from 76 to 2 cases per 100,000. The usual cause is an influenza/parainfluenza-related paramyxovirus with epidemic outbreaks occurring in spring and winter months. Other potential viruses include Coxsackie A and B, Epstein Barr, influenza and parainfluenza, as well as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fever, chills, headache, and preauricular pain occur 1-2 days prior to the appearance of unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid glands that may last between 5 and 10 days. Supportive therapy and hydration without excessive stimulation of the salivary glands is usually adequate since spontaneous resolution occurs in the majority of uncomplicated cases.

Chronic, recurrent bacterial infections are usually of multifactorial etiology, and may involve a sequence of events that make the glands vulnerable to recurrent infections due to fibrosis and microcyst formation. In children, chronic recurrent juvenile (parotid) sialoadenitis is caused either by a congenital abnormality of Stensen's duct (enlarged with a poor punctual seal), or a problem with the gland itself that may have baseline poor function due to repeated episodes of viral parotitis. Long-term antibiotic use with systemic steroids have anecdotally been reported to be successful treatments of this condition; however, sialography, which shows a "snow storm" pattern of sialectasis, is not only diagnostic but also frequently curative. Additionally, parasitic infections, or tuberculous mycobacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, can be found in young or immunocompromised children and may mimic salivary gland tumors and clinical differentiation is warranted [124-137].

# 39.4.2 Cystic Conditions of the Salivary Glands

The most common "cystic" condition of the minor salivary glands in children is the mucocele, which represents a mucous extravasation phenomenon and involves the lower lip labial minor salivary glands. The etiology of mucocele formation is usually trauma to the glands from accidental lip biting and trauma to the underlying

![](images/b0fd79345190581210b563b6201828ddad4f53d1345cf0a0c02bd05743f45626.jpg)  
Fig. 39.14 Mucocele of the lower lip (9-year-old boy)

minor salivary gland tissue (Fig. 39.14). The escape of mucin into the submucosal tissues triggers an inflammatory response by neutrophils and macrophages. The granulation tissue that forms creates a capsule around the free mucin, while the injured glands undergo associated inflammatory changes. With repeated injuries the capsule ruptures and the mucocele regresses, but maintains the potential to reform after the mucosa heals. Over time scarring and fibrosis may occur and the contributing glands may undergo atrophy and form a fibroma in the previous location of the mucocele. The treatment of a mucocele, or mucous-retention cyst, is surgical removal along with the contributing minor salivary glands to prevent recurrence at the same site. "Recurrent" cases, with an incidence of  $15 - 30\%$ , are usually due to incomplete initial removal of the lesion and associated minor salivary glands, or repeated trauma. The use of a carbon dioxide  $\mathrm{(CO_2)}$  laser for treatment of the surgical bed (minor salivary glands) with expected healing by secondary intention has been used with some success for recurrent mucocele lesions.

Ranulas, common in children, are mucous extravasation phenomena (mucoceles) of the floor of the mouth associated with the sublingual gland. Trauma to the sublingual gland, or dysgenetic development of the sublingual ductal system, appears to be the most accepted causative theories for this condition, although there seems to be an association with sarcoidosis ("sarcoid ranula"). The accumulation of saliva under the thin mucosa of the floor of the mouth causes the pathognomonic appearance of swelling under the tongue or "frog's belly" (rana = frog) (Fig. 39.15). The mylohyoid muscle distinguishes ranulas that are contained above the muscle in the floor of the mouth, from those that extend through the mylohyoid muscle inferiorly into the neck as "plunging ranulas," that may compromise the airway. CT or MRI will provide the necessary information for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in cases of plunging ranulas, since other neck masses or

Fig. 39.15 Ranula (11-year-old boy)

cysts must be ruled out. Marsupialization has been shown to be successful as initial treatment of ranulas contained in the oral cavity; however, definitive treatment (either primary or for recurrent lesions) is surgical removal of the sublingual gland, along with the ranula, with protection of the lingual nerve and Wharton's duct [131, 133, 134, 138-140].

# 39.5 Salivary Gland Neoplasms

Salivary gland tumors are rare in the pediatric population, and additional details regarding the pleomorphic adenoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma can be found elsewhere in this textbook. The diagnostic methods used in the evaluation of salivary gland tumors in children is the same as in adults. Fine needle aspiration biopsy, computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful studies for establishing an appropriate diagnosis [141-143].

# 39.5.1 Benign Salivary Gland Tumors

Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most common benign salivary gland tumor in children. It originates from either dual proliferation of cells with ductal or myoepithelial features or proliferation of a single cell with the potential to differentiate into either cell type. The myoepithelial features are responsible for determining the composition and histologic appearance of these tumors. Virtually all PAs of the major glands occur in the parotid gland. The most common site for minor salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma is the palate. Surgical treatment

is the same as in adults, including wide local excision to prevent recurrence due to unpredictable extensions of the PA capsule peripherally. The periosteum serves as an excellent anatomic barrier if not involved; otherwise excision of the periosteum and underlying bone excision is recommended [131, 134, 144-153].

# 39.5.2 Malignant Salivary Gland Tumors

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MECA) is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in children, for both minor and major salivary gland neoplasms. MECA represents  $16\%$  of all salivary gland tumors, and  $51\%$  of the malignant neoplasms. The intraosseous variant is believed to originate from embryonically entrapped salivary gland elements, may occasionally be found in children, and appears as a well-defined radiolucency of the mandible. On the basis of histologic appearance and degree of differentiation, this tumor is classified by grade. A low-grade or well-differentiated MECA is composed largely of mucous-secreting cells, often forming large glandular spaces; and a high-grade or poorly-differentiated MECA is characterized by a preponderance of squamous cells with a scant mucous component. An intermediate grade MECA has been described as well, with a mixture of both mucous and epidermoid elements. Treatment is based upon the grade of differentiation and location of the tumor, and varies from wide local excision of low grade lesions to a more aggressive surgical resection with margins for high-grade lesions (Fig. 39.16). Low- and intermediate-grade tumors in childhood have a better prognosis and response to treatment than high-grade lesions [154-156].

# Conclusions

In the chapter the various cysts, tumors, and pathologic conditions that are either unique or occur more often in this region in the pediatric age group are discussed. Also the most updated information regarding the pathophysiology, work-up, and available treatment modalities for these conditions are provided. Although maxillofacial tumors are rare in the pediatric population, certain processes are specific to this age. Thus, a good understanding of these specific conditions is invaluable in treatment data gathering and formulating the most appropriate treatment plan.
