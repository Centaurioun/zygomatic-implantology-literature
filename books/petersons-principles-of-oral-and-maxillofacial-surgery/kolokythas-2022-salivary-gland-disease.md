# 37.1 Introduction

Salivary glands are divided into the paired major glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) located in their specified anatomic locations in the head and neck and the minor salivary glands found in the submucosa throughout the oral cavity, oropharynx, sinuses, and trachea. It is estimated that there are approximately 500-1000 lobules of minor salivary gland tissue dispersed throughout the oral/oropharyngeal mucosal and submucosal tissues of the lips, floor of mouth, hard and soft palate, tonsillar pillars, buccal mucosa, and tongue. Typically, development begins in utero around the 35th day for the major and 40th day for the minor glands, and their origin is the ectoderm. Secretions by the glands in the form of saliva can be mucous, serous, or most commonly mixed. Specifically, secretions from the parotid are mainly serous (viscosity = 1.5) and contribute about  $25\%$  of the daily saliva while those from the sublingual and minor salivary glands located more posteriorly in the oral cavity are more mucous in nature (viscosity = 13.4) and have only minor contribution to the daily saliva production. Seventy-one percent of the saliva is produced by the submandibular glands and is mixed in consistency with viscosity around 3.4. Saliva is produced at a rate of 1000-1500 cc per day and primarily functions as a lubricant for speech and mastication, while initiation of digestion due to enzymes and some antimicrobial properties are provided (Tables 37.1 and 37.2). The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the control of salivary secretions by the glands. Sympathetic fibers travel via arterial plexus from the superior cervical ganglion, while parasympathetic stimulation travels to the parotid via cranial nerve nine and to the submandibular and sublingual glands via cranial nerve seven [1-4].

Anatomically, the parotids are located superficial and posterior to the masseter muscle and the mandibular ramus and are divided into superficial and deep lobes by the facial nerve. The saliva travels through a  $6\mathrm{cm}$  long,  $1 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter duct, known as the Stenson's duct, that opens into the oral cavity at the

buccal mucosa adjacent to the second molar. The course of the duct involves a sharp turn at the anterior border of the masseter muscle medially through the buccinator before it enters the oral cavity. The submandibular glands are located at the submandibular triangle bilaterally formed by the two bellies of the digastric muscle, the mylohyoid and platysma. The gland loops behind the mylohyoid muscle and extends into the oral cavity, and it may be in intimate relationship or in continuity with the sublingual gland requiring sharp dissection during excision. The Wharton duct,  $5\mathrm{cm}$  long  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter, empties the saliva from the gland into the oral cavity at the punctum located at the midline of the anterior floor of the mouth. Along its course in the floor of the mouth, it receives saliva from the sublingual gland via the duct of Rivinus and is in close association with the lingual nerve that loops around the duct twice from lateral to medial. Finally, the sublingual gland is located between the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and the mylohyoid muscle in the sublingual space. Saliva from the gland is transferred either through the Bartholin's ducts that start within the gland and coalesce to form the ducts of Rivinus that subsequently empty into Wharton's duct, or via short small ducts that open directly into the floor of mouth mucosa at the plica sublingualis [2, 5-16].

# 37.2 Diagnostic Modalities

The most important component in diagnosing salivary gland disorders is a detailed history and careful clinical examination. To augment the findings and aid in diagnosis, a variety of diagnostic imaging techniques are available that for practical purposes are employed for examination of the parotid and the submandibular glands. Plain films, either as mandibular occlusal and/or a panoramic radiograph, can be easily obtained in the office setting to quickly evaluate for the presence of a suspected sialolith (stone) in the submandibular gland ductal system since  $80 - 85\%$  of these stones are radiopaque (Fig. 37.1). With the current availability of Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) in most maxillofacial surgery and dental offices, the use of plain films for sialolith detection is probably obsolete. The incidence of radiopaque stones in the parotid is only  $40\%$  limiting the value of plain films for sialolithiasis of this gland. Mucous plugs are more commonly involved in parotid obstruction and stasis. Similarly, computer tomography (CT) is very helpful for identification of radiopaque stones and, of course, provides superior information to the plain films with details about exact location of the stone and status of the duct proximally and distally (Fig. 37.2) [2, 7, 9].

The gold standard for imaging the ductal system for salivary gland examination has traditionally been the sialogram. Unfortunately, the expertise needed to perform the study may not be readily available in all institutions. It is contraindicated in the presence of acute infection and iodine allergy. This modality provides important information regarding location and etiology of obstruction, presence of inflammation, and/or destruction of acini as well as allowing therapeutic dilation and irrigation of the ductal system in cases of obstruction. Specific imaging appearance of the gland parenchyma and its ductal system during the sialogram are pathognomonic for normal anatomy and functional status as well as specific pathologic entities (Fig. 37.3). Small stones or mucous plugs, sludge or debris in the ductal system of the glands can be "flushed out" during the injection of the contrast. Endoscopic

sialogrophy (discussed later) is replacing sialography as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality for ductal disease in those institutions where there are surgeons skilled in its use.

Technetium-99 m scintigraphy assists in evaluation of the salivary gland parenchyma, function and provides information for certain intraglandular tumors based on the radioisotope uptake. About  $80\%$  of benign lesions will appear "cold," with the exception of Warthin's tumor and oncocytomas that will appear "hot," while lymphoid tumors will appear "warm." It has been demonstrated that although sialography is superior in diagnosis and demonstration of obstructive conditions, scintigraphy is superior when neoplasms are suspected. Unfortunately, the study will not provide detailed anatomic information and tumor extension that are crucial for treatment decision making [17-21].

Ultrasound (US)-assisted examination of salivary gland pathology has been claimed to be superior to sialography, and with color Doppler imaging the limitations of distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors may be improved. Distinction of fluid-filled versus solid masses can be easily and quickly made due to the superficial position of the glands that allows for imaging with high-resolution US probes. The noninvasive nature of the study makes it an attractive alternative to other modalities especially when contraindications, such as allergy to intravenous contrast or claustrophobia, limit their use. Additionally, US-guided aspiration of fluid or biopsy of deeply located masses can provide valuable information in experienced hands. At present, the main limiting factor remains the ability to acquire accurate information in cases of minor salivary gland

disease, inflammation, and coexistence of small tumors with other conditions, and the lack of highly trained personnel for good information acquisition and interpretation [17-30].

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the gold standard for evaluation of salivary tumors (benign or malignant) (Fig. 37.4). MRI is superior to CT scan for evaluation of masses because it provides excellent soft tissue detail, delineation of the margins between tumor and glandular tissue, as well as presence of perineural spread with superior anatomic details. MRI is superior in detection of minor salivary gland pathology and detection of small tumors within inflammation, for example, cases of Sjögren's disease and coexistence of malignancy. In addition, MRI is the only imaging modality that can provide information regarding involvement of cranial nerves with tumor when clinical findings are not present or evident. Dynamic MR imaging has been used in evaluation of salivary gland function in patients with Sjögren's disease with promising results, but lack of expertise may limit the wide availability of this diagnostic modality [15, 31-33].

Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake has been extensively studied and accepted in cancer staging, therapy monitoring, and management of recurrent disease. Studies of the utility of FDG PET for salivary gland neoplasms have demonstrated that there is definitely a role for FDG PET in major salivary gland malignancies for initial staging, histologic grading, and monitoring or restaging posttreatment. In addition, FDG PET may have a role in incidental findings of tumors or cases of benign pathology, such as Warthin's tumor, in which the findings of other imaging modalities, such as scintigraphy, may be misleading. The 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not recommend PET for staging of salivary gland pathology due to the high metabolic activity exhibited by Warthin's tumor and the fact that ACC (Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma), a high-grade malignancy, is not PET avid [29, 34-38].

The interest in using saliva as a potential diagnostic tool over the last few decades is reflected in the literature by the proliferation of information from sialochemistry, salivary gland immunoglobulin assay, and salivary biomarker identification studies. The collection of saliva and analysis of its chemical composition may provide information regarding involvement of salivary glands in systemic disease processes or in cases of salivary pathology with no systemic manifestations or to evaluate the functional status of the gland. Specifically, alterations of sodium and potassium relative concentrations are evident in inflammatory conditions and can be demonstrated with sialochemistry studies [3, 5, 9, 39-48].

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) remains the gold standard for diagnosis of salivary gland tumors. Open biopsy for major salivary glands harbors the potential for facial scar, injury to the facial nerve, or development of fistula or sialocele, violation of tumor capsule and tumor spill, so it is restricted to the minor gland pathology. FNAB has high specificity and sensitivity  $(>90\%)$ , and provides accurate diagnosis in regard to presence of malignancy and is preferred for masses of the major glands. FNAB cannot distinguish between subtypes of malignancy with  $1\%$  possibility of false positive and  $10\%$  false negative results. In addition with the use of CT or US guidance, FNAB can be employed to access deeply located or small tumors that could be missed with blind approaches. Open biopsy of minor salivary glands from the lower lip remains the standard approach for diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome (SS). A minimum of 10 minor glands are needed for histological examination and assignment of a "focus score." Under high magnification, an aggregate of 50 or more lymphocytes in glandular tissue represents a "focus," and the presence of more than one focus in  $4\mathrm{mm}^2$  is regarded as being consistent with salivary component of SS [2, 9, 38, 45, 49].

# 37.3 Nonneoplastic Salivary Gland Disorders

# 37.3.1 Obstructive Disease: Sialolithiasis

Stone or calculi formation is a common phenomenon occurring in the kidneys, gallbladder, as well as the salivary glands. Sialolithiasis occurs twice as often in men, between 30-50 years of age, as in women and multiple stones may be present in  $25\%$  of the patients. An abnormality of calcium metabolism and salt precipitation appears to be the initial of a series of stages that results in formation of a nidus which subsequently forms a calcified mass (sialolith) due to layering of organic and inorganic material. Recurrent episodes of swelling of the involved gland, occurring during meals, are the usual complaints. Careful inspection along with bimanual palpation of the involved gland and its duct will provide valuable information. Occasionally, purulent discharge may be expressed from the duct when secondary infection is present, along with constitutional symptoms such as pain, fever, dehydration, halitosis, reactive lymphadenopathy. Laboratory workup may indicate elevated white blood cell count in infected cases.

Stones occur more often in relationship to the submandibular gland and the composition of the saliva from this gland in addition to several anatomic factors appear to be the contributing factors. Submandibular gland saliva contains twice the amount of calcium and has a more alkaline pH compared to that produced from other glands, in part explaining the frequency of sialolith formation. The actual route of the Wharton duct from the gland to the floor of the mouth, with two sharp turns, the smaller diameter of the punctum compared to the duct and the flow of saliva against gravity, further contribute to stone formation [10].

Sialoliths that occur anterior to a transverse line drawn between the first mandibular molars may be visualized with occlusal films and can be approached for removal intraorally if they are not spontaneously passed after adequate hydration and sialogogue therapy (50% of the cases) (Fig. 37.5). The duct is cannulated first, then the stone is identified, and a ligature suture is placed distal to it prior to opening the duct. After removal of the sialolith, sialodochoplasty is performed, creating a new opening in the floor of the mouth or transposing the ductal opening distally to ensure future unobstructed salivary flow. Stones located more proximally (behind the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle) often require surgical excision of the involved gland especially when it is nonfunctional following recurrent episodes of obstruction and parenchymal destruction (Fig. 37.6). Sialo lithotripsy via

extracorporeal electromagnetic shock waves has been shown to be successful in treatment of small stones, but this approach does not appear to be favored in the United States at least. The number, size, and location of the stones appear to be some of the limiting factors of this technology. Yu et al. and Carlson among others

have published useful algorithms to guide in the management of obstructive sialadenitis and sialolithiasis [50, 51].

Sialoliths of the parotid gland and Stensen's duct present the same clinical findings and complaints but are more commonly mucous plugs found on MR imaging or sialography, while calcified stones may be visualized with CT scan. Access depends on the location along the duct or within the glandular parenchyma. Sialoliths found in the duct after it pierces the buccinator muscle may be removed intraorally via ductal dilation or a mucosal incision over the duct. Occasionally, the proximal location of the stone, with recurrent episodes of obstruction and chronic sialadenitis, may require superficial parotidectomy [2, 7, 9].

Sublingual gland sialolithiasis is a very rare event, with only one study available from Germany (Rauch 1960) reporting an incidence of  $7\%$  [52]. The clinical findings are consistent with obstruction of Wharton's duct. Sialolithiasis of the minor salivary glands is an equally rare event, and if present, microliths are incidental histologic findings upon removal of mucoceles (mucous retention cysts) and of no clinical importance. Sialography, as stated earlier, may be employed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in cases of sialolithiasis caused by small stones in Wharton or Stensen ducts that may be "flushed out" during the exam when secondary infection is not present [2, 7, 9, 10, 45, 53-56].

The use of endoscopy for examination of the salivary ductal system and retrieval of sialoliths or treatment of a variety of other conditions, such as mucous plugs, foreign bodies, ductal strictures, or kinks, have shown excellent results. Sialendoscopy has been successfully employed for removal of sialoliths in close proximity to the hilum of the submandibular gland or the parotid without necessitating removal of the gland. The revolution in endoscopy with miniature scopes and specialized instruments that can be introduced through them into the ductal system has provided surgeons with the ability to use this approach for treatment of salivary gland obstructive disease. As a diagnostic tool, endoscopy can provide information in place of or augmenting the traditional diagnostic modalities for obstructive and inflammatory disorders of the glands. In addition strictures or adhesions in the ductal system are excellent indications for balloon dilation via endoscopic approaches. The major advantage of sialendoscopy in experienced hands is the ability to preserve the glands and restore function with only few potential complications in a minimally invasive manner [9, 54, 55, 57].

Intracorporeal fragmentation of larger stones may be required and can either be mechanical, laser-assisted, or via pneumatic methods and can be done endoscopically. Using graspers or forceps introduced through the scopes,

the large stone can be broken into smaller pieces and removed. Alternatively, Er-YAG or HO-YAG lasers may be employed to fragment the stones prior to removal. Damage to the laser probe from direct contact with the stone required for fragmentation is the major limitation for the Er-YAG lasers at the present time. Potential displacement of the sialolith fragments from use of HO-YAG laser and time required are the major disadvantages of this technique. Finally, high pressure introduced via rigid probes through the endoscope has been reported for fragmentation of large sialoliths. The stones are then removed with the basket technique, but limitations of compatibility of the available probes with the endoscopes used remains a problem. Details regarding equipment, advances, case selection, risks, and potential complications of sialendoscopy are well documented in the literature by pioneers in the field [9, 58-64].

# 37.3.2 Cystic Conditions: Mucous Extravasation and Retention Phenomena, Ranulas, Sialoceles, Parotid Gland Cysts

Perhaps the most commonly encountered "cystic condition" of the minor salivary glands, especially those of the lower lip, is the mucocele, which represents a mucous extravasation phenomenon. The etiology of mucocele formation is usually trauma to the labial minor salivary glands from accidental biting and is very common with younger patients (Fig. 37.7). The escape of mucin

![](images/63443d0189f11dbf46c90222bbac693fc24c20f849402b8b327e1a786dfd6278.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 37.7 Clinical picture of mucocele/mucous extravasation phenomenon involving the lower lip

into the tissues triggers an inflammatory reaction by neutrophils and macrophages. The granulation tissue that forms creates a capsule around the free mucin, while the injured gland undergoes inflammatory changes. With repeated injuries, the capsule ruptures and the mucocele disappears only to reform after the mucosa heals. Over time scarring and fibrosis may occur, and the contributing glands undergo atrophy. Approximately  $20\%$  of these cystic lesions are true retention cysts due to obstruction of the minor salivary gland opening by a microlith and these occur in older individuals. In these cases, a true cystic lining is present that originates from normal but compressed ductal epithelium. The differential diagnosis includes traumatic fibromas, and salivary gland or mesenchymal neoplasms. The treatment of mucoceles or mucous retention cysts is surgical excision along with the contributing glands. "Recurrent" cases (incidence  $15 - 30\%$ ) are usually due to incomplete initial removal or repeated trauma. Use of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser for treatment of the surgical bed and healing by secondary intention has been reported with some success for recurrent mucoceles [2, 9, 44].

Ranulas are mucous extravasation phenomena (mucoceles) of the floor of the mouth associated with the sublingual gland and are very common in children. Trauma or dysgenic development of the sublingual ductal system appears to be the most accepted causative theories for this condition. Accumulation of saliva under the thin mucosa of the floor of the mouth causes the pathognomonic appearance of swelling under the tongue or "frog's belly" (rana = frog) (Fig. 37.8). Differential diagnosis for ranulas includes salivary gland or mesenchymal tumors and other cysts such as lymphoepithelial, dermoid or epidermoid cysts. The mylohyoid muscle separates ranulas that are contained in the floor of the mouth versus those that extend into the neck or "plunging ranulas" and may compromise the airway. CT scan or MRI will provide the necessary information for

![](images/787d8b741e6001afd95a282adddfeb07096883cde4a6179f5ca9a8f72437d53a.jpg)  
$\text{图}$  Fig. 37.8 Clinical picture of the ranula

accurate diagnosis especially in cases of plunging ranulas as other neck masses or cysts need to be excluded. The differential diagnosis for neck masses include thyroid pathology, thyroglossal duct cysts, or sublingual dermoid cysts when present in the midline or lymphadenopathy, lymphangioma (cystic hygroma), submandibular gland swelling, branchial cysts, etc. for lateral neck involvement. Marsupialization has been shown to be successful as initial treatment of ranulas contained in the oral cavity. Definitive treatment is by removal of the sublingual gland along with the ranula with care not to injure the lingual nerve or Wharton duct, which require identification and canalization of the latter [51, 52, 60].

Sialoceles are very distinct salivary retention phenomena most commonly involving the parotid and less often the submandibular glands and are the result of penetrating injury to the respective ductal system. Thinning of the skin overlying the sialocele and tenderness are common findings. Repair of the injury and prevention of fibrosis or stricture formation along with dialogogues and hydration are usually successful. In most cases following ductal or parenchymal injury, the sialocele can be cured with botulinum toxin injections. In cases of ductal injuries deep into the gland or when repair is not feasible, superficial parotidectomy may be considered [2, 9, 45, 51, 52, 55, 56, 65].

Cysts involving the submandibular gland are rare while those involving the parotid are fairly common occurring either as polycystic disease or solitary entities, clinically indistinguishable from tumors. Among solitary lesions, lymphoepithelial cysts are the most commonly encountered, but require differentiation from salivary gland neoplasms (Fig. 37.9). Most often pleomorphic adenomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, or Warthin's tumors may appear cystic on imaging and will be discussed in detail later in this chapter. Lymphoepithelial cysts histologically consist of marked lymphoid hyperplasia and squamous-lined cysts and are recently been described in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS risk factors. Bilateral involvement of the parotids is common, and occasional superficial parotidectomy is performed for cosmetic purposes or in cases of facial asymmetry [66-70].

# 37.3.3 Inflammatory

Infections of major salivary glands may be either due to bacterial or viral etiology and may be acute or chronic/ recurrent. Most commonly chronic or recurrent infections are due to an underlying etiology such as obstruction from sialoliths or ductal strictures or kinks, and treatment is correction of the primary etiology as discussed earlier.

![](images/8ee395ca65872be61ba7366fe2691f205094c663a2e394d03f6f7d6fb5fe1bc5.jpg)

Acute suppurative sialadenitis involving the parotid is the commonest salivary gland infection and is usually due to ascending infection from the oral cavity in elderly, debilitated, chronically ill, or hospitalized immunosuppressed individuals. In general, there is a slight predilection for men over age of 60, and usually there is underlying fluid imbalance and associated dehydration that allows super-infection with staphylococcus (aureus or viridans both penicillin-resistant) that normally colonize the ductal openings. The decreased salivary flow allows for entrance of the bacteria into the ductal system and glandular parenchyma causing the infection. Streptococcus or other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, or fungus may be involved and in the majority of cases a mixed flora is isolated. As in every infection pain, erythema and swelling over the involved gland that must be differentiated from an odontogenic infection along with constitutional symptoms, fever, malaise, tachycardia, etc. are present. Clinical examination will reveal lack of saliva flow from the ductal opening or expression of thick purulent discharge when the gland is "milked." Laboratory findings include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate along with leukocytosis usually with a left shift consistent with the acute nature of the infection [9, 44, 45, 47].

Treatment of acute bacterial sialadenitis involves symptomatic and supportive care with fluid replacement via intravenous hydration and antibiotic therapy, analgesics and antipyretics. Initial antibiotics are chosen based on the most commonly involved organisms such as a first-generation cephalosporin or semisynthetic

penicillin against staphylococcus species until cultures and sensitivity results are available. Occasionally, surgical drainage is required and incisions are placed in cosmetically acceptable areas avoiding injury to the facial nerve or the ducts. Hematogenous spread of bacterial infections to the parotid lymph nodes is common in infants and children and cause suppuration and nodal breakdown that require surgical drainage.

Chronic/recurrent bacterial infections are of multifactorial etiology and may involve a sequence of events that make the glands vulnerable to recurrent infections due to fibrosis and microcystic formation. These findings are well documented in the salivary gland sonography literature. The entity worth mentioning here is chronic recurrent juvenile (parotid) sialadenitis that is caused by a congenital abnormality of the Stenson's duct (that is large with a poor seal) or the gland itself that may have poor function due to repeated viral parotitis. Long-term antibiotic use and steroids have anecdotally been reported to be successful treatments with this condition. However, sialogrophy which shows the pathognomonic snowstorm sialectasis is frequently curative [9, 47, 53, 66-68]. Mumps is the most common viral nonsuppurative condition that involves the parotid gland and is usually bilateral. Since the introduction and routine administration of attenuated vaccine for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) in 1967, the yearly incidence of mumps in the United States decreased from 76 to 2 cases per 100,000. The common cause is an influenza/parainfluenza-related paramyxovirus with epidemic outbreaks occurring in spring and winter months. Other potential viruses include Coxsackie A and B, Epstein-Barr, influenza, and parainfluenza as well as HIV. Fever, chills, headache, and preauricular pain occur 1-2 days prior to unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid glands that may last between 5-10 days. Supportive therapy and hydration without excessive stimulation of the glands are adequate as spontaneous resolution occurs in the uncomplicated cases. Of significance is the risk for development of mumps pancreatitis, and in  $20\%$  of adult male patients, mumps orchitis [9, 47, 69].

Salivary glands in HIV individuals are diffusely involved and the condition is referred to as  $HIV$ -associated salivary gland disease (HIV-SGD). The usual presentation is asymptomatic swelling of one or more major glands that may fluctuate but most commonly is persistent and is due to the presence of lymphoepithelial cysts which have a pathognomonic appearance on MR imaging. Another common condition among HIV patients is diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS) that causes xerostomia and sicca symptoms. Compliance with anti-retroviral medications should assist with these conditions along with meticulous oral hygiene for prevention of opportunistic anterograde

infections. The clinician should be careful not to miss a lymphoma of the salivary glands which is also more common in AIDS patients and may be mistaken as one of the above entities [61-72].

Relatively rare conditions include parasitic infections or tuberculous mycobacteria or nontuberculous mycobacterial disease. The later conditions found in young children and immunocompromised individuals may mimic salivary gland tumors from which they require differentiation [9, 45, 46, 50, 56, 66, 68, 71-76].

# 37.3.4 Noninflammatory/Autoimmune Conditions

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a very common chronic autoimmune disorder involving mostly the exocrine glands and affecting  $0.3 - 0.6\%$  of the population. Almost all cases involve both salivary and lacrimal, glands with persistent complaints of dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). There is striking female predilection as 9 out of 10 patients are perimenopausal women in the fifth decade of life. SS may occur alone (primary SS) or in association with other autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or scleroderma (secondary SS). The etiology is currently unknown and various environmental, viral, and hormonal causes are implicated in the development of the condition. The glandular parenchyma is infiltrated and eventually destroyed by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and replacement. Clinical manifestations and complaints of xerostomia and dry eyes are classic findings in primary SS. Gastrointestinal, endocrine (mainly autoimmune thyroid disease), neurologic, hematologic, and connective tissue involvement are responsible for complaints and clinical findings in secondary SS. Interestingly, patients may have vague symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue for years before the diagnosis of secondary SS is established. Bilateral symmetric and recurrent parotid swelling may be present in  $50\%$  of these patients [9].

Sialochemistry studies, scintigraphy, contrast sialog- raphy, salivary flow rate studies, and minor salivary gland biopsy may be employed for assessment of the salivary component in Sjogren's syndrome. Lacrimal involvement is classically tested with the Schirmer's test:  $35\mathrm{mm}$  standardized sterile strips are placed in the fornix and the millimeters of wetting" in  $5\mathrm{min}$  is measured (normal  $>10\mathrm{mm}$  in  $5\mathrm{min}$ ). Findings of sialography and scintigraphy suggestive of SS, as well as the grading system developed for in labial biopsy for diagnosis of SS are discussed earlier in this chapter. Autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies,

anti-Sjögren's syndrome A and B (SS-A and SS-B) antibodies are found in both primary and secondary SS. Immunogenetic typing studies have demonstrated that expression of specific histocompatibility antigens (HLA) is statistically significant for each type of the disease, but are only a component of the potential diagnostic criteria. In 2002, a classification criterion for SS was established by the American European group and includes ocular and oral symptoms, ocular and oral tests, positive labial gland biopsy, and anti-SS-A and SS-B antibodies (Table 37.3) [47]. Diagnosis of primary SS requires at least four of the six criteria while secondary disease requires establishment of connective tissue disorder, at least one (sicca) symptom and two objective tests of ocular and oral involvement [9, 42].

Treatment for SS is mostly supportive with artificial tears and saliva substitutes, while use of sialogogues may assist in stimulating flow from the remaining functional salivary gland tissue. Probably the most concerning complication associated with SS is that patients are at higher risk over the general population in developing lymphomas. The overall prevalence is estimated to be  $4\%$ . Usually these are mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas which are low-grade non-Hodgkin's type with good prognosis. If high-grade lymphomas occur, the life expectancy is affected [9, 43, 44, 49, 55, 77-82].

Necrotizing sialometaplasia is a reactive nonneoplastic process most commonly involving the minor salivary glands of the palate, although other sites may be involved (Fig. 37.10). The proposed etiology although not clear is thought to be trauma-induced vascular

infarction of the glandular lobules. Disruption of blood flow may be due to either mechanical or thermal trauma (i.e., injection of local anesthetic, smoking) or indirect causes (i.e., vascular conditions, diabetes mellitus). The lesions resolve spontaneously and the only concern is resemblance of the condition clinically to malignancy. Histologically, the squamous metaplasia (pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia) and replacement of the ductal structures may be confused, especially by general pathologists with squamous cell or mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Good history, evidence of recent trauma and examination of the specimen by oral pathologists would prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [9, 45, 55].

Benign lymphoepithelial lesion (Mikulicz disease) was initially described in 1952 as unilateral or bilateral parotid swelling. The disease is now considered an immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4) that affects the lacrimal and salivary glands [83-85]. Similarly, Kuttner tumor/chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is now recognized as being an Ig4-related disease as well that involves the submandibular gland of patients with these conditions. Recognition and diagnosis is essential as treatment by steroid therapy may show excellent response. High plasma levels of Ig4 and Ig4-IgG positive cell ratio of  $>40\%$  support the diagnosis of Kuttner tumor that should be distinguished from other entities such as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, Sjogren's syndrome, and lymphoepithelial sialadenitis [84, 86-90].

Finally, Sarcoidosis a granulomatous disease of obscure etiology often involves the salivary glands among other organs and is a common cause of bilateral parotid enlargement. Classic histologic findings of non-caseating granulomas in biopsies of involved organs and laboratory assays are used to confirm the diagnosis. Systemic treatment with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs are employed for nonspontaneously resolving cases, with good response [9, 45, 55, 91-94]. Sarcoidosis

may present with facial nerve palsy, uveo-parotitis (Heerfordt syndrome), Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome with facial palsy and orofacial granulomatosis.

# 37.4 Neoplastic Salivary Gland Disorders

# 37.4.1 General Considerations

Salivary gland tumors account for  $2 - 6.5\%$  of all head and neck neoplasms, are more common in women with a peak incidence in the sixth or seventh decade, but can occur in all age groups. The majority of neoplasms occur in the parotid, and pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor and mucoepidermoid carcinoma the commonest malignant. The proportion of malignant tumors is greater in the minor glands while benign tumors occur more often in the major glands (with the exception of the sublingual gland). Although the etiology is not clear, risk factors for development of salivary gland neoplasms include: radiation exposure, familial or genetic predisposition, tobacco (use for specific tumors), viral etiology, and chemical exposure.

FNAB, as discussed earlier, is the most commonly employed diagnostic modality for assessment of the pathology of salivary masses. Caution with malignant tumors should be exercised as the positive predictive value of FNAB is low [95]. Under light microscopy specific features are distinctive enough for adequate diagnosis while immunohistochemical analysis may be employed in more complex cases.

Clinical staging, histologic type and grade, location, cranial nerve involvement (facial nerve), and patients' demographics are among prognostic factors implicated in salivary gland malignancies. Most recent studies though have clearly demonstrated that clinical stage, particularly size, is the most critical factor of outcome rather than the histologic grade with the exception of few tumors [96, 97]. The TNM staging of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for tumor size (T), nodal status (N), and metastasis (M) applies to malignant tumors of major salivary glands only. [The latest World Health Organization (WHO) TNM classification in 2017 appears in Table 37.4.] Some general behavioral differences between benign and malignant tumors are shown in Table 37.5 [97-103].

# 37.4.2 Benign Salivary Gland Tumors

Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most common benign tumor originating either from dual proliferation of cells with ductal or myoepithelial features or proliferation of a single cell with the potential to differentiate into either cell type. The myoepithelial features are responsible for determining the composition and appearance of these tumors. There is a slight male predilection and although PAs can occur in any age they are more common between the fourth and fifth decade of life. Eighty five percent occur in the parotid while  $50\%$  of the tumors found in the minor salivary glands are PAs, with the palate as the most common intraoral site followed by the upper lip and buccal mucosa. Classically, PAs are slow-growing, mobile (except for those found in the hard palate), painless masses that can reach gigantic sizes if left untreated (especially those involving the parotid) (Fig. 37.11).

Histologically, the tumors demonstrate pleomorphic patterns of various ratios of epithelial and mesenchymal elements and are enclosed in a connective tissue pseudocapsule. The lack of true capsule, the deficiencies of the pseudocapsule, and the tumor extensions through these defects are thought to contribute to recurrences. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for PAs. Parotidectomy (usually superficial) with facial nerve preservation, excision of the submandibular or sublingual glands, or resection to the next anatomic layer for minor glands is the treatment [104] of choice. Although,

![](images/e1300d009eaa14376076bf392dfa5e841713838014bd4d90c9d07e2e9a74cc98.jpg)  
Fig. 37.11 Pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland

currently, the utility of partial parotidectomy and extracapsular dissection is debated for excision of parotid PAs. Care to ensure adequate removal while the tumor and its pseudocapsule are not violated is important in preventing recurrences. When recurrences occur, they usually appear as multiple discrete tumor foci, involve areas of scars from previous surgery, and in the majority of cases maintain the original pathology. A rate of malignant transformation up to  $25\%$  (carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma) is reported in long-standing untreated tumors or with multiple recurrences, after inadequate excision or tumors treated with radiotherapy [45, 56, 102, 105-112].

The metastasizing PA (MPA) variant of this neoplasm has identical benign histologic feature with the primary tumor but is associated with a 5-year disease-specific survival rates around  $58\%$ . Hematogenous metastasis after surgical manipulation and incomplete removal of these tumors have been suggested to be the main etiology of their behavior. Common sites outside the head and neck are bones, lungs, and abdomen, while within the head and neck an equal distribution of extra-lymphatic and nodal involvement is noted. Surgery is the treatment of choice for these tumors that are considered low-grade malignancies with a lethal potential [113-117].

Unlike pleomorphic adenomas, monomorphic adenomas originate from an isomorphic epithelial cell population, and thus they lack the mesenchymal tumor elements. Among the most common are: the basal cell adenoma, the canalicular adenoma, the myoepithelioma, the oncocytic tumors, and the ductal papillomas.

The vast majority,  $70\%$  of the basal cell adenomas is found in the parotid and comprise  $1 - 2\%$  of all salivary tumors. In the minor salivary glands, the upper lip is the most common location, followed by the hard palate, the buccal mucosa, and the lower lip. There is distinct male predilection and a mean age of 60 years. The mass is usually painless, slow-growing, and rarely recurs if adequately excised. Histologic variants include the solid, trabecular, and tubular types, but except for the membranous variant, histologic subtype has no impact on prognosis. The latter histologic pattern is exclusively found in the parotid and due to the multifocal pattern has demonstrated a significant recurrence rate. Local excision, with inclusion of normal tissue in multifocal tumors, is the treatment of choice [45, 99, 101, 105, 118, 119].

In contrast to basal cell adenomas, canalicular adenomas occur almost exclusively in the minor salivary glands, and the most common site is the upper lip (81% of the tumors in one series). The tumor is found most commonly in female patients older than 50 years as a freely movable, painless mass. The lack of capsule and the fact that over 20% of these tumors are multifocal may account for reported recurrences. Wide local excision ensuring total removal with a cuff of normal tissue is adequate treatment [45, 99, 105, 120-122].

Most myopeitheliomas are found in the parotid as well-circumscribed painless masses, presenting equally often in both genders as early as the third decade of life. The tumor is rare and the diagnosis occasionally requires distinction from those PAs with numerous myoepithelial cells. Three histologic forms are recognized: the spindle cell  $(70\%)$ , which favors the parotid, the plasmacytoid  $(17\%)$  most commonly found in the palate, and a mixture of the two  $(13\%)$ . Other than the potential for a diagnostic challenge, these variances have no impact on the clinical course or choice of treatment, which remains surgical excision. The tumor has no recurrence potential. Rare cases of malignant transformation have been reported in the literature [45, 99, 105, 123-130].

Two neoplasms comprise the subcategory of oncocytic tumors: Warthin's tumor (or papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum) and oncocytoma, due to presence of oncocytic-appearing epithelial cells or proliferation of oncocytic cells. Warthin's tumor accounts for  $5 - 7\%$  of epithelial salivary gland neoplasms with the vast majority found in the parotid, with bilateral involvement in  $4 - 6\%$  of the cases. There is 3:1 male to female predilection ages between 30 and 70 years, and this tumor is associated with cigarette smoking. The clinical presentation is that of a doughy painless mass often found in the tail of the parotid (  $\bullet$  Fig. 37.12). The tumor is believed to originate from inclusion of salivary gland cells into developing lymph nodes that eventually become reactive

![](images/cfa1837ba101a6f0098cf7ed2786fd46a27009226a83fb7f0cd80df36a5357e9.jpg)  
Fig. 37.12 Warthin's tumor involving the tail of the left parotid gland (arrow)

and induce a proliferation of both tissues. The term papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum is descriptive of the histologic appearance of the tumor with papillary, finger-like, projections into multicystic spaces along with a lymphoid stroma. FNAB is adequate for diagnosis, to rule out pleomorphic adenoma or malignancy, and the presence of a capsule allows for removal with limited potential for recurrence [45, 56, 99, 105, 131, 132].

Similarly, oncocytomas are small tumors found in the parotid as firm, painless freely movable masses less than  $5\mathrm{cm}$  in size. Although well encapsulated, these neoplasms may be multinodular. Superficial parotidectomy or excision with margin of normal tissue is recommended for treatment of oncocytomas that have no recurrence potential. Caution is required in cases of oncocytosis that may occur with age and is a metaplasia of the ductal and acinar cells, seen in otherwise healthy glands and requires no treatment. A rare malignant variant of this entity is the malignant oncocytoma that demonstrates atypical nuclear features and invasive pattern and requires more aggressive resection [45, 56, 99, 105, 133-138].

The ductal papilloma group includes the sialadenoma papilliferum, inverted ductal papilloma, and intraductal papilloma, all rare tumors thought to arise within the interlobular and excretory portions of the duct. All three tumors are more common in middle-aged males and are usually found intraorally associated with minor salivary glands (Fig. 37.13). Conservative surgery is adequate treatment for these low-recurrence potential neoplasms [7, 29, 45, 98, 99, 101, 102, 105, 139-147].

# 37.4.3 Malignant Salivary Gland Tumors

The biologic behavior of malignant salivary gland neoplasms can be used to classify these tumors as low-, intermediate-, or high-grade malignancies (▶ Box 37.1).

![](images/3029b69eb2f932c49ac60508544fbb1921c7f16de7e70c5d9c8a5f65e7c81c2d.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 37.13 Inverted ductal papilloma of the minor salivary glands involving the lower lip

In general, the most commonly encountered tumor is the mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MECA) that accounts for up to  $30\%$  and  $35\%$  of the parotid and minor salivary glands malignancies (palate), respectively, and  $20\%$  of those involving the submandibular gland. MECA is the most common salivary gland malignancy in childhood, while it can present at any age, mean of 45 years, with equal gender involvement. An intraosseous variant is often encountered in the mandible at the angle and is thought to originate from embryonically entrapped salivary gland elements (Fig. 37.14). On the basis of histologic appearance and degree of differentiation, this tumor is classified as low grade (well differentiated), composed largely of mucous-secreting cells, often forming glandular spaces and high-grade (poorly differentiated), characterized by squamous cells with rare mucous-secreting cells. An intermediate grade is described as well, which behaves more like the low-grade type. The histologic findings used by pathologists to assign a grade for these tumors follow the grading criteria set by Auclair et al., Goode et al., Accetta et al., and Brandwein et al. [99, 148-151]. Studies have demonstrated that tumor grade of differentiation, pattern of invasion, clinical staging, patient's age and size are all significant prognostic factors [152, 153]. High-grade tumors are associated with lower 5, 10, and 15 year survival rates  $(0 - 22\%)$  compared to low-grade tumors  $(90 - 100\%)$  [148, 154-157]. Treatment for MECA varies from wide local excision for low-grade tumors to more radical resection accompanied by neck dissection and potentially radiotherapy for high-grade tumors, especially those with nodal involvement. Simple curettage of intrabony tumors increases dramatically the recurrence potential [45, 56, 97, 102, 103, 105].

In 1983, the polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) was reported under the terms lobular carci

![](images/ee36aa5ff8161f2a635f377a9c1ff21d35a30bbf3111a1a69364803c4e8ceeb1.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 37.14 Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the right retromolar fossa

noma and terminal duct carcinoma of the salivary glands. The specific histopathologic features, clinical presentation, and behavior-segregated PLGA form other tumors. In the latest WHO classification, the tumor is renamed to polymorphous adenocarcinoma (PAC), omitting the low-grade component as some exhibit regional and distant metastases. Overall, PAC is a rare malignancy usually with indolent course found almost exclusively in the minor glands, most often those in the palate. A  $1 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  nonulcerated, non-painful, firm, elevated, and slow-growing submucosal swelling is the common presentation. The tumor occurs in older male or female patients in their fifth to eighth decade of life. Cervical nodal involvement is reported in  $10\%$  of the patients at the time of initial presentation. Histologically, the tumors lack a capsule and demonstrate infiltration into surrounding tissues. Difficulties in differentiating PCA from adenoid cystic carcinoma may be encountered on routine hematoxylin and eosin stains, especially due to the presence of perineural invasion in both tumors. The perineural invasion in PCA is not clinically significant, and wide local excision is adequate treatment with no need for radiotherapy [45, 102, 105, 158-167].

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a high-grade malignancy representing  $25\%$  of all salivary carcinomas with  $70\%$  of the cases occurring in the minor glands, while the parotid is most common site among the major

glands. Classically, these tumors present with tenderness or pain and neurologic findings associated with the cranial nerve invaded by the tumor. Mucosal ulceration assists in differentiation of ACC from PA in the palate (Fig. 37.15). Bone invasion, presence of tumor cells well beyond the intraoral mass, facial nerve involvement in parotid tumors, perineural invasion with skip lesions, and distant hematogenous metastasis present at time of initial diagnosis are characteristics of ACC's behavior. Three histologic patterns can be identified; the cribriform ("Swiss cheese"), tubular, and solid and they may coexist in the same tumor. Unlike other high-grade malignancies, ACC has good 5 year overall survival (70–90%) that drops dramatically at 10 years (30–70%) and even more at 15 years (less than 50%). Radical surgery with removal of underlying bone, when the palate is involved followed by wide-field radiotherapy or superficial parotidectomy with wide-field radiotherapy is the recommended approach. Presence of metastasis (usually to the lungs and less commonly to the cervical lymph nodes) has less impact on survival than size of the tumor. Some poor prognostic factors for ACC are tumor size greater than 4 cm, positive resection margins and presence of 30% or more of the solid variant [45, 56, 102, 105, 168–178].

Acinic cell adenocarcinomas most commonly  $(>80\%)$  involve the parotid, accounting for  $18\%$  of malignant

![](images/1042fc4b072c0c58a9fbbed66a1ac1b831325c8a94e7e2456f3958700e1eb706.jpg)  
$\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 37.15 Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right hard palate

salivary tumors and  $6.5\%$  of all salivary neoplasms. In general, these are indolent neoplasms with low metastatic potential and recurrence rates, especially when they involve the minor glands. Wide local excision is usually adequate while radiation therapy is reserved for recurrences or when complete excision cannot be accomplished.

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) are some additional malignant salivary tumors that may be encountered. In general, the treatment of salivary gland malignancies remains primarily surgical, although for advanced stage disease, recurrences, or not completely excised tumors radiotherapy has proven to be beneficial. Fast neuron radiotherapy has been shown to improve outcome over conventional radiation for stage T3 and 4 tumors, involvement of resection margins, or cases of recurrence. At present, there is no role for chemotherapy for salivary gland malignancies [45, 56, 99, 101-103, 105, 178-181]. In salivary duct carcinoma, Her2 has been shown to hold promise as an adjuvant therapy.

# 37.5 Selective Complications of Salivary Gland Surgery

Outcome of salivary gland surgery appears to focus on neurologic injuries, while gustatory sweating (Frey's syndrome) is usually discussed in parotid surgery literature. Surgical complications from approaches to the parotid (and less often the submandibular) gland specifically include injury to the facial nerve, in addition to general considerations such as scar formation and cosmetic defects. Identification of the main trunk of the facial nerve conventionally starts at its exit, before it enters the gland or by identification of the buccal branch  $4\mathrm{cm}$  anterior to the tragus in retrograde approaches. No difference in complication rates was identified between the two approaches although the retrograde approach is considered more challenging and prolongs surgical time. Frey's syndrome, although commonly associated with parotidectomy, has been reported following removal of submandibular gland or in relationship with trauma (gunshot) to the face. Various techniques have been presented to avoid this complication and include thick flaps, use of interpositional grafts, and botulinum toxin for treatment. Injury to the lingual and hypoglossal nerves is usually due to poor surgical technique and should not be encountered if careful dissection and identification are followed [96, 182-186].

# Conclusions

In this chapter, we provided a comprehensive overview of the various salivary gland pathologic processes that can be encountered. It is essential that the practitioner has a good understanding of the gross anatomy of the major and minor salivary glands, as well as the most appropriate imaging modalities that will assist with data gathering when pathology is present. Since certain pathologic processes can be more often encountered in specific salivary glands and age groups, having a good understanding of this prevalence is essential with treatment planning.
