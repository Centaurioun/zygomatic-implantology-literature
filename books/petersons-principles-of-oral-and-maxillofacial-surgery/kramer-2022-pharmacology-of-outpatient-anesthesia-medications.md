Intravenous (IV) sedation has a long history of use in oral surgery practice. Oral surgeons have been the historical leaders in the development of office-based ambulatory anesthesia practice. The development of newer IV agents and techniques has led to the increased acceptance of these practices as being safe and cost-effective. Currently, the vast majority  $(>70\%)$  of surgical procedures are performed on an ambulatory basis, and up to  $25\%$  of surgical procedures are performed with office-based sedation or general anesthesia.

Although it is neither possible nor the intention of the authors to present a full review of sedative and general anesthetic medications in this chapter, we review the pharmacology of many common agents used in office-based oral surgery sedation and general anesthesia practice. Where applicable, the use of these agents in oral surgical practice is highlighted.

# 3.1 Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics

# 3.1.1 Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamics is the study of the pharmacologic actions and clinical effects of a drug in the body [1]. The clinical response of most anesthetic and sedative medications derives from their actions in the central nervous system (CNS).

At a cellular level, the most frequent mechanism by which drugs exert their pharmacologic effects is through interactions with specific protein receptors embedded in cell membranes, which then initiate a specific set of intracellular actions. These protein receptors can be characterized as ion channels or transmembrane receptors. Ion channels allow the passage of specific ions, such as chloride, potassium, sodium, and calcium, into or out of the cell. Alterations in the intracellular concen

tration of these ions initiate characteristic cellular effects such as depolarization of a cell membrane or movement of storage vesicles. Opening of ion channels may be triggered by either changes in membrane voltage or binding by a specific ligand. Voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close depending on cellular transmembrane voltage, whereas ligand-gated ion channels undergo conformational changes when a drug or natural ligand binds to it, altering ion channel opening and closing. The  $\gamma$ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor is an example of a ligand-gated chloride ion receptor.

Ligand-regulated transmembrane receptors commonly rely on second-messenger systems to carry out the pharmacodynamic effect. When a specific ligand binds to the extracellular portion of these transmembrane receptors, a conformational change in the domain of the receptor exposed toward the cytoplasm activates either a specific enzyme or a second-messenger system. Second-messenger systems, such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP), and inositol triphosphate  $(\mathrm{IP}_3)$ , initiate a complex cascade of signaling proteins that, once triggered, will produce the intended effect.

Another type of receptor, an enzyme-linked system, occurs when a ligand binds to its specific receptor, activating an intracellular enzyme, e.g., tyrosine kinase, resulting in a specific effect. An example is the insulin receptor which regulates intracellular glucose uptake. Some highly lipid-soluble drugs do not engage membrane receptors at all, but instead exert their pharmacodynamic effect intracellularly via receptors found in the cytoplasm. Hormones and steroid medications are examples of medications that may easily cross the phospholipid cell membrane and bind to cytoplasmic receptors, which then alter cellular functions such as gene transcription. A smaller number of medications may also alter enzyme activity outside of cells, such as anticholinesterase drugs that block the activity of acetylcholinesterase.

Drugs are commonly classified as either agonists or antagonists for a specific receptor. Agonist drugs function to exert the normal property associated with receptor activation. Opioid agonists, like morphine, bind at specialized sites on opioid receptors activating a G protein, which can subsequently block voltage-dependent calcium channels, thus decreasing intracellular calcium. This reduction in intracellular calcium blocks release of glutamate and substance P necessary for pain transmission. Antagonist drugs exert the opposite effect of the natural ligand or agonist drug activity. Competitive antagonists bind at the normal ligand-binding site but exert no pharmacologic effect. Instead, the antagonist "takes up space" at the binding site, thus blocking agonist drug activity. The higher the concentration of antagonist, the greater the blocking effect. Agonist

activity returns once the antagonist concentration decreases or when additional agonist is administered to overcome the antagonist concentration. Naloxone is an example of a competitive antagonist at the opioid receptor. The shorter duration of action of naloxone compared to agonist drugs, like morphine, means that re-narcotization may occur, especially after a small initial naloxone dose. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers are another example of competitive antagonists used in anesthesia, in this case, for the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor. Noncompetitive antagonists do not bind at the ligand site but instead attach to a different location on the receptor, altering the configuration of the binding site and preventing normal ligand binding. Administration of additional agonist does not affect noncompetitive antagonist activity, because they do not compete for the same binding site. Many pesticides are examples of noncompetitive antagonist agents.

# 3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics is the study of the factors that affect the plasma concentration of a drug in the body, encompassing the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination [1]. Commonly identified by the route of administration, such as per oral (PO), intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or inhalation, absorption describes the point of entry of the drug into the body. Orally administered agents undergo first-pass metabolism. In this process, oral medications are absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and carried via the portal circulation to the liver where they undergo partial metabolism before entrance into the central circulation. This process potentially reduces the plasma concentration of drug that reaches the effector site, such as the CNS. The percentage of drug released into the central circulation following first-pass metabolism is referred to as the drug's bioavailability. Because the degree of gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism is unpredictable, PO sedative drugs have less reliable clinical effects. Most anesthetic agents used in oral surgical practice are delivered intravenously, intramuscularly, or by inhalation. In contrast to orally administered agents, these routes of administration do not undergo first-pass metabolism. Both IV and inhalation administration provide direct entry into the central circulation, reaching peak plasma concentration very quickly after drug administration. Inhalation pharmacokinetics is unique and is discussed in "Inhalation Anesthetics," later in this chapter.

Distribution describes the movement of a drug between body compartments. The main factors influencing distribution include the allocation of blood flow to a specific body compartment, the concentration gradient

of the drug between compartments, the chemical structure of the drug, and plasma protein binding of the drug. After administration, the majority of the drug initially redistributes to the vessel-rich group of organs. This vessel-rich group includes the brain, heart, kidney, and liver, representing  $10\%$  of total body mass but receiving  $75\%$  of cardiac output. Because the major site of anesthetic agent activity is the brain, early distribution of most anesthetic agents into the CNS results in early anesthetic effects.

The transfer of the drug from the central circulation to the brain is largely determined by the concentration gradient between the two compartments, although specialized transporter proteins (e.g., ATP binding cassette transporter [ABC transporter]) also affect movement of drugs into and out of the CNS. A lower concentration in one compartment favors the transfer from a region of higher concentration. After initial IV administration, the initial drug concentration in the brain is low relative to the plasma concentration; thus, the drug will rapidly transfer into the brain based on this differential concentration gradient. As the plasma concentration falls by continued redistribution to other vessel-rich organs, and later to less vessel-rich organs such as skeletal muscle ( $\sim 20\%$  of cardiac output), anesthetic drug not bound to receptors in the brain will transfer back into the central circulation for further redistribution to other tissue sites. As the brain concentration of sedative agent falls, the clinical effects of sedation also decrease.

Characteristics of the drug itself affect its distribution throughout the body. Lipophilic drugs more readily cross the blood-brain barrier and cellular membranes and generally exert their effects rapidly. Likewise, lipophilic drugs can quickly exit the CNS, shortening the duration of their effects. Hydrophilic medications either cross very slowly or must be transported by specific mechanisms. The size or molecular weight of the drug molecules influences movement across capillary walls; smaller molecules will cross more readily. As mentioned, various transport systems have been identified that cause some variability in drug onset and offset however.

The degree to which a drug binds to plasma proteins, such as albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, will affect the amount of free drug available to cross into the brain. Most sedative agents are highly plasma protein-bound. For example, initial doses of midazolam are  $97\%$  bound to plasma protein and unavailable to cross into the CNS. As the free drug plasma concentration decreases through further redistribution, and later metabolism and elimination, plasma protein-bound drug is released back into the plasma as free drug and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In this way, a sedative drug bound to plasma protein may be thought of as a reservoir of drug that may contribute to prolonged sedative effects. Once a large number of plasma protein

binding sites have been filled, an additional consequence is that further administration of small quantities of drug can have profound effects because a larger proportion of the additionally administered agent will be free drug that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Careful titration of IV agents, especially after initial administration and partial filling of protein binding sites, is important to avoid oversedation due to this mechanism. Hypoproteinemia secondary to advanced age, malnutrition, or severe liver failure can also dramatically increase the concentration of free drug, and dose reduction may be required.

As redistribution continues, a fraction of drug in plasma is delivered to the liver, the primary organ of drug metabolism, undergoing transformation from a lipid-soluble entity to a water-soluble form. There are four main pathways of hepatic metabolism: oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and conjugation. Phase I reactions include the first three pathways, converting the drug into a water-soluble metabolite or intermediate form. Phase II reactions involve most forms of conjugation, in which an additional group is added onto the metabolite in order to increase its polarity. Subsequent elimination via the kidney, the main excretory organ, requires hydrophilicity to avoid reabsorption of the drug in the proximal convoluted tubule. Water-soluble drugs and metabolites are eliminated chiefly by the kidney, but also via the bile, lungs, skin, and other organs.

Phase I hepatic reactions include the cytochrome P-450 (CYP-450) group of enzymes which carry out the oxidation and reduction reactions, occurring in the hepatic smooth endoplasmic reticulum (hepatic microsomal enzymes). The CYP-450 group of enzymes have been characterized into several isoforms (e.g., CYP-3A4, CYP-2D6, CYP-2C19, etc.). The conjugation reaction of glucuronidation is also conducted by the hepatic microsomal enzymes. The hepatic microsomal enzymes are unique in that certain chemicals and drugs, including those used in anesthesia, can stimulate their activity. This is termed enzyme induction and generally requires chronic exposure of the drug to the enzyme system for at least a few days. An isolated exposure to anesthetic agents is unlikely to induce significant hepatic enzyme activation. However, if the patient's daily medications induce hepatic enzymes, then increased metabolism of newly administered medications is possible. Induction is isoform-specific—a coadministered drug will be affected by enzyme induction only if both drugs are metabolized by the same enzyme system. Hepatic microsomal enzymes can also be inhibited by certain drugs, thus reducing metabolism of drugs by a specific enzyme system. For example, patients taking fluoxetine for depression may experience more profound and longer sedation with orally administered midazolam since fluoxetine

inhibits CYP-3A4, the main enzyme that metabolizes midazolam. Various tables have been published that list drugs that are substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of the various cytochrome enzyme systems.

Nonhepatic forms of metabolism are important for certain anesthetic medications and are useful in patients with significant liver or kidney disease. Drugs susceptible to Hofmann elimination spontaneously degrade at body pH and temperature. Ester hydrolysis by nonspecific and specific (e.g., pseudocholinesterase) esterases is less dependent on renal and hepatic functions.

Redistribution, metabolism, and elimination reduce the plasma concentration of the administered drug, increasing the transfer of drug from tissue sites (e.g., brain) back into the central circulation for further redistribution, metabolism, and elimination. Different mathematical models involving these processes have been developed that describe the offset of activity of anesthetic agents. The fall of  $50\%$  of the plasma concentration of the drug secondary to redistribution is termed the alpha half-life. The removal of  $50\%$  of the drug from the body due to metabolism and/or elimination is termed the beta half-life, or elimination half-life. Offset of clinical effects and awakening from a bolus of an IV anesthetic agent is more dependent on redistribution of the drug away from the brain and is, therefore, better approximated by the alpha half-life than the beta half-life. In some cases, residual CNS effects can be predicted by a long elimination half-life. The beta half-life has more use for orally administered agents and best describes central compartment concentration in a one-compartment model.

The pharmacokinetics of a continuous infusion of IV anesthetic agents may be better described by the context-sensitive half-time. This value represents the time necessary for the plasma drug concentration to decrease by  $50\%$  after discontinuing a continuous infusion, depending on how long the anesthetic agent has been administered [2]. Figure 3.1 describes the context-sensitive half-time for a number of common anesthetic agents. Currently, computer-controlled pumps administer continuous infusions based on a specific amount of drug per unit time, but in countries other than the United States, infusion pumps can be programmed to calculate and provide target plasma concentrations of an agent to a specified anesthetic or analgesic level.

# 3.2 Benzodiazepines and Opioids

# 3.2.1 Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used sedative and anxiolytic medications in oral surgery practice. Their relatively high margin of safety, in addition to the availability of an effective reversal agent (flumazenil), makes their use attractive during operator-anesthetist procedures in an outpatient setting.

Benzodiazepines are composed of a benzene and diazepine ring fused together [3]. Agonist agents contain a phenyl ring on the  $5^{\prime}$  position of the diazepine ring that is not present on the antagonist reversal agent (Fig. 3.2). These drugs bind to specialized sites on the inhibitory GABA receptors found throughout the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex. Binding of the agonist agent to the benzodiazepine receptor site increases the frequency of pore opening by GABA in the chloride-gated channel, thus increasing inward chloride flow, hyperpolarizing cell membranes, and

reducing neuronal transmission. This type of drug is termed an allosteric modulator, as it indirectly affects the binding the natural ligand to the actual main receptor site, with benzodiazepines acting as positive allosteric modulators.

Characteristics shared by benzodiazepines include sedation, anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, muscle-relaxing properties, and anticonvulsant activity. Indeed, any IV benzodiazepine agonist may be used to suppress acute seizure activity. These drugs do not produce analgesia.

Benzodiazepines are commonly used for preoperative sedation, both immediately before the procedure and at times as a sleep adjunct the night before surgery. In clinical practice, they are also used for moderate sedation and at higher doses can produce deep sedation and even general anesthesia.

In a nervous patient, anxiolysis from benzodiazepines can produce a noticeable reduction in blood pressure and heart rate, but these medications have little direct effect on cardiovascular parameters.

Given alone in slowly titrated doses, benzodiazepines also have minimal effects on ventilation. Large-bolus doses will, however, induce unconsciousness and apnea. In addition, even small doses, when given in combination with an opioid, can synergistically enhance opioid-induced respiratory depression.

Benzodiazepines are metabolized by hepatic enzymes into hydrophilic forms. These metabolites, some of which may be clinically active, are then excreted by the kidney in urine.

Serious adverse effects of properly titrated benzodiazepines are few, but paradoxical excitement, in which patients may become overly disinhibited and disoriented, is a possible complication. Flumazenil is useful in the reversal of paradoxical excitement and benzodiazepine-related respiratory depression. Flumazenil may also be used when excessive sedation occurs due to benzodiazepine use.

# 3.2.1.1 Diazepam

Diazepam is lipid soluble and is carried in an organic solvent such as propylene glycol or a soybean oil emulsion. IV injection can be painful, although injecting into a larger vein or preadministration of lidocaine or an opioid can reduce discomfort. IM injection is painful and absorption can be unpredictable.

Diazepam is still used by some oral surgeons for IV moderate sedation, given in 2.5- to  $5\mathrm{-mg}$  increments every few minutes. Onset of sedation occurs in several minutes and recovery from clinical sedation by diazepam is similar to that of midazolam. However, the much longer elimination time of diazepam, and numerous active metabolites, may contribute to lingering sedative effects. Diazepam can also be given orally  $(5 - 10\mathrm{mg})$  for preoperative anxiolysis or minimal procedural sedation.

This highly lipid-soluble drug accumulates in fat tissues with slow reentry of very small quantities into the central circulation, leading to an elimination half-life of

24-96 h. Diazepam is metabolized into three pharmacologically active metabolites, temazepam, oxazepam, and desmethyldiazepam, the latter two having particularly long elimination half-lives as well. The active metabolites and parent drug are partially eliminated in bile which can result in reemergence of sedation several hours after completion of the procedure owing to enterohepatic metabolism. Upon ingestion of a fat-rich meal, bile is released into the gut, and active drug components in the bile are reabsorbed by the intestinal mucosa where they undergo first-pass metabolism. These still active drugs are then re-introduced into the central circulation and into the CNS, resulting in possible resedation.

# 3.2.1.2 Midazolam

Midazolam has an imidazole ring attached to its diazepine ring. The imidazole ring is open at  $\mathsf{pH}$  less than 4 rendering the compound water-soluble at this  $\mathsf{pH}$ , but the ring closes at physiologic  $\mathsf{pH}$  producing a lipid-soluble benzodiazepine. Midazolam can, therefore, be delivered in an aqueous acidic solution, rather than requiring a solvent such as propylene glycol, resulting in less pain on IV and IM injection [4]. It is two to three times as potent as diazepam, with a faster onset, much faster elimination, and shorter duration of lingering effects. Its active metabolite is not thought to produce significant sedative effects. Respiratory depression is more of a concern with midazolam than with diazepam after larger bolus IV administration.

Midazolam is currently more popular than diazepam for IV sedation for short oral surgical procedures. For moderate sedation,  $0.05 - 0.15\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously in divided doses is titrated to effect, typically given in 1- to  $2.5\mathrm{-mg}$  boluses every few minutes. Peak effect is seen in approximately  $5\mathrm{min}$ . Dosage should be adjusted downward when given concurrently with other medications, such as opioids or propofol. An IM injection of  $0.15-$ $0.2\mathrm{mg / kg}$  to a maximum of  $10 - 15\mathrm{mg}$  depending on

patient age is also possible. As an alternative, midazolam may be given orally at  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  (maximum  $15\mathrm{mg}$ ) for preoperative sedation, such as before mask induction or IV start, or up to  $1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  (maximum  $20\mathrm{mg}$ ) for pediatric procedural sedation, usually mixed into a flavored syrup or in a commercially available premixed product; this route may be better accepted by pediatric patients [5]. Clinical effect from PO administration will be seen after  $15 - 20\mathrm{min}$  in the pediatric patient, although peak effect may be delayed to  $45 - 60\mathrm{min}$ .

# 3.2.1.3 Lorazepam

Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a slow onset. Its use for IV sedation is, therefore, limited but is an option for oral preoperative anxiolysis, particularly the night before surgery or for longer surgical appointments. Lorazepam is metabolized via glucuronidation, produces no active metabolites, and is markedly less susceptible to drug-drug interactions as it does not utilize the CYP-450 metabolism pathways. It is, however, an excellent emergency anticonvulsant as it binds very tightly to the benzodiazepine receptor. Dosage for an adult is  $1 - 4\mathrm{mg}$ .

# 3.2.1.4 Triazolam

Triazolam is available only in pill form as 0.125-and  $0.25\mathrm{-mg}$  tablets. This sleep adjunct can be used off-label for anxiolysis and moderate sedation at a dose of 0.25-  $0.5\mathrm{mg}$  for an adult. It is a very short-acting benzodiazepine and its effects are observed in  $30 - 45\mathrm{min}$ , peaking at a little over an hour, with clinically effective sedation lasting from 60 to  $90\mathrm{min}$  or longer. This drug has recently been highly promoted by dentists using multiple repetitive oral dosing, though it must be stated that reliable titration using the oral route is impossible. Although benzodiazepines are inherently safe drugs, patient selection, timing of additional doses, as well as knowledge of medical compromise and drug interactions along with proficient airway management and rescue skills from deep sedation are essential for safe clinical practice with oral sedation techniques that utilize multiple dosing regimens.

# 3.2.1.5 Remimazolam

As an ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine, remimazolam utilizes a similar pharmacologic metabolism strategy as remifentanil (see below), undergoing hydrolysis via tissue esterases in place of hepatic metabolism [6]. In initial drug trials, remimazolam has been administered in incremental boluses. However, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile suggests it is a strong candidate for continuous infusion as well. Current Phase 3 trials have shown impressive results with potential for major impacts on ambulatory sedation in the future.

# 3.2.1.6 Flumazenil

Flumazenil is a highly specific competitive antagonist for the benzodiazepine receptor and is used as a reversal agent for benzodiazepine receptor agonists [7]. It will reverse benzodiazepine sedation, excessive disinhibition, and the additive ventilatory depression related to benzodiazepines when combined with opioids. Flumazenil is electively administered at  $0.2\mathrm{mg}$  intravenously initially, followed by  $0.1\mathrm{mg}$  at 1-min intervals as necessary, to a total of  $1\mathrm{mg}$ . In emergency situations,  $0.5 - 1\mathrm{mg}$  or more may be administered as a bolus dose. Reversal effects may take several minutes to manifest. The effect of flumazenil will last  $30 - 60\mathrm{min}$  and may require redosing because agonist drug activity may outlast the reversal effects. Flumazenil should not be administered to epileptic patients using benzodiazepines chronically for seizure control and should be used cautiously with other epileptic patients.

# Key Points

Benzodiazepines potentiate the activity of GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter.  
Primary benzodiazepine effects include sedation, anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, mild muscle relaxation, and anticonvulsant activity.  
Flumazenil acts to competitively reverse the actions of benzodiazepines.

# 3.2.2 Opioids

Opioid medications are used in oral surgery practice primarily for analgesia and to augment sedation or euphoria. It is important to note that opioid medications do not produce amnesia or classical sedation, nor do they induce loss of consciousness or sensation of touch at clinically relevant doses. Patients given opioid medications alone will retain awareness and memory. Instead, opioids are often used in combination with sedative-hypnotic medications such as benzodiazepines or propofol to provide analgesia and augment the desired level of sedation/general anesthesia.

Whereas the term opiate refers to any drug derived from opium, opioid medications include all substances, natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors [8]. Common opioid medications are shown in  $\square$  Fig. 3.3. Endogenous opioids such as endorphins and enkephalins, and administered opioid medications like morphine, bind to opioid receptors located in presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons throughout the CNS as well as in peripheral afferent nerves. Agonist activity at these

![](images/434b63605b0e3eb7d130862b73c1ffe6fc23dd06f0ec3c13746a011077506818.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 3.3 Chemical structure of synthetic opioid agonists

receptors either modifies or decreases neuronal transmission of pain signals. Several subtypes of opioid receptors (e.g.,  $\mu, \kappa, \delta$ ) with differential effects have been identified. The  $\mu$  and  $\kappa$  receptors are predominantly responsible for analgesia, and most clinically used opioids are agonists for the  $\mu$  receptor. A subset of opioids, termed agonist-antagonist opioids, exhibit more  $\kappa$  receptor activity and can be antagonists or partial agonists at  $\mu$  receptors. Thus, agonist-antagonist opioids are contraindicated for patients on long-term opioids, such as those using these agents for chronic pain or those on methadone maintenance for treatment of opioid use disorder.

Respiratory depression is the most common and significant adverse effect of opioid agonists as used in anesthetic practice. This effect can be significantly exacerbated with concurrent administration of other medications such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol, and other opioids. Respiratory depression is dose dependent, resulting from a decrease in the respiratory response to arterial carbon dioxide  $\mathrm{(CO_2)}$  levels in the brainstem respiratory centers. Decreased respiratory rate and arterial hypoxemia may result without supplemental oxygen  $\mathrm{O}_2$  and appropriate monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry). Opioids are often titrated incrementally to balance their analgesic effect against respiratory depression.

Bradycardia due to a centrally mediated vagal response can be a direct effect and most apparent with higher opioid doses. This effect is common with drugs such as morphine, fentanyl, and its synthetic derivatives, but less common with meperidine. A mild decrease or stabilization of the heart rate may be desirable in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Most opioids are metabolized by hepatic enzymes and excreted into the urine and bile. The exception is remifentanil, which is metabolized by plasma esterases.

Opioids suppress the cough reflex and are a common ingredient in cough medicines. These antitussive effects can be beneficial during sedation, especially when used in patients with hyperreactive airways (e.g., smokers). However, several opioids can cause the release of histamine (e.g., meperidine and less so, morphine) and caution is advised when these histamine-releasing opioids are administered to an asthmatic patient. Other manifestations of histamine release include a decrease in blood pressure secondary to vasodilation, as well as pruritus and erythema, especially at the site of injection.

Other adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, and biliary tract spasm may increase patient discomfort postoperatively, particularly with repeated oral or neuraxial administration. These reactions are frequently misinterpreted by the patient and other healthcare providers as an "allergic" reaction.

# 3.2.2.1 Morphine

Morphine is the standard agent by which other opioids are compared. It has poor lipid solubility and, therefore, a slow onset. A majority of its effect after IV administration occurs in  $15 - 20\mathrm{min}$  and the analgesic effect lasts approximately  $3 - 4\mathrm{h}$ . Because of its slow onset and longer duration of activity, it is commonly used in anesthesia practice for postoperative pain management rather than IV procedural sedation. Morphine is normally given in 2- to  $4\mathrm{-mg}$  IV increments for postoperative analgesia.

Morphine has several notable characteristics. Histamine release from morphine can result in skin flushing and a decrease in blood pressure and occasionally is of concern in an asthmatic patient. Morphine is metabolized by hepatic enzymes into two metabolites that are subsequently eliminated by the kidney. One of these metabolites, morphine-6-glucuronide, is more potent than morphine itself, and opioid effects in patients with compromised renal function can be significant.

# 3.2.2.2 Hydromorphone

Hydromorphone, a ketone derivative of morphine, has a more rapid onset than morphine,  $2 - 5\mathrm{min}$ , allowing for more rapid titration, with a duration of action similar to that of morphine. It is approximately eight times more potent than morphine, so  $1.2\mathrm{mg}$  equals approximately  $10\mathrm{mg}$  of morphine. It produces no histamine release and has no active metabolites. For these reasons, it is preferred by some anesthesiologists for postoperative pain control and for titration during emergence from general anesthesia.

# 3.2.2.3 Meperidine

Meperidine is a synthetic opioid with a relatively rapid onset time and duration of action between 2 and  $3\mathrm{h}$ . It has been used for both IV procedural sedation and postoperative pain control. Meperidine is usually given in 12.5- to  $25\mathrm{-mg}$  IV increments titrated to effect.

The drug has several identifying characteristics. Like morphine, it also has an active metabolite, normeperidine, but it has half the potency of meperidine although with significant CNS toxicity. Postsedation delirium may occur, especially in the elderly. With repeated dosing, particularly in renally compromised patients, accumulation of normeperidine may lead to seizures. When mixed with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, meperidine may produce serotonin syndrome, a dangerous excitatory hyperthermic reaction. Meperidine is also associated with significant release of histamine; thus, appropriate precautions should be taken. Unlike the other opioids, it is not associated with bradycardia and may cause a mild increase in heart rate. Its structure

resembles atropine and it possesses mild anticholinergic effects such that a mild increase in heart rate is generally offset by direct opioid vagal stimulation and xerostomia can occur. Hospital use of meperidine is now rare in the United States with the drug most commonly used to reduce shivering post-general anesthesia, an action possibly associated with partial agonist activity at the  $\kappa$  receptor.

# 3.2.2.4 Fentanyl

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, and its high lipid solubility leads to its high potency, rapid onset (1 min), and shorter duration of action (10-20 min). With such characteristics, fentanyl is a frequent choice for IV moderate sedation for short office-based procedures. It is typically given in 25- to  $50 - \mu \mathrm{g}$  increments toward a total dose of approximately  $1 - 2\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg}$ . It is also given during induction of general anesthesia for attenuation of airway reflexes during intubation as well as for intraoperative analgesia.

Fentanyl does not induce histamine release and is, therefore, not associated with vasodilatory or bronchospastic effects. However, it can cause more pronounced bradycardia than morphine. Fentanyl is a potent respiratory depressant. At high doses and with rapid bolus administration, fentanyl and its other synthetic derivatives have been associated with chest wall and glottic rigidity, making ventilation impossible; there are reports that even lower doses (e.g., a bolus dose of  $100\mu \mathrm{g}$ ) can trigger this centrally mediated effect. Fentanyl-associated chest wall rigidity is treated with either naloxone or paralysis (succinylcholine or rocuronium), and positive-pressure ventilation devices and other resuscitation equipment must be immediately available. The incidence of fentanyl rigidity may be reduced by a preceding dose of a benzodiazepine or other hypnotic drug.

# 3.2.2.5 Remifentanil, Sufentanil, and Alfentanil

Remifentanil, sufentanil, and alfentanil are synthetic fentanyl derivatives used primarily for analgesia during general anesthesia. Remifentanil, in particular, is associated with a rapid onset and extremely short duration of action, resulting in a significantly shorter recovery time. Metabolized by nonspecific plasma esterases, its clearance is very rapid and independent of both hepatic and renal functions. It has a very short context-sensitive half-time of 4 min with virtually no cumulative effect, even after hours of continuous infusion at high doses. These features make remifentanil ideal for use in a titratable continuous infusion. Of note is the fact that because the actions of this medication are so short-lived, postoperative pain will not be addressed by intraoperative remifentanil, and alternative pain control with another

opioid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or local anesthesia, should be instituted toward the end of the procedure. The rapid removal of the drug from opioid receptors has also been associated with a phenomenon known as remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, which can be thought of as an acute withdrawal effect necessitating increased dose requirements for postoperative opioids.

Remifentanil can be used in a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) technique to maintain sedation/general anesthesia during oral surgery, most often in combination with propofol. For analgesia during general anesthesia, it is commonly used at doses of  $0.1 - 0.5\mu \mathrm{g / kg}/$  min. During sedation, the dose ranges from 0.025 to  $0.10~\mu \mathrm{g / kg / min}$  to allow for adequate spontaneous ventilation. Bolus doses can be used to facilitate intubation without the need for neuromuscular blockers or for management of light anesthesia or painful surgical stimulus. Remifentanil, like fentanyl, can cause chest wall rigidity and caution should be used during bolus administration. It is also a highly potent respiratory depressant; even at lower doses, apnea may be pronounced. None of these synthetic derivatives causes the release of histamine.

Sufentanil and alfentanil are shorter-acting agents than fentanyl but not as rapid in offset as remifentanil. These agents are commonly used as an adjunct continuous infusion for intubated general anesthesia during prolonged surgery, particularly when residual opioid effects are desirable postoperatively. Alfentanil, however, can be used similarly to remifentanil for office-based oral surgical sedation, although offset of action is not as complete as remifentanil.

# 3.2.2.6 Nalbuphine

Nalbuphine is the most frequently used IV agonist-antagonist opioid. It has a relatively short onset with duration of action of  $2 - 4\mathrm{h}$  at sedation doses of  $5 - 10\mathrm{mg}$  for the adult patient. Although nalbuphine and other agonist-antagonist opioids do possess a ceiling effect for respiratory depression at higher doses, at equianalgesic and clinically relevant sedation doses, the respiratory depressant effects are similar to  $\mu$  agonist opioids. Nalbuphine does not release histamine. As mentioned above, the agonist-antagonist opioids are contraindicated in patients taking opioids for chronic pain or for opioid use disorder.

Unlike all the other agents noted above, which are US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) schedule II-controlled substances, nalbuphine is not currently a scheduled-controlled substance and does not require state and federal documentation of its use.

# 3.2.2.7 Naloxone

Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that is active at all opioid receptor subtypes. It will reverse both the ventilatory depressive and the analgesic effects of opioids. It can also be used to reverse chest wall or glottic rigidity from fentanyl and its derivatives. In patients taking opioids chronically (e.g., chronic pain management, illicit opioid users, methadone therapy for opioid abuse), naloxone in sedative or general anesthesia practice must be used with caution, if at all, because the antagonist effect may precipitate acute opioid withdrawal and acute congestive heart failure may result.

The initial dose is  $0.4 - 2\mathrm{mg}$  intravenously for acute reversal. Naloxone can also be titrated in  $0.04\mathrm{-mg}$  increments when gradual adjustment of respiratory depression is required. Because the duration of naloxone activity is  $30 - 45\mathrm{min}$ , reemergence of respiratory depression may occur and additional dosing may be needed.

# Key Points

- Opioids produce analgesia primarily by activating pain modulation pathways, thus decreasing afferent nociceptor transmission to higher brain centers consequently modifying pain perception.  
- Opioids do not cause amnesia or loss of awareness.  
Common adverse opioid effects include respiratory depression or arrest, nausea and/or vomiting, and postoperatively, constipation.  
Naloxone, a full competitive antagonist, reverses the actions of opioids.

# 3.3 Sedative Medications Intended for General Anesthesia

A number of drugs intended to produce general anesthesia, commonly referred to as "induction agents," are a category of drugs used to induce general anesthesia, but they are also used for various sedative techniques in oral surgery practice. In the past, barbiturates, such as methohexital, were commonly used by oral surgeons. Legal and regulatory issues, as well as better pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, have led to propofol becoming the major induction agent in anesthetic practice, particularly in the United States. This category of drugs also includes other medications used for sedation, dissociative anesthesia, and induction of general anesthesia, including etomidate and ketamine.

# 3.3.1 Propofol

Propofol has become the most popular sedative-hypnotic drug used for ambulatory surgery. Propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol (Fig. 3.4), is highly lipid soluble and available as a milky white  $1\%$  suspension in soybean oil, glycerol, and egg phosphatide. Like benzodiazepines and barbiturates, propofol is thought to interact with the GABA receptor, causing increased chloride conductance and hyperpolarization of neurons. At higher doses, propofol can produce amnesia and loss of consciousness. It is also an anticonvulsant, although spontaneous excitatory movements may be noted after administration [9].

Depending on the dose and technique, propofol is used for all levels of sedation and general anesthesia. For induction of general anesthesia, a bolus of  $1.5 - 2.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously produces unconsciousness within  $30~s$  . In the intermittent bolus technique frequently used for deep sedation in oral surgery, small increments of propofol  $(10 - 30\mathrm{mg})$  are periodically administered after a baseline moderate sedation with a benzodiazepine and opioid is obtained, in order to produce a state of deep sedation for local anesthetic administration and other stimulating portions of dentoalveolar surgery. Propofol can also be used as a continuous IV infusion [10]. The dosages for moderate sedation range from  $25 - 100~\mu \mathrm{g / kg / min}$  , deep sedation from  $75 - 150~\mu \mathrm{g}/$ $\mathrm{kg / min}$  , and general anesthesia from  $100 - 300~\mu \mathrm{g / kg / min}$  depending on the use of intubation and other concomitantly administered drugs. The overlap of dose ranges, from moderate sedation to general anesthesia, highlights the low margin of safety of this drug in maintaining consciousness, especially if the intended level of sedation is moderate sedation. Use of additional benzodiazepines and opioids further blurs the dosing guidelines for various forms of sedation. FDA labeling prohibits use of propofol by those involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure.

Propofol is extensively metabolized by hepatic enzymes. In addition, extensive redistribution and other mechanisms of metabolism and elimination most likely occur, because the rate of propofol clearance from the plasma exceeds hepatic blood flow. This rapid plasma

![](images/46aa920bcee062a5db14a19c3954d5a1de2a74c1bad3609082740fc6cb70425e.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 3.4 Chemical structure of propofol

clearance may account for the decreased cumulative effect of this drug in the body, contributing to rapid awakening. The context-sensitive half-time for this drug is short, reaching a maximum of  $40\mathrm{min}$  even after  $2 - 6\mathrm{h}$  of continuous infusion. Context-sensitive half-times are even shorter with brief infusions.

Propofol decreases systemic blood pressure by as much as  $20 - 40\%$  from baseline through both central and peripheral mechanisms. Propofol also blocks sympathetic tone and allows parasympathetic vagal responses to predominate, thereby blunting the reflex tachycardia that would normally be associated with such a drop in blood pressure. Hypotension may, therefore, be significant after bolus administration or continuous infusion of propofol, particularly in elderly, medically compromised, and hypovolemic patients.

Propofol also leads to dose-dependent respiratory depression and can produce apnea at higher doses. It is not associated with histamine release and has bronchodilatory properties.

Recovery from anesthesia with propofol has several unique characteristics. Compared with other induction agents, propofol is associated with a more rapid awakening and recovery, with less residual CNS effects. Many patients also experience mild euphoria on awakening, which enhances reported satisfaction with the anesthesia postoperatively. Even at subhypnotic doses, propofol is associated with decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) [10]. All these features make propofol an attractive choice for outpatient procedures in which decreased time to discharge is desirable.

Several considerations should be taken when using propofol. The solution can cause significant pain on injection, especially through smaller vessels. This may be attenuated with preadministration of opioids or  $1\%$  plain lidocaine. Unlike barbiturates, however, it does not cause vasospasm when inadvertently injected into an artery.

Anaphylaxis is rare but has been reported in patients with a history of allergic reactions to other medications, especially neuromuscular blocking drugs. A history of egg allergy does not necessarily preclude the use of propofol, because the egg protein contained in the suspension is lecithin, whereas most egg allergies consist of a reaction to egg albumin. True soy allergy, as opposed to gastrointestinal intolerance, is likely not an absolute contraindication but caution is warranted when used in this rare patient population. All propofol formulations are pH neutral and can support bacterial growth; therefore, the observation of sterile technique and ideally withdrawing the medication to a syringe as close to time of use is recommended. A filled syringe should be dis

carded after  $12\mathrm{h}$ . Cracked glass containers or discolored contents should be discarded, because sepsis is a possibility. The original proprietary agent, Diprivan, uses EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as an antibacterial agent, whereas one generic version contains metabisulfite. This generic agent has been used in patients with known sulfite sensitivity and it appears that allergic reactions and bronchospasm are highly unlikely, although case reports have been documented. Another generic version uses benzyl alcohol to retard bacteria growth.

# 3.3.2 Etomidate

Like midazolam, etomidate contains an imidazole structure (Fig. 3.5). It is water soluble but available in a  $0.2\%$  solution in propylene glycol. In the same way as other common sedative-hypnotic drugs, etomidate interacts at the GABA receptor.

Etomidate is used primarily as an induction agent for general anesthesia at  $0.2 - 0.4\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously. Its main advantage over barbiturates and propofol is cardiovascular stability. Although systemic blood pressure can decrease by up to  $15\%$  with etomidate, changes in heart rate are minimal. It also does not depress myocardial contractility. Etomidate is usually reserved for patients with unstable cardiovascular disease.

Spontaneous respiration may be maintained. Respiratory depression is less pronounced with etomidate than with propofol, although apnea is still possible with higher doses.

Etomidate is metabolized by both hepatic enzymes and plasma esterases. This rapid clearance leads to awakening and recovery that is faster than with thiopental but slower than with methohexital or propofol.

Myoclonus is common in over  $50\%$  of patients and may be partially prevented with preadministration of a benzodiazepine or opioid. Many patients experience pain on injection. Eotomidate is associated with adrenocortical suppression, even when only a single induction dose is administered.

# 3.3.3 Ketamine

Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative (Fig. 3.6) that induces a state of "dissociative anesthesia." This is characterized as a "dissociation" between the thalamocortical and the limbic systems, producing a cataleptic state during which the patient may appear awake but does not respond to commands [11]. The eyes may be open and nystagmic. Ketamine does produce anterograde amnesia with sufficient dose, and unlike other induction agents, it can produce intense analgesia.

Unlike other hypnotic agents, ketamine does not interact with GABA receptors. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, but ketamine is a nonselective antagonist of supraspinal  $N$ -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a subset of excitatory glutamate receptors. Inhibition of these receptors decreases neuronal signaling and is likely responsible for the significant analgesic effects. Ketamine may also interact with pain receptors in the spinal cord as well as opioid receptors, which may also account for analgesia [12].

Ketamine is highly lipid soluble and redistributes quickly, which accounts for its rapid onset of action and relatively short duration of activity. It is metabolized by hepatic enzymes and has an active metabolite, norketamine. Ketamine does have a significant abuse potential, and its chronic use can lead to enzyme induction.

Fig. 3.6 Chemical structure of ketamine

The cardiovascular effects of ketamine reflect its indirect activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Ketamine causes an increase in synaptic norepinephrine by inhibiting reuptake at postganglionic sympathetic neurons. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and systemic blood pressure. Ketamine should, therefore, be used with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or in whom tachycardia should be avoided. However, ketamine may be chosen for induction of general anesthesia at  $1 - 2\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously when cardiovascular stimulatory effects are desired, as in emergent trauma surgery. Practitioners should note that ketamine is actually a direct myocardial depressant, an effect normally masked by the indirect sympathetic stimulation. In severely compromised patients, however, catecholamine stores may be exhausted and hypotension secondary to myocardial depression can become evident.

Respiratory depression is not significant with ketamine, although apnea may still occur with rapid bolus administration. Upper airway reflexes remain largely, but not reliably intact; aspiration is still possible, especially as ketamine increases salivary secretions, and can be emetogenic. Ketamine does not cause histamine release and is a potent bronchodilator secondary to sympathetic activation as well as direct bronchial smooth muscle relaxation.

In oral surgical practice, one primary indication for ketamine is IM injection for uncooperative adult patients, such as patients with intellectual disability or for children who will not tolerate IV placement. The IM dose for induction of general anesthesia is  $3 - 7\mathrm{mg}/$  kg, whereas  $2 - 3\mathrm{mg / kg}$  is usually sufficient to obtain adequate control for IV placement. A water-soluble benzodiazepine, like midazolam, is sometimes added to reduce the possibility of uncomfortable dreaming/hallucination associated with ketamine. An anticholinergic medication like glycopyrrolate can also be given to reduce the production of salivary secretions secondary to ketamine. Glycopyrrolate may be preferred over atropine or scopolamine for its superior antisialagogue effects, less pronounced cardiac effects, and poor CNS penetration.

The other main use in oral surgical practice is in a planned IV deep sedation technique. Moderate sedation is first achieved with a benzodiazepine with or without an opioid, followed by subanesthetic doses of  $10 - 30\mathrm{mg}$  of ketamine until a state similar to deep sedation is achieved. Because ketamine is quite analgesic, some surgeons omit opioid administration. Alternatively, if a standard deep sedation technique with baseline moderate sedation and small doses of propofol does not provide adequate operating conditions without high enough doses of propofol to induce hypoventilation/ apnea/airway obstruction, and intubated or laryngeal

mask general anesthesia is not an option as is common in oral surgery practice, "rescue" with ketamine is oftentimes effective to continue a non-intubated-style deep sedation/general-dissociative anesthetic.

"Emergence delirium" can occur during awakening. The patient may experience visual and auditory hallucinations that can be perceived as either pleasant (euphoria) or unpleasant (dysphoria), lasting for up to several hours. Delirium occurrence is less common in children and with IV doses less than  $2\mathrm{mg / kg}$ . It may be attenuated with prior or concurrent administration of benzodiazepines, which should be routine when IV sedation techniques with ketamine are used.

# 3.3.4 Barbiturates

Barbiturates are sedative-hypnotic medications that have long been employed as induction agents of general anesthesia. Recently, with the introduction of propofol, the use of IV ultrashort-acting barbiturates has decreased significantly in both oral surgery and hospital anesthesia practice. Barbiturates produce sedation, loss of consciousness, and amnesia. These drugs do not provide analgesia and may reduce pain threshold at lower doses. Some barbiturates, such as IV pentobarbital and oral phenobarbital, are still used as anticonvulsants for both prevention and treatment of seizures. High doses of any IV barbiturate can also suppress acute seizure activity.

Barbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid (Fig. 3.7). The characteristics of the individual barbiturate are determined by the side chains/molecules attached to the barbiturate ring (Fig. 3.8). For example, substituting sulfur for oxygen on the no. 2 carbon in

![](images/75f91d3f57b56386dcb652d9f8be6454bd641c3bbe265b31c580d7b79d0b3b24.jpg)

Thiamyal

thiobarbiturates increases the lipid solubility of these drugs and, hence, decreases onset of action and duration of activity. The methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the ring in methohexital results in a more rapid onset for this oxybarbiturate and increased susceptibility to cleavage, producing a shorter duration of action than other oxybarbiturates.

Barbiturates act as positive allosteric modulators and as a direct agonist (in high doses) of GABA receptors at a specific binding site (different from benzodiazepines), causing the chloride channel to remain open for a longer duration. The increased negative inward flow hyperpolarizes the membrane, decreasing neuronal transmission.

Awakening from bolus doses of IV barbiturates is dependent on redistribution from the brain. These medications are metabolized by hepatic enzymes without the formation of active metabolites and are then cleared renally. Because these drugs are highly protein-bound, hypoproteinemia secondary to liver failure or malnutrition increases the plasma concentration of free drug. Chronic use of barbiturates can cause induction of liver enzymes. Barbiturates are also contraindicated in

patients with acute intermittent porphyria because they may precipitate an attack.

Barbiturates are associated with a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and tidal volume with apnea observed at higher doses. Centrally mediated peripheral vasodilation leads to a transient drop of  $10 - 30\%$  in systemic blood pressure, particularly when a full induction dose is administered. This is partially attenuated by a compensatory increase in heart rate as baroreceptor reflexes remain intact. Hypotension is more evident in the elderly or medically compromised, hypovolemic patients. Thiopental can cause histamine release, which is clinically insignificant with methohexital.

Intra-arterial injection of barbiturates causes painful spasm of the vessel from precipitation of barbiturate crystals, which damage the endothelium and may result in occlusion of the artery. At worst, decreased distal perfusion may result in tissue necrosis of a limb or nerve damage and must be addressed immediately. The IV catheter should be left in place, IV cardiac lidocaine or procaine (without epinephrine) administered, and the patient should be transported to an emergency department where medications or stellate ganglion blockade

may be given to relieve the spasm and reduce the occlusion. Although uncommon, venous irritation and thrombosis secondary to crystal formation is also possible with concentrations of barbiturates above  $1\%$  methohexital and  $2.5\%$  thiopental.

These medications are stored in powder form and reconstituted in saline before use as sodium salts. The alkalinity of the solutions prevents bacterial growth and ensures a longer refrigerated shelf life of up to 2 weeks for thiopental and 6 weeks for methohexital.

# 3.3.4.1 Thiopental

Thiopental is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate that is commonly used at  $3 - 5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously in a  $2.5\%$  solution to induce loss of consciousness for general anesthesia before endotracheal intubation. It is associated with a longer recovery than methohexital owing to its decreased plasma clearance and is generally not used as a continuous infusion to maintain anesthesia owing to significant storage in multiple drug compartments. Thiopental can release histamine, which can be a concern in asthmatic patients. This drug is no longer available in the United States.

# 3.3.4.2 Methohexital

Methohexital is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate that was commonly employed for outpatient oral surgical procedures before the introduction of propofol, primarily for its more rapid recovery compared with thiopental. Methohexital is now used by a substantial minority of oral surgeons. As an oxybarbiturate, methohexital is less lipid soluble than thiopental but is associated with a more rapid awakening because of its increased hepatic clearance [13]. Psychomotor function returns more quickly with methohexital than thiopental, but recovery is significantly more delayed compared with propofol.

Methohexital is reconstituted into a  $1\%$  solution and given at  $1.5 - 2\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously for induction of general anesthesia. With these doses, blood pressure may drop by up to  $35\%$  and heart rate increases up to  $40\%$  of baseline. In the common deep sedation technique used in oral surgical practice, 10- to  $30\mathrm{-mg}$  increments of methohexital are periodically administered after obtaining baseline moderate sedation with a benzodiazepine and opioid to produce a state of deep sedation for local anesthetic administration and other stimulating portions of dentoalveolar surgery.

Methohexital is associated with involuntary movements such as myoclonus and hiccuing. These excitatory phenomena are dose dependent. Low doses of methohexital can activate seizure foci and should be used cautiously, if at all, for epileptic patients. Shivering upon awakening is also common after methohexital anesthesia. Methohexital exhibits clinically insignificant histamine release.

# 3.3.4.3 Pentobarbital

Pentobarbital is an IV short-acting barbiturate with a duration of action of  $2 - 4\mathrm{h}$ . In the past, it was commonly used for moderate sedation in doses of  $50 - 300\mathrm{mg}$ , combined with opioids and benzodiazepines, for longer operative procedures. Legal and cost considerations have limited its recent use. Cardiovascular effects are more modest than with the ultrashort-acting agents.

# Key Points

Intravenous sedative/hypnotic agents intended for general anesthesia (e.g., propofol) all produce dose-dependent depression of the central nervous system.  
No reversal agents are available for propofol, etomidate, ketamine, or barbiturates.

# 3.4 Inhalation Anesthetics

Inhalation anesthetics include nitrous oxide  $(\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O})$  as well as the potent volatile halogenated agents: isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Nitrous oxide alone is frequently used in dental offices for anxiolysis and minimal sedation, but it is also used in combination with other medications to induce and maintain both sedation and general anesthesia. The halogenated agents are extremely potent and are used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. They are complete anesthetics providing hypnosis, amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation.

The pharmacokinetics of these anesthetic agents differ from those of IV medications. These drugs are inhaled and cross from the alveoli into the pulmonary vasculature, entering the central circulation. They are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert anesthetic effects within the brain. These agents are minimally metabolized and are subsequently eliminated unchanged back into the alveoli. Once exhaled, these gases are deposited into the anesthesia circuit and eventually scavenged for discharge into the atmosphere.

Plasma concentrations of the inhaled anesthetics are dependent on the concentration of the gas within the alveoli, solubility characteristics of the individual gases, and cardiac output [14, 15]. Cardiac output influences the rate of uptake from the alveoli such that low cardiac output increases pulmonary venous uptake by increasing the amount of time any given volume of blood is in contact with the alveolar membrane. Main factors affecting alveolar gas concentration include the inspired concentration of gas, alveolar ventilation, and the total gas flow rate. Administering a higher concentration of gas will increase intra-alveolar concentra

tion, whereas altering the total gas inflow or alveolar ventilation (respiratory rate, tidal volume) will affect how quickly the concentration of gas within the alveoli changes.

Each agent varies in its solubility in blood and other tissues such as the brain, muscle, and fat, and these characteristics determine the ease with which the gas crosses into these different tissues. Of these, the blood-gas solubility coefficient (Table 3.1) is the most useful for describing the onset and offset of action of an anesthetic gas. It expresses the extent to which the anesthetic gas molecules from the alveolar spaces will dissolve into plasma before the plasma becomes saturated. Conceptually, a lower coefficient means that the gas is less soluble in blood and will saturate the plasma compartment quickly. Additional "overflow" molecules will then be free to move into other highly vascular tissues such as the brain, where the CNS anesthetic effect takes place. A lower blood-gas solubility coefficient therefore translates into faster onset of action in the brain. Once the gas is discontinued and the alveolar concentration decreases, the gas molecules move down their concentration gradient from the tissues back into the bloodstream and then into the alveoli. Gases with lower blood-gas coefficients will likewise "offload" from the bloodstream into alveoli more quickly and can translate into a faster offset of action.

Unlike IV medications, these inhaled drugs are not administered in doses of milligrams per kilogram. The rough equivalent of the effective dose  $50\%$ $(\mathrm{ED}_{50})$  of an inhaled anesthetic agent is the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The MAC value of any given agent is the inhaled concentration (volume %) of that agent

required to prevent movement in  $50\%$  of patients to a surgical incision. MAC values for different agents are given in Table 3.1. MAC values provide a useful dosage guide for anesthetic gases. In adults, a level of 1.3 MAC will prevent movement in  $95\%$  of patients, whereas 1.5 MAC  $(\mathrm{MAC}_{\mathrm{BAR}})$  will block an adrenergic response in  $50\%$  of patients. Below 0.3 MAC  $(\mathrm{MAC}_{\mathrm{AWAKE}})$ , patient awareness is more likely. MAC values are additive; for example, if 0.5 MAC of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  and 1.0 MAC of isoflurane are given simultaneously, the total MAC of anesthetic agent administered to the patient is 1.5 MAC. It should be noted that MAC values are general guidelines and individual anesthetic requirements can be influenced by a variety of factors such as age or medical status. Neonates have the lowest MAC requirement, whereas children have the highest requirement. MAC requirements subsequently decrease in the elderly patient. MAC values are typically listed for adult (30-40 years old) patients at 1 atm pressure and  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

The exact mechanism of action of inhaled anesthetic agents at the CNS is still controversial. Earlier theories have suggested that anesthetic molecules insert into and disrupt the lipid bilayer of neuronal cell membranes, thus interfering with the cellular function. More current theories suggest that anesthetic molecules may instead directly interact with cellular proteins, possibly with membrane ion channels or specific receptors.

Whereas  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  has mild or minimal sympathomimetic effects at commonly used doses in dental practice, all of the halogenated agents produce generalized cardiovascular depressant effects. The potent volatile agents block peripheral vasoconstriction, thus lowering mean arterial

blood pressure. At lower doses below 1 MAC, the baroreceptor sympathetic reflex is activated, which leads to a compensatory increase in heart rate.

At usual doses,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  does not appreciably affect respiration. However, the halogenated agents produce a characteristic "rapid and shallow" spontaneous breathing pattern. A decrease in tidal volume is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of breathing, but the faster respiratory rate does not fully compensate for the smaller tidal volumes. Therefore, minute ventilation is reduced and arterial  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  levels will be elevated in patients spontaneously breathing while under general anesthesia with these agents. The halogenated agents also cause a dose-dependent decrease in airway resistance and produce bronchodilation. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction can be attenuated at over 1-2 MAC for all volatile agents.

Although hepatic blood flow decreases with these agents, hepatic damage, if any, resulting from hypoxia is usually subclinical and transient. Renal blood flow and urine output are reduced secondary to decreased mean arterial pressure, which can be a concern in susceptible patients. The release of fluoride from the halogenated gases does not appear to cause clinically significant damage to renal tissues. With sevoflurane, fresh gas flows of at least  $2\mathrm{L / min}$  will minimize compound A accumulation in the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorber, which can lead to very rare hepatic or renal damage.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is another rare but very dangerous reaction triggered by the halogenated agents as well as succinylcholine (SCh). Nitrous oxide, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, opioids, benzodiazepines, other IV anesthetic agents, and local anesthetics do not trigger MH. Exposure to triggering medications causes an abnormal ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle cells to release excessive intracellular calcium, leading to uncontrolled muscle contractions. As a result,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  production increases quickly and exhaled  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  rises sharply. Initial signs include tachycardia and tachypnea, along with muscle stiffness. Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia may develop and cardiac arrest is a possibility. Increasing body temperature is a relatively late sign. The halogenated agent must be discontinued at once and  $100\%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$  administered, preferably through a different circuit and machine. Dantrolene, a specific treatment agent for MH, at  $2.5 - 10\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously must be given as soon as possible. Cooling measures including chilled IV fluids should be instituted. Emergency help must be obtained immediately and the patient will require medical management and monitoring for at least  $24\mathrm{h}$  after the episode. Reemergence of the reaction is common, requiring readministration of dantrolene. Acute renal failure is the most common morbidity secondary to myoglobinemia so repeated fluid boluses and Foley catheter placement are needed. A mortality rate

of  $10\%$  is associated with an acute MH episode, even with immediate proper management.

# 3.4.1 Nitrous Oxide

$\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  is commonly administered in dental offices for anxiolysis and mild sedation. It is a colorless and odorless gas, available in blue cylinders in the United States. In the dental setting, it is commonly administered with special nasal hoods fitted with a scavenger system. Concentration ratios of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{O}_2$  range up to 70:30 on most dental  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  and anesthesia machines. High levels of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{O}_2$  can produce deep sedation and significant analgesia. Unexpected respiratory depression or airway obstruction can occur when  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  is added to other sedative agents.

Nitrous oxide in oxygen is likely the most commonly used sedative agent in dental offices and enjoys the unique advantage of not requiring an escort after completion of the procedure, provided adequate recovery time has elapsed. The drug can be titrated using a nasal hood, usually starting at  $20\%$ $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  and gradually increasing to  $50\%$  as needed. Doses above that level are associated with increased nausea and dysphoria, although the brief application of doses higher than  $50\%$  is useful during local anesthetic administration and other short stimulating surgical episodes. At the conclusion of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  sedation, 3-5 min of  $100\%$ $\mathrm{O}_2$  is administered to maintain scavenging and limit operative contamination. In the past, there was a concern over diffusion hypoxia, a rare occurrence in the healthy individual if  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  is delivered via nasal hood and if room air gas, instead of  $100\%$ $\mathrm{O}_2$ , is used at the conclusion of sedation. This valid concern for intubated general anesthesia with nitrous oxide results when the rapidly exiting  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  can dilute room air  $\mathrm{O}_2$  concentration in the alveoli leading to hypoxic levels during initial recovery. The lower concentrations of actual delivered nitrous oxide when using a nasal hood, particularly in healthy patients, render this concern highly unlikely.

With a low blood-gas solubility coefficient of 0.47,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  has a very rapid onset and recovery. Whereas  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  lacks the potency of the halogenated agents (MAC value of  $105\%$ ), it also lacks the respiratory and cardiovascular side effects. During general anesthesia, it can be administered to an intubated patient in combination with other medications such as halogenated gases and/or opioids. Using this combination can reduce the dose required of each drug if given singly and will lessen the incidence of potential adverse effects.  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  is also inexpensive and can reduce the total cost of administered drugs. Recently,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  has somewhat fallen out of favor for intubated general anesthesia due to the documented increased incidence of PONV, especially when doses higher than  $50\%$  are used, as well as any pharmacoki

netic advantage being negated by the newer potent halogenated agents. At one point there was some concern that nitrous oxide may increase the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events but this has since been disproven [16].

There are a few contraindications for the use of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ . It can enter closed spaces faster than nitrogen can exit, leading to distention of the closed space [14]. In oral surgical practice, the implication of this property is to avoid  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  use in patients with current otitis media, sinus infections, and more advanced COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; emphysema with blebs that may rupture). Other relative contraindications of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  use include acute upper respiratory disease and a history of severe PONV.

Several precautions should be exercised when using  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ . It has been implicated in producing sexual hallucinations in some patients, predominantly young women. At least one additional staff person should always be present when this gas is being administered. Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders may experience exacerbated symptoms while undergoing  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  sedation. Because low levels of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  in room air have been demonstrated to increase spontaneous abortion rates in pregnant anesthesia providers, proper scavenging is essential to minimize room air levels so that surgical personnel are not at increased risk. Frequent recreational use of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  has been reported to lead to peripheral neuropathy and other deleterious effects. As with all anesthetic agents, anesthesia providers must never use these drugs for personal use and should be alert to potential misuse by other providers of these drugs.

# 3.4.2 Potent Inhalation Agents

The halogenated inhalation agents commonly in use today in the United States include isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. As seen in  $\square$  Fig. 3.9, all are with halothane, an ethane, added for historical reference. Unlike the original anesthetic gas, diethyl ether, these methyl-ethyl ethers are halogenated and nonflammable. The newer halogenated agents, sevoflurane and desflurane, are unique in that all of the side chain halogen atoms are fluorine. The gases are stored and released by gas-specific vaporizers that control the concentration (volume %) allowed into the anesthesia circuits and into the patient. They must also be scavenged effectively so that room air levels do not affect healthcare personnel.

# 3.4.2.1 Isoflurane

Isoflurane has an intermediate potency (MAC 1.2) and blood-gas partition coefficient (1.46). With the newer halogenated agents having improved pharmacokinetics, isoflurane is a less common choice for maintenance of

![](images/cc17e94e76001a2ca7109db4fb6a323525ba8cdf3a97669f235f990b6429e563.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 3.9 Chemical structure of inhalation agents

anesthesia, because recovery time is prolonged in longer procedures and there is less ability to quickly titrate the drug intraoperatively. Isoflurane is not a good choice for inhalation induction because it frequently leads to gagging and coughing when used. Isoflurane is, however, much more cost-effective than the two other popular agents, sevoflurane and desflurane; its cost per equivalent MAC administration is significantly lower than the other available agents. Isoflurane was originally associated with an increase in coronary steal phenomena, but this concern has since been disproven. Otherwise, contraindications for using isoflurane are few. Caution is warranted if desiccated  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorbers are suspected (e.g., if fresh gas flows were maintained overnight while an anesthesia machine was not in use) as isoflurane can interact with desiccated granules to form carbon monoxide.

# 3.4.2.2 Sevoflurane

Sevoflurane is nonpungent and a common choice for inhalation induction. It has an intermediate potency (MAC 2-2.4), and at higher doses, induction will be rapid. Recovery from sevoflurane after a short anesthetic  $(< 1\mathrm{h})$  is more rapid than isoflurane owing to the lower blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.69).

All of the side chain halogen atoms in sevoflurane are fluorine, contributing to its low blood-gas solubility and recovery profile. Unlike earlier inhaled agents, the small amount of inorganic fluorine released during sevoflurane use has not been associated with renal damage [17]. Sevoflurane and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorbers (particularly Baralyme but also soda lime) produce a degradation product called "compound A," a haloalkene, which is

nephrotoxic in rats but has not been associated with significant permanent renal damage in humans. Regardless, sevoflurane may not be the agent of choice for patients with renal disease. Sevoflurane should be used at a total gas flow of at least  $2\mathrm{L / min}$  for procedures longer than  $2\mathrm{h}$  and at least  $1\mathrm{L / m}$  for shorter procedures to minimize compound A production.

# 3.4.2.3 Desflurane

Desflurane is extremely pungent and can be so irritating to nonanesthetized airways that it may precipitate laryngospasm. It is to be avoided for inhalation inductions. During initial administration of desflurane, tachycardia can also occur until deeper levels of anesthesia are realized.

Desflurane is delivered from specially heated vaporizers because its vapor pressure is close to atmospheric pressure. It also possesses only fluorine substitutions that, like sevoflurane, confer a low blood-gas solubility. In fact, desflurane has the lowest blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.43) of any inhalation agent, lower than even  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ . This confers a quick onset and offset and easy titratability, and recovery can be very rapid after a short anesthetic with desflurane. Desflurane is the most expen

sive of the potent agents based on equivalent MAC administration. As with isoflurane, caution is warranted if desiccated  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorbers are suspected (e.g., if fresh gas flows were maintained overnight while an anesthesia machine was not in use) as desflurane can interact with desiccated granules to form carbon monoxide. This exothermic reaction with desflurane has also been implicated in airway fires.

# 3.4.2.4 Halothane

For historical perspective, since the 1950s, halothane, an ethane, was widely used, particularly in pediatric anesthesia, owing to its sweet, nonpungent odor that did not irritate the airway mucosa. This was the only inhalation induction agent available for many years until the introduction of sevoflurane. In 2000, the FDA changed the prescribing information for halothane, causing the agent to eventually no longer be available in the US market. Concerns included increased incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias and myocardial depression, epinephrine- and hypercarbia-induced dysrhythmia, drug-induced hepatitis particularly with repeated use, and potent triggering of MH, among other issues (Fig. 3.10). A significant decrease in pediatric perioperative cardiac arrests

resulted [19]. Halothane is very potent, with a MAC value of 0.75 but a relatively high blood-gas solubility of 2.54. Around the world, halothane is still commonly used because its cost is low and inhalation induction well tolerated.

# Key Points

Inhalational halogenated anesthetic agents are complete anesthetics.  
Inhalational anesthetics undergo minimal metabolism.  
Nitrous oxide does not trigger malignant hyperthermia like the other potent inhalational agents.  
- Sevoflurane is the agent of choice for mask induction.

# 3.5 Neuromuscular Blocking Medications

Skeletal muscle relaxation is often required during surgery when patient movement interferes with procedures involving anesthesia or surgery. For example, paralysis may be required to facilitate tracheal intubation, relax abdominal wall muscles for access during gastrointestinal surgery, or completely inhibit patient movement, for instance during ocular surgery. Whereas relaxation can be achieved with deeper anesthetic levels or appropriate peripheral neural blockade, neuromuscular blocking agents are commonly used to provide the necessary amount and duration of muscle relaxation.

The potential of these neuromuscular blocking (NMB) drugs during anesthesia and surgery was not recognized until the middle of the twentieth century. Many of the current neuromuscular blocking agents used are derivatives of curare, one of the oldest paralyzing agents, used by ancient hunters to paralyze prey. All are competitive antagonists that bind to the nicotinic ACh receptors located at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle, thus interfering with proper contraction of the muscle.

Neuromuscular blocking agents can be classified as either depolarizing or nondepolarizing and, within the latter group, can be divided based on structure, speed of onset, duration of action, and metabolism.

# 3.5.1 Succinylcholine

SCh, two joined ACh molecules, was introduced for surgical muscle relaxation in the 1950s and is the only depolarizing agent used today. Once SCh binds to the ACh receptor, the postsynaptic membrane depolarizes, an action potential is generated, and the muscle contracts. Subsequent muscle contractions are delayed until SCh

dissociates from the receptor and is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase).

SCh has the fastest onset (30-60 s) and shortest duration (5-10 min) of the neuromuscular blocking agents and is typically used in oral surgery practice to treat laryngospasm not relieved with positive pressure ventilation at a dose of  $20\mathrm{mg}$  to  $1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  depending on clinical circumstances. It is also given to facilitate tracheal intubation at a dose of  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  intravenously. It is no longer used to maintain intraoperative paralysis.

SCh has several notable side effects. Tachycardia can result upon initial administration, but bradycardia, sometimes severe, may develop, especially with repeated administration. Widespread muscle contractions can result in postoperative myalgia, which can at times be minimized by prior administration of a small dose of a nondepolarizing muscle blocker. The contractions may increase intraocular and intragastric pressure and can also cause a transient elevation in plasma potassium levels by  $0.5\mathrm{mEq / L}$ . Plasma potassium levels may rise even higher than  $0.5\mathrm{mEq / L}$  in patients with certain neuromuscular disorders, post-stroke, spinal cord injury, or significant burn injury  $24\mathrm{h}$  after injury. SCh is, therefore, contraindicated in these patients. SCh is a trigger for MH (see "Malignant Hyperthermia," earlier in Inhalation Anesthetics). Its use should also be avoided in patients with pseudocholinesterase abnormalities, because the recovery from this drug will be prolonged.

# 3.5.2 Nondepolarizing Agents

All of the remaining neuromuscular blocking agents are nondepolarizing and do not initiate muscle contraction upon administration. The chemical structures of these drugs fall into two classes: benzylisoquinolines and aminosteroids [14]. The characteristics of the commonly used nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are outlined in Table 3.2.

Although it is not quite as rapid in onset as SCh, rocuronium has the fastest onset of the nondepolarizing agents, with paralysis occurring at approximately 1 min with higher doses. It can be used for facilitating intubation when SCh cannot be used, particularly in an emergent situation. Onset time for most other agents is approximately 3 min.

Drug selection for maintenance of muscle relaxation is often based upon the anticipated need for continued paralysis. Of the steroidal agents, pancuronium has the longest duration, whereas vecuronium or rocuronium has intermediate duration depending on the dose administered. With any of these agents, paralysis will last longer than that produced with SCh and controlled ventilation must be provided. Return of skeletal muscle

function is usually monitored by a nerve stimulator, and the degree of paralysis is gauged by the number of muscle contractions (twitches) produced by stimulation of specific muscles, such as adductor pollicis or frontalis/orbicularis oculi. Paralysis may need to be reversed by an anticholinesterase or sugammadex to ensure adequate recovery of airway and respiratory muscle function before extubation.

Adverse effects may also affect the choice of neuromuscular blocking agent and can be categorized by structure. The benzylisoquinoline compounds may trigger histamine release, thus causing flushing and peripheral vasodilation. Mivacurium falls into the category but cisatracurium does not. Histamine release may be undesirable in asthmatic patients. Aminosteroid structures may block vagal activity, causing a noticeable increase in heart rate, which is common with pancuronium. Increased heart rate can be problematic in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Many of the nondepolarizing agents are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidney but some rely more on renal excretion. Cisatracurium is removed by Hofmann elimination, whereby the drug spontaneously degrades at body pH and temperature. Mivacurium is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, as with Scheme.

# Key Points

- Succinylcholine is a rapid-acting depolarizing paralytic agent.  
It is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase and can precipitate malignant hyperthermia.

# 3.6 Reversal of Nondepolarizing Agents

# 3.6.1 Anticholinesterases

Anticholinesterases, or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, block the action of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down ACh. In anesthesia, anticholinesterases, such as neostigmine and edrophonium, are most commonly used to reverse the effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants once partial muscle function has returned and paralysis is no longer necessary, usually at the conclusion of surgery. By increasing the amount of ACh available at the neuromuscular junction, more of the neurotransmitter can bind to nicotinic ACh receptors, overcoming the competitive inhibition of the neuromuscular blocker and aiding in the return of muscle function.

Increased ACh concentrations following anticholinesterase administration will bind not only to nicotinic ACh receptors but also to muscarinic ACh receptors at the heart, lungs, salivary glands, and smooth muscle. This can lead to undesirable effects including bradycardia, bronchospasm, abdominal cramping, and excessive salivation [20]. To prevent these effects, anticholinergic medications such as atropine or glycopyrrolate, which block muscarinic but not nicotinic ACh receptors, must be given together with anticholinesterases. The anticholinesterase and anticholinergic medications are paired according to similar time of onset and duration. Glycopyrrolate is generally administered with neostigmine, and atropine is more commonly used with edrophonium. Doses of these agents are listed in Table 3.3.

<table><tr><td>Anticholinesterase</td><td>Anticholinesterase dose (mg/kg)</td><td>Anticholinergic</td><td>Anticholinergic dose (mg) per mg of anticholinesterase</td></tr><tr><td>Neostigmine</td><td>0.4–0.8</td><td>Glycopyrrolate</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Edrophonium</td><td>0.5–1.0</td><td>Atropine</td><td>0.015</td></tr></table>

aThe two most commonly used acetylcholinesterase medications are listed. Acetylcholinesterase and anticholinergic medications are given in recommended combinations according to similar onset time and duration of action of the two types of drugs. The maximum dose of cholinesterase is not always necessary, but should be given based on the degree of recovery from muscle relaxation. The dose of the anticholinergic drug is determined by the amount of cholinesterase given. The dose for glycopyrrolate is given for  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  neostigmine

# 3.6.2 Anticholinergics

ACh is a neurotransmitter that binds to two types of receptors. Nicotinic receptors are located at autonomic ganglia and the neuromuscular junctions of the skeletal muscle. Muscarinic receptors are found at postganglionic sites of the parasympathetic nervous system at the heart, salivary glands, and smooth muscle. Both receptors are present in the CNS. Anticholinergic medications specifically block muscarinic receptors but do not affect nicotinic receptors despite the name implying that all cholinergic receptors are blocked. In anesthetic practice, as noted above, when anticholinesterase agents are used to reverse NMB, it is mandatory to co-administer an anticholinergic medication to avoid potentially life-threatening complications such as severe bradycardia or asystole.

Other clinical uses in anesthesia of atropine, glycopyrrolate, and scopolamine are defined by their varied effect at the muscarinic receptor sites of different organs (Table 3.4). Atropine has the fastest onset of increasing heart rate by blocking vagal nerve receptors at the heart and is used to treat emergent bradycardia. All three anticholinergic medications decrease salivary secretions. Glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium compound, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Atropine and scopolamine, both tertiary amines, can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation. Scopolamine is also used for management of nausea and prevention of motion sickness.

Central anticholinergic syndrome is a concern with higher doses of centrally acting anticholinergic medications, manifesting as restlessness and confusion. It may be reversed by physostigmine, an anticholinesterase that can cross the blood-brain barrier.

# 3.6.3 Sugammadex

Sugammadex has been used for years in other countries but only gained FDA approval in the United States in late 2015. Sugammadex (Bridion®) acts to engage and incapacitate free aminosteroid NMB drug molecules that would otherwise be available to continue to competitively antagonize the nicotinic ACh receptors of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [21]. The molecular structure of sugammadex, a modified  $\gamma$ -cyclodextrin ring, is designed to surround and encapsulate particularly rocuronium, but also vecuronium, preventing it from having any appreciable antagonistic activity at nicotinic ACh receptors at the NMJ, thereby facilitating NMB reversal and return of neuromuscular function [22]. The unbound sugammadex molecules bind to free aminosteroid NMB molecules in a 1:1 ratio, with roughly 2.5 times higher affinity for rocuronium than vecuronium. Since vecuronium is administered at 1/5th to 1/10th the dose of rocuronium, the drug is also effective for reversal of vecuronium NMB once some return of neuromuscular function occurs. Once encircled by

the sugammadex molecule, the aminosteroid relaxant molecule remains trapped until being filtered out and eliminated renally. Recurarization is extremely rare, mainly manifesting as a result of insufficient initial dosing, rather than partial return of NMB as can occur with anticholinesterase reversal due to inherent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variation. Rare allergic reactions have been documented with sugammadex, however.

Sugammadex has many significant potential advantages, including rapid reversal of paralysis, even following larger doses of rocuronium as are recommended during rapid sequence induction or for emergency

treatment of laryngospasm. There are a decreased risk of residual muscle paralysis; avoidance of the MH-triggering agent, succinylcholine; and lack of negative side effects seen with other neuromuscular reversal options. Despite the considerable cost, its routine use in the United States has grown exponentially since gaining FDA approval late in 2015 [23]. The positive impacts of sugammadex on ambulatory office-based anesthesia techniques are still evolving, but theoretically, it has the potential to be significant, possibly negating the need to utilize succinylcholine for emergent management of laryngospasm in oral surgery office-based sedation.

# Key Points

- Anticholinesterases, which should be combined with anticholinergics, reverse the action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers.  
- Sugammadex reverses the effects of rocuronium and vecuronium.

# 3.7 Adjunct Medications

Opioid medications, which have been discussed previously, are the mainstay intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. In the operating room, opioids are often given concurrently with other anesthetic agents in a balanced technique to supplement intraoperative analgesia. Opioids with a longer duration of action, such as morphine or hydromorphone, are commonly administered before the end of the procedure, if postoperative pain is anticipated. During the initial phase of hospital postoperative care, these medications are usually given by the nursing staff but once initial recovery has occurred, patient administration can also occur via computer-aided patient-controlled analgesia pumps. Other options for postoperative pain control can be used, however, in oral surgery office-based sedation.

# 3.7.1 NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs)

NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) which acts on arachidonic acid, a breakdown product of phospholipids in cell walls, to produce prostaglandins, an inflammatory mediator involved in pain transmission. Ketorolac tromethamine and ibuprofen are the two IV NSAID medications currently available in the United States. Ketorolac can provide effective postoperative analgesia for adults for many dentoalveolar procedures at an IV dose of  $30\mathrm{mg}$  and IM doses of  $30 - 60\mathrm{mg}$ . For pediatric patients,  $0.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  is used, although off-label one-time doses of  $1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  can be considered. Onset time is  $10 - 15\mathrm{min}$ , with an analgesic duration of approximately  $6\mathrm{h}$ . Ketorolac  $30\mathrm{mg}$  intramuscularly is the analgesic equivalent of  $10\mathrm{mg}$  of parenteral morphine and does not produce opioid-related respiratory depression, nausea, or sedation. Intravenous ibuprofen (Caldelor®) dose is  $400 - 800\mathrm{mg}$  ( $10\mathrm{mg / kg}$  to  $400\mathrm{mg}$  for pediatric patients) delivered over  $30\mathrm{min}$  with cost concerns limiting its use in oral surgery practice. NSAID use does have several cautions, however. Because of possible NSAID-induced inhibition of platelet aggre

gation, the drug is normally administered after bleeding has been controlled and should be avoided for surgeries associated with postoperative hemorrhage. Patients with bleeding-related disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease, blood dyscrasias, liver failure, and those taking anticoagulants) should not be given NSAIDs. Rarely, life-threatening bronchospasm can also occur with NSAIDs, particularly in those with a history of asthma or aspirin allergy. Because NSAIDs block prostaglandin production, patients who depend on renal prostaglandins for adequate renal function, and those with frank renal disease, should be administered NSAIDs cautiously, if at all. Patients taking drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers, aliskiren, and beta blockers) can develop acute renal failure when NSAIDs are coadministered, especially for more than a single dose. Patients with congestive heart failure, hypovolemia, or cirrhosis may have impaired renal perfusion and NSAID administration can result in renal complications. A "Black Box" warning is present for all NSAIDs indicating increased risk of embolic phenomena. Caution is advised when prescribing/administering these medications to patients with, or at significant risk of, atherosclerotic disease and especially to those with previous history of myocardial infarction. Since the vast majority of oral surgeons providing office-based sedations will have received adequate local anesthesia, oral NSAIDs may alternatively be administered, if not contraindicated, ideally well before local anesthesia has worn off.

# 3.7.2 Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) is likely the most commonly used analgesic in the world. Its exact mechanism of action remains unelucidated, but it is generally accepted to be centrally acting. Current hypotheses have suggested activity of its active metabolites in various aspects of nociceptive pathways, such as the cannabinoid receptor  $\mathrm{(CB_1)}$  and the capsaicin receptor  $(\mathrm{TRPV}_1)$ , and/or inhibition of the conversion of prostaglandin  $\mathbf{G}_2$ , an unstable intermediate produced by the COX enzyme. Despite the current lack of understanding regarding acetaminophen's cellular and molecular actions, it clearly utilizes alternative mechanisms than NSAIDs and opioids. Similar to NSAIDs, acetaminophen produces analgesia and antipyretic effects, but lacks appreciable anti-inflammatory effects. Acetaminophen is a common postoperative analgesic, producing synergistic and additive effects when used in combination with other analgesics. Currently acetaminophen is available

in multiple formulations for oral consumption as well as an IV formulation, commonly administered perioperatively as an infusion over  $15\mathrm{min}$ . Recommended dosing for adults is  $650 - 1000\mathrm{mg}$  every  $4 - 6\mathrm{h}$ , not to exceed  $4000\mathrm{mg}$  per day (pediatric dosing  $15\mathrm{mg / kg}$  every  $6\mathrm{h}$  or  $12.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  every  $4\mathrm{h}$ , not to exceed  $75\mathrm{mg / kg}$  per day). Acetaminophen undergoes hepatic metabolism via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation, in addition to oxidation via CYP-450 enzymes, most notably CYP2E1, which creates the highly reactive toxic metabolite,  $N$ -acetyl-para-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) [24]. Prolonged use, especially at higher doses, can result in hepatic failure due to this toxic intermediary. Use of reduced dosages or complete avoidance should be considered for patients with hepatic impairment or dysfunction. Patients prescribed postoperative analgesics featuring a combination of opioid with acetaminophen must be counseled to avoid additional extraneous consumption of acetaminophen due to risk of acetaminophen toxicity. The daily dose of acetaminophen should be reduced to  $2000\mathrm{mg / day}$  in patients taking warfarin (Coumadin) to avoid excessive anticoagulation. Used appropriately, acetaminophen, particularly when combined with NSAIDs and opioid agonists, remains a powerful foundational analgesic for managing acute pain.

# 3.7.3 Alpha-2 Agonists

Alpha-2 agonists have sedative, analgesic, and muscle relaxing properties in addition to their inhibition of CNS sympathetic outflow and, thus, their antihypertensive effects. They are one of the very few drug classes known to decrease anesthetic requirements. Clonidine, the prototypical alpha-2 agonist, can be used as an anxiolytic premedication with the added benefit of cardiovascular stability intraoperatively. Dexmedetomidine, an IV alpha-2 agonist agent approved for use in the United States in 1999, is the dextro-isomer of medetomidine and eight times more selective for the alpha-2 receptor than clonidine. It was initially approved for use in the intensive care unit for sedation of intubated patients, but in 2008, after extensive use in anesthesiology, the FDA approved the agent for procedural sedation in nonintubated patients. Dexmedetomidine has proved useful as a sole sedative agent delivered as a continuous infusion for awake endotracheal intubation and other peripheral procedures in which good local anesthesia can be obtained. It can also be used in a continuous infusion as an adjunct to general anesthesia to reduce anesthetic requirements. When combined with

other sedative agents, it can be used as an adjunct to intravenous sedation. Some practitioners use a single bolus dose before extubation to decrease postoperative agitation following sevoflurane anesthesia in children. When initially administered, hypertension can occur due to activation of peripheral alpha-2 receptors on blood vessels, but later, as central alpha-2 receptors are activated, bradycardia is the most significant adverse effect. The drug can significantly prolong the recovery phase when used as a continuous infusion and, therefore, may not be commonly considered for oral surgery office-based sedation techniques.

# 3.7.4 Local Anesthetics

A detailed discussion of local anesthetics is beyond the scope of this chapter. The most commonly used agents for intraoperative and immediate postoperative pain control in office-based oral surgery are the local anesthetics. The use of effective local anesthesia is required for successful administration of moderate and deep sedation for oral surgical procedures. General anesthesia, either with intravenous or inhalation agents, does not require the use of local anesthetics, although their use allows reduced dosages of these other systemically administered anesthetic agents. Long-acting local anesthetics, like bupivacaine, provide several hours of analgesia for inferior alveolar nerve block anesthesia as well as soft tissue anesthesia in the maxilla. Lidocaine with epinephrine given intraoperatively can also provide adequate analgesic duration until postoperative oral NSAIDs or opioid/acetaminophen combinations can achieve reliable plasma levels for generally predictable postoperative pain control. A liposomal drug delivery system for bupivacaine (Exparel®) has been developed to deliver bupivacaine over  $48 - 72\mathrm{h}$ . Administered in an infiltration technique (not FDA approved for oral nerve block) adjacent to oral surgical sites, a decreased need for postoperative analgesics in the early postoperative period may be realized.

# Key Points

Combined use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen can produce significant analgesia.  
Reduced dosing of NSAIDs and acetaminophen is indicated for patients with certain comorbidities.  
Local anesthetics are the mainstay of perioperative pain control during sedation.

# 3.8 Antiemetic Medications

PONV is one of the most common complaints after surgery and anesthesia. Certain groups of patients (female, previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, history of motion sickness, and non-smokers) appear to be more susceptible. Certain surgeries (ear, ocular, tonsillar, maxillofacial, gynecologic) are likewise associated with increased PONV. Nausea and/or vomiting after oral surgery is not uncommon. Swallowed blood and secretions can stimulate the gag reflex and are potent gastric irritants. Drugs used during sedation and general anesthesia, such as nitrous oxide, potent inhalation anesthetics, opioids, and ketamine, may trigger nausea postoperatively. Other "nonchemical" triggers of nausea include smell, gastric distention, motion, and even stress.

Chemical triggers in the bloodstream come into contact with an area in the medulla lacking an intact blood-brain barrier called the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) [25]. The CTZ (Fig. 3.11) contains receptors for serotonin, histamine, muscarinic ACh, substance P, and dopamine. Opioids, toxins, and chemotherapy agents, as well as input from the middle ear, also stimulate this area. Stimulation of the CTZ will activate vomiting.

Many antiemetic medications act by blocking these receptors at the CTZ. Medications that block the dopamine receptor include phenothiazines (e.g., prochlorperazine) and butyrophenones (e.g., droperidol). They effectively reduce PONV but are associated with adverse effects such as sedation, extrapyramidal reactions, and, in larger doses, potential prolongation of the QT interval. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (serotonin;  $5\mathrm{-HT}_{3}$ ) antagonists including ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron produce less sedation and other adverse effects than the dopamine antagonists and are the most commonly used antiemetics. They have been rarely associated with sero

tonin syndrome when patients are taking other serotonergic medications. Antihistamine, such as promethazine (which also possesses a phenothiazine structure and thus some dopamine blocking ability), is an effective antiemetic owing to its anticholinergic properties but can cause significant sedation. Scopolamine, an anticholinergic medication, can be used as a patch behind the ear to reduce PONV, although its original use is for motion sickness. Ideally, the patch should be placed at least  $1\mathrm{h}$  or more before anesthesia with the effects lasting up to 3 days. Other antihistamines with anticholinergic effects, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, also have some mild antiemetic properties. The newest antiemetic agent is an  $\mathrm{NK}_1$  receptor antagonist, aprepitant (Emend®), which appears especially useful for delayed phase PONV. The natural ligand for the  $\mathrm{NK}_1$  receptor is substance P.

Dexamethasone is now commonly used to decrease the incidence of PONV when given shortly after induction of general anesthesia. A minimum adult dose of  $4\mathrm{mg}$  or  $0.1\mathrm{mg/kg}$  intravenously appears to be an effective dose for this effect to be realized [26]. Other corticosteroids do not appear to have this antiemetic effect.

Selection of anesthetic agents may help prevent PONV. Propofol has antiemetic effects, particularly when administered for maintenance of anesthesia. Additional antiemetic treatment may be unnecessary following the use of propofol infusions, even in patients with a previous history of PONV. Avoidance of known nausea triggering agents such as nitrous oxide at higher doses, ketamine, and longer-acting opioid medications may also reduce PONV.

# Key Points

- Multimodal management of PONV is ideal, targeting different receptors in the CRTZ.

# Conclusion

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons continue to provide the majority of moderate and deep sedation within the practice of dentistry. Patient safety is critical to the continued use of the team model which employs a surgeon-anesthetist with support from clinical staff during oral surgery procedures performed with sedation. Intimate knowledge of anesthetic pharmacology by the oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a basic requirement for the continued safe practice of these advanced anxiety and pain control techniques.
