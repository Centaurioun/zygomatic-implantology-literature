# 63.1 Introduction

Orthognathic surgery involving the maxilla was first described in 1859 by von Langenbeck to provide surgical access for the removal of nasopharyngeal polyps [1]. The first report of a maxillary osteotomy in the United States was by Cheever in 1867 for the treatment of complete nasal obstruction secondary to recurrent epistaxis for which a right hemi-maxillary downfracture was performed [2]. The subsequent century found numerous authors describing osteotomy designs and techniques that included mobilization of the entire maxilla, mostly for access and treatment of pathologic processes. In 1901, Le Fort published his classic and vivid descriptions of the natural planes of maxillary fracture by applying blunt forces to cadaver head specimens [3]. In 1927, Wassmund first described the Le Fort I osteotomy for the correction of midface deformities [4]. However, complete mobilization of the maxilla with immediate repositioning was not performed until 1934 by Axhausen [5]. Separation of the pterygomaxillary junction was advocated by Schuchardt in 1942 [6]. Moore and Ward in 1949 recommended that a horizontal transection of the pterygoid plates is necessary for maxillary advancement [7]. Willmar reported [8] on over 40 patients treated in this manner with a horizontal osteotomy through the pterygoid plates and described severe bleeding in most cases likely due to laceration of one of the pterygoid branches of the maxillary artery; this technique was abandoned in favor of a vertical separation of the maxilla from the pterygoid plates at the pterygomaxillary suture or junction. Most of the early technical descriptions simply mobilized the maxilla by releasing at least some bony attachments and then placing orthopedic forces with elastic traction on the maxilla to achieve the desired movement, in a sort of unintentional distraction osteogenesis procedure. As expected, owing to soft tissue restriction, uncontrolled distraction forces, and a lack of wire or ridged fixation of the maxilla, these techniques were associated with a high degree of bony relapse and unpredictable vectors of movement. In 1965, Obwegeser [9] recommended complete mobilization of

the maxilla so that repositioning could be accomplished without soft tissue or bony resistance, and this notion proved to be a major advance in the concept of maxillary stability, as documented by Hogemann and Willmar [10] and Perko [11].

Due to early concerns regarding vascular supply to the maxilla, and the belief that complete mobilization would result in complete loss of vascularity to the entire maxilla, anterior segmentalization of the maxilla was advocated in the early descriptions of maxillary surgery in order to preserve blood supply to the posterior segments, including reports by Cohn-Stock [12], Wassmund [4] and Spanier [13]. Because complete mobilization of the maxilla was not performed, instability and relapse occurred commonly with these approaches, as well. In addition, because surgical access was performed through palatal incisions, vascularity to the anterior maxillary segment was severely compromised. Cupar [14, 15], Kole [16], and Wunderer [17] reported a more direct surgical access to the anterior maxilla via vestibular incisions with improved mobilization of the maxilla and maintenance of blood supply to the anterior maxillary segment. Posterior segmentalization of the maxilla was used by Schuchardt [18] but owing to incomplete mobilization, it had limited stability with hard and soft tissue relapse. Kufner [19] improved on this posterior segmental osteotomy technique in an attempt to decrease relapse by complete mobilization of the osteotomized segments before surgical repositioning. The next logical step in the evolution of maxillary surgery was to combine the techniques of anterior and posterior segmental osteotomies in order to accomplish a total maxillary alveolar osteotomy (TAMO) for segmental manipulation and surgical repositioning simultaneously [20, 21]. Several forms of TMAOs were described by Converse and Shapiro [22], Cupar [14], and Kole [23]. Willmar [8] further established the stability achieved by performing complete Le Fort I osteotomy, and Bell [24] documented the overall superiority of the total downfracture Le Fort I osteotomy for segmental and one-piece maxillary osteotomy. In addition in 1975, Bell [24] documented that the vascular supply to the downfractured, completely mobilized maxilla is preserved via the buccal and palatal soft tissues and that the descending palatine vessels may be sacrificed without vascular compromise to the surgically repositioned maxilla.

In further consideration of maxillary stability before ridged fixation techniques, block bone grafting to improve stability was advocated by Gillies and Rowe [25], Cupar [14, 15], and Obwegeser [26] who first advocated grafting in the pterygomaxillary fissure. Throughout the years, clinicians have advocated block grafting, using autogenous iliac crest blocks,

allogeneic blocks, or synthetic materials (e.g., block hydroxylapatite) in the bony gaps created by maxillary osteotomy but specifically placed in the pterygomaxillary buttress or piriform rims. The use of block grafting to improve stability remained a controversial procedure despite the promulgation of certain guidelines for grafting (i.e.,  $>6\mathrm{mm}$  of maxillary advancement, or cleft lip and palate cases), and interestingly, Willmar [8] did not find a difference in stability with and without bone grafting in a series non-cleft maxillary osteotomies. Early descriptions of rigid fixation of maxillary osteotomies were published by Michelet 1973 [27], Horster 1980 [28], Drommer and Luhr 1981 [29], and Luyk and Ward-Booth 1985 [30]. Since that time, a wide variety of methods have been advocated for rigid internal fixation of maxillary osteotomies including stainless steel or titanium bone plates and screws, metallic mesh, pins, rigid adjustable pin (RAP) system, and resorbable (polyglycolic acid [PGLA], Poly-L-lactic acid [PLLA] polymers) fixation [31-33]. Despite these descriptions of various surgical techniques throughout the past century, there remains a lack of consensus among surgeons regarding the specifics of the surgical technique utilized for maxillary mobilization, the considerations for maxillary distraction osteogenesis versus one-stage Le Fort surgery, the need for adjunctive bone grafting, the specific "rigid fixation" devices used (e.g., number of plates needed, appropriate plate and screw thickness and diameter) and the use of postoperative postoperative maxillomandibular fixation (MMF).

# 63.1.1 Basic Principles of Maxillary Surgery

Maxillary deformities may manifest in any of the three planes of anatomy: sagittal, axial, and coronal. Patients displaying abnormal facial anatomy and exhibit elements of maxillary and mandibular deformities and therefore, the clinician must be able to recognize and treat a variety of maxillary and midface deformities. Subjectively, patients with maxillary deformities often describe their dentofacial problem in terms of the relative mandibular appearance such that maxillary hypoplasia may be attributed to mandibular hyperplasia ("pseudoprognathia"). Patient expectations clearly demonstrate the importance of the position of the mandible and the chin in patient aesthetic satisfaction [34]. This perceptual preoccupation with apparent mandibular excess or deficiency in the absence of a significant absolute mandibular abnormality may require additional patient education and guidance from the surgeon

in order to assist the patient in recognizing the contribution of the midface and maxilla to her or his overall facial appearance. In a similar fashion, the patient may attribute a convex facial profile to an abnormal nasal prominence in describing the chief complaint, which may be due to maxillary anteroposterior (AP) excess and/or mandibular (AP) deficiency.

Therefore, the clinical database should include a comprehensive history and physical examination, dental model or digital occlusion scan analysis and traditional model surgery (TMS) and/or Computer-Assisted 3D Surgical Simulation (CASS), and cephalometric analysis with prediction tracings in order to determine the list of treatment options.

Scrutiny of physical characteristics, cephalometric analysis with prediction tracings, TMS and CASS, will all assist in obtaining a satisfactory treatment plan. These important diagnostic and treatment planning modalities are discussed extensively elsewhere in the text; however, TMS and CASS, which we will collectively refer to as presurgical simulation (PSS), is the most valuable tool in preparing for orthognathic correction of skeletal facial deformities. Whereas PSS is essential for immediate preoperative surgical planning and splint construction, it may be even more important in the early phases of treatment planning. Before initiating orthodontic or surgical treatment, PSS is the best method to determine the final postoperative position of the mandible as well as the maxilla. Two-dimensional cephalometric prediction (computer-generated or hand drawn) or photographic image manipulation cannot detail all of the three-dimensional and occlusal information obtained from PSS. In the pretreatment stages, the teeth may not fit together perfectly during this preliminary PSS, but orthodontic tooth movement can be simulated to permit an accurate prediction of the specific movements required in the maxilla and mandible to achieve the desired final surgical result. The close interaction and communication between the orthodontist and the surgeon become paramount at this stage of planning. Pretreatment PSS is essential when contemplating maxillary surgery alone and is also very useful when planning 2-jaw surgery. Pretreatment PSS permits the three-dimensional evaluation of the maxilla and the mandible independent of whether autorotation or osteotomy of the mandible are part of the final treatment plan. The entire process of presurgical assessment and treatment planning for orthognathic surgery has undergone major advances with three-dimensional technology which undoubtedly improves efficiency and accuracy for correction of skeletal discrepancies in both complex and routine cases.

# 63.1.2 Computer-Assisted 3D Surgical Simulation and Traditional Model Surgery

Presurgical simulation may be useful in mandibular surgery from an academic standpoint, although the final mandibular position is determined by the occlusion in all three planes of space, but it is particularly important in maxillary, and two-jaw, orthognathic surgical planning. The information obtained from precise PSS permits accurate surgical planning, reveals the three-dimensional changes that are planned in the surgery, and facilitates the exact positioning of the jaws. PSS is critical for two-jaw surgery and fabrication of intermediate and final surgical splints, and when applied to isolated maxillary surgery, simulation analysis may reveal that, in fact, maxillary surgery alone is not sufficient to most appropriately treat the skeletal deformity. The principles of PSS for orthognathic surgery, including both one- and two-jaw surgery, are covered elsewhere in this textbook.

# 63.2 Surgical Anatomy

# 63.2.1Osseous Structures

The body of the maxilla contains the maxillary sinus in its entirety, except rarely when the apex of the sinus extends into the zygomatic bone [35]. The anterior or facial surface of the maxilla is composed of the anterolateral wall of the sinus. The infraorbital foramen is located at variable distances between the inferior orbital rim and the maxillary alveolus. The alveolar jugae, or root prominences, visible through the facial surface of the maxillary alveolar process are more prominent anteriorly, and the longest root in the maxilla of the canine tooth form the canine fossa just lateral to the root juga. The anterior aspect of the alveolar process of each side of the maxilla surrounds the piriform aperture, or rim, and the maxillary suture in the anterior midline unites to form the anterior nasal spine (ANS). This bony prominence forms the most anterior and inferior, or caudal, support for the flexible anterior cartilaginous nasal septum. Proceeding posteriorly from the ANS, the nasal crest of the maxilla rises sharply to form a crest at the junction of the anterior and nasal surfaces of the maxilla, which forms the nasal floor and results in an inclination of this structure superiorly, or cranially, at the piriform aperture. The body of the maxilla and its frontal process form the superolateral boundary of the piriform aperture as a thin edge of the bone. The piriform rim itself represents the vertical pillar of midfacial support (Fig. 63.1).

![](images/4953aaefc121793709b5adac73c98a5a24962751a76e325973b7fcacf77e12f0.jpg)  
Fig. 63.1 Cross-sectional anatomy of the maxilla at the piriform rim

In the midline between the nasal cavities, the nasal crest of the maxilla articulates with the septal, or quadrangular, cartilage, the vomer, and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone [36, 37]. The nasal septal cartilage rests in a central groove of the nasomaxillary crest, which extends posterior from the ANS to the posterior nasal spine (PNS). This bony-cartilaginous articulation is flexible, but it is stabilized by the perichondrial-periosteal continuity and interposed connective tissue. In the midline, at the junction of the premaxilla and the maxilla, or the primary and secondary palate, is the incisive foramen or fossa, which typically presents the openings of four canals through which the nasopalatine arteries and nerves pass.

The hard palate is formed by the midline fusion of the palatine process of the two hemi-maxillae and the horizontal lamina of the palatine bones [38]. The transverse suture between the maxilla and palatine bones is located approximately 1 centimeter anterior to the posterior margin of the hard palate or the junction of the hard and soft palate. At its lateral extension, this suture widens into the greater and lesser palatine foramina, which are located approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  posterior and medial to the second molar (Fig. 63.2). The palatal soft tissue is very thin in the midline and the bone is very thick, but the opposite is true 5- and  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  lateral to the midline. The greater palatine canal superiorly, or cranially, is also formed by the perpendicular laminae of the palatine and maxillary bones, which continue cranially to form the inferior lateral nasal wall. The inferior nasal turbinate, an isolated bony structure, articulates with the maxillary and palatine components of the lateral nasal wall in this region, and the superior and middle turbinates are part of the ethmoid bone. Posterolaterally, the maxillary tuberosity is located behind the third molar tooth, when present. Superior to the tuberosity, the posterior-superior alveolar foramina through which the posterior-superior alveolar nerves and vessels emerge. The pyramidal process of the palatine bone unites the medial and lateral pterygoid plates

Fig. 63.2 Cross-sectional anatomy at the pterygomaxillary junction. Note the position of the greater palatine foramen and the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone

of the sphenoid bone with each other, as well as the maxilla. The pterygomaxillary junction, formed by the palatine bone, ends superiorly in the pterygomaxillary fissure leading into the pterygopalatine fossa [39, 40].

The foramen rotundum, containing the second division of the trigeminal nerve, opens into the posterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa. In addition, the pterygoid (Vidian) canal also communicates into the pterygopalatine fossa. From this point extending medially, the sphenopalatine foramen leads to the lateral nasal cavity beginning posterior to the middle nasal turbinate of the ethmoid bone. Anteriorly, the infraorbital and zygomatic nerves and infraorbital vessels run in transverse the infraorbital canal; inferiorly, the descending palatine artery and greater palatine nerves course within the greater palatine canal.

# 63.2.2Vascular Structures

The vascular supply to the maxilla is extensive, and it originates from large and small vessels as well as soft tissue perfusion. The normal vascular supply is derived from the terminal branches of the maxillary artery, which traversed the pterygopalatine fossa approximately  $20\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the pterygomaxillary suture. The pterygoid and pterygomaxillary divisions of the maxillary artery supply various portions of the maxilla via a complex network of tributary vessels and collateral circulation. Additional perfusion is supplied via the anastomosis of the greater palatine artery with the lesser palatine artery. The lesser palatine connects with the ascending pharyngeal artery off of the external carotid artery in the

![](images/931a4eacc0a0ff72d788d3698b25b0a4db6a4ea5a4cc26a593c507a68c95817d.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 63.3 Pathway of the ascending palatine, ascending pharyngeal, and descending palatine arteries as they continue into the greater palatine arteries

ascending palatine artery off of the facial artery. This three-way junction of the lesser, greater, and descending palatine arteries at the opening of the greater palatine foramen is a critical crossroads in the blood supply of the maxilla after downfracture. The venous outflow tracts mimic the vascular anatomy with a confluence of veins located posteriorly as the pterygoid venous plexus.

Although numerous texts concerning head and neck anatomy describe the detailed vascular anatomy of the intact maxilla, several aspects of maxillary blood flow during and after maxillary osteotomy remain controversial or unknown. The Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy had been performed for over 100 years before Bell [41, 42] first identified the exact nature of the blood supply in the osteotomized maxilla, which provided detailed information regarding the viability of the pedicled maxilla. It was obvious that even though the direct blood supply to the maxillary teeth and periodontal tissues was interrupted, collateral circulation existed to provide perfusion of the dental pulp and surrounding structures (Figs. 63.3 and 63.4). This same circulation is also responsible for the survival of the remainder of the maxilla; however, the exact nature of the various factors affecting maxillary perfusion is still not well documented or understood. During the classic downfracture maxillary osteotomy, the entire blood supply to the maxilla is severed except for posterior remaining buccal pedicle and that heading for the greater palatine artery distal to the greater palatine foramen. If the greater palatine artery is disrupted anterior to this junction, severe ischemia

![](images/72c0ffda6d47ac49a4400054c0e03f08eef5626d0732835b15404f7527032486.jpg)  
Fig. 63.4 Soft palatal, ascending pharyngeal, and ascending palatal vessels anastomose with the greater palatine artery. Major vessels have been sectioned and tied. The arrows signify direction of blood flow

will result unless an anterior pedicle has been retained. Bell [41, 42] has shown that preservation or sacrifice of the descending palatine artery is inconsequential and can be ligated, thereby shifting the perfusion of the greater palatine artery via the lesser palatine artery. However, the pressure gradient from the lesser palatine artery to the greater palatine artery will be possible only if the descending palatine artery has been ligated and not lacerated. The downfractured maxilla has a rich blood supply via the ascending pharyngeal artery and the ascending palatine branch of the facial artery [43]. Laceration of the descending palatine artery will not only increase uncontrolled hemorrhage but also reduce the perfusion distally through the greater palatine artery to the maxilla.

Bell [42] also verified the revascularization of anterior maxillary osteotomies using the microangiographic technique. Brusati and Bottoli [44] performed revascularization studies similar to those of Bell and found quite different results in that the tunneling technique to access the anterior maxillary bone [16] was superior to the anterior maxillary labial pedicle technique in maintaining the blood supply, especially to the pulpal tissues [17]. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Bell used a monkey model and Brusati and Bottoli used the dog model, which they claimed possess a more similar maxillary vasculature to that of the human [44] The clinical

significance of these differences remains unclear, and in none of these studies were the maxillae moved to a new position, which may, in fact, represent the greatest insult to the blood supply at the time of actual maxillary osteotomy surgery. It should be remembered that revascularization does not necessarily represent the reestablishment of adequate blood flow, and therefore Nelson and coworkers [45, 46] used a radioactive microsphere technique to evaluate maxillary blood flow. Unfortunately, several variables were present in this study that make interpretation difficult, including the fact that severance of the descending palatine vessels was inadvertent and no ligation was performed, which allowed bleeding to occur through the lacerated vessels and prevented a pressure gradient from developing to maintain distal flow to the anterior maxillary segment. In other studies, involving anterior maxillary osteotomies, Nelson and coworkers [46] found no significant differences among three different techniques, including the labial pedicle, the tunnel technique (as described by Brusati and Bottoli) [44], plus a third procedure using only a palatal pedicle. Although no statistical difference was seen, the palatal flap seemed to be slightly superior to the others, and owing to the presence of multiple confounding variables, the clinical significance could not be determined.

# 63.3 The Soft Tissue Envelope of the Maxilla

The midfacial superficial fascia, or subcutaneous tissues, contain variable amounts of adipose tissue as well as the muscles of facial expression in the deep fascial layer. This fascia is tightly bound to bone in most locations in the midface, except directly adjacent to the buccal fat pad and in the lower eyelids. In Anatomy for Surgeons: The Head and Neck, Hollinshead [39] divides the mimetic or facial muscles into five chief groups: mouth, nose, orbit, ear, and scalp. The muscle groups of the mouth and nose, which are innervated at their posterior inferior aspect by the facial nerve, are of greatest concern with regard to maxillary orthognathic surgery. These muscle groups insert into the skin and mostly arise from periosteum surrounding the midfacial facial skeleton. The upper oral group of muscles radiate from their insertions near the corner of the labial commissure (modiolus region). From a horizontal to vertical, and inferior to superior, orientation the risorius, zygomaticus major and minor, and the levators (levator labii superioris alaeque nasi) insert and blend with the skin and the orbicularis oris muscle. The risorius does not arise from bone but originates from the superficial fascia over the parotid gland. The risorius, zygomaticus major, and zygomaticus minor elevate and retract the corner of

the mouth and upper lip laterally. The superficial levator muscles and a third deeper muscle, the levator anguli oris, elevate the lateral portion of the upper lip. In addition, the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi attaches to the skin and greater alar cartilage of the nose, thus lifting the ala and widening the naris.

The orbicularis oris is composed of many multidirectional fiber groups that blend with other surrounding facial muscles, encircle the mouth, originate from periosteum covering the roots of the canine teeth, insert laterally at the corner of the mouth, and pass at right angles to the encircling sphincter fibers connecting skin to labial mucosa. This diverse muscle draws the lips together, purses the lips, presses the lips against the teeth, and pulls the corners of the lips inward. The buccinator muscle arises from the mandible and maxilla and the pterygomandibular raphe, which separates it from the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. The fibers pass forward and slightly inferiorly to blend with the orbicularis oris and attach to the mucosa and skin of the labial region. The buccinator muscle acts to flatten the cheek against the teeth and alveolus.

Lightoller [47] and Nairn [48] place emphasis on the modiolus, which is the point at the lateral aspect and just superior to the corner of the mouth where muscles of the oral group of the mimetic muscles converge. The orbicularis oris and buccinator muscles join at the modiolus region to form a continuous muscular sheet on either side of the midline. The zygomaticus major, levator anguli oris, and depressor anguli oris (this group is referred to as the "modiolar stays") immobilize the modiolus in any position. In addition, the marginal and peripheral parts of the orbicularis oris muscle are distinguishable by the fact that the peripheral aspect of the muscle lies parallel to the inner labial mucosal surface and the marginal part curls outward following the vermilion surface. As tension is expressed in the orbicularis oris, the marginal aspect of the muscle is thought to straighten and decrease vermilion exposure, thereby pulling the upper and lower lips toward each other and against the facial surfaces of the dentition.

When contemplating maxillary orthognathic surgery, consideration must be given to the nasal group of facial muscles that act to both dilate and compresses the nares and whose length and function may be affected by Le Fort surgery. The nasalis arises from the anterior aspect of the maxilla in a position lateral and inferior to the ala. The transverse portion of the nasalis muscle unites with the contralateral nasalis muscle over the dorsum of the nose. The alar portion of the nasalis muscle inserts into the greater alar cartilage. Thus, the two parts compress and dilate the nasal apertures respectively. The depressor septi muscle lies beneath the orbicularis oris and attaches to the base of the columella and posterior ala; it func

tions to narrow the naris. The posterior and anterior dilator muscles are intrinsic muscles of the nose that course from the alar cartilages to the margin of the alar fat pads. The nasal mucoperiosteum is firmly fixated to the elevated piriform rim above the floor of the nose, to the lateral margin of the nasal aperture, and to the ANS. The premaxillary wings that flare laterally from the anterior midline nasal crest provide an irregular attachment of the mucoperiosteum along the infero-anterior nasal floor.

The hard palate is covered by mucosa firmly adherent to the periosteum and containing mucous minor salivary glands. The mucosa is thin in the midline region of the palate and thickens toward the alveolar process. The palatine crest is a transverse elevation at the posterior border of the horizontal plate of the palatine bone that gives attachment to the tensor veli palatini muscle. The larger, lateral pterygoid plate is the origin of the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid and the medial pterygoid muscles. A small part of the medial pterygoid muscle also arises from the maxillary tuberosity. The tensor veli palatini muscle that functions during speech and swallowing curves around the hamulus, which is the caudal, or inferior, termination of the medial pterygoid plate. From the hamulus, the tensor muscle of the palate enters the soft palatal tissues. The tensor aponeurosis is an adherent connective tissue sheath continuous with the periosteum, which covers the posterior hard palate attaching laterally to the submucosal layer of the pharynx and the tensor veli palatini tendon.

# 63.4 Surgical Techniques

# 63.4.1 Incisions, Dissection, and Exposure of the Maxilla

Exposure of the anterior, lateral, and pterygomaxillary regions is most commonly achieved via a circumvestibular incision horizontally through the mucoperiosteum above the attached gingival margin at the level of the maxillary teeth apices (Fig.63.5a). This circumvestibular incision typically extends from the first molar to the contralateral first molar (Fig.63.5b). Care is taken to avoid the parotid papilla of Stenson's ducts at approximately the maxillary second molar region superior to the occlusal plane. The incision may be made with electrocautery or a scalpel, and there are no studies evaluating the two techniques. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal incision is made to the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus, and care should be taken in the anterior region to keep the incision below the anterior nasal spine and avoid a superiorly placed incision that may perforate the nasal mucosa and enter the nasal cavity. The tissues above the incision are reflected superiorly in

![](images/d4d7bc40dd565900cd61f113184a9008ca3a92a6a9bde96e4a2517da60ac35e5.jpg)

a subperiosteal plane first at the area of the piriform rims, using a periosteal elevator (#9) (Fig. 63.5c). Further superior exposure lateral to the nasal aperture will lead to exposure of the infraorbital nerve exiting from the infraorbital foramen. This subperiosteal dissection also elevates the insertions of the muscles mentioned previously, including the upper lip muscles, nasal muscles, and zygomatic muscles. Further posterior subperiosteal tissue reflection from the infraorbital foramen will reveal the zygomatico-maxillary suture, the zygomatic buttress, and the most anterior aspect of the zygomatic arch. Continuing posteriorly and inferiorly with subperiosteal tunneling, the lateral aspect of the maxillary tuberosity and its junction with palatine bone and pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone are exposed. Care should be taken to avoid vascular structures by directing this subperiosteal dissection posteroinferiorly, more toward the mucogingival junction, as dissection progresses toward the pterygomaxillary fissure. Meticulous maintenance of the subperiosteal plane of dissection will prevent troublesome exposure of buccal fat pad tissue, which impairs visualization and retraction of soft tissue during subsequent osseous surgery. A reverse-angled Obwegeser retractor ("toe-out" or "upturned" or a reverse-Langenbeck) is placed in the pterygomaxillary junction to facilitate bony exposure. Close attention should be paid to the placement of this retractor because it can be responsible for periosteal tears and exposure of the buccal fat.

The attached and unattached mucogingival tissues inferior to the horizontal incision are elevated minimally, if at all. In areas of planned interdental osteotomies for segmentalization of the maxillary arch, the attached gingiva and periosteum are elevated conservatively, using a Woodson elevator, while retraction laterally is provided, if necessary (Fig. 63.6). Because the alveolar osteotomy will be accomplished with a thin osteotome or saw blade, osseous exposure requirements at the alveolar crest level are minimal and minimal soft tissue dissection is usually required. Infrequently, the intersegment oste

Fig. 63.6 If segmentalization is necessary, it is best to perform interdental osteotomies before horizontal osteotomies and downfracture. Use minimal exposure technique for interdental osteotomies

otomy be larger, and more exposure may be necessary to prevent tearing of the gingival papilla. In addition, a wider exposure of alveolar bone is frequently needed when an osteotomy is planned in an edentulous site or in a simultaneous extraction space. In these rare situations, a vertical releasing mucosal incision at the line angle, one tooth distant from the osteotomy site, will facilitate wider exposure for osseous procedures. This ancillary vertical incision should be used only when an anterior labial pedicle can be maintained to maximize the labial vascular pedicle during multi-segmental osteotomy procedures (Fig. 63.7). As mentioned, for one-, two-, and most routine three-piece maxillary osteotomies a circumvestibular incision with minimal interdental exposure is preferred. For three-piece maxillary osteotomies involving wide expansion or other extreme changes,

Fig. 63.7 Modified incision for cases in which anterior perfusion is questionable. Bilateral vestibular incisions are made from the first premolar to the second molar; shown with a midline vertical incision

four-piece maxillary osteotomies, and osteotomies in some cleft maxillae, soft tissue incisions can be isolated from second molar to first premolar to maintain a wide anterior labial soft tissue and vascular pedicle to the anterior maxillary segment(s) (Fig. 63.7). In some cases, a midline vertical incision is utilized to gain access to the anterior maxillary segments, if necessary.

Once the labial incisions and soft tissue and muscle dissections are completed, the nasal mucoperiosteum is elevated to complete soft tissue exposure of the osseous surgical site (Fig. 63.5c). A meticulous initial subperiosteal plane of dissection is imperative for complete elevation of the nasal mucosa without disruption of mucoperiosteal integrity, leading to persistent nasal bleeding both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Because the nasal cavity is more voluminous inside the piriform rim than at the entrance to the piriform aperture, the periosteal elevator should be held at an oblique angle to the surrounding maxillary bone adjacent to the nasal aperture; alternatively, a Woodson elevator may be used to initiate the dissection at the piriform rim. While maintaining the elevator tip against bone within the nasal cavity, the mucoperiosteum is reflected from the nasal floor, lateral nasal wall, and nasal crest of the maxilla and the caudal portion of the nasal septum. The dissection should continue superiorly  $1\mathrm{cm}$  along both the lateral nasal walls and both sides of the nasal septum to prevent nasal mucosal tearing during osteotomy or downfracture of the maxilla, particularly at the superior reflections of the nasal floor medially and laterally.

The AP depth of this nasal mucosal dissection is approximately 15 to  $20\mathrm{mm}$  from the rim. The remaining posterior soft tissue is reflected more precisely after initial downfracture of the maxilla. At this point, in preparation for osseous surgery, there should be to reverse angle ("toe-out") Obwegeser retractors, one on each side posteriorly at the pterygomaxillary junction; two Obwegeser retractors ("toe-in") elevating the soft tissues, upper lip muscles, nasal muscles, and zygomatic muscles and protecting the infraorbital neurovascular bundle superiorly; and two periosteal elevators or a malleable metallic retractor, one in the inferolateral aspect of the piriform rims bilaterally protecting the nasal mucosa.

# 63.4.2Osseous Surgery

Before osseous surgery, vertical reference points must be recorded, and these may be made either inside or outside of the wound. The internal reference points are small holes made with a #701 bur in the piriform rims and zygomatic buttress, well above the osteotomy. Measurements are made from the reference points to the gingival crest or orthodontic bracket corresponding to the point-to-point measurements made at the time of TMS using a caliper, or as measured in CASS. Incisal edges should not be used, as they are often obscured by surgical splints during fixation. Orthodontic brackets can be dislodged during surgery and the gingival crest provides a predictably accessible point. External reference using a Kirshner wire or Steinmann pin may also be used. An external reference is created by using a wire or Steinmann pin placed in the nasal bones, and then using a measuring device (e.g., Perkins device) to make reproducible vertical measurements to the central incisor bracket or other inferior references that will not be obscured if an interocclusal splint is used later during the surgery. In addition, horizontal measurement can be made using the same Perkins caliper with a millimeter calibrated rod placed in the lower portion of the device. After taking the initial vertical and horizontal measurements, the device can be set to the planned movements and used subsequently during osseous surgery to confirm that the planned movements have been achieved. The medial canthus may also be used as a superior point, with measurements with a caliper or Boley gauge. Many studies have shown that external reference points are more predictable and reproducible than traditional scribe lines, and, similar to how it may be measured in PSS, the external technique utilizes reference points that are located at a distance from the osteotomy site. This minimizes parallax error, especially with a significant maxillary advancement. It also

prevents obliteration of landmarks inappropriately placed adjacent to the osteotomy, especially with a significant maxillary impaction procedure.

The design of the osteotomy will depend upon the maxillary movement desired. The initial lateral maxillary osteotomy (Fig. 63.8) is generally begun at the greatest convexity of the zygomatic buttress because this area provides a convex surface for the reciprocating saw. The saw is advanced anteriorly through the lateral piriform rim below the inferior turbinate while the nasal mucoperiosteum is retracted and protected with the periosteal elevator. For a standard maxillary osteotomy, this horizontal osteotomy is parallel to the maxillary arch wire and maxillary occlusal plane, in an attempt to simulate the cut performed previously during model surgery. Any modifications to the standard osteotomy are taken into consideration at this point and altered as necessary (e.g., a  $Z$  or a step osteotomy). After the anterior osteotomy is completed, the bony cut is continued posteriorly by tapering inferiorly toward the pterygomaxillary junction, using the reciprocating saw in an "inside-out" fashion (Fig. 63.9).

After completion of the osteotomy of the anterior and lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, a bayonet or double guarded nasal septal osteotome is directed slightly downward and posterior (Fig. 63.10) beginning just above the ANS while the anterior nasal mucoperiosteum is retracted. Proceeding posteriorly, the osteotome is carefully maintained in the midline along the nasal crest of the maxilla. There is a tendency toward superior deviation while separating the cartilaginous and vomerine septum from the nasal crest of the maxilla; this necessitates slight downward inclination of the septal osteo

tome. A finger placed at the PNS region near the soft palate confirms that the osteotome has been carried sufficiently posterior. Next, the lateral nasal wall is severed using a thin spatula or single guarded nasal osteotome directed posteriorly and inferiorly if necessary, while medial retraction of the nasal mucoperiosteum is accomplished with a periosteal elevator. The osteotome is gently malleled posteriorly for a distance of approximately  $20\mathrm{mm}$  to avoid premature injury to the descending palatine neurovascular bundle that resides in the lateral posterior nasal wall. In many cases, the use of these osteotomes will initiate the downfracture of the maxilla,

Fig. 63.11 Pterygomaxillary separation with a small, sharp, curved osteotome directed medially

and some surgeons may choose to perform this portion of the osteotomy after all other osteotomies have been completed, including the pterygoid plate osteotomy, in which the pterygoid plates are separated from the maxillary tuberosity (Fig. 63.11) using a small, sharp, curved osteotome (pterygoid osteotome). This instrument is preferred over the traditional thick pterygomaxillary osteotome (Swan-neck osteotome) because the thin cutting edge and more gentle curve limit fracture [49] and promotes precise division of this bony junction, although studies indicate that the pterygoid osteotomy may occur in a variety of erroneous locations, including the alveolus, through the plates horizontally, and close to the skull base, as well as other locations. The tip of the osteotome is directed as anteriorly, inferiorly, and medially as the tunneled buccal soft tissue pedicle will allow. A finger placed palatal and posterior to the maxillary tuberosity will help verify complete separation of the maxilla from the pterygoid plates while avoiding trauma to the palatal vascular pedicle. Because the maxillary artery has been shown to lie in the pterygomaxillary fossa approximately 20 to  $25\mathrm{mm}$  above the pterygomaxillary Fisher, the use of a  $10\mathrm{mm}$  pterygoid chisel will allow a 10- to  $15\mathrm{-mm}$  margin of safety during the performance of the osteotomy. An alternate technique for pterygoid separation was described by Precious et al. in 1991 [50]. Their experience suggested that their technique produces a complete, clean separation of the maxilla from the pterygoid process in a passive manner at the end of which the tuberosity was intact and the horizontal process of the

Fig. 63.12 Down-fracture is accomplished with a sharp toothed Senn retractor, with simultaneous elevation of nasal mucoperiosteum

palatine bone remained with the maxilla most of the time. This technique ensures that there is not a comminution of the pterygoid plates and fracture of the maxillary tuberosity. The authors further claim that the resultant visualization of the pterygoid separation allows easy identification, dissection of the neurovascular bundle and minimizes injury to the adjacent vascular structures.

At this point, all osteotomies have been completed, and downward pressure is placed on the anterior maxilla using digital manipulation and the sharp hooks of a Senn retractor or bilaterally placed Smith Spreaders to facilitate initial downfracture of the maxilla (Fig. 63.12). If moderate pressure does not result in mobilization of the maxilla, and evaluation and verification of all osteotomies should be performed, and typically, the pterygoid disjunction is found to be incomplete. The curved osteotome is again placed into the pterygomaxillary junction, malleled gently, and then torqued to mobilize the maxilla. If no significant movement is detected, then the osteotome may be carefully placed further superiorly in the pterygomaxillary junction, directed anteriorly, and malleled until the separation is complete. Another area of possible incomplete osteotomy is the lateral nasal wall, which can be checked with a guarded osteotome and completed if necessary.

When mobility occurs, the nasal mucoperiosteum is elevated in a progressive fashion posteriorly until the posterior edge of the hard palate is encountered (Fig. 63.12). Any significant tears in the nasal mucosa should be repaired at this point with resorbable suture to prevent persistent postoperative epistaxis. Portions of the pterygoid plates or perpendicular process of the palatine bone that resist fracture may be completely

separated from the maxilla using carefully placed double-action rongeur under direct visualization (Fig. 63.13). After initial mobilization of the maxilla, the descending palatine neurovascular bundle may be identified, isolated, and either protected or ligated with him the clips and divided. If the descending palatine vessels are maintained, care must be taken to avoid inadvertent laceration or the presence of sharp bony edges that may contribute to intraoperative bleeding during maxillary repositioning or postoperative hemorrhage, as documented by Lanigan and West [51]. Significant movement of the posterior maxilla can cause tensile forces and disruption of the descending palatine vessels. Superior repositioning of the maxilla may also compress the exposed vessels between the inferior and superior osseous segments. Severe postoperative bleeding after Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy has been reported [52-54], and attempts to preserve the neurovascular bundle may increase this complication. Ligation and division of this structure has been shown to have no deleterious influence on perfusion or neurosensory recovery [55, 56]. The bone of the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone surrounding the neurovascular bundle is carefully removed using a Woodson elevator and a rongeur that facilitates isolation of the neurovascular bundle (Fig. 63.13). Other clinicians argue against the routine ligation of the descending palatine vessels if they can be protected adequately, especially during seg

mental maxillary procedures. After downfracture, if additional mobilization of the maxilla is needed, a "J" stripper, normally used for periosteal elevation in mandibular sagittal osteotomies, may be placed over the posterior border of the midline nasal floor at PNS region (Fig. 63.14), and anterolateral pressure is exerted to progressively increase mobility of the maxilla. A Tessier retro maxillary lever or similar instrument may also be placed posterior to the tuberosity region with anterior pressure. Finally, with extreme caution, two Rowe disimpaction forceps may be used with a straight arm of the forceps placed on one side of the nasal floor and the curved arm placed on the palatal mucosa. With two of these forceps, significant torque may be placed on the maxilla to achieve mobility, but significant pressure on the palatal vascular pedicle may compromise blood flow to the anterior maxilla if used inappropriately or for an extended period of time, especially during segmental maxillary surgery and their use has been discouraged as a potential cause of aseptic necrosis of the maxilla [57]. The goal of these maneuvers is to mobilize the maxilla into the approximate final position with only gentle digital pressure and a minimum of soft and hard tissue restriction. After the maxillary downfracture any significant, unexpected sinus pathology may be debrided and submitted for histopathologic evaluation, if indicated. After mobilization of the maxilla from the cranial base is complete, a reassessment of the surgical site should be performed. Based upon the planned movement all potential bony interferences posterior to the second molar should be eliminated before application of

maxillomandibular fixation (MMF). Next, MMF is applied, either with or without the inter-occlusal splint fabricated during model surgery. On occasion, with full dentition and good interocclusal contacts, the splint may not be necessary. However, even in cases such as this, an interocclusal splint provides a more definitive seating of the teeth than a tooth-to-tooth contact. If there is instability in the occlusion, a planned open bite posteriorly, or a tripod planned for the occlusion to be corrected orthodontically after surgery, the interocclusal splint should be used. Also, the splint may or may not be left in place, typically wired to the maxilla after surgery.

Condylar positioning during the rotation of the maxillomandibular complex and application of rigid fixation to the maxilla are paramount to success, and some surgeons prefer complete paralysis of the patient during this process. The physiologic position of the condyles is thought to be a supero-anterior orientation relative to the glenoid fossae, and the surgeon should position the condyles appropriately before autorotation (Fig. 63.15). The importance of this stage of the surgery cannot be overestimated, and the most likely points of unrecognized bony interferences are in the areas of

![](images/618aaebb882b16f8292f731f93d67896256b40536cf3b1e2a783fed28cb25c42.jpg)  
Fig. 63.16 Inappropriate positioning of the condyles around posterior pivot points a will result in open bite b after release from maxillomandibular fixation

the pterygoid plates, the maxillary tuberosities, and the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone. It is quite possible to rotate the maxillomandibular complex while being unaware of a premature pivot point in these posterior bony areas (Fig. 63.16a). This will result in immediate malpositioning and a class-II open bite discrepancy once the patient is released from MMF. If a significant period of MMF or training elastics is used postoperatively, this discrepancy may not become apparent for weeks or months (Fig. 63.16b). Once these posterior interferences have been removed, the surgeon continues to rotate the entire complex around the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) until the appropriate vertical relationship is achieved. The cartilaginous septum and vomer as well as the nasal crest of the maxilla are reduced in height equal to the planned movement of the maxilla. This may require a submucous resection of the cartilaginous nasal septum to prevent buckling of the septum from pressure as the maxilla is repositioned. A groove can be fashioned in the midline of the nasal floor to accommodate the recontoured septum and prevent nasal septal deviation postoperatively. A portion of the inferior edge of the cartilaginous septum should be removed, and the tendency is to not remove enough because there may be unequal areas of contact between septum and maxilla. Even if the maxilla is inferiorly repositioned, buckling of the septum may occur because

the cartilaginous septum extends anterior and inferior to the ANS and, therefore, can be buckled as the maxilla moves forward even if there is some downward movement (Fig. 63.17). This is the reason that the surgeon should err on the side of over reduction, rather than under reduction, of the nasal septum and nasal maxillary crest. As mentioned, the maxillary positioning has been predetermined by the model surgery and splint construction dictates the horizontal and transverse maxillary movements but not the vertical position. At the time of surgery, as the maxilla is rotated around the condyles, bony interferences are removed only at the points of contact, not as a full wedge reduction of bone planned upon the movement [58], because "telescoping" of the bony edges may occur without the need for bone reduction (Fig. 63.18). Selective bone reduction of interferences only results in improved bone-to-bone contact and avoids large gaps between bony segments. Once the desired vertical relationship has been achieved based on the measurements, the maxilla should be fixated in position with internal rigid fixation, typically using four  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  plates with self-drilling screws, plates that the piriform rims and zygomaticomaxillary buttressed regions, because these represent the structural pillars of the midface. Next, MMF is removed and the mandible is rotated based upon the condylar position into the interocclusal splint while it is held against the maxillary dentition. This step is critical to determine whether the condyles were adequately seated during fixation of the maxilla. An immediate anterior open bite or

tal advancement of the maxilla will buckle the septum unless adequate bony and cartilaginous relief is provided  
$\text{图} 63.18$  Removal of bony walls and slotting of the contact points

significant malocclusion at this point necessitates removal of rigid fixation and inspection and reduction of bony interferences to allow correct condylar position in order to achieve appropriate maxillary movements. After release of MMF and verification of the correct, planned, stable and repeatable occlusion, the surgical splint is usually removed unless the plan postoperative surgical occlusion is unstable, as mentioned previously.

Variations in the previously discussed basic osteotomy design may enhance osseous contact, facilitate bone graft placement, or assist in the application of

rigid fixation devices and result in improved stability of the repositioned maxilla. These variations are described later as they apply to specific maxillary movements. To prevent septal deviation, despite adequate bone and cartilage removal, it is often desirable to suture the nasal septum to the ANS in the midline. This is done by drilling a hole through the ANS and passing a 2-0 resorbable or non-resorbable suture through the hole and then through the cartilaginous septum (Fig. 63.19). This will also contribute to the prevention of postoperative displacement of the septum during extubation. The use of alar base cinch sutures to control our base widening using 2-0 non-resorbable sutures and V-Y or double V-Y closure to preserve vermilion display using 4-0 chromic gut sutures are discussed elsewhere in this text. Recontouring of the bony inferior piriform rim and reduction of the ANS are often useful in preventing widening of the alar base and preventing over-rotation with elevation of the nasal tip. Following copious irrigation, wound closure is performed by suturing the perioseum using a polyglycolic acid suture followed by mucosal closure with chromic gut. Alternatively, a single 3-0 chromic gut suture may be used to close the mucosa and perioseum for from the superior tissue to the inferior alveolar unattached perioseum and mucosa.

Virtual cutting guides and custom patient-specific fixation devices have come to the forefront in recent years with studies proposing accuracy of such techniques, quicker

operations, better postoperative stability, and elimination of positioning splints altogether in surgery [59, 60].

# 63.4.3 Segmental Maxillary Procedures

A variety of surgical options exist when segmental maxillary surgery is required. Whereas there are regional variations in specific orthodontic preferences that are preparing the dentition for surgery, the need for segmentalization of the maxilla occurs frequently. While two-piece maxillary surgery is frequently performed for a surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) procedure, the three-piece maxillary osteotomy is perhaps performed most commonly when segmentation of the maxilla is required. Once again, the decision-making process regarding which of the options will be utilized in each case is determined by pretreatment and preoperative assessment and model surgery simulation. The need for dental extractions, most commonly of the premolar teeth with the segmental osteotomies performed through the extraction sites, is also determined at this stage of treatment planning. If no extractions are required, the interdental osteotomies may be made reliably between parallel or divergent roots of the canines and lateral incisors or posteriorly between the canines and premolar teeth. When possible, the osteotomy should be performed between the canine and premolar teeth to preserve more hard and soft tissue with the

associated vascular pedicle to the anterior maxillary segment. If the six maxillary teeth interdigitate well with the lower anterior teeth, the interdental osteotomy is performed between the canine and the premolar teeth. This places a potential periodontal defect at the interdental osteotomy site more posterior in the oral cavity, removed from the aesthetic zone. If extractions are required based upon the coordinated orthodontic and surgical treatment plans, the teeth may be removed early during presurgical orthodontic treatment or during the orthognathic surgical procedure. The indications and considerations that influence this decision are covered elsewhere in this book. Regarding the specific surgical technique, the interdental osteotomy is created with gentle soft tissue retraction and the use of a thin cement spatula osteotome or a thin sagittal saw blade while palpating the palatal mucosa in the area of the osteotomy. As described, the standard circumvestibular incision can be performed, and conservative tunneling technique can be created from the circumvestibular incision inferiorly to the alveolar crest on the facial aspect of the alveolus. The osteotome is malleted through the interdental alveolus until the tip is just palpable under the palatal mucosa (Fig. 63.6). With care, the osteotomy can be carried superiorly to the level of the planned horizontal maxillary osteotomy and medially to the horizontal surface of the hard palate. This should be performed before any of the other maxillary osteotomies are done because the maxilla must be stable at the time to withstand the forces of the mallet. If teeth are to be extracted at the time of osteotomy, which is rarely necessary, an alternative flap design is recommended in order to maintain an anterior soft-tissue pedicle for blood supply to the anterior segment (Fig. 63.7). It should be remembered that segmentalization with a standard, or modified, interdental osteotomy may be more difficult when alternative Le Fort osteotomy designs are used, such as high Le Fort I, II, or III. When the “Z” osteotomies are used, interdental cuts between canines and premolars are more difficult than between canines and lateral incisors.

After complete maxillary downfracture and full mobilization of the maxilla, the remainder of the segmental osteotomies can be completed. The palatal soft tissue is very thin in the midline and the bone is very thick, but the opposite is true 5 and  $10\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the midline. For that reason, two parasagittal osteotomies are frequently utilized along the floor of the nose using a bur with a rounded tip, such as a Steiger, or 1703 fissure, bur (Fig. 63.20). The use of two parasagittal or paramedian, osteotomies creates a bony island in the midline to avoid perforation of the thin palatal mucosa in the midline region; this creates a separate "island" of bone in the midline of the palate. The parasagittal cuts are joined with the interdental cuts in order to perform the three-piece maxillary osteotomy and release the three dentoalveolar segments. If significant torqueing of the anterior maxillary segment is planned, the two parasagittal cuts must be

![](images/4682dc736b6d3f48e557abd58163bb15ffba4657c7274d4f4fd74bcc8bceebd1.jpg)  
Fig. 63.20 Following down-fracture, the maxilla is segmentalized with a rounded-end cutting bur such as a Steiger or 1703 bur by making two parasagittal cuts that join across the midline and connect with the interdental osteotomies

joined across the midline so that there are three dentoalveolar segments and one mid-palatal bony fragment. In two-piece maxillary osteotomy designs, the two parasagittal cuts are joined with one midline interdental cut between the central incisors at the incisive canal. The orthodontic arch wire must be sectioned at the interdental osteotomy sites in order to ensure complete segment mobilization and allow any necessary recounturing in the osteotomy site. Finally, if large interdental bone removal is necessary to close and extraction space, surgical access may be needed from the palate, especially in the midline (Fig. 63.21). In this case, it is recommended that an anterior labial mucoperiosteal pedicle is maintained with a small midline vertical incision to access the ANS (Fig. 63.7). This technique allows for a midline palatal incision and conservative circumdental incisions to access the palatal bone removal. The individual segments are then wired to the final surgical splint. The splint should have some palatal coverage for segmental maxillary surgery, with relief so that pressure is not placed on the palatal vascular pedicle. If bone grafting is required on the palate, for example, with a significant transverse expansion, this must be done before the maxilla is repositioned and stabilized vertically. In contrast, any interdental and/or buttress bone grafting, if necessary, can be performed just before closure of the soft-tissue wounds owing to access from the facial aspect of the maxilla. After splint fixation, the orthodontic arch wire can be luted together with a rapid-curing acrylic or a new orthodontic arch wire can be placed. Some surgeons prefer to leave final splints wired in, as a method of added stability especially in segmental osteotomies when the maxilla has been transversely widened. The length of time the splint is left in place depends upon the magnitude and

![](images/5847080c4c8ad8f4f2496448ddf20b2ba1827f27219aab209a71942af78635cd.jpg)

direction of segmental movement. Typically, splints are left in place for segmental cases for approximately three weeks for smaller movements and up to eight weeks for greater degrees of expansive movements. After splint removal, the patient returned to the orthodontist for fabrication of the appropriate retention devices, replacement of a continuous arch wire, and completion of postsurgical orthodontic treatment.

# 63.4.3.1 Superior Maxillary Repositioning

When considering maxillary impaction surgery, historical descriptions suggest a lateral maxillary wedge ostectomy based upon the amount of the planned superior maxillary movement. However, this should be avoided because it often results in large gaps in the bony interfaces as the maxilla is moved superiorly because the contour of the maxilla is not consistent and has several bends and turns that may result in unpredictable superior movement of the maxilla, with some areas having premature contacts that require reduction and others exhibiting a "telescoping" effect of the bones with desirable overlap [58]. Furthermore, any shifting, tilting, or advancement of the maxilla may further reduce bone-to-bone contact, making premature bony removal unnecessary and potentially deleterious. Instead, sequential bony reduction of premature osseous contacts avoids unnecessary loss of bone and ensures a more predictable final contact between the maxilla and the cranial base (Fig. 63.18). Therefore, the standard horizontal osteotomy is performed, and no bone is removed until the splint is in place with MMF, and the maxillomandibular complex is rotated superiorly, with the condyles seated appropriately, to determine the spe

cific location of the bony interferences. (Figs. 63.15 and 63.16). The areas of bone premature bone contact can now be determined as the maxilla is positioned superiorly, and bone is removed minimally at the contact points to permit the plan superior repositioning based upon the reference landmarks. In many cases, isolated interferences of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus may be managed with the creation of slots, or grooves, in the zygomatic buttress region or anywhere necessary along the lateral maxillary wall (Fig. 63.18). One must be careful that the grooves do not inhibit the free rotational movement of the maxillomandibular complex and cause displacement of the maxilla with condylar malpositioning. This technique is particularly valuable when the maxilla is shifted laterally or torqued in a transverse direction, which would make prediction of a predetermined ostectomy difficult. In most cases of maxillary superior movement, significant bone reduction is required on the superior aspect of the maxilla as well, especially in the posterior regions. This bone reduction can be performed using a rongeur initially followed by a large round, or pineapple-shaped bur while protecting the nasal tissues and descending palatine vessels. If the vessels were not sacrificed previously, they may require ligation at this point if significant bony interferences are present in these areas. Once the maxillary vertical position is ideal based upon the reference points, the maxilla is rigidly fixated, the MMF released, and the occlusion is assessed for accuracy, stability, and repeatability. In its final position, the maxilla must have the preplanned vertical position and occlusion (or A-P position against the mandible), be without a cant, and the TMJs should be passively positioned.

# 63.4.3.2 Anterior Maxillary Repositioning

The traditional standard Le Fort I osteotomy is horizontal and angulation parallel to the maxillary occlusal dentition. However, in an attempt to avoid the long maxillary cuspid root, there may be a tendency to incline the angle of the osteotomy in a superior direction from posterior to anterior into the piriform rim. Such an inclination in the osteotomy design may not coincide with the desired forward maxillary movement, and if the angulation of the left and right sides is not coincident, and asymmetry may be created with the maxillary movement.

For this reason, a variety of straight, stepped, and "Z" osteotomies can be described in the literature and may be individually designed to accommodate the planned maxillary movements [33, 61-63] (Figs. 63.22, 63.23, 63.24, and 63.25). If bone grafting (Fig. 63.26) is planned for stability with a large maxillary advancement, the vertical steps in the osteotomy design, or "Z" osteotomies provide additional, and improved, sites for the placement of bone grafts. In many cases of AP maxillary deficiency, there is an additional component of midface, or malar hypoplasia, and various osteotomy designs have been advocated for simultaneous attempts to advance the zygomatic bone

and or in for orbital rim (e.g., high Le Fort I, or Le Fort II, or modified Le Fort III, zygomatic osteotomies, zygomatic arch osteotomies, quadrangular osteotomies, or double-step osteotomies of the maxilla and in for orbital rim). Unfortunately, many of these techniques fail to improve the malar hypoplasia and result in a worsening of the facial profile, such that a "dish-face" deformity may result [26]. Perhaps the most predictable method by which to address malar hypoplasia is to consider prosthetic malar augmentation using stock or custom implants (e.g., high-molecular-weight porous polyethylene or sili

cone). This option may be used at the time of the Le Fort advancement surgery or in a delayed fashion to determine whether the maxillary surgery itself had a significant enough positive impact on the malar hypoplasia to result in the patient declining any further surgery for aesthetic reasons. These prosthetic implants may also be placed in the paranasal regions for augmentation in this area, if necessary. Finally, severe maxillary hypoplasia, due to cleft lip and palate or other syndrome or etiology, may be managed with distraction osteogenesis, which is covered elsewhere in this text.

# 63.4.3.3Inferior Maxillary Repositioning

Inferior repositioning of the maxilla presents a unique challenge in orthognathic surgery owing to the increased relapse potential resulting from impingement of the maxilla on the pterygomandibular sling of the medial pterygoid and masseter muscles [66-69]. In the pre-rigid fixation era, various techniques were recommended for additional stabilization and fixation of the maxilla after inferior repositioning, including skeletal suspension wires, (circumzygomatic, frontozygomatic suture, and piriform rim wiring), interosseous wires, Steinmann pins, Wessberg pins, and RAPs, until the introduction of rigid fixation plates and screws in the United States in the early 1980s [32, 62, 64, 70-72]. Whereas bone grafting has been employed for stabilization of the inferiorly repositioned maxilla, it may not be required if a series of slanted Z or step osteotomies are used [61, 64, 65, 74] (Fig. 63.22). The specific angulations of these osteotomies are planned so that the maxilla will slide down the incline plane of the cuts, maintaining bone contact as it is repositioned anteriorly and inferiorly. Based upon the inclination of the anterior portion and the posterior portion of the osteotomies, the maxilla may be positioned more anteriorly or more inferiorly (Figs. 63.22, 63.23, and 63.24). Most surgeons use bone grafts and rigid fixation to stabilize the maxilla that has been inferiorly repositioned with a resultant lack of bone-to-bone contact. Bone grafts may be secured with bone screws or plates if sufficient bone is available or with stainless steel wires (Fig.63.26). Patients who are candidates for inferior maxillary repositioning often have paper-thin maxillary bone due to the vertical skeletal growth pattern or lack of occlusal forces. Although rigid internal fixation with plates and screws is the stabilization method of choice, occasionally insufficient bone is available adjacent to the osteotomy sites. In these cases, the RAP system can be a useful alternative. The application of this system has been described elsewhere [64].

# 63.4.3.4Posterior Maxillary Repositioning

Posteriorly repositioning, or setback, of the maxilla must be considered carefully because there will be a resultant loss of upper lip support as well as paranasal osseous support for the overlying soft tissue. At the pterygomaxillary disjunction of the Le Fort osteotomy, bone must be removed either from the pterygoid plates (with great caution) or the maxillary tuberosity, which extends into the alveolar process. An alternative is to intentionally direct the osteotomy through the maxillary tuberosity or alveolus just posterior to the second molar to ensure a predictable osteotomy and guide the position where the bone will be removed [74, 75]. Also, this technique will leave tuberosity bone attached to the pterygoid plates, which may then be more safely removed. A possible complication of this technique is damage to the greater palatine artery distal to its anasto

Fig. 63.27 Bone plating encompasses a wide variety of plates and screws, ranging from very rigid to very malleable. Generally,  $0.6\mathrm{mm}$  profile plates with  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  screws are used in the piriform rims and buttresses

mosis with the lesser palatine vessel. Alternatively, maxillary horizontal excess may also be addressed with anterior maxillary osteotomy, especially when extractions are planned, or if edentulous sites are present; this is discussed later in this chapter.

# 63.5 Rigid Internal Fixation for Maxillary Osteotomy

Rigid internal fixation with bone plates and screws is the current standard for maxillary stabilization after Le Fort surgery. Although this technique has eliminated many of the concerns with postoperative stability and relapse from wire fixation or no fixation, the technique is less forgiving than wire fixation and, therefore, precise intraoperative positioning is even more critical. A wide variety of plating systems and sizes are available, and there is no consensus on the number of plates and screws necessary or the thickness of the plates or diameter of the screws required for stable fixation. Typical midface plating sets have 1.5- and  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  plates and screws that work well for maxillary fixation and most surgeons prefer to use four  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  plates in the pillar regions of the midface at the piriform rim and zygomaticomaxillary buttress regions. (Figure 63.27) Preformed plates are available with specific bands for specific maxillary advancements and computer planning allows fabrication of customized fixation devices. Although resorbable plates and screws are available for midface applications, most surgeons do not use these on a routine basis and reserve these for the pediatric age group, when indicated. The use of rigid internal fixation for

Fig. 63.28 Labial pedicle for anterior maxillary osteotomy; the palate is flapped open

maxillary surgery has also decreased the need for adjunctive bone grafting for large maxillary advancements and has essentially eliminated the need for skeletal suspension wiring techniques, because relapse is no longer a significant concern with the current fixation techniques. The use of semi-rigid fixation continues to be considered by some surgeons. This would involve rigid fixation of the piriform buttress but the fixation of the zygomatic buttress area with a wire that allows for better control of the final occlusion with postoperative elastics.

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, custom and patient-specific fixation devices and implants have been shown to eliminate the need for positioning guides and splints and now have a proven track record of accuracy, efficiency, and safety.

# 63.6 Specific Procedures

# 63.6.1 Anterior Maxillary Osteotomy

Numerous techniques have been advocated to perform the anterior maxillary osteotomy and the three main options involve the use of one of three vascular pedicles: labial (Fig. 63.28), palatal (Fig. 63.29), and a combination of these with vertical incisions in both (Fig. 63.30). The anterior segmental maxillary osteotomy can be successfully and, when done properly with attention to detail and respect for the hard and soft tissues, generally has few complications. However, if there is a compromise of the vascular pedicle to the anterior maxillary segment, the complications can range from minor periodontal defects, which can be devastating in the aes

thetic zone, to loss of teeth, bone, or the entire anterior maxillary segment due to avascular necrosis. Anterior maxillary osteotomies are generally used to treat horizontal maxillary excess when the posterior occlusion is ideal or if the posterior occlusion can be corrected with mandibular surgery. Commonly, anterior maxillary osteotomy, with simultaneous premolar extractions, is used for bimaxillary protrusion in which both the anterior maxilla and the anterior mandible are to be retracted

![](images/25d4d66bd549b77e26986cb892ca32890bca7f8f3debae3e1b01a03ea52ffeb3.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 63.31 Anterior maxillary osteotomy with first premolars extracted corrects maxillary excess, bimaxillary protrusion, and anterior open bite

(  $\square$  Fig. 63.31). These procedures can also be used for correction of an anterior open bite occlusal relationship. On occasion, an anterior maxillary osteotomy may be combined with a mandibular advancement and anterior mandibular segmental osteotomy in cases planned for correction of a severe curve of Spee. The specific surgical sequence must be considered carefully when both jaws are involved because the surgical procedures must be done systematically so that the surgeon does not lose orientation. There are two possible scenarios: (1) the posterior occlusion will not change because the posterior maxillary and mandibular teeth need not be moved or (2) mandibular surgery will be performed to correct the posterior occlusion. This is a critical difference because, if the posterior occlusion is not going to be changed by surgery the models must be mounted in centric occlusion not centric relation. If the posterior occlusion will be altered by mandibular surgery, then a new centric relation will be established by the surgery and PSS can be done as usual. In the first scenario, the anterior maxilla is cut and positioned to the best relationship against the uncut mandible in centric occlusion and set against the posterior maxilla, and a splint is constructed. If one is considering TMS in the second scenario, and if mandibular surgery is planned, two mandibular models are mounted, one mandibular model is cut, and the other is left intact to preserve the intermediate phase and fabricate the intermediate splint. Then, the anterior maxilla and the mandible models are cut and repositioned to the final occlusal position and a final splint is fabricated. The cut maxilla can then be articulated with the uncut mandible to establish the intermediate position, and a second (intermediate) splint is made.

Such complex traditional model surgery steps have been made easier with CASS. Typically, the final splint will be wired to the maxilla for a postoperative period, so there must be a separate intermediate splint that articulates with the final splint and the mandibular teeth (a splint within a splint technique). Particularly with segmental surgery, PSS should replicate the actual surgery to provide a clear understanding of the three-dimensional movements necessary to execute the surgical procedure. Measurements and reference marks should be made at the level of the interproximal spaces and the root tips, correlated to the radiographs including CT scans to determine precise root position. Also, reference marks should be made on the palate at the root tips and the maxillary midline. If maxillary widening is planned, transpalatal reference marks should also be used. The use of intermediate splints in segmental cases is a little different from their use in total arch cases because the posterior maxilla is not mobilized, the anterior maxillary positioning is more difficult to determine precisely. For example, the anterior maxilla can fit into the splint and appear ideal until the mandible is rotated into occlusion, and if the mandible does not fit ideally, it is possible that the anterior maxilla might be rotated or tipped superiorly or inferiorly within the splint, and must be adjusted before fixation. For this reason, the mandible should not be wired into MMF but left to freely rotate into the maxillary splint. Also, at surgery, if the mandible is held into MMF during the fixation process for the anterior maxilla, it is possible that the condyles have been pulled out of the fossae resulting in an immediate postoperative malocclusion (anterior open bite). Therefore, the splint must be ligated to the posterior maxilla first, and then the anterior maxilla is brought into the splint and ligated. If the mandible rotates freely into the desired occlusion, then the maxilla is in the correct position, and rigid fixation may be applied. Next, if mandibular surgery is planned it can be initiated at this time.

In cases of segmental maxillary surgery, the choice of surgical technique depends upon the surgical access and the areas that will be most difficult to visualize intraoperatively. For example, in cases of open bite in which no teeth are to be extracted, the anterior segment will be rotated clockwise downward after interdental osteotomies. Access to the interdental area, the midline of the palate, and the ANS is not as critical as it is with other surgical movements. This procedure can be done with a circumventibular incision, or with bilateral horizontal incisions, in the canine-molar regions and a vertical incision in the midline between the central incisors. Conversely, if first premolars are to be extracted or are planned to be extracted, and the anterior maxilla is planned for retraction, access to the mid-palatal area is essential. The original description of the Wunderer technique, in which a transverse palatal incision allows the palatal soft tissue be elevated posteriorly, provides excellent access to the hard palate, but care must be taken to

preserve the labial soft tissue pedicle with segmental maxillary surgery [16]. However, if superior repositioning of the anterior maxillary segment is planned, access to the junction of the ANS and the nasal septum is limited and a vertical incision may be made over the ANS, but because this labial flap represents the complete blood supply to the anterior maxilla, it is not recommended routinely. An option for most anterior maxillary osteotomies is a "hybrid" procedure that avoids many of the potential complications of the segmental surgery and allows adequate access to all regions (Fig. 63.30). The labial incisions are made laterally with a vertical midline incision to permit access to the ANS-nasal septum region, however, instead of a full palatal flap (Wunderer). Circumdental incisions are made around the necks of the teeth on either side of the interdental osteotomies with a midline incision is made over the mid-palatal suture with a small anterior "Y" if necessary. The "Y" should be anterior to the interdental bone cut and be as conservative as possible.

Fixation of anterior maxillary osteotomies is as varied as the surgical techniques [76]. Orthodontic arch wires and cast splints represent two of the extremes in techniques used for fixation. Orthodontic arch wires and cast splints represent the two extremes for fixation; however, orthodontic appliances are the simplest and easiest to use, at least as part of the fixation scheme and supplemental fixation may be required. An occlusal splint with a skeletal suspension wire from the anterior nasal spine is helpful in such cases, especially if there is any significant tension on the free maxillary segment. Intraosseous wires or smaller plates and screws can be carefully used to fixate the segment, perhaps in the 1.0- to  $1.5\mathrm{-mm}$  range rather than  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  plates and screws used for standard Le Fort surgery. Although Erich arch bars have been used for additional fixation and in certain cases may be appropriate, a lower level of precision can be expected owing to torque of the maxillary segment from circumdental wires. The most

critical factor with segmental maxillary surgery is that at the time of surgery, the anterior maxilla must be mobile enough that it does not require any significant pressure to place it into the desired final position. Then, fixation can then be applied by one of the many methods discussed that will hold the segment in the proper position throughout the healing period and MMF is not commonly used.

# 63.6.1.1Posterior Maxillary Osteotomy

The posterior maxillary osteotomy (PMO) and its modifications [17, 20, 77-82] are rarely indicated today, because open bite correction or transverse maxillary expansion are performed more easily and predictably with Le Fort I surgery. PMO is usually indicated as a pre-prosthetic procedure to correct hyper-eruption of a posterior maxillary dentoalveolar segment. Another indication for these procedures can be for correction of posterior open bites caused ankylosis of teeth in the posterior segment that are resistant to orthodontic forces. PMO can be used to reposition entire segments of the occlusion in such cases. Meticulous surgical planning is essential to visualize the three-dimensional movements and in anticipating osseous interference of the individual segments. Cone Beam or other CT or periapical radiographs are useful for evaluating interdental and subapical osteotomy sites. Surgical planning should be done with the maxillomandibular relationship in centric occlusion, not centric relation, unless the mandible is also planned for surgery. A high palatal vault allows access to palatal osteotomy via a trans-antral approach beneath the nasal floor. The soft tissue incision is made horizontally in the maxillary buccal vestibule from the anticipated anterior interdental osteotomy site to the second molar region (Fig. 63.32a. A mucoperiosteal dissection beneath the superior aspect of the incision exposes the lateral maxilla, and the pterygomaxillary region is exposed via soft tissue retracted in a tunneling technique. At the anterior interdental osteot

omy site, conservative tunneling of the periosteum exposes the full vertical extent of the dentoalveolar segments. After retraction of the soft tissue with skin hooks and right-angle retractors, the facial interdental osteotomy can be outlined with a narrow fissure bur, or it can be directly completed with a thin, cement-spatula osteotome. An alternative soft tissue flap design can add a vertical releasing incision from the horizontal incision inferiorly through the gingiva at the mesial line angle of the canine  
(63.32b). A horizontal osteotomy is performed approximately  $5\mathrm{mm}$  above the roots of the teeth and joined with the anterior interdental osteotomy  
(63.32a). The vertical interdental osteotomy should be completed first so that the segment is not mobile while using interdental osteotomes. The palatal osteotomy is accomplished with a small, sharp, curved osteotome directed at the juncture of the vertical alveolus and horizontal palatal shelf. The surgeon places a finger in the palatal mucosa to detect complete osseous sectioning while minimizing palatal mucosal trauma  
(63.33a, b). In patients with high palatal vaults, the trans-antral osteotomy is completed along the entire AP extent of the planned palatal osteotomy  
(  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 63.33b), except in the area of the descending palatal neurovascular bundle. Next, the pterygomaxillary junction is separated with a curved osteotome using a technique similar to that for a total maxillary osteotomy. In contrast, patients with a low, flat palatal vault can be osteotomized more easily through the nasal floor  
$(\square$  Fig.63.33c). The posterior dentoalveolar segment is downfractured using digital pressure and any osseous

interference may be removed using a bur or rongeur. Any previously inaccessible medial and posterior walls of the mobile segment are addressed now after mobilization and displacement of the posterior segment. Bone removal at the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone and mobilization should continue until the segment can be repositioned with minimal soft-tissue tension or bony interferences (Fig. 63.34). Final contouring is accomplished while holding the splint in the stable portion of the maxilla anteriorly, and then the mandible is rotated into the correct occlusal position to ensure that no distortion of the splint has occurred. A splint modification should be considered that results in a slightly thicker splint and trans-palatal acrylic or wire reinforcement will add rigidity to prevent inadvertent distortion of the posterior extension of the splint and to support the osseous segments postsurgically. Once the segments are ligated to the splint, the repositioned posterior maxillary segment may be fixated with interosseous wire, suspension wire, stable pin fixation, or bone plates and screws. Bone grafts are rarely required unless down-grafting to gain vertical height of the alveolar segment, and additional stability may be obtained by luting the orthodontic arch wire back together with quick-curing acrylic or by placing a rectangular arch wire across the interdental osteotomy site; MMF is usually not required. If the posterior segment is repositioned laterally or medially to a significant degree, additional access may be necessary; this can be performed via a midline palatal incision with palatal tissue reflected laterally (Fig. 63.35). Meticulous surgical dissection can ensure maintenance of the integrity of the palatine

If the alveolus is short and the palatal vault is flat or shallow, the osteotomy usually traverses the medial sinus wall and passes through the floor of the nose (Fig. 63.33c).

# 63.6.1.2Total Maxillary Alveolar Osteotomy

The TMAO was designed to avoid some of the problems seen with the Le Fort I downfracture technique. However, the hypothesized advantages, including improved nasal airway, improved stability due to better bony contact, improved ability to widen the maxilla, and better maxillary profusion, have not been realized [83-89]. Throughout the past several decades, there has been very little need to consider this surgical option over the traditional standard Le Fort osteotomy, considering the increased potential risks, complications, and morbidity of the TMAO.

# 63.7 Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (SARPE)

# 63.7.1History

The concept of maxillary transverse width discrepancy correction orthodontically originated in the United States in 1860 by G. H. Angell which was reported in Dental Cosmos [90], where he described a widening of the maxillary dental arch by opening the mid-palatal suture. The use of this technique was abandoned by American practitioners by the early 1900s, until Haas reintroduced the concept in 1961 with rapid palatal expansion (RPE, also referred to as rapid maxillary expansion, RME), appliances that effectively corrected arch width discrepancies [91]. In growing children, nonsurgical RPE results in fairly predictable opening of the mid-palatal suture with bony expansion, but in adults, stability of RPE has been questioned and potentially results in dental tipping and periodontal defects rather than true bony expansion. Several authors including Timms and Moss [92], Haas [91, 93], have shown orthodontic RPE to result in alveolar bending, periodontal membrane compression, lateral tooth displacement, and tooth extrusion [93]. For those reasons, Haas advocated overexpansion to allow for some degree of relapse; however, even with  $50\%$  overexpansion, nonsurgical RPE has been associated with significant relapse and subsequent failure in the skeletal immature adult patient, although orthopedic RPE is relatively successful and stable in children and adolescents who have not yet experienced closure of the mid-palatal suture. Although, historically, the mid-palatal suture was thought to be the area of resistance to expansion, Isaacson and Ingram [94] have shown that the major site of resistance is not the mid-palatal suture, but all of the remaining maxillary articulations. Lines [95] and Bell and Epker [96]

demonstrated that increased facial skeletal resistance to expansion was located at the zygomaticotemporal, zygomaticofrontal, and zygomaticomaxillary sutures, whereas Wertz [97] hypothesized that the resistance was attributable to the zygomatic arches. This controversy regarding the specific areas of resistance in the midfacial skeleton stimulated the development of a variety of maxillary osteotomy designs to expand the maxilla in conjunction with orthodontic appliances. Lehman and coworkers [98] demonstrated that there was improved expansion with surgery and the use of an RPE orthopedic appliance. Kennedy and colleagues [99] reported a significant increase in the amount of lateral osseous movement possible in animals that underwent surgical osteotomies prior to orthodontic RPE. Whereas the results reported in the literature varied with the specific technique used as well as the timing of orthopedic expansion device activation, the majority of studies show that surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion or surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARME or SARPE), is more stable than orthodontic expansion alone. SARPE is one of the earliest forms of distraction osteogenesis of the maxilla used to widen the maxilla in the transverse plane. The benefits of its user gradual callous distraction that allows the soft tissue to accommodate the bony movements thereby resulting in improved long-term stability. The role of surgery with RPE is to release the areas of resistance in the maxilla before orthopedic RPE. Whether transverse maxillary expansion will be performed alone or in conjunction with surgery will depend on the patient's age, the magnitude of expansion required (if greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  is required, a SARPE may be indicated), and the condition of the mid-palatal suture and will not be based solely upon the maxillomandibular relation. Lines [95] found SARPE to be extremely valuable in young patients (growing children) exhibiting maxillary collapse, maxillary retrusion, and pseudo-class III malocclusions. When maxillary expansion and total maxillary osteotomy are required, two treatment regimens are possible: (1) SARPE followed by a one-piece maxillary osteotomy at a later date or (2) two-piece (or multiple-piece) maxillary osteotomy in one procedure. Several factors must be considered when determining which method is preferable for each individual patient.

# 63.7.2 SARPE Versus Multiple-Piece Maxillary Osteotomy

There is controversy regarding the relative risks and benefits of SARPE followed by Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy in two separate, sequential procedures as opposed to a single-stage vs. multiple-piece maxillary

osteotomy (MPMO); of the many factors involved in each of these two approaches, only the issue of transverse stability has been studied extensively. The vast majority of the data supports the fact that the transverse stability of SARPE far exceeds MPMO [100-107]. It should be mentioned that the poorest results reported for SARPE are nearly as unstable as those reported for MPMO; however, the surgical technique is not described [108]. In general, SARPE will increase total arch length, permitting extraction-free orthodontic leveling and aligning and allowing a greater degree of transverse expansion with lower morbidity than segmental surgery. It has been suggested that vertical and horizontal repositioning of the maxilla are better managed in a single-stage procedure with segmental maxillary surgery [109], and although no data to substantiate or refute this suggestion has been offered, typically when SARPE is performed before therapy, the maxillary arch can be orthodontically leveled and aligned within the basal bone without extrusion of teeth, which is then followed by a one-piece maxillary osteotomy to correct vertical and horizontal discrepancies. The main reason for this preference is that segmental surgery has a much higher incidence of both minor and major complications than SARPE and one-piece maxillary surgery, and also segmental surgery often requires premolar extractions that add another surgical procedure and additional morbidity and potential complications [54, 110]. In addition surgical splints must be left in the mouth postoperatively for several weeks after segmental surgery, thereby increasing postoperative discomfort and negatively affecting the performance of adequate oral hygiene. Another factor to consider is the location of the expansion—while MPMO offers expansion in the posterior segments, SARPE offers midline and anterior expansion allowing the orthodontists to create a really wide and round ideal maxillary arch. Finally issues of cost, not only from a financial standpoint but also including time off from work or school as well as psychological impact, must be taken into consideration [111]. Therefore, SARPE followed by Le Fort I single-piece osteotomy is used most often, and the use of multi-segment maxillary surgery is reserved for two specific case scenarios. The first scenario involves cases in which there are different occlusal planes in the maxilla that are not amenable to correction solely with a SARPE and cannot be adequately addressed with orthodontic leveling and aligning with is within a reasonable time period. But, as mentioned earlier, with SARPE, the creation of a large midline diastema between the maxillary central incisors and the two hemi-maxillae allows considerable orthodontic leveling options without tooth extrusion so that these cases requiring segmental surgery to correct the variable

maxillary occlusal planes are not common. The second scenario requiring segmental surgery includes the patient who has undergone orthodontic therapy for months or years before referral for a surgical option and the dentition has reached a maximum limit of movement, possibly with root resorption, which would make a single-stage segmental maxillary procedure more desirable.

# 63.7.3 SARPE Surgical Technique

It should be mentioned that a variety of techniques exist for the SARPE procedure based upon where the surgeon and orthodontist believe that the major points of resistance to expansion exist. In addition, some limited osteotomy design SARPE surgeries may be performed in the outpatient setting using intravenous sedation,

b-d, Division of the hemimaxillae is accomplished by inserting an osteotome in the midline

although if the SARPE is performed as a standard Le Fort I two-piece osteotomy without downfracture, an operating room setting and endotracheal intubation may be preferred. A typical SARPE surgery begins with local anesthesia and bilateral mucoperiosteal incisions that extend from the piriform rim to zygomatic buttress region in the area of the maxillary first molar (Fig. 63.36a). Bilateral osteotomies are then performed from the piriform rims to low in the pterygomaxillary junction (Fig. 63.36a). A simple linear A-P osteotomy from piriform rim to pterygomaxillary junction is recommended for the SARPE.

More complicated designs [109, TorB, 112] appear to offer advantages in theory and on paper, but in fact, are not clinically relevant when applied to three-dimensional geometric structures such as the maxilla and the movements realized with the procedure. A sloped variation of the osteotomy of the lateral maxillary wall [111] is based upon the expectation that as the maxilla is expanded it will "ride down" this slope laterally and inferiorly. This concept appears valid in a two-dimensional drawing, however, in three dimensions, if the osteotomy is made flat from lateral to medial, as expansion occurs, the bone at the piriform region slides laterally over the flat surface lateral to it and the bone of the buttress region slides laterally over the flat surface lateral to this area. Therefore, if the lateral maxillary wall cuts are straight and horizontal, perpendicular to the midsagittal plane, from lateral to medial, the angulation of the cut from anterior to posterior does not affect the vertical position of the segments as they are expanded. As a result, a

![](images/d07e75df53384f87c1534a6a9f6410b081a3d14341ef539a00ff8882453b1dcb.jpg)  
Fig. 63.37 Surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion. Expansion device is turned to separate the hemimaxillae

standard horizontal osteotomy may be used for the SARPE procedure. Next osteotomies are made in the anterior  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  of the lateral nasal walls, because this is the thickest portion of the anterior maxillary wall. Separation of the hemi-maxillae is performed by driving a thin spatula osteotome between the central incisors on the alveolus in the midline and parallel to the palate posteriorly for approximately  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  (Fig. 63.36b, c, and d).

The expansion device is turned three or four activations (1/4 mm each activation, although some devices are 0.2 mm/activation) until separation is noted between the central incisor teeth (Fig. 63.37). Both segments are mobilized until equal mobility is seen bilaterally in each hemi-maxillary segment. Some authors recommend a subtotal Le Fort I osteotomy with a horizontal osteotomy, vertical midline osteotomy, and pterygoid and septal nasal separation [111, 112]. Shetty demonstrated, with a photo-elastic model, that the midpalatal and pterygomaxillary articulations were the primary anatomic sites of resistance to expansion forces [113]. This study used only incomplete cuts of the lateral maxillary wall, from the second bicuspid to second molar. It is unclear whether these findings would be as significant with complete cuts from the piriform to the pterygomaxillary fissure. Need for separation of the pterygomaxillary junction is, therefore, a point of debate. Several studies have shown minimal relapse without pterygomaxillary disjunction and, therefore, do not advocate a pterygoid osteotomy for improved stability [100, 104]. However, a reasonable argument for separation is that potential complications can be minimized since pterygoid separation will reduce forces transmitted to the skull base upon expansion [112]. Of course, additional sutural release will obviously contribute to improved segment mobility with a SARPE, and the potential morbidity, although significant, is typically uncommon.

In addition, nasal septal separation from the nasal crest of the maxilla will avoid postoperative nasal septal deviation because the septum may remain attached to one of the two maxillary segments. Also, two sources of potential hemorrhage, via manipulation of the pterygomaxillary junction and separation of the nasal septum from the nasal crest of the maxilla, should be avoided if this procedure is performed as an office-based procedure or on an outpatient basis under intravenous sedation.

As with distraction osteogenesis, a latency period after the SARPE procedure of approximately 5 days should be used to allow some soft tissue healing and the formation of a fibro-vascular bridge to support future bone formation in the distraction gap. The activation period can begin after 5 days and the expansion appliance is activated, or turned with a special "key," accord

Fig. 63.38 Unilateral surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion. a The osteotomy is driven to the midpalatal suture. b The horizontal osteotomy is completed in the same manner as the bilateral osteotomy

ing to specific instructions (usually a rate and rhythm of twice-daily activations of  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  each turn), until the desired expansion is achieved based upon the orthodontic requirements. After completion of the distraction phase, a consolidation period should be allowed for bony healing with the device locked in place to prevent counterclockwise rotation, using a stainless-steel wire through the activation device or composite resin, or some other material, placed to prevent device deactivation. This is usually held in place for a period of 8-12 weeks after completion of bony movement. An alternative use of SARPE is unilateral SARPE that can be achieved by completing a vertical interdental osteotomy between the appropriate teeth and connecting that cut with a unilateral horizontal osteotomy extending posteriorly to the pterygomaxillary junction. If the entire hemi-maxilla is to be mobilized, the surgical procedure is performed the same as described for a standard bilateral SARPE case, with the horizontal Le Fort osteotomy performed on one side only. If a widening of an isolated portion of one posterior hemimaxilla is planned, the interdental osteotomy must be completed to the midline palatal suture (Fig. 63.38a, b). The posterior segment is mobilized (Fig. 63.39a) and expanded in the same manner as for the bilateral SARPE procedure (Fig. 63.39b). The long-term effects on nasal airway resistance after the SARPE procedure are unknown,

although some studies have shown increased nasal airflow whereas others have not shown changes in nasal airflow in the long-term follow-up [114, 115].

While most orthodontists have traditionally used tooth-borne devices such as a Hyrax palatal expander appliance, this has been implicated in teeth tipping and device activation difficulties for the patients as well as providers.

Since 2005, bone-borne non-screw self-supported self-retaining palatal expander called the Rotterdam distractor (KLS Martin group, Jacksonville, FL) has been in clinical use. Bone-borne distractors utilize direct bone anchorage creating true orthopedic expansion of the osteotomized maxilla (Fig. 63.40). The distractor is designed like a car jack with self-retaining nails that engage the palatal vault. The activating arm is low profile and is easy to use by the patient.

Aziz and colleagues reported using this device in a series of patients explaining their protocol, and its advantages [116].

Mini-screw-assisted rapid palatal expanders (MARPE) have gained popularity in the recent years as an alternate to tooth-borne skeletal expansion devices. The MARPE appliances consist of a central expansion jackscrew and four attached arms soldered to orthodontic bands that anchor teeth. Four mini-screws attach the expansion jack bicortically to the palatal and nasal floor.

Fig. 63.40 A bone-borne maxillary expander

These screws bear the anchorage and absorb the forces of expansion without transmitting them on to the teeth. The screws are recommended to be placed as posteriorly as possible on the palate to maximize the orthopedic expansive forces to the pterygoid plates. Studies that examined palatal expansion with this device utilized superimposed CBCTs showed that significant skeletal

expansion was achieved in patients with transverse maxillary deficiency [117-119].

# 63.7.4Zygomatic Osteotomy and Modified Le Fort Osteotomies

As discussed in the section on anterior maxillary repositioning, patients with severe midface deficiency may benefit from enhancement of the prominence of the zygoma region. From an aesthetic standpoint, prominent malar prominences are desirable and with a growing public awareness of surgical capabilities, there is an increasing demand for cosmetic procedures designed to enhance the region of the face. Numerous methods have been developed to augment the malar eminences and the paranasal regions, mostly using bone grafts or synthetic implants. Autologous grafts from the ramus, chin, or coronoid process are disappointing because of resorption and the donor site morbidity. Allogeneic transplants such as lyophilized cartilage have been used with some success but are prone to migration,

inflammation, and resorption. At the present time, the preferred method for malar augmentation is the use of alloplastic implants, most commonly with high-molecular-weight porous polyethylene or silicone. If alloplasts are contraindicated or declined by the patient, the zygomatic osteotomy may be a useful alternative. The zygomatic osteotomy is approached through an

intraoral incision and a reciprocating saw is used to create a parasagittal osteotomy through the zygoma immediately adjacent to the root of the zygoma (Fig. 63.41a, b). This is performed as close to the lateral orbital rim as possible and the zygoma is outfractured gently so that an interpositional material can be placed in the gap to hold the zygoma in a lateral

position. The interpositional material (bone graft or synthetic implant) can be stabilized in a traditional fashion in this area. This technique provides lateral zygomatic projection, but it does not provide anterior projection, unless the interpositional material is fashioned in such a way to project the zygoma in a forward position (Fig. 63.41c).

The wide range and variety of maxillary osteotomies that extend the traditional Le Fort I procedure have been referred to by many names including modified Le Fort I, II, III, high Le Fort I, pyramidal, middle, intermediary, quadrangular, and maxillary-malar-infraorbital osteotomies (Fig. 63.42a-c). These techniques or modifications to these procedures have been described previously [120]; however, this group of osteotomies is limited clinically with regard to expansion, rotation, and torque or yaw movements. Therefore, with the clinical success of silicone, porous polyethylene, and other synthetic implants for the malar, infraorbital, lateral orbital, and paranasal regions, these more invasive and potentially hazardous osteotomy designs are rarely used clinically in non-syndromic patients (Fig. 63.43a-c).

# Conclusion

Maxillary orthognathic surgery continues to evolve. Although much of the execution of maxillary osteotomy is done in a similar manner to how it has been done for decades. The evolution has been in planning, positioning, and fixation. This evolution in recent decades has been primarily technological. There have been benefits in both workflow and patient outcomes.

Advancement in the computerized planning of orthognathic surgery, the availability of patient-specific cutting guides and fixation devices, and refinement of techniques has allowed correction of dentofacial deformities of the maxilla to be performed with a greater attention to detail and increased precision.
