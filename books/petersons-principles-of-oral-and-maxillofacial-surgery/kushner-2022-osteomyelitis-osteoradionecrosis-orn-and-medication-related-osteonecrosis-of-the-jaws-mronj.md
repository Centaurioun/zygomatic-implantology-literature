# 41.1 Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is defined as inflammation of the bone marrow with a tendency to progression. This disease process also involves the adjacent cortical plates and periosteal tissues. Osteomyelitis still presents as a devastating condition for our patients and a conundrum for treating surgeons.

In the pre-antibiotics era, osteomyelitis of the mandible was not uncommon. With the advent of antibiotics, osteomyelitis became a rare disease. In recent years, antibiotic resistance is becoming more prevalent and we are seeing an increase in osteomyelitis. Despite modern therapy it can still remain a major source of morbidity to the patient, requiring multiple surgeries and resulting in prolonged treatment with loss of teeth and jawbone.

The incidence of osteomyelitis is higher in the mandible due to the dense, poorly vascularized cortical plates and blood supply primarily from the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle, a single source. Osteomyelitis is less common in the maxilla due to the excellent blood supply from multiple feeder vessels. In addition, the maxillary bone is much less dense than mandibular bone.

Diminished host defenses, both local and systemic, can contribute significantly to the emergence and clinical course of the disease. Osteomyelitis has been associated with multiple systemic diseases including diabetes, autoimmune states, malignancy, malnutrition, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Medications such as steroids and chemotherapeutic agents have also been linked to osteomyelitis [1]. Local conditions that adversely affect the blood supply can also predispose the host to a bony infection. Osteopetrosis, bone pathology, and repeated surgeries can alter the blood supply to the area and provide a potential foothold for pathology to set in (Figs. 41.1, 41.2, and 41.3).

# 41.1.1 Pathogenesis

In the maxillofacial region, osteomyelitis primarily occurs as a result of contiguous spread of odontogenic

infections, dentoalveolar surgery and maxillofacial trauma. In adults, the process is initiated by an

introduction of bacteria into the jawbones. This can occur with dental extractions, implant placement, root canal therapy or fractures of the mandible or maxilla. Any dento-alveolar surgical procedure can potentially cause an osteomyelitis. The initial insult results in a bacteria-induced inflammatory process or cascade. In the normal healthy host, this process is self-limiting and is a component of the healing process. Occasionally in the normal host and certainly in the compromised host, there is the potential for this process to progress to the point where it is considered pathologic. With inflammation there is hyperemia and increased blood flow to the affected area. Additional leukocytes are recruited to the area to fight off infection. Pus is formed when there is an overwhelming abundance of bacteria and cellular debris that cannot be eliminated by the body's natural defense mechanisms. When the pus and subsequent inflammatory response occur in the bone marrow, an elevated intramedullary pressure is created which further decreases the blood supply to the area. Pus can travel via Haversian and Volkmann's canals to spread throughout the medullary and cortical bone. Once pus has perforated the cortical plates and collects under the periosteum, the periosteal blood supply is compromised and further aggravates the local condition. If the process continues, pus exits the soft tissues either by intraoral or extraoral fistulas.

# 41.1.2 Microbiology

More than 500 bacterial species have been identified in the mouth [2-4]. The mouth and anus are the different ends of the same alimentary tube and many clinicians consider them the most highly contaminated areas of the human body. Historically, staphylococcal species were considered the major pathogen in osteomyelitis of the jaws. However, with refinements in collections and processing of microbiology specimens, we are able to get a true picture of the disease-causing organisms. With most oral infections, the major pathogenic species are streptococci and anaerobic bacteria. The anaerobes responsible are generally bacteroides or peptostreptococci species. Often the infections are mixed species, growing several oral pathogens on final culture. The clinician must begin empiric antibiotic therapy based on the most likely pathogens. This could include penicillin and metronidazole as dual drug therapy or clindamycin or Unasyn(ampicillin/sulbactam) as a single drug treatment. Definitive antimicrobial therapy should be based on the final culture and sensitivity results for optimal medical management. Also, on rare occasions, viral osteomyelitis has been reported.

# 41.1.3Classification

Over the years, many ways of classifying osteomyelitis have been presented. Currently, there is no universally accepted classification system for osteomyelitis. A rather complex classification system was proposed by Cierny and colleagues [5]. Osteomyelitis was classified as being either suppurative or nonsuppurative by Lew and Waldvogel [6]. This classification was modified by Topazian [7]. Additional authors classified osteomyelitis as being hematogenous or secondary to a contiguous focus of infection [8]. Another system proposed by Hudson essentially divided the presentation of osteomyelitis into acute and chronic forms [9]. The classification system offered by Hudson is the most advantageous to the clinician. Osteomyelitis is classified into acute and chronic forms based on the presence of the disease for a 1-month duration.

Acute osteomyelitis:

(a) Contiguous focus  
(b) Progressive  
(c) Hematogenous

Chronic osteomyelitis:

(a) Recurrent multifocal  
(b) Garre's (Figs. 41.4, 41.5, 41.6, 41.7, and 41.8)  
(c) Suppurative or nonsuppurative  
(d) Sclerosing

# 41.1.4Clinical Presentation

Very often, as with any infection, the patient with osteomyelitis of the maxillofacial region will present with classic symptoms:

Pain  
- Swelling and erythema of overlying tissues  
Adenopathy  
Fever  
Paresthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve with mandibular osteomyelitis  
Trismus  
Malaise  
Fistulas

The pain in osteomyelitis is often described as a deep and boring pain, which is often out of proportion to the clinical picture. In acute osteomyelitis it is very common to see swelling and erythema of the overlying tissues, which are indicative of the cellulitic phase of the inflammatory process of the underlying bone. Fever often accompanies acute osteomyelitis, whereas it is relatively rare in chronic osteomyelitis. Paresthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve is a classic sign of a pressure on the

inferior alveolar nerve from the inflammatory process within the medullary bone of the mandible. Trismus may be present if there is inflammatory response in the

muscles of mastication of the maxillofacial region. The patient commonly has malaise or a feeling of overall illness and fatigue, which would accompany any systemic

infection. Lastly, both intraoral and extraoral fistulas are generally present with the chronic phase of osteomyelitis of the maxillofacial region. Often these patients will have a laboratory work-up as part of their initial examination. In the acute phase of osteomyelitis it is common to see leukocytosis with left shift, common in any acute infection. Leukocytosis is relatively uncommon in chronic phases of osteomyelitis. The patient may also exhibit an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Both the ESR and CRP are very sensitive indicators of inflammation in the body and they are very nonspecific. Therefore, their main use is to follow the clinical progress of the osteomyelitis.

Nearly all patients will have some form of maxillofacial imaging. The orthopantomogram view is indispensable in the initial evaluation of osteomyelitis. This view is easily obtainable in most dental offices and can yield valuable information as to the radiographic changes with osteomyelitis, potential sources of the disease, and predisposing conditions such as fractures and underlying bone disease. One must bear in mind that radiographic images lag behind the clinical presentation since cortical involvement is required for any change to be evident. Therefore, it may take several weeks before the bony changes appear radiographically. Hence, it is possible to see a patient with acute osteomyelitis that has a normal-appearing orthopantomogram. However, one can often see the appearance of "moth-eaten" bone or sequestrum of bone, which is the classic appearance of osteomyelitis.

Computerized tomography (CT) scans have become the standard in evaluating maxillofacial pathology such as osteomyelitis. They provide three-dimensional imaging not available on an orthopantomogram view. The CT scan can give very detailed images as to early cortical erosion of bone in osteomyelitis. One can often see the extent of the lesion and bony sequestrum along with pathologic fractures. CT scanning, like plain films, requires  $30 - 50\%$  demineralization of bone before

changes can be seen, thus presenting an essential delay in diagnosis of osteomyelitis [10]. Cone beam CT scans have become commonplace in the dental office and can provide similar advantages by giving the clinician three-dimensional images of the affected region [11, 12] (Figs. 41.9, 41.10, 41.11, 41.12, 41.13, and 41.14).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally considered more valuable in the evaluation of soft tissue lesions of the maxillofacial region. However, MRI can assist in the early diagnosis of osteomyelitis by loss of the marrow signal before cortical erosion or sequestrum of the bone appears. Thus, MRI may benefit in identifying the earlier stages of osteomyelitis [10].

Nuclear medicine has evolved to aid in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Technetium 99 has been the workhorse of nuclear medicine imaging of the maxillofacial region. The technetium 99 bone scan is very sensitive in highlighting areas of increased bone turnover; however, the scan is not very specific to areas of infection. With the addition of gallium 67 or indium 111 as contrast agents, one can differentiate areas of infection from trauma or postsurgical healing, as these agents specifically bind to white blood cells.

# 41.1.5Treatment

The management of osteomyelitis of the maxillofacial region requires both medical and surgical interventions. In rare cases of infantile osteomyelitis, intravenous antibiotic therapy alone may eradicate the disease. Antibiotic therapy is rarely curative in later-onset cases, and the overwhelming majority of osteomyelitis cases require surgical intervention.

Clearly the first step in the treatment of osteomyelitis is diagnosing the condition correctly. The tentative diagnosis is made from clinical evaluation, radiographic evaluation, and tissue diagnosis. The clinician must be aware that malignancies can mimic the presentation of osteomyelitis and must be kept in the differential diagnosis until ruled out by tissue histopathology. Tissues from the affected site should be sent for Gram stain, cul

ture, sensitivity, and histopathologic evaluations. The clinical response to the treatment of any patient will be compromised unless altered host factors can be optimized. Medical evaluation and management in defining and treating any immunocompromised state is indicated and often helpful. For example, glucose control in a diabetic patient should be stabilized for best response to therapy.

Empiric antibiotic treatment should be started based on Gram stain results of the exudate or the suspected pathogens likely to be involved in the maxillofacial region. Definitive culture and sensitivity reports generally take several days or longer to be obtained but are valuable in guiding the surgeon to the best choice of antibiotics based on the patient's specific causative organisms [13]. Infectious disease consultation may provide the most current antimicrobials and/or regimens.

# 41.1.6Surgical Options

Classic treatment is sequestrectomy and saucerization. The aim is to debride the necrotic or poorly vascularized bony sequestrum in the infected area and improve blood flow. Sequestrectomy involves removing infected and avascular pieces of bone – generally the cortical plates in the infected area. Saucerization involves the removal of the adjacent bony cortices and open packing to permit healing by secondary intention after the infected bone has been removed. Decortication involves removal of the dense, often chronically infected and poorly vascularized bony cortex and placement of the vascular periosteum adjacent to the medullary bone to allow increased blood flow and healing in the affected area. The key element in the above procedures is determined clinically by cutting back to good bleeding bone. Clinical judgment is crucial in these steps but can be aided by preoperative imaging that shows the bony extent of the pathology. It is often necessary to remove teeth adjacent to an area of osteomyelitis. In removing adjacent teeth and bone the clinician must be aware that these surgical procedures may weaken the jaw bone and make it susceptible to pathologic fracture.

Supporting the weakened area with a fixation device (external fixator or reconstruction type plate) and/or placing the patient in maxillomandibular fixation is frequently used to prevent pathologic fracture. Indeed, we have primarily grafted such areas when the sequestrectomy and saucerization have been deemed adequate.

Some authors have proposed adjunctive treatment methods that deliver high doses of antibiotic to the area using antibiotic impregnated beads or wound irrigation systems [14-16]. This therapy works on the premise that high local levels of antibiotics are made available and the overall systemic load is very low, thus reducing the possible side effect and complication rate.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment has also been advocated for the treatment of refractory osteomyelitis. This treatment method works by increasing tissue oxygenation levels that would help fight off any anaerobic bacteria present in these wounds. The widespread

use of HBO treatment of osteomyelitis still remains controversial.

Resection of the jaw bone has traditionally been reserved as a last-ditch effort, generally after smaller debridements have been performed or previous therapy has been unsuccessful or to remove areas involved with pathologic fracture. This resection is generally performed via an extraoral route, and reconstruction can be either immediate or delayed based on the surgeon's preference. Rigid internal fixation has simplified the postoperative course by providing a means for immediate function of the jaws. Advances in technology and rigid technology have allowed 3-D printing of models and plates which allow for extremely precise ablative and reconstructive surgery. The custom milled plates are very precise and require little or no additional bending. The custom milled plates are stronger than traditional plates and are less prone to fracture. In addition, inferior alveolar nerve preservation and immediate reconstructive surgery with bone grafts have shortened the clinical course for our patients [17] (Figs. 41.15, 41.16, 41.17, 41.18, 41.19, 41.20, 41.21, and 41.22).

We believe that early resection and reconstruction shorten the course of treatment. Once the patient

At this point preservation of the mandible is highly unlikely and one should attempt to shorten the course of the disease and treatment (Figs. 41.23, 41.24, 41.25, 41.26, 41.27, 41.28, and 41.29).

# 41.2 Osteoradionecrosis

Radiation therapy is a valuable treatment modality in treating cancer of the maxillofacial region. Radiation therapy can be used alone or as an adjunctive therapy in combination with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy, like any treatment modality, has deleterious side effects, including mucositis and xerostomia. One of the most dreaded complications of radiation therapy is osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Historically, ORN was felt

and hypovascular [18, 19]. In years past, the radiation therapist used orthovoltage therapy and there was a high incidence of ORN. However, the modern radiation therapists use megavoltage, which is felt to be kinder to the bone and soft tissues. In addition, collimation and shielding of tissues in conjunction with careful dental

evaluation preoperatively have greatly decreased the incidence of ORN. The effects of radiation last a lifetime and do not decrease over time. Ideally, the dental team is consulted prior to radiation therapy beginning. A thorough dental exam will identify any teeth that should be extracted prior to radiation therapy. Flouride carriers can be fabricated if there are teeth remaining during radiation therapy. The dentist can review the importance of dental care during and following radiation therapy. The goal is to perform any invasive dental procedure prior to radiation therapy in hopes to decrease the chance of osteoradionecrosis. Unfortunately many times clinically, the dental clearance is not obtained before starting radiation therapy. The dental team is then faced with performing invasive dental procedures in the radiated field which can be a set-up for complications (Figs. 41.30 and 41.31).

ORN is generally caused by trauma to the radiated area, usually by dental extraction, but it can also occur

spontaneously. The clinical picture of ORN is most commonly seen with pain and exposed bone in the maxillofacial region. ORN is more common in the mandible than in the maxilla for reasons described earlier in this chapter. A dosage of radiation above 5000-6000 rads is generally felt to make the mandible susceptible to ORN (Figs. 41.32, 41.33, 41.34, 41.35, 41.36, 41.37, and 41.38).

Radiographically, the appearance on the orthopantomogram or CT scan resembles conventional osteomyelitis with areas of osteolysis and bony sequestrum. Often there is an appearance of moth-eaten bone present on these films. Cone beam CT(CBCT) has become common in dental offices and can provide three-dimensional imaging which can help diagnose osteoradionecrosis.

The treatment of ORN is aimed at removing the nonviable (necrotic) tissue and allowing the body to heal itself. The clinician must always be aware that tissue removed in a prior cancer patient should be sent to

pathology to rule out occult or recurrent malignant disease that is masquerading as a bony infection. Minor debridements of exposed bone may work in most minor cases of ORN. Surgery in the radiated field always has the potential of delayed healing.

There have been additional methods to combat osteoradionecrosis. Treatment with oral pentoxifylline(Trental) and tocopherol (Vitamin E) has proven effective in medically managing early- and even late-stage osteoradionecrosis. The pentoxifylline and Vitamin E clinically combat fibrosis, increase blood flow, and scavenge free radical that are detrimental to healing [20-22]. Addition of Clodronate has also shown promising results in clinical trials [23-25]. Platelet-rich plasma, which is rich in growth factors, has also shown promise when used to debride the necrotic bone of ORN. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) can also be used for delayed healing or ORN in the radiated field. Current therapy calls for augmentation of tissue healing response by the use of HBO. HBO therapy consists of  $100\%$  oxygen delivered in a pressurized manner. Tissues treated with HBO have increased levels of oxygen, which has a

negative effect on bacteria and a positive effect on angiogenesis and increased blood flow to the area. HBO has been used effectively to treat ORN and as an adjunctive treatment with maxillofacial reconstructive procedures such as dental extractions, dental implants, and jaw reconstruction in the radiated patient.

HBO treatment consists of dives or treatment sessions for  $90\mathrm{min}$  based at 2.4 atm of pressure. Twenty to 30 dives are given preoperatively before any surgical intervention is performed. The area of ORN is then debrided and followed with 10 additional HBO treatments. Reconstruction of the maxillofacial region is based on the patient's response to the treatment protocol. HBO treatments are expensive and facilities are often scarce, available only in larger cities with medical centers or academic health science centers. Despite its documented clinical benefits, there still remains some controversy about the effectiveness of HBO therapy [26].

With the addition of microvascular surgery to the surgical armamentarium, there now exists an excellent surgical option in treatment of the patient with ORN. Microvascular surgery (free flaps) allows the surgeon to bring in hard and soft tissues that have their own independent blood supply. The fibula, iliac crest, scapula, and radius are all considered applicable donor sites [27, 28]. The fibula is very popular in maxillofacial reconstruction as the surgeon can bring an excellent length of bone which can be osteotomized and fabricated into a new mandible [29, 30]. There is an excellent skin paddle to provide soft tissue coverage. The microvascular flap is plugged into facial vessels or the carotid artery and jugular vein system for blood supply and drainage. The clinical advantage of microvascular surgery is that the surgeon does not have to rely on a compromised host bed from radiation therapy or a lack of soft tissue, which very often occurs in ablative cancer surgery. In addition, HBO treatments are not necessary with microvascular surgery. Lastly dental implant reconstruction has been used with free tissue transfer techniques and has proven successful in the dental reconstruction of these patients [31]. We now have the capability to restore patients as close as possible to their premorbid status with modern reconstructive techniques. Microvascular free tissue transfer has withstood the test of time and is now commonplace in managing oncologic and other hard and soft tissue defects (Figs. 41.39, 41.40, 41.41, 41.42, 41.43, and 41.44).

# 41.3 Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws

A new pathologic entity was discovered in 2001-2002 when clinicians noticed an increased incidence of exposed alveolar bone and "refractory osteomyelitis" in patients taking medications in a new class of drugs named bisphosphonates. Dental patients had common procedures such as extraction of teeth with postoperative complications of nonhealing, exposed jawbone [32].

![](images/1718d743a31415862c1d3f921c8696cd5d8595fdbdd1e1cbad9817ce3c3bec1e.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 41.44 Postoperative panoramic image of free fibula to the left mandible

Spontaneous exposure of alveolar jawbone was also reported. Bisphosphonates were used to treat bony sequelae of malignant disease such as multiple myeloma and metastatic disease, very typically, breast cancer.

These patients commonly had growing destructive lesions in bone that caused two major problems. Metastatic bony lesions caused the breakdown of bone which release calcium resulting in the hypercalcemia of malignancy. Additionally, the weakened bones are also susceptible to pathologic fracture. Bisphosphonates acted by decreasing bony resorption. Patients who were treated with bisphosphonates had the progression of their bony lesions either halted or slowed. This left patients with less pain, fewer pathologic fractures, and a better quality of life. This was certainly a huge benefit to the medical oncology community and their patients. Bisphosphonate medications can also be used to treat Paget's disease of bone and osteogenesis imperfecta. With the bone stabilizing effects of bisphosphonates documented in cancer patients, clinical application spread into use with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a major public health issue, with osteoporosis causing major quality of life issues with long bone fractures and compression fractures in the spine. Osteoporosis has a huge societal impact on our aging population (Figs. 41.45, 41.46, 41.47, 41.48, 41.49, 41.50, 41.51, and 41.52).

With the excellent response seen by the medical community, the use of bisphosphonates became more common. Patients went about their day-to-day living, which included routine dental care. The dental profession began seeing the complications in bisphosphonate patients after seemingly routine procedures such as extractions and implant placement. The medical and dental clinicians were first alerted to this growing problem in 2003 [32].

The new pathologic entity evolved to the name of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws and used the acronym BRONJ. To establish a diagnosis of

![](images/8a89d277f1680181bd5166f6267e3bf036e0f946a334098e02d81aaa265ed200.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 41.47 Exposed maxillary bone in bisphosphonate patient with poorly fitting maxillary denture. MRONJ diagnosis made

BRONJ, patients must have exposed jawbone for at least 8 weeks, a prior or current history of bisphosphonate treatment, and no history of radiation therapy to the jaws [33, 34].

Bisphosphonates alter normal bone metabolism. Bone is constantly undergoing remodeling via bone resorption and bone deposition. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity and, thus, prevent bone breakdown. Bisphosphonates also affect osteoblast activity, which in turn, secondarily affects osteoclast activity. The combined effect of bisphosphonates significantly alters the normal process of bone deposition and resorption. In addition, recent findings suggest that bisphosphonates also affect soft tissue wound-healing cells [35]. The combined hard and soft tissue healing alterations may lead to the complex process of osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ), which is still not completely understood. In addition, the half-life of this medication is long, often uncertain, but measured in years.

# 41.3.1 List of Bisphosphonates

A. Etidronate (Didronel)  
B. Tiludronate (Skelide)  
C. Pamidronate (Aredia)  
D. Zolendrenate (Zometa, Reclast)  
E. Alendronate (Fosamax)  
F. Risedronate (Actonel)  
G. Ibandronate (Boniva)

Clinicians became aware that medications other than bisphosphonates were linked to osteonecrosis of the jaws. The name of this new disease entity underwent several name changes. ARONJ was the acronym for antiresorptive -induced osteonecrosis of the jaws. DIRONJ was the acronym for drug-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws. Clinicians have settled on calling this new disease entity MRONJ, which is the acronym for medication-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws. The title MRONJ appears to have withstood the test of time and is now well accepted.

# 41.3.2 Medications Linked to Osteonecrosis of the Jaws and their Clinical Indication

Alendronate(Fosamax) osteoporosis  
Risendronate (Actonel) osteoporosis  
- Ibandronate(Boniva) osteoporosis  
Zolendronate (Reclast) osteoporosis  
Pamidronate (Aredia) bone metastatic disease  
Zolendronate (Zometa) bone metastatic disease  
Denosumab (Xgeva) bone metastatic disease  
Denosumab (Prolia) osteoporosis  
Romosozumab(Evenity) osteoporosis  
Sunitinib(Sutent) tyrosine kinase inhibitor  
- Sorafenib (Nexavar) tyrosine kinase inhibitor  
- Bevacizumab (Avastin) humanized monoclonal antibody  
- Sirolimus (Rapamune) mammalian target of rapamycin pathway

The list of medications linked to MRONJ will continue to grow as newer medications are developed to fight cancer and osteoporosis. Clinicians must stay vigilant as newer medications used to fight cancer and osteoporosis emerge and have the potential side effect of osteonecrosis of the jaws.

Intravenous bisphosphonates had a well-established clinical efficiency in treating hypercalcemia of malignancy and bony metastases. Oral bisphosphonates were

used to treat osteoporosis with worldwide acceptance. Osteoporosis has significant adverse health care implications that include hip fracture and vertebral fractures and is a major public health care initiative [36, 37]. It became clear to clinicians that the incidence of ONJ was higher with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy than with oral therapy. Many studies have tried to establish the incidence of ONJ with both oral and intravenous therapy but have been hampered by underreporting of the disease.

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) developed a task force to provide the best recommendations to clinicians in management of MRONJ. The position paper was published in 2014 [38]. The recommendations were meant to give clinicians a guide in management of bisphosphonate patients. The recommendations were expected to be modified as scientific data were accumulated and studied.

# 41.3.3Patients About to Initiate Bisphosphonate Therapy

The goal in this group is to prevent the development of ONJ. If at all possible, the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy should be delayed until oral/dental health is optimized. This will mandate cooperation and communication between medical and dental colleagues. Nonrestorable teeth and teeth with poor prognoses should be extracted. It is recommended to allow 14-21 days to allow adequate healing before starting bisphosphonate therapy. Other necessary dentoalveolar surgery, such as tori removal or alveoloplasty, should be done at this time. Restorative dentistry, scaling, and prophylaxis are best completed before initiation of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients with complete or partial dentures should be evaluated for areas of potential mucosal trauma or irritation. Patients should be educated about the importance of good oral and dental hygiene during bisphosphonate therapy, similar to instructions given to patients undergoing radiation therapy to the jaws. Routine dental examinations and evaluations are important to monitor patient compliance and to detect problems early rather than at a later stage.

# 41.3.4Patients Receiving Intravenous Bisphosphonates

Patients should maintain good oral and dental hygiene in order to prevent problems that require osseous surgery. However, there will always be patients who have

situations arise that are unexpected and unpredictable. Dental procedures that involve bony surgery should be avoided. Endodontic therapy is preferable to extraction of teeth. Placement of dental implants should be avoided. The incidence of developing ONJ in patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonates is higher than in patients receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy (Figs. 41.53, 41.54, 41.55, and 41.56).

# 41.3.5Patients Receiving Oral Bisphosphonates

The risk of ONJ appears to be associated with a longer duration of therapy, 3 years or greater. Scientifically based recommendations are lacking at this point. Recommendations are based on expert opinion and will

be modified as the scientific data become available and are analyzed. In patients who have taken oral bisphosphonates for less than 4 years and have no clinical risk factors, no alteration in the planned dentoalveolar treatment is required. Risk factors include conditions that may adversely affect healing, such as steroid treatment, diabetes and other medications, and medical conditions that would make the patient immunocompromised.

In patients who have taken oral bisphosphonates for less than 4 years but have clinical risk factors, a "drug holiday" of at least 2 months should be considered before dentoalveolar surgery. This will require communication between the dentist and the physician to make the judgment if the systemic condition permits this action.

In patients who have taken oral bisphosphonates for greater than 4 years (with or without risk factors),

Fig. 41.56 Instead of extraction #30, root canal therapy #30 was performed and the tooth was "banked." Tooth #30 is asymptomatic and extraction was avoided

a drug holiday of 2 months should be considered before dentoalveolar surgery. This will again require communication between the dentist and the physician to evaluate the overall systemic condition of the patient.

In addition, informed consent of possible complications of MRONJ should be discussed with the patient before any dentoalveolar surgery. Many surgeons have evolved to using written informed consent forms with their patients, and customized forms specific to MRONJ are now available.

Despite clinicians' and patients' best efforts, there is still the possibility of developing MRONJ in our patient population. MRONJ may occur after dentoalveolar surgery, denture irritation, or spontaneously.

# 41.3.6Staging of MRONJ

# Stage 0

Patients with no clinical evidence of necrotic bone but have nonspecific clinical and radiographic findings such as pain and change in the bony trabecular pattern of the jaws.

# Stage 1

Patients have exposed and necrotic bone who are asymptomatic and show no sign of infection.

# Stage 2

Patients have exposed and necrotic bone who are symptomatic with pain and infection.

# Stage 3

Patients have exposed and necrotic bone who are symptomatic with pain and infection and one or more of the following:

- Exposed and necrotic bone extending beyond the alveolar bone.  
- Pathologic fracture.  
Extraoral fistula.  
Oral-antral or oral-nasal communication.  
- Osteolysis extending to the inferior border of the mandible or maxillary sinus floor.

Treatment strategies are based on the stage of the disease. The guidelines are meant to provide recommendations and not dictate treatment. The personal experience of the clinician and overall condition of the patient will determine the ultimate treatment plan. As more scientific data become available, treatment recommendations will be modified to reflect the evidence-based decision-making process that is most desirable. In patients who are at risk for MRONJ, no specific treatment is required

other than educating the patient of the risks involved and the signs and symptoms of the disease. Routine dental examinations and good oral/dental hygiene are emphasized.

In stage 0 patients, clinical follow-up is recommended with conservative treatment. Clinicians should provide symptomatic treatment such as pain control and manage any treatable condition such as dental caries and periodontal disease.

In stage 1 patients, oral anti-microbial rinses, such as chlorhexidine  $0.12\%$ , are indicated. Close monitoring of the oral condition and maintaining good oral hygiene are recommended. Surgical treatment is generally not recommended. Sharp bony edges that are irritating oral tissues may be smoothed down.

In stage 2 patients, treatment is more aggressive. Oral antimicrobial rinses are recommended in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. MRONJ is not due to a primary infectious etiology. However, secondary infections are seen. Penicillin is still effective in the management of MRONJ with infection. Quinolones, metronidazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and erythromycin have been used empirically in penicillin-allergic patients. Culture and sensitivity of infected bone may be considered to more appropriately direct antimicrobial therapy. Refractory cases may require intravenous antibiotic treatment along with maintenance of suppressive treatment to manage the disease (Figs. 41.57, 41.58, and 41.59).

In stage 3 patients, surgical debridement, including resection, is used in conjunction with antibiotic treatment. Resection is generally reserved for extensive, late presentation of disease and pathologic fractures (Figs. 41.60, 41.61, 41.62, 41.63, 41.64, and 41.65).

Mobile segments of bony sequestrum should be removed regardless of the disease stage. Care should be taken not to expose the uninvolved bone for fear of extending the disease process. Clinical controversy arises with regard to stopping the bisphosphonate medication

Researchers are actively studying MRONJ to further elucidate the etiology and possibly direct effective treatments or preventative strategies. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is currently being evaluated [39, 40]. Clinicians are evaluating new techniques such as using platelet-rich plasma to aid in healing after dental extractions in bisphosphonate therapy patients [41, 42]. The scientific knowledge base will surely continue to grow and we will gain a better understanding of MRONJ.

Recently, oral bisphosphonate therapy patients were found to have an unusual complication. Long-term patients were noted to have spontaneous fractures in their long bones, specifically the femur. Long term is felt to be greater than 5 years but some fractures occurred after 2 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures occurred with walking and low-energy injuries. There was generally a prodromal symptom of pain in the affected area. This has caused intense scrutiny as bisphosphonate medications were prescribed to prevent fractures. This has caused clinicians to reevaluate their recommendations for stopping oral bisphosphonate

medications for a period of time(drug holiday) and allow the bone to resume a more normal state of resorption and deposition. The final therapeutic regimen of oral bisphosphonate therapy has yet to be determined.

# Conclusion

Osteomyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, and osteonecrosis present an ongoing and potentially difficult clinical scenario to manage. Many patients will receive a combination of surgery and medical management to adequately heal from these diseases. Some patients will be required to undergo extensive and potentially disfiguring surgery to manage their disease. The medical management, including antibiotic therapy and HBO treatment, may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to the patient's life. All of these conditions can be started with something as innocuous and common as a dental extraction.

Clinicians must always be vigilant for posttreatment complications, including osteomyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, and osteonecrosis. Despite advances in both medical management and surgical therapy, the absolute answer to the prevention and/or management of osteomyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, and osteonecrosis has yet to be found. Clinicians will continue to search for answers to provide optimal care of their patients.
