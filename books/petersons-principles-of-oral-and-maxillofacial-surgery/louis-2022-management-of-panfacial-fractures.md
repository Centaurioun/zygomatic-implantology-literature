# 29.1 Introduction

The management of patients with multiple displaced and comminuted facial fractures can be extremely challenging not only for those who are inexperienced but also for experienced surgeons. Improper diagnosis, treatment planning, and sequencing produce inadequate results and can lengthen procedure time. However, with the availability of detailed imaging [1-3], ridged fixation [4-6], bone grafting techniques [7-9], and proper sequencing [4, 10, 11], outcomes can be optimized. All facets of facial form and function are important, and one should strive to preserve them. The importance of proper occlusion cannot be underestimated. Acute changes in the way teeth come together can readily be detected by the individual [12]. Such alterations can result in myofascial or temporomandibular joint pain [13]. Reestablishing the patency of the nasal cavity is important in the prevention of nasal obstruction and potential problems such as sinusitis and obstructive sleep apnea [14, 15]. It is also required to establish the proper quality of speech [16]. Small changes in orbital volume can result in enophthalmos and/or diplopia [17, 18]. The reestablishment of facial height, width, and projection is important for the prevention of facial deformities and for the psychological and social well-being of the individual [19-21]. No one of these factors can be considered more important than the other; together, they constitute the face and its associated functions.

In this chapter, discussion is presented on some of the historical perspectives, etiology, anatomic considerations, imaging, bone grafting, soft tissue resuspension, sequencing of treatment, complications, and new technologies as they relate to the management of panfacial fractures.

Panfacial fractures are defined as maxillofacial fractures involving all three vertical thirds of the facial skeleton: upper, middle, and lower thirds [4].

# 29.2 Historic Perspective

Panfacial fractures involve the frontal bones, zygomaticomaxillary complex, naso-orbitoethmoid region, maxilla, and mandible. Complex facial injuries such as these are generally the result of high-velocity trauma [22]. Before the advent of rigid fixation techniques [23-25], these fractures were treated with wire fixation and headframes [26-28]. With these techniques, it was difficult to establish and maintain the three-dimensional stability of the facial skeleton.

Several important advances in the management of maxillofacial trauma have resulted in improved outcomes. These include the development of high-resolution computed tomography, rigid fixation techniques, soft tissue resuspension, primary bone grafting, and computer-assisted surgery. All of these have made a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of panfacial injuries; each of these will be discussed in more detail.

# 29.2.1 Etiology

Panfacial fractures result from motor vehicle collisions, assault, sports-related accidents, industrial accidents, and gunshot wounds [22, 29-32]. Gunshot wounds are usually associated with significant soft tissue damage and generally require some different principles of management. These injuries are covered in a different chapter in this book and will not be discussed in this chapter.

# Key Points

- Panfacial fractures are generally the result of high-velocity trauma.  
Wire fixation and headframes have been replaced by rigid internal fixation techniques.  
- Technological advancement in imaging and computer-assisted surgery has significantly improved outcomes.

# 29.3 Anatomic Considerations

# 29.3.1 Facial Buttresses

Many authors have described the buttresses of the face in both vertical and horizontal planes [10, 32-34]. The vertical buttresses include the nasomaxillary, zygomaticomaxillary, and pterygomaxillary buttresses (Fig. 29.1). The nasomaxillary buttress includes the maxillary process of the frontal bone and the frontal process of the maxilla, extending lateral to the piriform rim. The zygomaticomaxillary buttress is composed of

Fig. 29.2 Horizontal buttress of the maxillofacial skeleton

the zygomatic process of the frontal bone, lateral orbital rim, lateral zygomatic body, and zygomatic process of the maxilla. The pterygomaxillary buttress includes the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid and maxillary tuberosities. Usually, the nasomaxillary and zygomaticomaxillary buttresses are reconstructed, but the pterygomaxillary buttress is not because of inaccessibility. The condyle and posterior mandibular ramus make up yet another buttress establishing posterior facial height.

The horizontal buttresses are also described as anterior-posterior buttresses [10]. These include the frontal, zygomatic, maxillary, and mandibular buttresses (Fig. 29.2). The frontal buttress is composed of the supraorbital rims and the glabellar region. The zygomatic buttress consists of the zygomatic arch, zygomatic body, and infraorbital rim. The maxillary and mandibular buttresses are composed of the basal bone of the maxilla and mandible arches.

None of these buttresses exists in a vacuum. Together, they give the facial skeleton its structural integrity. The bone is generally thicker over these described areas to neutralize the forces of mastication or impact. With the proper reduction in these buttresses, we are able to reconstruct the height, width, and projection of the face.

# 29.3.2 Key Landmarks

When there are multiple facial fractures involving the upper, middle, and lower faces, reconstruction should be approached as a puzzle. Known landmarks and anatomy can be used to reconstruct more precisely those areas that have been damaged. Some key landmarks that may help in establishing the proper positioning of the facial skeleton include the dental arches, mandible, sphenozygomatic suture, maxillary buttress, and intercanthal region.

# 29.3.3 Dental Arches

When one or both of the dental arches are intact, they can be used as guides. For example, if the patient has suffered a Le Fort fracture but no midpalatal split, the maxilla, as an intact arch, can be used to set the mandibular arch and establish proper width. Particularly, problematic is the situation in which there is a midpalatal split and the mandible is also fractured along the

tooth-bearing region, with associated condyle fractures. This can easily lead to widening of the entire facial complex if these segments are not properly reduced. One approach to this problem is to reestablish the maxillary width by exposing the palatal fracture, and then reducing and fixating the region (Fig. 29.3) [34-37]. This approach should not be considered the first step in the overall sequencing of panfacial injuries, but this technique works well when there is a solitary midpalatal fracture without comminution or avulsion. Owing to concerns about access, many surgeons chose to establish

good arch form and fixate the fracture along the facial aspect of the alveolus while avoiding the roots of teeth (see  $\square$  Fig. 29.3b, c). A second approach is to obtain impressions for fabrication of dental models. Simulated surgery can then be performed on the upper and lower casts and a surgical splint fabricated (  $\square$  Fig. 29.4) [38, 39]. This is by no means a foolproof method when both the upper and the lower arches are fractured. The more severe the injury (i.e., multiple segments), the more difficult it is to establish a preinjury occlusion. If the patient has dental models of her or his preinjury occlusion from

previous orthodontic or prosthetic rehabilitation, these can provide invaluable clues to establishing the proper arch form. A third option is to reconstruct the mandible because this is generally a robust bone that can undergo anatomic reduction if attention is paid to detail.

# 29.3.4 The Mandible

Anatomic reduction at the symphysis and/or body can be achieved with an extraoral exposure of the fracture. Such exposure allows for direct visualization of the inferior border and, to a lesser degree, the lingual cortex. The reduction in both the buccal and the lingual cortical surfaces before fixation yields better results (Fig. 29.5) [40, 41]. When bilateral subcondylar fractures are present, they must be treated to establish the posterior facial height and facial width. When bilateral subcondylar fractures are present and there is an associated fracture along the symphysis and/or body region, the mandible may undergo splaying, with a resultant increase in facial width. The lateral pterygoid muscle attachment at the pterygoid fovea, as well as the lateral capsular ligament of the temporomandibular joint, acts to prevent extremes of movement laterally. The mandibular condyle can be reconstituted to the mandibular ramus to help establish facial height and width.

# 29.3.5 Sphenozygomatic Suture

The sphenozygomatic suture, along the internal surface of the lateral orbital wall, has been shown in cadaver studies to be a key landmark for both the reduction and the fixation of the zygomaticomaxillary complex [42- 44]. If other aspects of the facial skeleton are ignored, the use of this suture alone can result in errors; however, if the orbital roof and superior lateral orbit are intact, this suture can be an important landmark for the proper positioning of the zygoma and zygomatic arch. The

sphenozygomatic suture is usually exposed from a periorbital approach including the upper blepharoplasty, upper brow, transconjunctival with lateral canthotomy, or coronal approach (Fig. 29.6).

# 29.3.6 Intercanalthal Region

The intercanthal region may also be used to reestablish midfacial width because the intercanthal distance is fairly constant in the adult facial skeleton [45]. Restoration of the proper intercanthal distance via reduction in the naso-orbitoethmoid complex can help to determine facial width (Fig. 29.7) [10] This depends mainly on the fracture type. If there is minimal or no comminution in the region, proper reduction can aid in reestablishment of facial form. Unfortunately, many times this area is severely comminuted and is of little help. Establishing the proper intercanthal distance through measurement is usually performed in patients with severe comminution.

# Key Points

Vertical and horizontal buttresses form the foundation of the facial skeleton.  
- Restoration of facial buttresses facilitates proper facial projection and width.  
- When complex panfacial fractures present, surgeons must rely on key landmarks including the dentition, anatomic mandibular reduction, sphenozygomatic suture, and intercanthal region.

# 29.4 Imaging

Imaging of the facial skeleton has gone through a gradual evolution in the area of facial trauma. Plain film radiography and linear tomography were the gold standard until the advent of computed tomography (CT) [46-49] CT has improved our ability to image the facial skeleton and obtain details not possible with plain films (Fig. 29.8) [1]. It allows the clinicians to determine not only the location of fractures but also the degree and direction of displaced segments [2, 3]. Since the introduction of CT, it has undergone an evolution in both the quality of the images and its application. In a previous article, authors reported on "sophisticated CT," in which  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  cuts through the facial skeleton were presented [2]. It is now a routine practice at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to obtain  $0.75\mathrm{-mm}$  axial cuts with coronal reconstructions. Specific imaging protocols have been developed for obtaining diagnostic coronal reformatted images from axial helical CT data. This allows for three-dimensional reconstruc

With current CT technology, the maxillofacial trauma surgeon can evaluate the fracture pattern by viewing individual cuts or the three-dimensional reconstructions [3]. This allows the surgeon to view necessary details or the overall injury pattern. By manipulating the image windows on a monitor, the surgeon can view

hard and soft tissue details. Soft tissue details that can be viewed on CT are not readily apparent on plain films. These include intracranial injuries, injuries to the globe, presence and location of foreign bodies, extraocular muscle entrapment, soft tissue avulsion, displaced teeth, and the airway. If a cervical spine injury is suspected, it may be imaged at the time of cranial and maxillofacial imaging. The combination of physical examination and current CT imaging allows a clear treatment plan to be generated. This helps greatly with sequencing at the time of surgery.

# 29.5 Surgical Approaches

Approaches to the facial skeleton in panfacial trauma should permit wide exposure of the fracture to allow for anatomic reduction. The location and extent of exposure are dependent on fracture severity and combination. The following describes which fractures can be accessed through the various surgical approaches (Fig. 29.10):

# Surgical Exposure

Coronal flap: frontal sinus, naso-orbitoethmoid (superior aspect), medial canthal tendon, supraorbital rim, orbital roof, superior aspect of the medial and lateral orbital wall, zygomatic arch, and mandibular condyle (with preauricular extension).  
Subciliary and transconjunctival incision with lateral canthotomy: infraorbital rim, medial and lateral orbital walls, and orbital floor. The transconjunctival incision with lateral canthotomy does allow access to the frontozygomatic suture. This requires detachment of the lateral canthal tendon and incision through the orbicularis oculi muscle and periosteum deep to the lateral periorbital skin. The subciliary approach may allow better access to the lateral nasal region.

- Upper eyelid crease incision: superior and lateral regions of the orbit. It is generally used to expose the frontozygomatic suture. This incision is not needed when the biconormal incision is used.  
Perinasal incisions: naso-orbitoethmoid region, medial canthal tendon, and nasolacrimal sac. These incisions are generally avoided because of the potential for significant scarring. This incision is not needed when the bicononal incision is used.  
Maxillary vestibular incision: maxilla and zygomaticomaxillary buttress.  
- Mandibular vestibular incision: mandible from the ramus to the symphysis. This approach is not usually recommended for comminuted fractures.  
Cervical incisions: mandible, except for when there is a high condylar neck fracture. The approach is generally indicated when anatomic reduction is crucial. It allows the surgeon to visualize the reduction in the lingual cortex. It is also indicated for comminuted and complicated fractures such as a fracture of the atrophic edentulous mandible.

# 29.6 Bone Grafting and Soft Tissue Resuspension

Two procedures have improved outcomes in the management of panfacial trauma: primary bone grafting and resuspension of the soft tissue after extensive exposure of the facial skeleton [7-9]. As previously discussed, the facial buttresses are areas that can serve as guides in the reduction in the facial skeleton and provide stabilization of fractures. With high-velocity trauma, comminution and loss of bony segments can occur in the buttress and "nonbuttress" areas of the face.

# 29.6.1 Bone Grafting

When these defects are significant, the surgeon may consider the use of bone grafting to prevent soft tissue collapse and to allow for structural support of the facial skeleton. Previous articles have reported on primary bone grafting with few complications [7-9]. Even when the bone graft becomes exposed, secondary wound healing generally occurs. Common areas that may require primary bone grafting include the frontal bone, nasal dorsum, orbital floor, medial orbital wall, and zygomaticomaxillary buttress.

There are many potential sources of bone for a graft, but calvarial bone may be the best. Access is often achieved through a biconormal flap that has already been created during the management of the fractures. These grafts have been shown to resist resorption better than

![](images/3346d15731ad25d9a77c98108658c06e96e7491429f806e4c0190319423e53c3.jpg)

endochondral bone [8]. Rigid fixation of these grafts has been shown to decrease resorption (  $\bullet$  Fig. 29.11) [8].

# 29.6.2 Soft Tissue Resuspension

Soft tissue resuspension after surgical access to facial fractures is important for long-term facial esthetics [42, 52, 53]. Resuspension may be especially beneficial in the midface region. For repair of midface fractures, the region is usually exposed transorally and from a periorbital approach [52]. The soft tissue attachment over the midface is customarily completely stripped. This frequently results in sagging of the soft tissue, with reattachment at a more inferior position. Manson and colleagues [42] stated that there are two steps to placing the soft tissue back into proper position after exposure of the facial skeleton: refixation of the periosteum or fascia to the skeleton, and closure of the periosteum, muscle fascia, and skin where incisions have been made. The periosteum is inflexible and limits soft tissue lengthening and migration. Its reattachment is usually accomplished by drilling holes in key locations to fix the periosteum to the bone. Areas where periosteal closure should be obtained include the frontozygomatic suture, infraorbital rim, deep temporal fascia, and muscular layers of maxillary and mandibular incisions [32, 42, 52, 54]. Areas where periosteal reattachment should be obtained include the malar eminence and infraorbital rim, temporal fascia over the zygomatic arch, medial and lateral canthi, and mentalis muscle [42].

initial reconstruction avoids saddle nose deformity. Post-traumatic scarring causes soft tissue collapse which will be difficult to resolve during revision surgery

# Key Points

Areas of comminution that may necessitate primary grafting include nasal dorsum, orbital floor and medial wall, and zygomaticomaxillary buttress.  
Coronal flap allows access to calvarium which is ideal source for autograft to areas of comminution.  
Areas requiring soft tissue resuspension may include medial and lateral canthal tendons and infraorbital-zygomatic areas

# 29.7 Sequence of Treatment

# 29.7.1 Airway Management

How to maintain the airway is a crucial decision in the management of panfacial fractures. There are several options that are dictated by the fracture pattern and extent of other injuries. When there are extensive head injuries and prolonged intubation is anticipated, tracheostomy should be considered [55-57]. Likewise, tracheostomy is an appropriate option to facilitate the management of multiple facial fractures [10, 56, 57]. In many cases, there are extensive injuries to the naso-orbitoethmoid region, making nasal intubation difficult and hazardous [58, 59]. With nasal intubation, access to the frontal sinus and naso-orbitoethmoid region is hindered.

Oral intubation may be an option when maxillomandibular fixation is either not possible or not indicated. When prolonged intubation is not anticipated, options include submental intubation [60, 61] or passing the tube behind the dentition, if space permits. If an extraoral approach is indicated to manage a mandibular body/angle fracture or a symphysis fracture, submental intubation may hinder access.

# 29.7.2 Fracture Management

Much has been written about the proper sequencing of treatment for panfacial fractures [10, 28, 42, 52, 62]. Sequences such as "bottom-up and inside-out" or "top-down and outside-in" have been used to describe two of the classic approaches for the management of panfacial fractures. To the author's knowledge, there have been no randomized studies to ascertain whether one approach is superior to the other.

The bottom-up and inside-out approach predates the use of rigid fixation, but is still a valid approach. It establishes the mandible as a foundation for setting the rest of the face and includes open reduction and internal fixation of subcondylar fractures and the remainder of the mandible. The occlusion is set by placing the patient in maxillomandibular fixation; then, the maxilla should be in the proper position. Realignment of the zygomatic buttresses follows in this sequence; however, fixation at this point may lead to inaccuracies in upper midface position. Instead, a break in the sequence is usually preferred here. The zygomaticomaxillary complex is reduced and fixated first. This allows for a more accurate repositioning of the upper midface before fixation at the zygomatic buttress. The maxilla is now fixated along the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. Last, the naso-orbitoethmoid fracture is reduced and stabilized (Fig. 29.12) [62]

The opposite approach, top-down and outside-in, starts at the zygomatic region. The sphenozygomatic suture is reduced and fixated inside the orbit. The zygomatic arch is reduced and plated. If the arches are not properly reduced, underprojection of the midface can result. The alignment of the arch can be verified by the proper position of the sphenozygomatic suture. From this point, the zygomas can be further positioned and fixated at the frontozygomatic suture. The nasoorbitoethmoid complex is then positioned to the supraorbital rims, infraorbital rims, and maxillary process of the frontal bones. The maxilla is addressed next, using the position of the zygomaticomaxillary buttress and

piriform rim as a guide. Maxillomandibular fixation can then be established (Fig. 29.13) [52]. Reduction and fixation of the mandibular condyle and the symphysis/ body/angle fractures are then performed.

Some surgeons feel that there is a significant advantage to the top-down and outside-in approach because open treatment of the condyles may not be necessary. The patient is treated with varying periods of maxillomandibular fixation, which may be a valid approach in the case of comminuted intracapsular fractures. Although this is a viable option in some cases, there are two potential complications. One is an unrecognized rotation of the body or ramus of the mandible, resulting in widening. A second complication is temporomandibular joint ankylosis caused by the inability to begin early physical therapy. One author reviewed closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures and showed compromised results [63]. Early function of patients with condylar head fractures is usually indicated, along with guiding elastics to maintain the range of motion of the temporomandibular joint.

Neither one of these techniques will achieve optimal results in every situation. Instead, an approach that goes from known to unknown is certainly more accurate. For example, if there is a significant calvarial injury, it may be difficult to start from the cranium and proceed caudally. In this case, a sequence that starts caudally and proceeds cranially may achieve more optimal results, allowing the surgeon to reconstruct the damaged cranial portion last. Conversely, if there is significant comminution of the mandible or if key segments are missing, it may be more appropriate to start cranially and proceed caudally. Thus, the maxillofacial trauma surgeon must be comfortable with both approaches and use known landmarks to achieve optimal results.

In  $\triangleright$  Boxes 29.1 and 29.2, two common sequences of management of facial fractures are illustrated. Other sequences exist, but they are variations of these two major approaches (Fig. 29.14).

# Key Points

- Careful preoperative reflection is important: How can your airway interfere with surgery? Nasal, oral, submental intubation, and tracheostomy should be considered.  
Bottom-up, inside-out or top-down, outside-in approaches can be employed in combination, carefully studying preoperative imaging allows for a known-to-unknown approach.

# 29.8 Complications

Many complications are associated with various particular fractures; these are discussed elsewhere in the text, with reference to the specific fracture type. However, a significant complication associated with panfacial fractures discussed here is widening of the facial complex. This occurs when the surgeon fails to properly reduce key areas that guide in establishing facial width [42]. If the first area approached is fixated in an improper location, subsequent fragments will be reduced and fixed in an improper spatial arrangement, resulting in a series of errors and, usually, a widened and deprojecting facial complex. To prevent this, the surgeon must use stable segments, known landmarks, and anatomic reduction in the management of panfacial fractures.

If this complication does occur, the surgeon must assess the patient and determine the severity and location of the problem. This is done through physical examination and CT imaging (Fig. 29.15). In severe cases, three-dimensional CT reconstruction of the entire facial skeleton can be obtained and, if indicated, computer-assisted surgery techniques can be utilized, including manufacturing a three-dimensional stereolithographic model [64, 65]. The model allows the surgeon to identify and recreate the fractures during model surgery. The fracture may be reduced anatomically and stabilized with plates, which can then be sterilized and used at the time of surgery. This technique and the use of proper landmarks can aid in the proper reduction and fixation of the fractures.

# Key Points

- Pathognomonic stigmata of panfacial fracture include facial widening with deprojection.  
Careful examination, review of images, and surgical planning will decrease the risk of long-term facial deformity.

# 29.9 Computer-Assisted Surgery

The principles for maxillofacial trauma, including adequate exposure, anatomic reduction, and stable fixation, are often challenging to achieve in panfacial trauma. Intraoperative assessment is encumbered by swelling, tissue avulsion, and distortion of landmarks [66]. As mentioned, "wide" surgical exposure interrupts critical soft tissue attachments such as the zygomatic prominence, canthi and mentalis, or places vital structures at risk including the globe. The classic, and perhaps dated, paradigm employs postoperative scans [67, 68], and consideration for secondary revision. Recently, computer-assisted surgery (CAS) has become ubiquitous in our literature for pathology and reconstruction [69-72], orthognathics [73, 74], and facial trauma [75-78]. Generally, we divide CAS into four categories: virtual surgical planning (VSP), intraoperative navigation, intraoperative imaging [79], and more recently in-house 3D printing.

hardware was removed. The previous fractures were recreated by performing bilateral condylar process osteotomies, a symphysis osteotomy, and a Le Fort I with left paramidline split.

# 29.9.1 Virtual Surgical Planning

Several corporations provide VSP services and accompanying splints, models, and guides. Specifically, CT scan data are recorded in "Digital Information and Communications in Medicine" (DICOM) format. These DICOM data are transferred into computer-aided design (CAD) software and are manipulated in 3D to rotate, translate, and reduce fracture. In complex panfacial trauma, naso-orbital-ethmoidal contours and zygomatic buttresses are mirrored to the unaffected side or modeled to population norms for bilateral fracture patterns (Fig. 29.16). Thereafter, this virtually reconstructed skeleton becomes the template from which custom polymer guides and splints are created by additive manufacturing and/or custom titanium plates are created by selective laser melting (SLM). Indeed, this application of CAS in facial trauma surgery has improved surgical accuracy [80, 81].

# 29.9.2 Intraoperative Navigation

Intraoperative navigation, which was pioneered in neurosurgery [82, 83], has been adopted for various applications in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Briefly, the preoperative CT data are first registered to the patient clinically. In maxillofacial trauma surgery, the most applicable method is registration using an infrared stylus to sample the surface anatomy of the patient and correlate with CT data. Navigation allows the surgeon to digitally visualize deep skeletal contours buried under vital structures including orbit or skull base. Moreover, as an extension of VSP, the reconstructed skeleton is converted back into DICOM format and transferred into a surgical navigation system. This allows the surgeon to verify adherence to the VSP idealized skeleton. The efficacy of this surgical protocol has been well-documented for panfacial fractures  $(<2\mathrm{mm})$ , for ZMC fractures  $(<2\mathrm{mm})$  and orbital fractures (decreased diplopia and improved volumetric correlation) [84-87].

# 29.9.3 Intraoperative Imaging

Intraoperative imaging introduces a portable CT scanner into the operating room. Currently, both fan-shaped conventional CT and volumetric cone beam CT are described in the literature; while the former provides increased image resolution, the latter decreases the radiation dosage. With technological advancement, the cost and footprint have decreased. The logistics of intraoperative CT is also less cumbersome with studies demonstrating "scan to interpretation times" as low as 14-20 minutes for experienced teams [66, 88]. Interestingly, overall revision rates after intraoperative CT are approximately  $22 - 28\%$  [66, 88, 89]. The fractures that comprising panfacial injuries demonstrate high rates of revision after intraoperative imaging: orbits, ZMC, Lefort II/III, and NOE; thus, these fractures pose the highest yield when utilizing this technology.

# 29.9.4 Onsite 3D Printing

Onsite 3D printing presents a new area of innovation for surgical teams. These devices employ additive manufacturing with chemical or light-curing polymers. Previously, these machines were financially inaccessible to academic surgical groups, pricing above  $100,000. Now, the start-up cost is less than$ 3000 with free open-sourced software and low-cost print materials. Studies demonstrate that this technology can be implemented into a busy trauma services and save operating time and costs for fracture management [78, 89]. In its current state, it is unclear if in-house VSP in CAD is of interest to individual surgical teams. Rather, collaborating with bioengineers in a VSP meeting will be the standard until the software reaches the same user friendliness of implant planning.

# 29.9.5 Future Considerations

Importantly as biomedical technology advances, we must consider the cost compared to the reliable surgery of our forefathers. Importantly, does technology improve outcomes, quality of life, and efficiency. The counterargument comes from the observation of our surgical colleagues; orthopedists routinely perform intraoperative imaging to ensure adequate reduction and fixation. Neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists regularly rely on navigation in spinal and neuro-craniofacial surgery. Hopefully, our "millimeter mindset" prevails as we welcome technological innovation.

# Key Points

Computer-assisted surgery includes four modalities: VSP, navigation, intraoperative imaging, and onsite 3D printing.  
CAS represents additional tools that can improve cosmetic-functional results, decrease operative time, and ultimately decrease costs to care for complex facial injuries.

# Conclusion

The management of panfacial fractures is extremely complex. There are, however, many technologic advances that can aid the surgeon in the proper management of these fractures. The most important of these advancements is imaging. With the advent of high-resolution scanners, the surgeon has a more accurate picture of the fracture pattern. Once the proper diagnosis is established, the surgeon should be able to institute an appropriate sequence of treatment.
