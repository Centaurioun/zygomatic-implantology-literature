# Learning Aims

1. Zygomatic complex fractures include fracture of the orbital floor.  
2. Displaced articulation points and orbital bones must be reduced.  
3. Not all zygomatic complex fractures require surgical treatment.  
4. Treatment for low velocity versus high velocity injuries is different.  
5. In complex cases intraoperative navigation can be useful.

# 23.1 Introduction

The zygoma is a quadrangular structure that articulates with the frontal, temporal, sphenoid, and maxillary bones; therefore, the terms trimalar and tripod fracture are inaccurate. The articulations are commonly referred to as the zygomaticofrontal (ZF), zygomaticotemporal (ZT), zygomaticomaxillary (ZM), and zygomaticosphenoid (ZS) sutures. The zygoma provides strength and stability of the midface as the ZM and ZF articulations contribute to the horizontal and vertical buttresses of the face, respectively. The forward projection of the zygoma causes it to be injured frequently [1]. The zygomatic arch may be fracture independently or as part of the zygomatic complex fracture. The cause of zygomatic injuries varies with patient demographics. Common causes of zygomatic injury include assault, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and sports injuries. In this chapter, the

applied surgical anatomy, diagnosis, management, and complications of zygomatic complex fractures are discussed.

# 23.2 Surgical Anatomy

The zygoma has four bony projections, which create a quadrangular shape: the frontal, temporal, maxillary, and inferior orbital rim.

# Key Point

A zygomatic complex fracture includes disruption of the four articulating structures: zygomaticofrontal (ZF), zygomaticosphenoid (ZS), zygomaticomaxillary (ZM), and zygomaticotemporal (ZT) sutures (Fig. 23.1a, b).

$\Theta$  All zygomatic complex fractures involved the orbital floor and the ZS suture is within the orbit. Therefore, an understanding of orbital anatomy is necessary for treating these injuries (  $\square$  Fig. 23.2).

The orbit is a quadrilateral pyramid that is based anteriorly. The orbital floor slopes inferiorly and is the shortest of the orbital walls, averaging  $47\mathrm{mm}$  [3]. The orbital floor is comprised of the orbital plate of the maxilla, the orbital surface of the zygomatic bone, and the orbital process of the palatine bone. The medial and lateral walls converge posteriorly at the orbital apex. The

medial wall consists of the frontal process of the maxilla, the lacrimal bone, the orbital plate of the ethmoid, and a small portion of the sphenoid body. The lateral orbital wall is the thickest and formed by the zygoma and the greater wing of the sphenoid. The roof of the orbit is composed of the frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid (Fig. 23.2).

The inferior orbital rim is often fractured in zygomatic complex fractures as the infraorbital rim is part of the ZM process. The ZM buttress and infraorbital rim do contribute to one of the horizontal buttresses of the face. This buttress is easily accessible for stabilization and is important to help restore facial width.

The zygomatic arch includes the temporal process of the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The glenoid fossa and articular eminence are located at the posterior aspect of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (Fig. 23.1a, b).

The sensory nerve associated with the zygoma is the second division of trigeminal nerve. There are three branches (zygomatic, facial, and temporal) that exit the foramina in the body of the zygoma and supply sensation to the cheek and anterior temporal region. The infraorbital nerve passes through the orbital floor and exits at the infraorbital foramen (Fig. 23.2). It provides sensation to the anterior cheek, lateral nose, upper lip, and maxillary anterior teeth. Studies show that  $30 - 80\%$  of patients with zygomatic complex fractures have sensory deficits to the midface on the affected side [4, 5].

Muscles of facial expression originating from the zygoma include the zygomaticus major which inserts at the oral commissure and minor, also known as the zygomatic head of the levator labii superioris, which inserts to support the upper lip (Fig. 23.1a). Both muscles are used to draw the upper lip upward and are used in smiling. Like all muscles of facial expression, they are innervated

by the facial nerve, cranial nerve VII. The masseter muscle has two heads, superficial and deep. The superficial head originates from the temporal surface of the zygomatic bone and inferior aspect of the zygomatic arch and inserts to the angle of the mandible. The deep head of

the masseter muscles originates from the medial aspect of the zygomatic arch and inserts to the ramus. The masseter is innervated by a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3). The temporalis fascia originates from the temporal line and inserts into the zygomatic arch. The fascia prevents inferior displacement of a fractured zygomatic arch from inferior pull of the masseter muscle (Fig. 23.3).

Tendinous attachments to the zygomatic arch include Lockwood's suspensory ligament as well as the medial and lateral canthal tendons. The position of the globe in relation to the horizontal axis is maintained by Lockwood's suspensory ligament which attaches medially to the posterior aspect of the lacrimal bone and laterally to Whitnall's tubercle (which is  $1\mathrm{cm}$  below the zygomaticofrontal suture on the medial aspect of the frontal process of the zygoma). The lateral canthal tendon attaches to Whitnall's tubercle. Trauma that causes inferior displacement of the zygomatic complex often results in down-slanting palpebral fissure on exam. The medial canthal tendon attaches to the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests (  $\square$  Fig. 23.2).

# 23.3 Diagnosis

Fractures of the zygomatic complex are often treated 4-5 days after injury once swelling has time to decrease. Initial evaluation includes documentation of the mechanism, level of consciousness, status of surrounding soft tissues (eyelids, lacrimal apparatus, canthal tendons, globe), cranial nerves II through VII, and bony injury.

Visual acuity and status of globe and retina should be established. An ophthalmologist should be consulted for suspected or questionable ophthalmic injury.

# History

The mechanism, force, and direction of injuring blow should be established by patient or bystander. A direct lateral blow, as in assault, usually produces in isolated zygomatic arch or an inferomedially displaced zygomatic complex fracture. A frontal blow usually causes a posterior and inferior displaced fracture.

A patient with a zygomatic complex fracture often reports pain and numbness to the ipsilateral midface including the cheek, upper lip, lateral nose, and maxillary teeth. From the edema and ecchymosis, the patient may have diplopia or blurry vision. If the zygomatic arch is medially displaced, the patient may complain of trismus. Epistaxis may also be present.

# Physical Exam

Edema and ecchymosis are the most common early clinical signs and are present in  $61\%$  of all zygomatic injuries, and most symptoms can be attributed to these sequelae [6, 7]. Additional visual clues to a zygomatic complex fracture include depression of the malar eminence and infraorbital rim which produces flattening of the cheek, subconjunctival hemorrhage, down-slanting palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and accentuation of the supratarsal fold of the upper eyelid. Lacerations in the facial region should lead the surgeon to suspect an underlying fracture (  $\text{口}$  Fig.23.4a,b).

The physician should palpate the zygomaticofrontal suture, the zygomatic arch, and  $360^{\circ}$  of the orbital rim in a systematic fashion. Tenderness, step-off deformity, or separation at the sutures are indicative of fracture. Intraorally, disruption of the ZM suture may be palpable, and ecchymosis of the ipsilateral maxillary vestibule in the region of the canine fossa may be visible. Evaluation of maximal incisal opening is evaluated to rule out impingement of the coronoid process on the zygomatic arch.

In isolated zygomatic arch fractures, a depression is observed and palpated anterior to the tragus. Pain upon palpation and decreased mandibular motion are often observed with these injuries. Orbital findings are usually absent.

Examination of the eye must include evaluation and documentation of visual acuity, pupillary response to light, funduscopic evaluation, ocular movement, and globe position. Initially, patients with severe trauma may present with exophthalmos from edema, retrobulbar hemorrhage, and inferior-posterior displacement of the arch. Limited ocular movement, enophthalmos as swelling resolves, and diplopia may be present if there are significant fractures of the orbital floor or medial and lateral walls of the orbit. The lack of pupillary response and ptosis is present if cranial nerve III has been injured. Injuries to the optic nerve, hyphema, injury to the globe, retrobulbar hematoma, retinal detachment, and disruption of the lacrimal ducts may also be present (Fig. 23.5).

# Major ocular injuries are present in  $4 - 12\%$  of zygomatic complex fractures [8-10].

Careful evaluation of the cranial nerves must be performed with special attention to cranial nerves II, III, IV, V, and VI. A full secondary survey should be completed and documented.

# 23.3.1 Radiographic Evaluation

# Plain Film Radiographs

CT scans have nearly replaced plain films for the diagnosis and management of zygomatic complex fractures. However, a fundamental working knowledge of this technique is important.

Waters' View The single best radiograph for evaluation of the zygomatic complex fracture is Waters' view, also known as occipitomental view. It is a posteroanterior projection with the head positioned at  $27^{\circ}$  angle to the vertical and the chin resting on the cassette. This positioning projects the petrous pyramids off the maxillary sinuses permitting visualization of the sinuses, lateral orbits, and infraorbital rims.

Submentovertex View The submentovertex (jug-handle) view is directed from the submandibular region to the vertex of the skull. It is useful for evaluation of the zygomatic arch and malar projection.

# Computed Tomography

CT is the gold standard for radiographic evaluation of zygomatic fractures. Axial, coronal, and sagittal images are obtained to delineate fracture patterns, degree of displacement and comminution, and to evaluate the orbital soft tissues. CT scans allow visualization of the buttresses of the midfacial skeleton: nasomaxillary, zygomaticomaxillary, zygomaticotemporal, zygomaticosphenoid, and infraorbital. The axial view is useful in evaluating the continuity of the zygomatic arch as well as malar projection (Fig. 23.6a-d). Coronal images are helpful in the evaluation of the orbital floor with the soft tissue window useful in visualizing orbital muscles and to see if orbital contents have herniated into the maxillary sinus or if entrapment is present [11]. Sagittal images are valuable for additional evaluation potential orbital floor fractures as well as postoperative evaluation of position of orbital implants.

# Classification of Fractures

Historically, the classification of zygomatic fractures was used to predict which fractures would remain stable after reduction. Clinically, this would allow the surgeon to identify the fractures that would require open reduction and internal fixation. Numerous investigators have developed a classification system for zygomatic fractures, and no single classification system is universally used. Knight and North developed one of the more popular classification systems for zygomatic fractures which characterizes the fractures by degree of displacement on Waters' view radiograph [12]. The historic classification systems were developed prior to the CT scan and rigid fixation era. More modern classification systems strive

to identify those fractures that require aggressive surgical approaches.

In 1990, Manson et al. proposed a method of classification based on the pattern of segmentation and displacement [13]. Fractures with little to no displacement were classified as low-energy injuries with incomplete fractures of one or more articulation points. Middle-energy injuries included those fractures with mild to moderate displacement and complete fracture of all articulations with or without comminution. High-energy injuries were characterized by comminution in the lateral orbit and lateral displacement with segmentation of the zygomatic arch.

Gruss et al. proposed a classification system that stressed the importance of recognizing and treating zygomatic arch fractures in association with the zygomatic

body [14]. Like Manson and colleagues, Gruss et al. emphasized comminution, segmentation, and lateral bowing of the zygomatic arch must be identified and treated.

Zingg et al. reviewed 1025 fractures and classified the injuries into three categories, type A, B, and C [15]. Type A fractures are low-energy injuries with fracture of only zygomatic pillar: the zygomatic arch, lateral orbital wall, or infraorbital rim. Type B fractures are designated complete "monofragment" fractures with fracture and displacement along all four articulations. Type C are those with "multifragment" fractures including fracture of the zygomatic body.

The classification schemes vary to some degree; however, each note that as the degree of comminution and displacement increases, the role of open reduction and internal fixation increases as well.

# 23.4 Treatment

Treatment of zygomatic complex fractures must be based on a complete history and physical exam, including CT imaging to full appreciate the nature of the injury. Classification systems, if accepted, are helpful to standardize terminology, to plan treatment, and to predict prognosis. However, the surgeon must individualize treatment based on the history, physical exam, radiographic findings, and sound clinical judgement. Indication for treatment of zygoma fractures depends on function and aesthetics.

Management of zygomatic complex and zygomatic arch fractures depends on the degree of displacement and the resulting aesthetic and functional deficits. Treatment may range from simple observation to open reduction and internal fixation of multiple fractures.

The role of antibiotics in maxillofacial trauma is controversial [16, 17]. Chole et al. performed a randomized control study evaluating the use of prophylactic antibiotics in maxillofacial trauma. In the 18 patients with zygomatic complex fractures who were evaluated, there were no reported infections regardless of whether patients received antibiotics [16]. With regard to postoperative antibiotic coverage, Huang et al. retrospectively evaluated the rate of infection in open and closed methods of treatment and determined that the rate of infection was the same [18]. If antibiotics are given, sinus flora should be covered.

# 23.4.1 Zygomatic Arch Fractures

Isolated zygomatic arch fractures that are nondisplaced or minimally displaced often require no surgical correction. These injuries do not usually result in significant functional or cosmetic deficits; therefore, it is appropriate to simply observe the patient. The patient should be observed after all of the swelling has subsided for final evaluation of potential facial deformity.

The Keen approach is an intraoral approach utilizing a full-thickness maxillary vestibular incision from canine to first molar, approximately  $5\mathrm{mm}$  above the mucogingival junction [19]. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal envelope is elevated from the zygomatic buttress anteriorly to the pyriform rim and superiorly to expose the infraorbital nerve. An elevator is then carefully placed under the arch and used to "run the arch" and identify the fracture. The elevator is used to place anterior and lateral pressure on the fractured arch to reduce the fracture. A click is often heard as the bones reduce.

The incision is closed with resorbable suture. Fixation is not usually necessary.

The Gillies approach is another common technique for treatment of zygomatic arch fractures and can be used for reduction of zygomatic complex fractures as well [20]. A  $2\mathrm{cm}$  temporal incision is made behind the hairline. The dissection continues through the subcutaneous and superficial temporal fascia down to the glistening white deep temporal fascia. The temporal fascia is incised horizontally to expose the temporalis muscle. A sturdy elevator, such as an urethral sound or Rowe zygomatic elevator, is inserted deep to the fascia and underneath the temporal aspect of the zygoma. The elevator must pass between the deep temporal fascia and temporalis muscle or it will be lateral to the arch. The force applied to the elevator should be anterior and lateral, with care not to put pressure on the temporal bone. The arch should be palpated during reduction as a guide to ensure proper position. Fixation is not usually necessary. The wound is closed in layers.

Ellis et al. found that in a series of 2067 zygomatic fractures, 10 of 136 isolated zygomatic arch fractures required some form of fixation [4]. Numerous methods of stabilization for zygomatic arch fractures have been proposed. These include temporarily packing the temporal fossa with  $\frac{1}{2}$  inch gauze, a nasogastric tube, or a urinary catheter [21-23]. More conveniently (but not necessary), a circumzygomatic wire can be passed and tightened over a foam-backed aluminum eye shield to suspend the arch.

Open reduction with internal fixation is seldom necessary for treatment of isolated zygomatic arch fractures. Internal fixation with miniplates may be required as part of the management of high-energy comminuted zygomatic complex or panfacial fractures.

# 23.4.2 Zygomatic Complex Fractures

Low-Energy Zygomatic Complex Fractures Low-energy, nondisplaced, or minimally displaced zygomatic complex fractures often require no surgical correction. The patient should be monitored longitudinally for signs of displacement, extraocular muscle dysfunction, and enophthalmos after swelling resolves. The patient should be informed of the risk of residual asymmetry of the cheek, orbit, and eyelid if the fracture is displaced and not reduced. Documentation including photographs is recommended [24].

Middle-Energy Zygomatic Complex Fractures Middle-energy, displaced zygomatic complex fractures require reduction and internal fixation. In 1996, Ellis and Kittidumkering proposed an algorithm of treatment for

isolated middle-energy zygomatic complex fractures that did not require orbital reconstruction [25]. The first step in this algorithm is reduction of the fracture. A Carroll-Girard screw, which can be inserted transcutaneously into the malar eminence, provides excellent three-dimensional control of the fracture. If reduction of the fractures is unstable, or if there is question regarding the accuracy of the reduction, the author recommends proceeding to open reduction and internal fixation. The zygomaticomaxillary buttress is exposed first and stabilized with a plate if necessary. The zygomaticofrontal buttress is exposed next and is also stabilized with a plate if required. This method requires proper patient selection, experience, and meticulous technique to ensure accurate reduction and stabilization.

Other authors recommend routine exposure of two or more of the three anterior buttresses for middle-

energy injuries: the zygomaticomaxillary buttress, zygomaticofrontal buttress, and the infraorbital rim. In this manner, multiple buttresses are visualized and three-dimensional accuracy of the reduction can be confirmed [26-29] (Fig. 23.7).

High-Energy Zygomatic Complex Fractures A more aggressive surgical approach should be planned to treat high-energy fractures [14, 25, 26, 30]. High-energy injuries often cause significant comminution of the anterior buttresses which makes anatomic reduction difficult. With segmentation of the zygomatic arch, it is impossible to control this posterior buttress (Fig. 23.8). Additionally, these fractures often require orbital reconstruction. To restore proper projection, facial width, and orbital volume, exposure of the zygomatic arch and orbital floor is

often necessary in additional to exposure of the anterior buttresses. A coronal flap is used to gain access to the zygomatic arch. A transcutaneous or transconjunctival incision is used to explore and reconstruct the internal orbit. With wide intraorbital exposure, the broad spherozygomatic suture may also be visualized to aid in anatomic reduction [14, 25, 26, 30, 31].

# Surgical Approach to the Zygomaticomaxillary Buttress

The best approach for visualization, reduction, and fixation of the ZM buttress is transorally, via a maxillary vestibular incision. An oropharyngeal pack is utilized throughout. Local anesthesia is infiltrated, and an incision is made in the maxillary vestibule  $3 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  above the mucogingival junction. The incision extends from the canine area to the first or second molar region and is full

thickness. The full-thickness mucoperiosteal envelope flap is elevated to expose the infraorbital nerve, piriform rim, and zygomaticomaxillary buttress. Additional superior dissection is used to visualize the infraorbital rim [32, 33].

# Surgical Approach to the Zygomaticofrontal Buttress Access and exposure for open reduction of the zygomaticofrontal buttress can be achieved through a lateral brow incision or an incision in the supratarsal fold. If a pre-existing laceration is present, it may be used for exposure of this region.

A lateral brow incision is performed by first palpating the frontozygomatic suture. A  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$  incision is made within the confines of the lateral eyebrow, parallel to the superior lateral orbital rim. Dissection is carried through the orbicularis oris and the periosteum to the fracture site.

Kung and Kaban described the use of a supratarsal fold incision to access the lateral orbit [34]. The incision is placed in a skinfold parallel to the superior palpebral sulcus above the tarsal plate, approximately  $10 - 14\mathrm{mm}$  above the margin of the upper eyelid. A  $2.0\mathrm{-cm}$  incision is usually provides adequate exposure, but the incision may be extended laterally to the crow's foot if necessary. Blunt dissection parallel to the orbicularis oculi muscle fibers separates them and exposes the lateral orbital rum. The dissection is continued, superficial to the orbital septum and over the lateral orbital rim. A vertical periosteal incision is made, and subperiosteal dissection will expose the fracture. The incision provides access to the fronozygomatic suture and results in a less noticeable scar.

# Surgical Approach to the Infraorbital Rim and Orbit

Access and exposure for open reduction of the infraorbital rim and orbital floor can be achieved through a subtarsal incision or transconjunctival incision. Protection of the globe with a scleral shield or tarsorrhaphy is recommended.

A subtarsal incision is made in a natural skin crease below the inferior border of the tarsus. Laterally the incision is a few millimeters below the lid margin, and as the incision courses medially, the incision is oriented

farther inferior. A scalpel is used to incise through skin. Orbicularis occuli is identified and dissected from the preseptal space. The muscle is then divided from the lateral to medial. In a preseptal plane, the dissection continues inferiorly until the infraorbital rim is reached. A periosteal incision is made on the anterior surface of the infraorbital rim. Subperiosteal dissection is then completed to expose the orbital rim and floor [35]. Regardless of technique, transcutaneous approaches are associated with a higher incidence of ectropion, increased scleral show, and cutaneous scarring [36-39].

To avoid complications associated with cutaneous incisions, many authors recommend the transconjunctival approach to the orbital rim and floor [39-42]. Tessier described this approach in 1973 [42]. The lower lid is retracted, and an incision is made below the lower border of the tarsus. Dissection is extended inferiorly, and a preseptal dissection superficial to the orbital septum is used to expose the infraorbital rim. Variations of this technique include a retroseptal dissection. This approach maintains the integrity of the lower lid but requires retraction of the orbital fat during fracture reduction and fixation [33]. A lateral canthotomy can be used to increase exposure. Meticulous repair of the lateral canthotomy is required to prevent asymmetry [33, 40, 42, 43].

# - Pitfalls in Surgical Approach to the Infraorbital Rim and Orbit

All approaches to the infraorbital rim and orbital floor can result in complications such as ectropion, entropion, and increased scleral show. Advocates of the transconjunctival approach cite increased rates of ectropion and scleral show with transcutaneous incisions [39-42]. Applying et al. found a  $12\%$  rate of transient ectropion, and a  $28\%$  rate of permanent scleral show with a subciliary approach versus no transient ectropion and only a  $3\%$  rate of permanent scleral show with transconjunctival approach [41]. Multiple factors have been proposed as the cause of increased scleral show and ectropion.

During dissection to the orbital rim, care should be taken to ensure the placement of the periosteal incision is on the anterior surface of the maxilla. An incision placed on the superior rim or posterior to the orbital rum may violate the orbital septum. Subsequent scarring and contractures of the septum may result in increased scleral show or ectropion [44].

# Surgical Approach to the Zygomatic Arch

In high-energy zygomatic complex fractures or secondary correction of zygomatic deformities, access is limited to conventional incisions. To obtain adequate exposure, a coronal incision combined with a lower eyelid approach is recommended.

The incision for a coronal flap extends through skin, subcutaneous tissue, and galea of scalp. Elevation of the coronal flap proceeds in the subgaleal loose area

lar connective tissue superficial to the pericranium. The temporal and preauricular plane of dissection is along the temporal fascia which can be identified by its glistening white appearance. A horizontal periosteal incision is made  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  above the supraorbital rim, and subperiosteal plane of dissection is developed to the superior and lateral orbit. An incision is made in the superficial layer of the temporal fascia from the posterior zygomatic arch to the previously exposed supraorbital region. The temporal fat pad should be identified. The dissection is extended inferior at this depth to the zygomatic arch and anteriorly to the lateral orbital rim. The facial nerve is protected within the flap [14, 33].

# 23.4.3 Internal Fixation

Historically, many different methods have been utilized for stabilization of zygomatic complex fractures. These have included antral packing, percutaneous wire fixation, and wire osteosynthesis. Currently, miniplate or microplate fixation provide the best results and minimal complications [43, 45-47].

There is no consensus regarding the number and type of plates required or the best location for internal fixation to best repair zygomatic complex fractures. The masseter and temporalis muscles as well as soft tissue contracture can cause rotational movements in multiple axes around the zygomatic buttresses. Internal fixation must provide enough stability to resist these forces

(  $\text{口}$  Fig. 23.9).

For low- and middle-energy fractures, stable fixation can be achieved at one or more of the anterior buttresses. The location of fixation and number of sites of fixation depend on the fracture pattern, location, vector of displacement, and degree of stability. Occasionally one-point fixation may be adequate, although more commonly two- or three-point stabilization is required [25, 28, 48-50]. The fractures must be reduced properly prior to fixation. This is best accomplished by exposing multiple sutures for anatomically accurate reduction and direct visualization. Additional fixation does not necessarily lead to improved outcomes if the fracture is not properly reduced [25, 51].

For high-energy injuries, a fourth point of fixation is required. The zygomatic arch is typically comminuted and laterally displaced. Open reduction and internal fixation are required to restore proper facial width and projection [14, 25, 26, 46, 51].

# Internal Fixation of the Zygomaticomaxillary Buttress

The zygomaticomaxillary buttress provides ideal location for internal fixation for middle- and high-energy fractures [52, 53]. Anatomic reduction of this fractures assists in restoring malar projection but is difficult if the buttress is comminuted. The overlying soft tissue is thick, and palpation of the plate is not a concern; therefore, 1.5 or 2.0 plates should be used for stabilization of the fracture [25, 28, 54, 55].

# Internal Fixation of the Zygomaticofrontal Buttress

The zygomaticofrontal buttress contains excellent bone for fixation and can accommodate a 2.0 plate [56] although these authors recommend using a smaller plate if palpable through the thin skin in this region. Reduction and fixation of this fracture will reestablish the vertical height of the zygomatic complex.

# Tips

The narrow interface of the ZF buttress makes it not very helpful in evaluating reduction of a rotated fracture [14, 57].

# Internal Fixation of the Infraorbital Rim

The infraorbital rim has poor quality of bone for internal fixation [56]. Additionally, the skin in this region is quite thin, and large plates are easily palpable. Despite these concerns, fixation of this site is required to restore proper orbital volume and facial width [56-58]. The infraorbital rim is typically rotated posteriorly and inferiorly [30]. The fracture should be mobilized anteriorly and superiorly and stabilized. Typically a 1.0 or 1.5

microplate is used to stabilize the infraorbital rim [28, 29, 32, 56]. A potential pitfall in reduction of this fracture is an unappreciated hemi-nasoethmoid fracture. If the infraorbital rim is secured to this undiagnosed, displaced segment, post-operative facial widening can occur [25, 57, 59].

# Internal Fixation of the Zygomatic Arch

Internal fixation of the zygomatic arch is required for high-energy fractures that demonstrate comminution and lateral displacement [14, 25, 26, 30, 56]. Restoration of this sagittal facial buttress is important to restore proper facial width as well as projection. When internal fixation of the zygomatic arch is indicated, it is often reduced and stabilized first in the sequence of repair of high-energy injuries. Caution must be used in restoring a "straight" arch and not an anatomically correct "curved" arch, which will decrease facial projection. This fracture typically requires a large plate to resist deformational forces [56, 58].

# Sequence of Internal Fixation

As in the treatment of panfacial fractures, a systematic approach is helpful to ensure accurate restoration of facial height, width, and projection [30, 55]. For middle-energy injuries, these authors recommend exposure of all three anterior buttresses. The zygomaticofrontal suture is often stabilized first with a 1.0 or 1.5 plate to restore vertical dimension. This is followed by fixation of the zygomaticomaxillary fracture and fracture of the infraorbital rim. The orbital floor, if necessary to plate to restore proper orbital volume, is reconstruction after the zygomatic complex has been restored to its correct three-dimensional position [28, 55].

$\Theta$  In high-energy injuries, the zygomatic arch should be reconstructed first [14, 26, 30, 48, 55].

# Management of the Orbital Floor

Patients with middle-energy zygomatic complex fractures and no clinical or radiographic evidence of orbital disruption do not require exploration [25]. Middle-energy injuries with displacement of the orbital rim or floor or herniation of soft tissue into the sinus should be explored. Clinical indications for orbital exploration include enophthalmos, restriction of extraocular muscle function with a positive forced duction test, and persistent diplopia. High-energy injuries require a more aggressive approach, and the orbital rum and floor should be explored and reconstructed [25, 26, 28, 48, 56, 60].

Indications for exploration of isolated orbital floor fractures include CT scan evidence of a fracture and herniation of orbital tissue, enophthalmos, dystopia, disabling diplopia that does not improve over 7-14 days, and a positive forced duction test [48, 61-64].

# Treatment

Access to the floor is accomplished by a subtarsal or transconjunctival incision. Simple linear fractures may only require removal of entrapped tissue. Larger defects require reduction of the soft tissue and bone fragments from the sinus and reconstruction of the floor with a bone graft or implant. Exploration of the orbital floor is competed prior to reduction of the fracture. Reconstruction of the floor is completed after reduction and stabilization of the orbital rim [28, 56, 63].

The orbital floor may be reconstructed with an autograft, an allograft, or a prosthetic implant. Autograft sources include calvarium, iliac crest, or nasal septal cartilage and is not commonly used anymore [65, 66]. Allograft sources include lyophilized dura and cartilage [67]. Alloplastic implants include material such as titanium mesh, porous polyethylene, resorbable polydioxanone sheets, or poly-d-l-lactic acid. Each material offers different benefits for reconstruction including biocompatibility, strength, comorbidities, and ease of use. Titanium mesh is a strong, malleable material that can span the defect and be contoured to adapt properly [29, 68]. Titanium mesh prefabricated implants with or without porous polyethylene coating have been shown to have no difference in complication rate or reoperation rate [69]. Additionally, bioresorbable plates such as polylactide or polydioxanone have successfully been used to orbital reconstruction without evidence of clinical foreign body reaction [70, 71].

Regardless of technique or implant selection, anatomic restoration of the orbital volume is required to prevent postoperative enophthalmos [59-61, 68]. In complex fractures, a significant portion of the orbital floor may be comminuted or missing. Prior to placement of the implant or graft, the defect must be completed defined, and the graft or implant must be placed on an intact posterior "ledge" which may be  $35 - 38\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the orbital rim [72, 73]. Forced suction tests should be performed before and after the orbital floor exploration as well as after reconstruction to ensure no muscle entrapment [56, 63].

# Role of Bone Grafting

Early bone grafting is indicated for severe injuries in which there is loss of bone or extensive comminution. Comminution of the orbital floor and zygomatic buttresses is common in high-energy injuries. These zygomatic complex fractures are often associated with other severe midface fractures that require treatment. Grafts may help to achieve anatomic reduction and stability, as well as to prevent soft tissue contraction [74, 75].

# Postoperative Care

Zygomatic complex fractures violate the maxillary sinus. For this reason, the patient must avoid blowing

the nose. Antibiotics and decongestants are often prescribed such as ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, or cephalosporin may be used along with pseudoephrine as a decongestant [63]. Incisions are observed carefully for signs of infection. The eye is examined to document visual acuity and to rule out complications such as corneal abrasion. In high-energy zygomatic complex fractures or when there are multiple complex facial fractures involved, a CT scan may be obtained to evaluate the zygomatic complex reduction and orbital reconstruction [57, 63].

# Computer-Assisted Reconstruction

Complex fractures of the zygomatic complex or pan facial fractures can be difficult to restore proper projection and symmetry. Virtual surgery, or computer-aided surgery, can help ensure proper reduction and facial reconstruction. Virtual surgery consists of first obtaining accurate imaging of the patient. For zygomatic complex fractures, this is done by obtaining a facial bones CT with  $1\mathrm{mm}$  slices or less. Next, the images are reviewed and shared with the surgical planning software team who creates a 3D model. The bones are manipulated to proper position, often basing malar projection and appropriate orbital volume off of the contralateral side. In pan facial fracture cases, bony segments can be manipulated to ensure a symmetric result. In complex cases, intraoperative navigation may be used to evaluate reconstruction in real time in the  $x$ ,  $y$ , and  $z$  axes. Custom plates or orbital implants can be fabricated to use during surgery.

# 23.5 Complications

Although complications of zygomatic complex and zygomatic arch fractures are uncommon, the surgeon must recognize their signs and symptoms to provide appropriate care. Complications may occur in the early postoperative period or may manifest later in recovery.

# Infraorbital Paresthesia

The incidence of sensory alteration of the infraorbital nerve following zygomatic trauma ranges from  $18\%$  to  $38\%$  [4, 15, 76, 77]. Studies by Vriens and colleagues as well as Taicher and colleagues have found improved recovery of infraorbital sensation following open reduction and internal fixation at the zygomaticofrontal suture compared with reduction without fixation [73, 78]. Contrary to those studies, Nordgaard reported no substantial difference in neurosensory outcomes between those patients who had surgery to treat the zygomatic complex fracture and those who did not [5]. Presumably, anatomic reduction of the fracture may minimize compression of the nerve and allow for recovery. In Vrien's

study, the same degree of improvement seen in patients with open reduction and internal fixation of zygomatic complex fractures was not seen in patients requiring orbital floor exploration and reconstruction.

# Malunion and Asymmetry

Inadequate reduction or stabilization of zygomatic fractures may result in malunion or asymmetry [14, 15, 25, 30]. Poor malar projection is the result of the uncorrected inferior and posterior rotation of the zygoma. Increased facial width, in addition to decreased malar projection results from inadequate reduction of the zygomatic arch as part of a high-energy orbitozygomatic injury [30].

Malunion that is recognized up to 6 weeks after injury may be corrected using routine zygomatic reduction techniques. Correction of mild late deformities includes autogenous onlay grafts or placement of alloplastic implants such as porous polyethylene [26]. Severe late posttraumatic deformities may require zygomatic osteotomy and repositioning. Cranial bone grafting may also be required. Scarring and contraction of the periorbital soft tissue may also occur [78].

# Enophthalmos

Reconstruction of a fractured zygomatic complex can lead to an increase or decrease in orbital volume and can therefore cause enophthalmos or exophthalmos, respectively. Grant et al. described the clinical problem of enophthalmos eloquently by comparing the shape of the orbit to that of a cone. The volume of a cone is  $1/3(\pi r^2)$  h. The orbital rim position determines the radius of the cone and the anterior posterior orbital length is the height of the cone. In this equation, the radius is squared and small increased in the radius result in dramatic increases in volume. Clinically, poor alignment of the orbital rim may significantly increase the orbital volume and result in enophthalmos [60].

Orbital floor blowout fracture may also result in enophthalmos by increasing the orbital volume. CT technology allows for calculation of orbital volume and the predicted implications regarding orbital floor fractures leading to enophthalmos [73, 79-82]. Raskin et al. demonstrated that a  $13\%$  increase in orbital volume at 4 weeks results in significant enophthalmos  $(>2\mathrm{mm})$  [73]. The critical size of the orbital defect and herniation of orbital tissues have also been studied. In 2002, Ploder et al. reported that a mean fracture area of  $4.08~\mathrm{cm}$  or a mean displaced tissue volume of  $1.89~\mathrm{mL}$  was associated with greater than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of enophthalmos [83]. In general, approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}^3$  of displaced tissue equals  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of enophthalmos [84]. Enophthalmos or exophthalmos greater than  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  has been shown to be perceivable to the human eye [82].

Late repair of enophthalmos is technically challenging. Wide access with osteotomy of the zygoma, repositioning, and grafting is usually required. Redraping of the periorbital soft tissue including a canthopexy may be required [59-61]. The use of preoperative computed planning, custom cutting guides, or intraoperative navigation have been shown to be helpful in secondary reconstruction of orbital fractures [83, 85].

# Diplopia

Diplopia is a common sequela of midfacial fractures. The incidence varies between  $17\%$  and  $83\%$  and depends on the severity and pattern of the injury as well as the time of presentation following the injury [4, 70, 86-88]. Ellis et al. reviewed 2067 zygomatic complex fractures and noted a  $5.4 - 74.5\%$  incidence of diplopia [4]. Nondisplaced zygomatic complex fractures and isolated zygomatic arch fractures had the lowest incidence of diplopia and orbitozygomatic fracture with pure orbital blowout fractures had the highest incidence.

The principle causes of diplopia include edema and hematoma, entrapment of the extraocular muscles and orbital tissue, and injury to cranial nerves III, IV, or VI. Histologic studies by Iliff et al. have shown posttraumatic fibrosis of the extraocular muscles in response to injury. They hypothesize this may impair contractility and decrease excursions of the muscles [48, 89-91].

Axial and coronal windows of CT scans should be reviewed to assist with evaluation. Ophthalmologic consultation is recommended to rule out globe injury. Diplopia due to edema, hematoma, or neurogenic causes may resolve without intervention. Diplopia resulting from entrapment requires exploration and reduction of herniated orbital tissue [48, 62, 63, 65, 66, 89]. Postoperative diplopia from enophthalmos or exophthalmos requires revision surgery and improved anatomic reduction.

Persistent bothersome diplopia that does not resolve may require evaluation and treatment by an ophthalmologist.

# Traumatic Hyphema

Trauma to the eye may result in bleeding into the anterior chamber – the space between the cornea and iris. Ophthalmology consult is recommended for evaluation, as hyphema may result in increased intraocular pressure, vision loss, staining of the cornea, impaired accommodation, and re-bleeding. Goals of treatment include maintaining normal intraocular pressure and prevention of re-bleeding, which occurs in  $5 - 30\%$  of patients [92, 93].

Management of hyphema consists of supportive therapy including elevation of the head of bed and

patching of the injured eye. Medical management includes topical cycloplegics, corticosteroids, and betablockers. System antifibrinolytics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and osmotic agents may also be required. Rarely, surgical intervention by the ophthalmologist is required. Repair of fractures may be delayed.

# Traumatic Optic Neuropathy

Traumatic optic neuropathy may manifest as conditions ranging from mild visual deficit to complete visual loss. An ophthalmologic consultation is mandatory. Treatment varies depending on the cause but may include systemic steroids or surgery with orbital or optic nerve decompression. Treatment of facial fractures may be delayed [48, 94].

# Superior Orbital Fissure Syndrome

Superior orbital fissure syndrome is an uncommon complication following facial trauma. Presentation may include ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, forehead anesthesia, and a fixed dilated pupil. Proptosis may be present. Treatment may include reduction of fractures, steroids, orbital apex exploration, and aspiration of retrobulbar hematoma if present [95].

# Retrobulbar Hemorrhage

Retrobulbar hemorrhage is a rare but severe complication that may be the result of either the initial injury or the operative correction. Pressure from the hemorrhage may disrupt the retinal circulation and can lead to irreversible ischemia and permanent blindness. In a review of 1405 orbitozygomatic fractures, Ord reported a  $0.03\%$  incidence of postoperative retrobulbar hemorrhage with visual loss [96]. An emergent ophthalmologic consultation is necessary; however, decompression with lateral canthotomy and cantholysis should be delayed.

# Trismus

Patients with zygomatic fractures commonly present acutely with a complaint of trismus. However, there are cases of reduced mandibular range of motion following zygomatic complex fractures reported in the literature. The most likely cause is impingement of the zygomatic body on the coronoid process of the mandible. Trismus may also occur secondary to fibrous or fibro-osseous ankyloses of the coronoid to the zygomatic arch. A CT scan should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Coronoidectomy is the most common treatment. If the zygoma is improperly reduced, zygomatic osteotomy and repositioning may be necessary to restore unrestricted motion of the mandible [63, 97].

# Conclusion

Zygomatic complex fractures can be challenging to reconstruct depending on the mechanism of injury and severity of displacement. Properly reconstructed zygomatic complex fractures will restore facial symmetry including projection of the midface and volume of the orbit. In order to achieve optimal results in displaced ZMC fractures, it is crucial to open and evaluate the anterior buttresses for adequate visualization of the reduction. For high-energy injuries, it is important to open and visualize all buttresses including the zygomaticotemporal. The use of intraoperative imaging and navigation can be useful tools to ensure facial symmetry is achieved.
