# 70.1 Introduction

Distraction osteogenesis (DO), osteodistraction, or callatosis, is a biologic process of new bone formation that occurs between bone segments that are separated by gradual incremental traction. This process commences when distraction forces are applied to the callous tissues that connect the divided bone segments and continues as long as these tissues are stretched by the applied forces. The traction generates tension that stimulates new bone formation in the gap parallel to the vector of distraction [1]. These factors are based upon the law of tension-stress that states that gradual traction on living tissues creates stresses that stimulate and maintain the regeneration and continued growth of both hard and soft tissues. DO is a surgical-orthopedic process, rather than an isolated surgical procedure, involving gradual separation of a fracture callous, which produces an unlimited quantity of new bone, with associated adaptive soft tissues changes, referred to as distraction histogenesis. Theoretically, the overlying soft tissue envelope, including the skin, subcutaneous tissues, muscles, fascia, and periosteum, respond favorably to the hard tissue movements with gradual elongation and accommodation and, therefore, a lower resistance and decreased overall bony relapse, although the clinical application of this theory has been questioned [2]. Although the principles of DO were developed many years ago, the application to the maxillofacial region began in the late 1980s and early 1990s [3]. Maxillofacial DO was applied to complex craniofacial deformities, including craniofacial microsomia, in an effort to grow bone and avoid the need for grafting and to reduce bone resorption and relapse associated with surgical movements. In consideration of the evolutionary stages of surgery in general, these four stages include ablation, reconstruction, transplantation, and induction [4]; DO is classified within the most progressive stage of induction, or regeneration, in that bone is formed de novo as a type of endogenous tissue-engineered bone. In the 1990s, DO was welcomed with a major paradigm shift in the approach to the craniofacial patient. Introduced as a new "disruptive technology" with wide applications in the maxillofacial region initially, DO was considered a panacea when, in fact, standard surgical techniques were perfectly ade

quate at the time. This overzealous enthusiasm has been followed by a period of intellectual reproach and a focus of the indications for this treatment scheme [5]. This reassessment phase has included a reappraisal of the myriad complications that may occur with DO as well as strategies for prevention and management [6]. In Ilizarov's opinion, "... there are no complications with the technique; there are only inexperienced surgeons causing problems for their patients," [7] but perhaps the more important issue here is to define the indications for the use of craniomaxillofacial DO. These indications include craniosynostosis and skull base deformities; total midface discrepancies, maxillary and mandibular orthognathic discrepancies; mandibular condylar abnormalities including ankylosis; severe asymmetries of the maxillofacial region; maxillary alveolar cleft deformities; segmental defects of the jaws due to trauma or pathology; neonatal airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency; and alveolar ridge deficiencies (Table 70.1). Despite the controversies surrounding the current indications for DO, the technique provides an additional arm in the treatment algorithm for congenital and acquired dentoskeletal deformities, with the advantages of no bone grafting or donor site morbidity and the ability to titrate the bony movements and grow an unlimited amount of new bone and with the disadvantages of a surgeon learning curve, vector control problems, and patient and parent cooperation during the entire DO process. With the application of maxillo

facial DO to the appropriate clinical scenario, there are clear advantages over conventional orthognathic and craniofacial surgical procedures, but it has become clear that DO will not replace standard surgical techniques, which can adequately accomplish the treatment goals in one surgical procedure, rather than through a process of gradual bone DO, which may take from weeks to months of treatment time.

# 70.2 History of DO

DO was developed initially for orthopedic lengthening of long bones for a variety of problems. Although Ilizarov is generally credited with the concepts involved

with distraction osteogenesis, it was Codivilla who first described the technique for femoral expansion in 1905 [8] (Fig. 70.1); and later, Abbott, in 1927 [9], used DO for tibial lengthening. In fact, Ilizarov is known as the "father of distraction osteogenesis," because he described the accepted principles of distraction osteogenesis in 1971 [10] that are still utilized clinically today. Ilizarov popularized the tension-stress effect by applying gradual traction to fractures and nonunions of endochondral long bones using large, external halo-type distraction devices (Fig. 70.2) and recognizing that the increased cellular activity and metabolic response with neovascularization led to ossification of the site with bony union without the need for bone grafting. Ilizarov then realized that the mass or shape of these bones and joint articulations depends to a great extent on the available blood supply to the area as well as the functional burdens placed upon the bones (Wolff's law). Although orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons had been utilizing the principles of DO for years in the management of transverse maxillary deficiency, with both orthopedic sutural expansion in the growing patient and surgically assisted maxillary expansion in the adult, it was McCarthy, who performed animal studies in the late 1980s, that led to the clinical application of these principles to the maxillofacial region and the 1992 publication describing successful monofocal DO of the mandible in four children with craniofacial microsomia [11]. The average patient age was 6.5 years, with mandibular lengthening between 18 and  $24\mathrm{mm}$ , with an 11-20-month follow-up period with minimal morbidity

or complications. Before McCarthy, Snyder, in 1973 [12], used external DO devices in the canine mandible and, in 1977, Michieli and Miotti [13] used intraoral mandibular DO devices in the dog model. Throughout the 1990s, there was an explosion of new ideas related to DO device design, including external (extraoral and rigid external [halo] devices), internal (intraoral, subperiosteal, or buried), semipuried devices, toothborne or hybrid devices, and monofocal, bifocal, multifocal, and transport vectors, as well as the clinical indications for DO, including maxillary and mandibular deficiencies in the vertical, anteroposterior, and transverse planes, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, obstructive sleep apnea, neonatal airway compromise, mandibular continuity defects after tumor ablation or trauma, craniosynostosis, vertical and horizontal alveolar ridge deficiency, alveolar cleft maxillary deficiency, and alveolar cleft discontinuity. Since the explosion of interest in maxillofacial DO in the 1990s, surgeons who have experience with DO have focused the clinical indications for this technique and typically consider DO as an option only when conventional techniques for surgical correction are limited. In fact, only  $4\%$  of centers actively involved in performing DO on a regular basis have performed more than 100 cases of DO, making the designation of "experienced" a questionable misnomer. Dentoalveolar PDL distraction osteogenesis was initially reported by Liou et al. in 1998 [14]. Dentoalveolar distraction osteogenesis was initially described by Iseri et al. [15] Even in the small number of known "DO centers," the reported incidence of complications with multivector DO is nearly  $25\%$  [6]. Therefore, in general, with other factors equal, the procedure with the lowest "cost" to the patient, in terms of finances, treatment time, and patient morbidity, should be used.

# 70.3 Biological Basis of DO

Regarding the overall process of new bone formation and transformation that occurs as a result of DO, this begins with the formation of a hematoma at the site of the corticotomy, or bone fracture, as expected, with organization of the clot as functional stresses are introduced with DO. As the process of DO progresses, the histologic appearance of the bone in the distraction gap becomes organized into four distinct zones of varying bone maturation (Fig. 70.3), including a central zone of fibrovascular granulation tissue composed of collagen fibrils and new capillaries that are oriented parallel to the vector of distraction. The next zone is that of extending bone formation, followed by the zone of bone remodeling, and finally, the zone of mature bone, which gradually transitions into the normal adjacent native cancellous bone. Throughout the latency, activation,

Fig. 70.3 Healing of the distraction gap with four zones of bone formation (central, extending bone, bone remodeling, and mature bone zones)

and consolidation phases of distraction, this bone gradually transforms from immature, woven bone with neovascularization to a more mature lamellar bone end product with minimal callus formation (Fig. 70.4). As the consolidation continues, the periosteum becomes proliferative and will re-form a cortical outline around the newly formed cancellous marrow; this cortex is responsible for the strength of the bony consolidate that will prevent relapse.

# 70.4 Overview of Risk of DO

Without a doubt, since the early 1990s, the unbridled enthusiasm about DO of the maxillofacial region has waned significantly since the resurgence of the technique and application to the maxillofacial region in the early 1990s [5]. Although the proposed benefits of DO that would allow it to replace traditional osteotomies for orthognathic surgery have not been borne out in clinical practice, DO maintains a place in the treatment of craniofacial malformations, specifically severe deformities, in which there are poor conventional options for patient management. One of the major advantages of DO is the ability to lengthen bones to a greater degree than would be possible with orthognathic surgery, owing to the limitations based upon the envelope of discrepancy [16]. Unlike orthognathic surgery, the DO technique is not age-limited and could be applied not only to the skeletally immature child but also to the neonate with upper airway obstruction due to retrognathia in order to avoid a tracheostomy and permit normal speech and language

development. DO is titratable, in that the clinician can continue to separate the bony segments until the desired results have been achieved (e.g., negative anterior overjet to account for some bony relapse or open airway at the tongue base in the Pierre Robin birth asphyxia patient). Also, the soft tissues are stretched slowly with DO so that they may gradually adapt to the bony movements and result in potentially less relapse than that achieved with conventional orthognathic surgery performed without rigid fixation techniques. In addition, regarding the TMJ, the mandibular condyle and disc position has additional time to adapt to any rotational changes that occur during distraction over a period of days or weeks, rather than acutely during orthognathic surgery in a period of minutes or hours. Also, with DO, there is no potential donor site morbidity from the need for bone graft harvesting, which may be necessary, although uncommon, with orthognathic surgery. Both techniques are typically performed in the outpatient setting and, in fact, essentially in the same technical procedure, with application of distraction devices in lieu of plates and screws for orthognathic surgery. The cost of the DO procedure would typically be greater than orthognathic surgery because it usually requires two surgical procedures with general anesthesia in a hospital setting, and many more postoperative visits for the patient and family, as well as the additional cost of the actual DO devices, which is much greater than the cost of plates and screws. The disadvantages of DO include the additional time required for the entire treatment process,

potential surgeon inexperience with a highly technique-sensitive procedure, the need for parent and patient cooperation, low incidence of major infection with maxillofacial DO, nerve paresthesia (trigeminal, facial nerves), TMJ dysfunction, facial scarring (pin tracts) from external devices, premature fusion of segments, malunion, device hardware failure with screw loosening and plate fracture, and relapse with the need for initial overcorrection. In addition, the issue of growth of the craniofacial skeleton after DO is unpredictable. In general, it is believed that in the syndromic patient, the deficient bone, or involved side of the jaw (e.g., hemifacial microsomia) has less inherent growth potential and may not grow normally after surgical correction, despite Wolff's law. Functional remodeling is expected to play a role in the growing process, yet overcorrection of  $25\%$  to  $33\%$  is advocated to allow for some relapse of the bony consolidate and expected lack of continued "normal" growth. Because more patients who had DO in the 1990s as children are growing into adolescence in the new millennium and at the present time, an assessment of these growth issues may allow further clarification in the future.

Another controversial advantage of DO in the adolescent cleft patient undergoing maxillary advancement is the theoretical lower incidence of velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) development, or worsening, than with a standard Le Fort advancement. Based upon the present available literature, there is no consensus on VPI or speech alterations when comparing DO with Le Fort

osteotomies [17]. In assessing the magnitude of maxillary advancement on VPI, other studies have shown no significant improvement in speech hypernasality, or VPI, with DO movements less than  $15\mathrm{mm}$  [18]. Perhaps the most appropriate manner in which to consider the issue of VPI is to classify the preoperative VPI status into mild, moderate, and severe VPI and then evaluate the possible outcomes of either Le Fort osteotomy or DO. In most cases, mild or moderate VPI cases may progress to moderate to severe VPI, whereas severe VPI is not likely to improve after maxillary advancement with either form of surgery, and other surgical options are usually required to address this problem independently (e.g., pharyngeal flap procedure).

The potential complications of the DO process are many and variable, and the problem is that not many surgeons or surgical teams have extensive experience in managing patients who have undergone DO. Complications can vary from mild (superficial infection around distractor arm wound site) to severe (complete hardware failure). Complications of DO may occur during the preoperative phase, intraoperative phase, distraction phase, or postdistraction phase of the treatment process. In the preoperative phase, patient selection and vector planning are critical, and application of DO to the inappropriate patient or for the wrong indication may be problematic. Intraoperatively, an inadequate corticotomy may be performed, and the DO devices may be placed with an improper vector or with lack of sufficient device stability. During the distraction phase, the device may malfunction, the vector may proceed in an improper fashion, and there may be dehiscence of the overlying soft tissues as well as facial scarring. In the postdistraction phase, there may be an inadequate total distraction distance, minor infections, a fibrous union, or malunion of the bone segments due to inadequate bony consolidation in the distraction gap, resulting in potential bony relapse. Overall, many retrospective reviews [19] have shown that the most common complication with DO is nerve paresthesia (5% long-term), infection (<5%), condylar morphologic changes, incomplete osteotomy by the surgeon, device breakage, patient compliance problems, premature consolidation of bone, pin tract scarring, hypertrophic facial scarring, damage to teeth and roots, improper vector direction, TMJ ankylosis, hematoma at the distraction site, and periodontal problems. As expected, the more complex the DO device used (multivector vs. univector), the higher the incidence of complications, and patients of advanced age also have a higher incidence of complications, especially persistence of nerve paresthesia. In both animal [20] and clinical [21] studies, the incidence of prolonged paresthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve is variable, but generally remains low with mandibular DO corticotomies; and younger patients recover spon

taneous neurosensory function more rapidly after nerve injury and to a greater degree or magnitude than older patients. With regards to the development of TMJ problems after DO, several reports have indicated the findings of hypomobility or fibrous ankylosis depend upon the specific direction and magnitude of mandibular movement, although more recent studies indicate that the TMJ accommodates to the DO process with no long-term functional TMJ abnormalities after mandibular DO [22].

# 70.5 Principles of DO

Although the original description of the technique of DO by Ilizarov has been modified and should be adjusted based upon the specific clinical scenario and location of distraction, the basic principles remain unchanged (Table 70.2). The first principle involves the surgical technique used to create the separation between the bones. For long bones and the mandible, a corticotomy is performed, rather than a complete osteotomy, in order to preserve the endosteal continuity and blood supply in the distraction gap before the initiation of distraction in order to support the internal milieu of the ensuing distraction gap and provide the most conducive environment for bone formation (Fig. 70.5). This has been referred to as "rotational osteoclasis." In most cases, a reciprocating or micro-oscillating saw, or rotary handpiece with a thin fissure bur, is used to perform the majority of the corticotomy, and a bone chisel and osteotome are used to complete the bony fracture. An ultrasonic bone-cutting instrument is often helpful in minimizing morbidity to vital neurovascular structures.

In the mandible, the location of the corticotomy is typically in the body, angle, or ramus region, depending

upon the intended distraction vector, horizontal (body), oblique (angle), or vertical (ramus), and a corticotomy will not section across the inferior alveolar canal or damage developing tooth buds that would occur if a complete osteotomy were performed. For the maxilla, a true corticotomy is not possible owing to the nature of the thin bone so, a standard Le Fort osteotomy is generally performed. At the same time as the corticotomy, the DO device is applied to the mandible, and the specific device and planned vector dictate the angulation of the corticotomy itself; so, in many cases, the device is applied before performing the corticotomy in order to visualize the area for the planned corticotomy and for placing a score mark in the midpoint between the stabilization plates and the screws of the DO device. Depending upon the specific DO device used, it may be secured to the mandible from an extraoral transcutaneous approach using transcutaneous pins that are then secured to the devices, or transoral DO devices may be secured to the mandible with standard bone screws. The extraoral pins should be placed parallel to each other and perpendicular to the distraction vector, and in order to minimize pin tract scarring, it is advisable to pinch the skin and subcutaneous tissues together between the pins during transcutaneous pin placement. Before wound closure during surgery, the distraction devices must be activated to confirm that movement of the bone segments will proceed in an uninterrupted fashion, because failure to achieve segment distraction at the time of surgery must be corrected at this point in time during surgery. Many times, this maneuver will stretch the cancellous bone,

but may also minimally convert the corticotomy to an osteotomy through physical separation of the bony segments. Often the device may be activated before placement to create room between bony segments when applying distractors. After activation of the devices at surgery, deactivation should occur in order to bring the bone edges in close proximity without compressive forces.

In distraction at the Le Fort 1 level, distractors may be applied only after the maxilla has been adequately mobilized. Once done, the mobilized maxilla should be placed in its native position and distractors are then applied. A stereolithographic model can aid in distractor placement before applying to the patient. This also aids in vector orientation and parallelism among the distractors. As in the mandible, the distractors should be activated to ensure mobilization. An alternative technique in where the surgeons aim for but fall short of advancing the maxilla to the goal distance using traditional orthognathic surgery, distractors may be used intraoperatively to advance the maxilla to the desired position where it can be left serving as rigid fixation. This can be used to expand the soft tissue envelope that is often scarred and restricted in the cleft patient. Alternatively, rigid fixation may be applied and the distractors may be removed.

In distraction of the midface at the Le Fort II, Le Fort III, and monobloc level, distractors are applied only after adequate mobilization of the facial skeleton. Once returned to native position, the distractors are applied at the appropriate bony interface. Closure of the

wound, which is often provided by a coronal scalp incision, may be difficult given history of previous surgeries, and increase volume within the wound from the distractors.

The second principle is the latency period, defined as the interval between the initial surgical procedure (corticotomy and device application) and the device activation, typically ranging from five to 7 days (Table 70.3). This is stage of distraction that varies most between providers and between sites. The primary reason for the delay between osteotomies and start of active distraction is to permit the establishment of a fibrovascular bridge across the endosteum of the bony segments that will act to support future bone formation during the distraction period. This time delay is prudent considering that even if a corticotomy is performed, there may be transient interruption of endosteal continuity and vascularity owing to the initial surgical insult as well as postsurgical edema. Within the first 24 hours, there is vascular ingrowth and mesenchymal cell proliferation, and within 24-72 hours, the early stages of granulation tissue (fibroblasts and capillaries) formation begin. Therefore, the supportive fibrovascular connection across the corticotomy site should be established in a 5-7-day period in the skeletally mature patient. The specific length of time chosen for this latency period is critical because waiting too long may result in premature fusion of the segments with inability to perform distraction and not waiting long enough may result in the lack of a stable vasculature in the bony gap, leading to a nonunion, or fibrous tissue interposed between the bony segments at the completion of distraction. The latency period is also age-adjusted, such that a shorter period is used for children (2-3-day latency) and neonates (zero

day latency), whereas a longer period is employed for elderly patients (7-10-day latency).

The third DO principle involves the activation period, or turning of the distractors, which includes both the rate and the rhythm, or frequency, of distraction. It is critical for the treatment team to carefully document the date of osteotomies and application of distractors, and the date of activation of the distractors, the number of turns of the distractor arms per activation session (rate), the number of sessions the arms are turned per day (rhythm), the distance distracted per day, and total distance of distraction per day. For the typical adult patient, the usual rate of distraction is  $1.0 \mathrm{~mm}/$  day in divided increments, generally  $0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$  twice daily. All of this information should be documented in a bedside calendar and in the daily progress note (Table 70.4). Again, age plays a significant role in the decisions regarding rate such that in children and adolescents, a rate as high as  $2.0 \mathrm{~mm}/$  day may be chosen, whereas for neonatal distraction, the rate can vary from 1.0 to  $3.0 \mathrm{~mm}/$  day. If the rate is too slow, especially in the very young patient, there may be premature fusion of the proximal and distal segments, whereas too rapid a distraction rate may result in a fibrous nonunion because the microvasculature may be compromised. Alternatively, and if the rate of distraction is too fast, this increases the risk of an "hour glass" deformity of the distracted bone and regenerate. The specific rhythm used is a subject of debate because, initially, it was believed that continuous distraction throughout the day would be ideal, although it appears as if incremental, intermittent traction of the bony segments produces advantageous periosteal stresses that serve to enhance bone regeneration in the distraction gap. Therefore, once a day, or twice-daily

(bid) rhythms are employed in most patients for ease and patient compliance, so that distractions may occur at set times each day (e.g., 8:00 'L and 8:00 OL). If there is discomfort during the distraction activation, especially toward the end of the process when bone healing is advanced and consolidation is beginning, the rhythm may be reduced (e.g.,  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  qid to  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  to bid), and predistraction analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) may be helpful for patient comfort. Typically, each specific distraction device is supplied with a screwdriver to activate the distraction arm, with an "arrow" inscribed on the screwdriver (Fig. 70.6), as well as the distance of distraction achieved with one complete 360-degree turn of the screwdriver to ensure that patients or parents perform the turns correctly. Multivector devices may add confusion because there may be more than one movement performed during each activation of the device (x, y, and z axes). It should be remembered that the bony regenerate is "moldable" during this period, and it could be influenced by the use of orthodontic elastics, which can also affect the occlusal relationships of the dentition. Alternatively, temporary anchorage devices (TAD) are helpful with altering the vector of distraction without moving the dentition (purely skeletal movement). This plasticity of the distraction bone can be used to bend the bone in cases in which vector correction is required (e.g., use of vertical anterior elastics for closure of an anterior open bite malocclusion). Most authorities share the opinion that external distraction devices such as the RED allow for more control of vector, when compared to "internal" buried devices that have one or, in the case of multivector devices, two vectors of movement. [23] However the authors have the opinion that with the use of orthodontic elastics and/or TADs, the vector of internal devices can be "molded" during the distraction phase.

The fourth principle of distraction involves the consolidation period, or period of neutral fixation, and has a great degree of variability based upon surgeon preference. This is the period of time for bony consolidation that occurs between the completion of distraction and the removal of the distraction device. In the adult patient, this is usually 8-12 weeks, whereas in the young patient, there may be sufficient strength a much shorter time frame after distraction. Though, even in the neona

tal population, most surgeons wait an average of at least 12–16 weeks [2]. It has been suggested that the consolidation period should at least equal twice the activation (distraction) period, so that the time is based upon total distraction distance; for example, if the activation period was 14 days, then the consolidation period should be approximately 28 days in length. Again in any patient older than a neonate, most surgeons will wait significantly longer. During the consolidation period, in the case of an external mandibular distraction appliance, a large, bulky extraoral multivector device may be replaced with a lightweight carbon fiber rod supplied by the companies for patient comfort. There is extreme variability in the length of the consolidation period because it is unclear exactly when device removal is appropriate and will not result in relapse owing to premature removal. This is perhaps the phase where internal devices are most advantageous. That is, that after distraction is complete, distractor arms can be removed from the buried distractor left behind, leaving the distractor arm wounds to heal, leaving only the prominence of the distractor under the skin and soft tissues as evidence that a buried distractor exists (Fig. 70.7). An objective means of evaluating whether bony stability would exist if the DO devices were removed is limited to radiographic documentation that a bony cortex exists or that there is sufficient bone fill in the distraction gap. Because this period of the DO process is the least understood and adds the most time to the overall DO process, there has been a great deal of research interest in acceleration of the consolidation period by treating the distraction gap region with either chemical factors, such as growth factors, cytokines, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-  $\beta$  -1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as physical factors, including ultrasound stimulation, low-level laser stimulation [24], and electromagnetic therapy.

The fifth, and final, principle of distraction involves the removal of the DO device. Depending upon whether the devices are intraoral, extraoral, buried, or pin-retained, removal may be a simple procedure performed under local anesthesia or intravenous sedation in an outpatient clinic or it may require more extensive surgery performed under general anesthesia in an operating room setting. Unlike in the consolidation period, where internal buried devices are advantageous, this is the period where external devices are clearly beneficial when compared to internal buried devices. In the case of external mandibular distraction devices, or in the RED devices used for midface distraction, devices can often be removed in clinic. Conversely, internal buried mandible devices need to be removed in the operating room setting. In the case of an internal buried mandibular distractor, the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve is again placed at risk, and devices are often covered with bone requiring, in some instances, bone removal to remove hardware, and given the dissection, there is stripping of the periosteum leading to a chance of additional or long-term growth restriction of the mandible. In the case of internal buried distractors at the midface level (i.e., Le Fort II, II, and monobloc), device removal requires re-entering a coronal incision, and dissection of the temporalis muscle which carries the risk of associated temporal wasting and hallowing. In addition there is a chance of additional scarring and chance of morbidity to the frontal branch of the facial nerve. There are technical developments ongoing that may allow the foot plates of buried devices to remain attached to the bone, possibly with resorbable materials (e.g., oly-G-lactic acid [PGLA], poly-L-lactic acid [PLLA] co-polymers), which would make the removal of buried devices simpler without the need for extensive re-exposure of the surgical site. Further refinements and technologic advances in materials may allow fabrication of completely resorbable DO devices in the future. It should be noted that, in some cases, surgeons may choose to place titanium bone plates and screws in a conventional orthognathic surgical manner at the time of DO device removal (i.e., "hybrid" DO-orthognathic procedure) to prevent relapse in specific circumstances in which relapse is a major concern (e.g., Le Fort advancement in the cleft patient).

# 70.6 Patient Evaluation and Vector Planning

A comprehensive history and clinical examination should be performed in a manner similar to that done for the orthognathic surgical patient with an asymmetry. Particular attention should be directed toward examining the patient in a natural head position (NHP), despite

asymmetries in orbitozygomatic position, ear deformities, and occlusal cants. Frontal, profile, bird's-eye, and worm's-eye views are helpful to visualize both hard and soft tissue volume and landmarks. A functional TMJ examination should be performed, especially with mandibular asymmetries. The standard radiographic evaluation should be used, including periapical radiographs to plan for interdental osteotomies, if necessary, a panoramic radiograph to assess the dentition and condylar/ramus morphology, and a posteroanterior cephalometric radiograph to assess orbitozygomatic discrepancies and occlusal cants. Care must be taken to maintain the patient's head in the NHP during the cephalometric films such that in cases of microtia, or melotia (low-set ears), the ear rod on the affected side is allowed to contact the scalp passively in the temporal region, and it is not placed within the external auditory canal as on the unaffected side. The use of three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scanning and computer planning is becoming invaluable in the assessment and treatment planning of craniofacial asymmetries and also in DO device design and vector planning.

The choice of distractor device depends upon several variables, including the specific anatomic abnormality, the desired distraction vector, the overall magnitude of bony movement, the planned surgical access, as well as access for device activation, patient and parent preferences, and surgeon experience. The DO devices are classified according to several factors. In relation to the skin surface, DO devices may be external or internal, and these internal devices may be buried or semiburied and placed transorally or transfacially. Devices may also be classified according to the type of tissue that anchors the devices, including boneborne, toothborne, or hybrid (a combination of bone- and toothborne) devices. Lastly, devices are classified according to the number of potential vectors of movement (Fig. 70.8) as monovector (or univector or unidirectional, one vector), biplanar or bidirectional (two vectors), and multivector (or multi-planar, more than three vectors) devices. In general, the need to use a multivector device requires external placement with potential facial and pin tract scarring; but this problem should be balanced with the advantages of ease of access to the activation devices, having full control of multiplanar vectors in three planes of space (x, y, and z axes), and the ease of removal. Monovector devices usually require only one corticotomy and use a "straight screw" type device to achieve simple linear elongation of bone in a vertical, horizontal, or oblique vector. A bidirectional device may require two corticotomies performed perpendicular to each vector and the use of a specific device to achieve both vector movements, or a specialized device may be used with only one corticotomy to achieve biplanar movement (Fig. 70.9). For maxillary distraction, either internal or external devices

may be used (Fig. 70.10) and the RED (rigid external device), which may use maxillary occlusal splint, or bone plate that connects to an external multivector control arm, is used for maxillary and midface distraction in cleft and craniosynostosis cases.

The issue of distraction vector, or trajectory of movement of the bone segments, is important to consider for

both the maxilla and the upper face as well as the mandible. However, most efforts have focused on distraction vector planning in the mandible (Fig. 70.11). Virtual surgical planning is an invaluable tool to help the surgeon assess the presurgical anatomy of the patient, design osteotomies, choose movements and vectors based on desired movements, choose the distractor device, and

![](images/8ef341a921fc6e2d357af932a2f4df668a885a42f97c257ea2db8f0d08f9644d.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 70.9 Oblique osteotomy with vertical and horizontal vector Wood distraction device

virtual choose the final occlusion (Fig. 70.12). In the case of mandibular distraction, the three mandibular vectors are based upon the relationship of the direction of the corticotomy to the occlusal plane. A vertical vector, perpendicular to the occlusal plane, is achieved with a horizontal osteotomy of the ramus, whereas a horizontal vector, parallel to the occlusal plane, results from a corticotomy performed vertically in the body or angle region of the mandible. An oblique vector, resulting in both vertical and horizontal elongation of the mandible, will result when the corticotomy is performed at an angle between zero degrees (the vertical vector) and 90 degrees (the horizontal vector) to the occlusal plane, generally in the angle region of the mandible. With regards to vector planning, it must be recognized that there are both biologic and mechanical forces that will significantly affect the direction of distraction (Fig. 70.13). The biologic vectors result from the neuromuscular soft tissue envelope, including the muscles of mastication and suprahyoid musculature. These forces may influence the distraction vector unpredictably, and the surgeon has little control over these factors. The mechanical vectors, conversely, are under full control of the surgeon and orthodontist involved in the care of the distraction patient. These mechanical forces include the distraction device itself, the intercuspation of the teeth, bone segment contact, the TMJ apparatus, and of course, the angulation of the corticotomy and DO device placement that determines the actual direction of vector movement. As an example of the result of the combined biologic and mechanical vector forces, a vertical distraction device in the ramus will result in counterclockwise rotation of the mandible with a posterior open bite occlusion, whereas a horizontal mandibular distraction vector has the tendency for clockwise rotation of the mandible with the development of an anterior open bite occlusion, due to the biologic vectors, including the

suprahyoid musculature (Fig. 70.14). Additional considerations in vector planning involve unilateral cases in which rotational forces also influence movement of the mandible (e.g., hemifacial microsomia). In an attempt to determine the precise placement of a distraction device to achieve the desired vector, a geometric formula may be used to allow proper positioning of the pins, or screws, of the distraction device. The pin (or screw) placement angle is determined by measuring the vertical and horizontal deficiencies in the mandible as well as the gonial angle of the mandible (condylion-gonionmenton), because this will dictate the intended vertical and horizontal movement of the mandible. The pin placement angle is determined (The formula is shown in Fig. 70.14): 180 subtracted by the gonial angle and multiplied by the product of the vertical deficiency (condylion-gonion distance) divided by the total deficiency (vertical plus horizontal [gonion-menton distance] deficiency). In the example shown with a  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  horizontal and a  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  vertical deficiency, with a gonial angle of  $140^{\circ}$ , the pin placement angle is  $20^{\circ}$  to the mandibular plane (gonion-menton). This formula can assist the surgeon if three-dimensional imaging and planning is not available. Remember that in the maxilla, the vector is mostly dependent upon the specific DO devices chosen (usually bilateral devices are necessary), including buried internal devices and REDs. There is generally a horizontal, or anteroposterior, vector in most maxillary distraction cases; however, vertical change may be achieved with intermaxillary vertical elastics or by variable adjustment of the external device and RED.

Regarding the technical aspects of distraction, the bone segments may be separated in a monofocal, bifocal, or trifocal fashion (Fig. 70.15). The monofocal mode will separate two bone surfaces in a standard DO fashion, whereas a bifocal distraction will utilize a transport disk of bone that is moved through the soft tissues toward another segment of bone. The trifocal mode will move two segments of bone as transport disks toward each other, and specialized devices are available to assist with transport distraction. The bifocal and trifocal modes of transport distraction are typically used for reconstruction of segmental defects of the mandible (Fig. 70.16). With transport distraction, the transport disk of bone will develop a fibrocartilaginous cap on the advancing front of the bone segment as it moves through the subcutaneous soft tissues. When used for mandibular segmental defect reconstruction, this cartilage cap must be resected at the time of device removal and may require additional bone grafting at the junction site as well as the use of rigid fixation devices for stabilization. The formation of this cartilage cap can be used as an advantage in cases of TMJ reconstruction with DO (Fig. 70.17). For example, in cases of TMJ anky

losis, after gap arthroplasty, a vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO; or variation) is performed with application of a distraction device with a vertical vector to distract the proximal bone segment into the newly created glenoid fossa. This particular transport disk will become the new condyle with a desirable cartilaginous cap to prevent future ankylosis, and it will function as a normal condyle as it assumes a more normal anatomic size, shape, and position [25].

sary, during distraction, and preparation of the dentition for DO, management of the dentition during active DO, and finalizing the occlusion at the completion of DO. The three phases of orthodontics for DO include predistraction, active distraction, and postdistraction treatments. Pre-DO orthodontics, especially in regard to midface advancement in the cleft and craniofacial patient, is similar to pre-orthognathic surgery preparation using fixed orthodontic appliances to eliminate dental compensations, coordinate arches, correct transverse deficiencies, correct occlusal disharmonies, eliminate crowding and potential dental interferences with distraction (e.g., retroclined maxillary incisors inhibiting forward mandibular movement), and creating root divergence at a tooth-bearing corticotomy site. As mentioned, orthodontic traction and occlusion is considered to be one of the mechanical vectors that is under the control of the clinician during active distraction. Dynamic changes are going on in the young patient with regards to the dentition and occlusion with transitioning from a primary to permanent dentition, vertical growth

of the alveolar process and jaws, and possibly premature occlusal contacts that develop during distraction resulting in functional shifts that may affect the vector movement. Therefore, active DO orthodontic intervention may include occlusal equilibration, the use of neutral occlusal bit plates, and fabrication of specific orthodontic stabilization devices to control mediolateral interarch relationships during distraction, especially with unilateral distraction vectors (Fig. 70.18). In the case of the patient in the mixed dentition stage, TADs may have to be used to provide adequate anchorage for desired orthodontic movements. This is especially helpful in the syndromic patient, who often has variability in tooth formation and eruption times. For unilateral mandibular distraction, two concerns are control of developing laterognathism and contralateral cross-bite occlusion. Laterognathism is the development of an asymmetrical habitual occlusion during DO that results in functional shifts toward the unaffected side, or in the direction of the distraction vector, that may limit the magnitude of distraction. Although functional appliances may be

used, typically cross-arch elastics are used to control laterognathism, but these forces directly oppose the forces of DO and, therefore, overcorrection may be indicated. For contralateral cross-bite control, transpalatal and lingual arches with both intermaxillary cross-arch elastic and unilateral cross-bite elasticities are used. Orthodontics with vertical elastics can also be used to decrease or eliminate developing open bites during distraction, by a combination of molding of the bony regenerate as well as tooth extrusion. This is especially helpful when using midface internal devices where the vector is set when compared to the RED, when the vector can be dynamic during distraction. It is the opinion of the authors that the vector of internal midface devices can be modified during active distraction with the use of orthodontic elastics. Also, for vertical vectors in the

ramus region to lengthen the ramus (e.g., hemifacial microsomia), it may be necessary to maintain the ipsilateral posterior open bite after mandibular plane leveling with a bite plate and sequential plate reduction to allow unimpeded maxillary growth. If active orthodontic intervention is used during distraction, then minimal postdistraction orthodontics may be required. Or just elastics to "retain" the dentofacial relationship may be needed. Post-DO orthodontics must consider whether orthodontic finishing can be completed in the nongrowing patient or whether a planned malocclusion was performed with the expectation of future growth (e.g., a class III occlusion with anterior occlusal cross-bite expecting future maxillary growth). Again, functional appliances (e.g., bionator therapy) may be used for up to 6 months after DO, depending on patient age, to mold

# 70.8 Mandibular Distraction

Mandibular anteroposterior hypoplasia constitutes the majority of dentoskeletal deformities that are treated with orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. DO should not be considered in cases in which standard orthognathic surgical techniques can be employed (i.e., sagittal split osteotomy [SSO], VRO). When considering the indications for DO, the magnitude of the skeletal discrepancy must be severe enough to warrant distraction, and typically, these types of deformities are due to congenital craniofacial abnormalities that may be a compo

ment of a syndromic diagnosis, such as hemifacial (or craniofacial) microsomia, Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins, Goldenhar's, or Nager's syndrome, or may also be associated with the myriad signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Age and size of the patient, is often the biggest determinant of whether to employ orthognathic surgery vs. DO. For example, in neonates with Pierre Robin Sequence, an SSO is not possible and therefore DO is the only reasonable option for mandibular advancement. In addition to congenital deformities, acquired mandibular retrognathia may result from condylar trauma or pathology that leads to TMJ ankylosis. DO can also be applied to the mandible to correct transverse mandibular deficiency with mandibular widening via distraction as well as segmental mandibular defects managed with transport distraction osteogenesis. Typically, DO is considered for these severe

deformities in which conventional orthognathic options are limited owing to the young age of the patient or the degree of bony movement, which may not allow application of rigid fixation, or in whom plates and screws may interfere with future growth, and the magnitude of soft tissue (skin, muscle, nerve) stretch that may not respond well to acute lengthening, and before the introduction of rigid fixation devices, may have contributed to relapse of the bony segments.

As mentioned previously, a wide variety of distraction devices are available for mandibular DO procedures, and these include external, internal, semiburied, toothborne hybrid devices, with monofocal, bifocal, multifocal, and transport distraction vectors. In cases of severe horizontal and vertical ramus deficiency, either a multifocal multivector device or a combined distraction device may be used to accomplish both vertical and horizontal distraction vectors simultaneously (Fig. 70.19). In cases of unilateral vertical ramus hypoplasia, for example, with hemifacial microsomia, a stable univector distraction device can be used to level the mandibular occlusal plane and allow unimpeded future growth of the maxilla using a maxillary splint that is sequentially reduced during vertical maxillary growth (Fig. 70.20). An

alternative option for a patient with a unilateral vertical ramus deficiency (e.g., hemifacial microsomia) is to consider performing bimaxillary osteotomies, application of intermaxillary fixation (IMF), and the use of only a mandibular distraction device that will result in distraction of both the mandible and the maxilla owing to the use of IMF (Fig. 70.21). Segmental defects of the mandible can be treated with the use of transport DO as mentioned previously, and ankylosis of the TMJ can also be managed with the use of a transport segment of bone that is distracted toward the glenoid fossa in order to create a new condylar head with fibrocartilage. In a manner similar to surgically assisted maxillary expansion, mandibular expansion with distraction may be accomplished with a midline mandibular osteotomy and the use of an external or internal device (Fig. 70.22).

A major indication for mandibular distraction is in the neonate with severe upper airway obstruction. This is most commonly seen in the patient with Pierre Robin Sequence. In the most severe cases of Pierre Robin Sequence, mandibular DO has become popular as an alternative to tracheostomy or tongue-lip adhesion [28]. These patients often have severe mandibular anteroposterior deficiency and airway obstruction with birth

asphyxia due to isolated obstruction at the base of the tongue. Most often, this technique is considered for the Pierre Robin (1923) [29] sequence patient with the triad of mandibular retrognathia and hypoplasia, glossoptosis due to an in utero problem of mandibular hypoplasia with lack of tongue descent, and upper airway obstruction. In addition, the patient may have a U-shaped cleft palate, but this is not necessary for characterization of Pierre Robin Sequence. This type of cleft palate is different from a traditional "V-shaped" cleft palate in that it is usually isolated without a cleft of the lip, alveolus, and anterior hard palate, and is caused by failure of closure of the palatal shelves in the

midline due to the glossosptosis and tongue being present. On exam of these patients, the cleft defect will often match the size of the tongue (Fig. 70.23) The airway obstruction is present at birth in  $70\%$  of infants and results in a mortality rate of  $2 - 26\%$  even in experienced centers. A variety of methods have been used to address the airway, including the EXIT (ex utero intrapartum treatment) procedure, in which immediate intubation is performed upon a staged delivery of the infant with the head delivered first for intubation. However in the Pierre Robin population, the EXIT procedure is reserved for those with the most severe upper airway obstruction on delivery where intubation is deemed (usually by in utero imaging) to not be possible [30, 31]. All conservative options should be exhausted in patients prior to any planning of any surgical maneuvers. In general, for mild airway obstruction in the neonatal period, positional head therapy (prone, lateral, head extension positions) is usually effective to open the posterior pharynx, relieve the tongue obstruction, and maintain arterial oxygen saturation. For moderate airway obstruction, nasal stents can be placed using a 3.0 endotracheal tube or other nasal airway device, such as a nasal trumpet. For severe obstruction, with difficulty maintaining inspired oxygen concentrations above  $90\%$  most of the time, either an anterior glossopexy (tonguelip adhesion) procedure can be used with a reported success rate less than  $50\%$  [32, 33]; a tracheostomy, which does not address the anatomical cause of the problem, can be performed, but is often associated with significant long-term morbidity, including tracheostomy care, psychosocial issues, speech developmental delay, skin scarring, tracheal stenosis, and the most severe complication of mucus plugging or dislodgement. Tracheostomy is associated with an average time of 18-36 months until removal. Mandibular DO can be performed in order to correct the etiology of the problem and allow future mandibular growth, without significant morbidity. It has been associated with a significantly lower rate of need for gastrostomy tube placement when compared with tracheostomy and tongue lip adhesion [34]. And when comparing pre- and post-polysomnograms, DO  $(92\%)$  had a higher rate of resolution of obstructive apnea when compared to tongue-lip adhesion  $(47\%)$  [35]. Among the few problems reported with neonatal mandibular distraction, alteration in the morphology of the condyle with reported cases of TMJ ankylosis has occurred [36], although other reports show no ankylosis and an adaptation of the condyle to the distraction process [37]. In addition, more common risks include morbidity to developing tooth buds and agenesis and malformation of teeth, failure of tooth eruption, infection, and neurosensory disturbance to the inferior alveolar nerve. The DO procedure will serve to advance the mandible,

elevate the hyoid bone, and relieve the obstruction at the tongue base; one of the major benefits of DO is the ability to titrate the degree of mandibular forward movement and continue until the airway obstruction has been relieved and confirmed by laryngoscopy. Owing to expected relapse in the young patient, over-correction is advocated, and creation of a reverse over-jet class III jaw relationship is preferable at the time of DO completion.

All other reasons for disordered breathing, besides upper airway obstruction, must be ruled out prior to undertaking distraction osteogenesis. The presence of other abnormalities of the upper airway must be ruled out with laryngoscopy (Fig. 70.24). Laryngomalacia or tracheomalacia would be relative contraindications to DO in the presence of combined upper airway obstruction due to tongue base obstruction and tracheostomy and may be warranted for severe airway obstruction.

goscopy can be done at bedside to assess the level of airway compromise and possible etiology. In addition, when a distraction procedure is planned, direct laryngoscopy can be done prior to the procedure during induction and intubation. Polysomnography should be considered. It is important to consider the distraction device options carefully for the very small mandible, and consideration should be given toward computer planning for vector planning, device assessment, use of SLA (stereolithography), and possibly fabrications of cutting guides to reproduce the virtually planned procedure (Fig. 70.25). Conventional options for neonatal distraction include either internal plate and screw devices or external pin devices (Fig. 70.26). Typically, the distraction rates in the neonate are accelerated over the typical adult rate of  $1.0\mathrm{mm/day}$  to a  $4.0\mathrm{mm/day}$  distraction rate in divided increments, and, in this manner,  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$  of distraction may be accomplished within a period of 7 to 10 days while the patient is in the intensive care unit of the hospital. After a consolidation period of approximately twice the distraction period (14-30 days), the devices can be removed; resorbable devices are available and clinical research continues to determine efficacy. Direct laryngoscopy should be considered at the time of device removal to assess the airway. Post distraction polysomnography should also be considered.

Post-operative care and adherence to instructions is of paramount importance. Distractor arms sites should be cleansed twice daily with a solution of  $\frac{1}{2}$  peroxide,  $\frac{1}{2}$  saline, or a similar cleanser. The nasal endotracheal tube should be checked multiple times throughout the day for position and any pressure on the nasal ala, as pressure for any significant period of time can lead to pressure necrosis of the skin and cartilage of the nose. In this population, any minute change in tube position in the airway can lead to dislodgement superiorly and unplanned extubation, or inferior mispositioning in the mainstem bronchus of the right lung. When distractor arms exit anteriorly, a shoulder roll should be placed so that the arms are kept off the patient's chest. While intubated, the patient's head should be maintained in a neutral position so no pressure is on the distractor arms. Extubation can usually take place after confirmation of a cuff leak and usually can take place on postoperative day 4 or 5 once the mandible is adequately advanced. Once extubated, the speech-language and pathology team can work with the parents and baby to begin feeding using special bottles suitable for those with a cleft palate. The most common complication when performing DO in this population with a buried internal device is a surgical site infection at the distractor arm site. These are best managed with expeditious recognition of this along with local management with aggressive wound care. Rarely, a bedside incision and drainage will have to be performed. Systemic antibiotic therapy may be needed for infections that do not resolve with local measures. The most catastrophic complication of neonatal mandibular DO is dislodgment and/or failure of the hardware. This may be attributable to surgical execution, but can also be associated with iatrogenic injury during the postoperative period (i.e., physical dislodgement of the distractors). Early recognition is key and will likely be noticed during turning of the activation arms, or on physical exam with a midline shift of the mandible toward the side of hardware malfunction/failure. Immediate imaging in the form of a CT should be obtained to assess the hardware and surgical site. Though rare, if this is encountered, immediate surgical intervention should be performed to address the hard

Distractor arms can be disengaged upon the completion of distraction, which is deemed complete when assessing the maxillomandibular alveolar relationship which should be overcorrected to be slightly class III in profile.

# 70.9 Maxillary Distraction (Le Fort I Level)

Maxillary DO has been performed for years by oral and maxillofacial surgeons and orthodontists using surgically assisted maxillary expansion techniques to address transverse maxillary deficiency. Similar considerations are made for maxillary DO as with mandibular DO in that DO should not be used in cases in which conventional orthognathic surgical procedures can be used. Maxillary DO at the Le Fort I level is typically reserved for cleft lip and palate patients, who have had numerous previous surgical procedures with severe maxillary anteroposterior hypoplasia, palatal scarring (possibly with a pharyngeal flap), and compromised blood supply to the maxillary

hard and soft tissues. These factors may result in difficulties with standard Le Fort surgery with problems with mobilization of the maxilla into the final forward position, an increased relapse potential compared with conventional orthognathic surgery even with rigid fixation, and worsening of speech and swallowing abnormalities or VPI, especially in the presence of a pharyngeal flap. Application of maxillary DO at the Le Fort II level may be used for unusual midfacial deformities of the nasomaxillary complex such as Binder's syndrome; use at the Le Fort III level is generally for cases of syndromic or nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, such as Apert's, Crouzon's, and Pfeiffer's syndromes. In most cases of maxillary DO performed at the Le Fort I level, semiburied intraoral devices are adequate. Virtual surgical planning is invaluable for choosing a device, assessing vector control, and for fabricating SLM models that can be used to adapt distractors (Fig. 70.27). Some advocate the use of a RED device for reported advantages of increase vector control.

In a fashion similar to that used for mandibular transport DO, maxillary segmental distraction may be used, especially in the area of an alveolar cleft defect for

closure without the need for bone graft procedures, using specialized distraction devices (Fig. 70.28).

Maxillary distraction may also be used at the Le Fort III level for craniosynostosis cases, although the usual unidirectional vector of distraction fails to address the complex three-dimensional nature of the skull and cranial base abnormalities (Fig. 70.29), and perhaps these deformities benefit from a one-stage surgical approach with cranial recontouring and application of small or resorbable fixation, without the need for DO device removal at a second surgical procedure, despite the potential DO advantages of maintenance of blood supply, less intraoperative blood loss, and lack of soft tissue limitation to cranial remodeling. Each patient must be evaluated independently to determine the most appropriate surgical procedure to achieve the desired result with the least patient morbidity.

# 70.10 Midface Distraction (Le Fort II, III, Monobloc and Facial Bipartition)

Midface advancement is a standard procedure in the treatment algorithm in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis [38-40]. It usually takes place at approximately 7-8 years of age but may be done earlier or later depending on patient associated variables. Movements at this age have been found to be stable over time. [41] Midface advancement is most commonly done with a subcranial Le Fort III osteotomy. Alternative procedures for midface advancement include Le Fort II osteotomy, monobloc osteotomy, and Facial bipartition [42, 43]. Briefly, when correction of midface hypoplasia and cranial forehead reconstruction is needed, monobloc advancement should be used. [44] And in the case of hypertelorism, the facial bipartition is the operation of choice [45]. Variations of these procedures such as Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning [46], or a combined monobloc and Le Fort II [47] have also been described for patients with Apert syndrome. [48] These osteotomies may be done in conjunction with external devices (i.e., RED) or internal semi-buried devices. The main reported advantage of the RED is the ability to control movement in the anterior/posterior, superior/inferior, and lateral/medial vectors. In addition, the surgeon can control pitch, roll, and yaw of the midface and adjust as needed during the distraction phase.

Le Fort III level internal distraction in syndromic craniosynostosis has some favorable characteristics when compared to external distraction (RED) [49].

When planning a Le Fort III osteotomy with internal semiburied distractor placement, virtual surgical planning is invaluable (Fig. 70.30). Advantages of internal distractor placement include delivery of the force of distraction at the most superior aspect of the midface complex, a more inconspicuous device to be worn during the distraction and consolidation phase when compared to the RED often leading it to be more accepted socially for older adolescent and teenage patients, and no additional scars or wounds other than the coronal incision as compared to the wounds often made by transfacial wires that may pass through with external distraction which often heals in an unsightly manner. Disadvantages of the internal device include morbidity to the lacrimal gland, trismus due to dissection of the temporalis during the surgical approach, and that the coronal incision has to be entered at device removal. This includes re-dissection of the temporalis muscle which may be associated with further trismus, temporal hollowing/wasting, and soft tissue scarring. Removal of the RED may be done in the clinical setting or under a brief sedation. Regardless of choice of distractor, the goal of distraction with contemporary Le Fort II, III, and monobloc advancement is to decrease the retro frontal dead space that is created after acute expansion of the craniofacial skeleton in traditional midface advancement and subsequent communication between the nasal cavities and anterior cranial fossa that led to an infection rate as high as  $30\%$ , resulting in sequelae such as meningitis, epidural abscess, and possible osteomyelitis of the frontal-facial skeleton [50-52].

# 70.11 DO for Craniosynostosis

DO for management of the cranial vault expansion in craniosynostosis is relatively novel and was initially reported in 2009. [53] Cranial distraction is a useful adjunct in both very young patients as well as patients who are older and in need of extensive expansion of the cranium. Given the relatively high rate of relapse in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis under Frontot-orbital advancement (FOA) at an early age, FOA is often delayed as long as possible [54]. Posterior cranial vault expansion can be used as an early temporizing measure in the first 6 months of life to minimize progression of the anterior deformity, and provide intracranial volume expansion with the hope of reducing an

abnormal increase in intracranial pressure. Additionally, neonates and infants have significant bony regeneration potential; however, in the older patient, that potential decreases significantly. Thus, with traditional cranial vault remodeling, the older patient requires complete reconstruction with careful attention being paid to ensure that every small defect is covered with bone, as the critical size defect, that is the size of the cranial defect that will fill in with bone, dramatically decreases with increasing age. Distraction offers significant cranial expansion with a possible decreased risk of relapse and/or bony defects. It may result in increased expansion, decreased operative time, decreased blood loss, decreased surgical risk, and a more stable cosmetic result [55] (Fig. 70.31).

Another advantage of posterior distraction is the need for only a single circumferential osteotomy centered on the torcula confluence of the sagittal and transverse sinuses. It should be noted that some surgeons prefer to make their osteotomy superior to the torcula citing safety concerns; others believe that inferior to the torcula is preferred because it results in increased posterior cranial fossa expansion. [55, 56]

A tailored approach is needed based on the specific needs of the child and age of the patient in question. With age, osteogenic potential decreases and a longer latency period is needed. In a child  $< 6$  months of age, a latency period of 1-2 days is recommended; if distraction is being performed on an adult, 5-7 days is suggested. The active distraction rate and phase is dependent on the size of the distractor. The general recommended rate is  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  per day – in the older patient  $1\mathrm{mm}$  should be standard. The recommended length of the consolidation phase is  $3\times$  that of active distraction.

Drawbacks to distraction include: superficial hardware infections are common, device failure is possible, and a second surgery for device removal is needed. DO for FOA has also been described in the literature [57-59]. However, there is a lack of long-term data assessing the use of distraction for anterior cranial vault expan

sion, and FOA with internal rigid fixation remains the standard of care in syndromic dysostoses.

# 70.12 Alveolar Ridge Distraction

The subject of alveolar ridge distraction is covered in Chaps. 11 and 12, but it deserves mention in this section on DO because the indications and expected advantages of the technique are consistent with the other applications of DO to the craniomaxillofacial skeleton. The technique also represents an alternative form of transport DO that has been discussed previously, with the transport segment pedicled on the lingual perio- teum and soft tissues for maintenance of blood supply, and a vertical vector of the planned bony distraction. In areas of alveolar ridge deficiency, alveolar ridge DO offers an alternative option to autogenous or allogeneic or alloplastic bone grafting or guided bone regeneration, with the principal benefit being the soft tissue expansion of the attached and unattached gingiva during the process of distraction, in order to avoid a soft tissue dehiscence that frequently occurs with vertical alveolar ridge augmentation. Alveolar bone is very dynamic when compared to other areas of the maxillo

![](images/7e44dd38f376ff54780b2e242a7cdd063e6719c408aa8846892ee2c78557044e.jpg)

facial skeleton. It responds to mechanical stimuli by catabolic bone resorption in the direction of an applied load, and anabolic bone deposition in the direction opposite of the applied load [60, 61]. (Fig. 70.32).

The surgical technique for alveolar distraction has been described elsewhere [62]. Briefly, a horizontal incision is made parallel to the gingival margin. Careful attention is paid to only dissect the periosteum needed for make bone cuts and to place the distractors. Maintenance of a lingual pedicle of mucosa and periosteum is essential to segment viability. The segment planned for distraction is cut with a bur, saw, or ultrasonic surgical cutting instrument. The distractor is then applied (Fig. 70.33). After this, the previously described stages of distraction are followed [62]. Alveolar ridge DO is by no means a panacea for reconstruction of the alveolar ridge because there may be several complications, including poor vector control with an inadvertent lingual orientation or deviation of the

transport segment due to the soft tissue pedicle, as well as unpredictable osseous healing in the distraction gap [63] (Fig. 70.34), that may require bone grafting at the time of endosseous implant placement, thereby negating the expected benefit of avoidance of bone grafting.

# Key Points

- When used for the right indications, distraction osteogenesis is an effective technique.  
Virtual planning and computer-assisted surgery can add to the efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability of distraction osteogenesis.  
Distraction osteogenesis, although effective, does not replace good surgical principles utilized during conventional skeletal surgery.

# 70.13 The Future of Craniomaxillofacial DO

# Conclusion

In the craniomaxillofacial region, the application of DO maintains specific indications, including severe skeletal deformities of the maxilla and mandible, that are not amenable to correction by conventional orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment methods. Because one of the major limitations or disadvantages of the DO process is the length of the consolidation period, basic and clinical research will continue to focus on methods to shorten the consolidation period by accelerating the process of osseous healing in the distraction gap using both locally applied stem cells, growth factors, and cytokines, as well as the application of external sources of bone stimulation. Development of customized devices specifically designed with an exact vector for the individual patient is an option using three-dimensional computer treatment planning, and further developments may allow cost containment in the future. The development of automatic devices with internal preprogrammed daily incremental device activation will continue, as well as the refinement of resorbable materials that can be used for distraction, especially in the pediatric age group, that will provide sufficient rigidity to allow bony movement despite significant soft tissue restriction and then undergo spontaneous resorption at the appropriate time, in order to avoid the morbidity of an additional surgical procedure for device removal.
