# 33.1 Introduction

The functionality of the oral cavity is unmatched in the human body and involves almost all functions that make us human. Speech, mastication, taste, swallowing, respiration, and facial expressions are all basic human functions that we all take for granted when we are healthy. Cancers of the oral cavity can greatly diminish these basic functions or, in some cases, eliminate them altogether, which has devastating effects on quality of life.

Squamous cell carcinoma makes up over  $90\%$  of cancers affecting the oral cavity [1]. While sarcomas, melanomas, salivary gland tumors, lymphomas, and metastatic disease also occur in the oral cavity, they represent the minority of cases. The content of this chapter is limited to the discussion of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) with special mention of oropharyngeal. Other malignant processes are discussed elsewhere in this text.

In the 9 years, since the last edition of this textbook has been published, there has been an increasing prevalence of HPV-related head and neck carcinomas [1]. There is also mounting evidence that HPV-positive SCC and HPV-negative SCC behave as entirely different disease processes, especially with regard to oropharyngeal SCC [2-4]. This evidence prompted the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) to significantly amend the head and neck section in the 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual, which was published in 2017. These changes and other aspects of the diagnosis and staging of OCSCC will be discussed in-depth in this chapter.

# 33.2 Epidemiology

Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and oral cavity (OC) is the most common mucosal malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract making up  $85 - 95\%$  of all head and neck cancers, the second most common head and neck

cancer after thyroid cancer [5, 6]. Other less common malignancies of the head and neck include sarcomas, lymphoma, mucosal melanoma, salivary gland tumors, and metastatic disease. Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program estimate there were 53,000 new cases of oral and oropharyngeal cancer in the USA in 2019 with 10,860 deaths [7]. The global incidence of cancer of the lip and OC was estimated to be 354,864 new cases in 2018, which is a decrease from the 369,200 cases in 2012. There were 177,384 and 145,328 deaths from oral cancer in 2012 and 2018, respectively. Oral cancer is the 11th most common malignancy in the world [8]. The incidence of oral cancer overall has generally decreased. Interestingly, SCC of the tongue is increasing in incidence, while the incidence at the subsite of floor of mouth is decreasing (Fig. 33.1) [8]. Gender distribution varies by country, but globally the male: female incidence is  $69\%$  males, and  $30\%$  females with fatality rate of  $685\%$  and  $33\%$  for males and females, respectively [9, 10].

The median age at diagnosis of OCSCC is 63 years. However, in North America, there is a trend of increasing incidence of young Caucasian females with OCSCC without the typical, known risk factors [11, 12]. The general management of OCSCC is surgery with potential adjuvant radiation depending on adverse features. In cases of high-risk pathologic features and high-stage disease, management has not changed in the past 5 decades. However, within this time from the advent of adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy for cancers with certain associated high-risk features is relatively new [13, 14]. Despite, the relative stagnation of changes for the management of cancer, the prognosis of OCSCC has shown significant improvement since the 1970s [9]. SEER demonstrates this same trend (Fig. 33.2).

is thought to be related to the improvements in imaging, operative, and surgical techniques, radiation targeting techniques, and supportive care. (  $\square$  Fig. 33.3).

The racial profile of OCSCC has changed since the 1970s where it was predominately whites. Now, there is an increased incidence of OCSCC seen in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific islander. The incidence of OCSCC in blacks has marginally decreased since the 1970s.

# 33.2.1 Projections

It is difficult to appreciate the actual annual incidence of OCSCC, as some databases such as SEER lump the OC subsites (see below) together with the oropharyngeal subsites (tonsil, soft palate, base of tongue, lateral pharyngeal walls, and lingual surface of epiglottis), separating only lip and tongue cancers from the other sites. Regardless of the reporting algorithm used, worldwide cases of OCSCC are estimated to rise by  $54\%$  by 2040, to over 545,000 per year. Deaths from OCSCC, however,

Fig. 33.3 Trends in treatment combinations and 3-year cancer-specific survival from 1973 to 201 for a early-stage and b late-stage disease. CRT chemoradiotherapy, RT radiotherapy. (Cheraghlou et al. [9])

are expected to increase by  $56\%$ . Overall incidence is expected to rise from 2018 to 2040 significantly in less developed regions such as Africa  $(+105\%)$ , Latin America and the Caribbean  $(+80.5\%)$ , Asia  $(+55\%)$ , and Europe  $(+17.2\%)$ . There is also a moderate increase projected for the USA  $(+33.4\%)$  [5, 10].

# 33.2.2 Survival

SEER 18, which includes data from 2009 to 2015, demonstrated mean five-year survival of  $65.3\%$  for OSCC; however, survival is skewed heavily to favor those with localized (AJCC stages I and II; see below) versus

regional and distant disease [7]. As such, staging workup of not only the primary tumor site but also the regional cervical lymphatics and distant sites such as the chest and abdomen is included in assigning the initial cTNM stage. This becomes critical in management.

# 33.3 Risk Factors

# 33.3.1 Tobacco

Over  $90\%$  of OCSCCs are due independently from one form or another, to tobacco. The specific causative agents in tobacco include benzopyrenes, benzanthracenes, and epoxides. The relative risk of smokers developing OCSCC is 2.1 [15]. The WHO estimates tobacco-related healthcare costs, and lack of productivity costs the global economy $1.4 trillion annually. Tobacco use in both sexes is expected to decrease by  $28\%$  by 2025 [16]. Tobacco use varies by region and includes cigarettes and cigars, smokeless tobacco (dip/snuff/snus), water pipe (hookah/sheesha/shisha/narghile), and areca nut/betel quid [17]. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were introduced in the early 2000s and aggressively marketed to young people as a healthier, trendy alternative to cigarettes. An e-cigarette consists of a liquid cartridge containing nicotine dissolved in propylene glycol (often with food flavoring added), a heating element, battery, and mouthpiece. Initially, the lack of carcinogenic additives was felt to reduce the user's risk of cancer compared to traditional cigarettes [18, 19]. More recent studies, however, have identified the carcinogen N-nitrosonornicotine in the saliva of e-cigarette users [20] and the ability of e-cigarettes to induce DNA strand breaks and cell death independently of nicotine in vitro [21]. A 2019 systematic review concluded the available evidence in the scientific literature was insufficient to confirm e-cigarettes were less harmful than conventional cigarettes, in part due to the relatively short time since their introduction to the market [22]. There is no evidence at the current time to support the association of marijuana use and development of OSCCC. A 2004 meta-analysis demonstrated no increased risk in a large, multi-study pooled analysis [23, 24].

# 33.3.2 Alcohol

Alcohol has long been considered a co-risk factor in the development of OCSCC, acting synergistically with tobacco by solubilizing its toxins and concentrating them in the dependent portions of the OC: the floor of mouth and lateral borders of the tongue in particular

[25]. A pooled systematic review and meta-analysis of 12,828 cases of head and neck cancer compared to 17,189 control cases showed a multiplicative effect when patients both smoked and drank alcohol [26]. Though not a carcinogen itself, ethanol breaks down to acetaldehyde, a highly toxic metabolite responsible for DNA damage in oral mucosa. Ethanol also increases cytochrome P450 enzyme (specifically CYP2E1) induction in the liver, disrupting the protective effects of retinoids such as vitamin A and increasing oxidative stress [17]. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that alcohol consumption in itself is an independent risk factor for developing OCSCC [27, 28]. In fact, there is a significant dose-related response that can be seen in light versus heavy drinkers. The association between alcohol and OCSCC is similar in men and women as well as the dose-response relationship in these genders [15]. Among never/non-current smokers, the relative risk for OCSCC is 1.3-fold higher for those who drink and 2.5-fold higher for those who drink heavily [15]. Various studies show different risks among beer, wine, and spirits for developing OCSCC, which seems to vary by region with beer having the highest risk in the USA, wine having the highest risk in Europe, and hard liquor having the highest risk in Latin America [29, 30, 30]. Among these groups, the association between alcohol and OCSCC is stronger in smokers than in nonsmokers. This is different than prior studies, which reported higher rates among spirit and beer drinkers compared to wine drinkers [31]. As previously noted, this synergistic effect has been demonstrated in multiple studies [15, 28].

Given the high prevalence of alcohol abuse in the HNSCC population, all patients with the new or existing diagnosis should undergo an alcohol abuse evaluation. Importantly, alcohol is associated with the development of secondary HNSCC [32, 33]. Therefore, careful monitoring for alcohol abuse and possible intervention is needed during the surveillance period. Furthermore, former drinkers have less risk of developing OCSCC than current drinkers. In fact, as the number of years quitting alcohol increases the risk of OCSCC gradually drops eventually to the below the level of current drinkers, and near the level of never drinkers [34, 35]. This further highlights the importance of alcohol abuse control during the surveillance period [29, 34, 36].

# 33.3.3 Oncogenic Viruses

# 33.3.3.1 Human Papillomavirus (HPV)

HPV, a small, non-enveloped, DNA virus, belongs to the Papillomaviridae family and commonly infects squamous epithelial cells [37], and has long been known to be

a risk factor for cervical cancer [38]. However, though implicated, HPV was never definitely identified as an independent risk factor for head and neck cancer [39-42] until 2007, when D'Souza reported human papillomavirus as independent risk factor for tobacco and alcohol use for oropharyngeal cancer [43, 44]. While the overall incidence of head and neck cancer is decreasing in the USA, the incidence of HPV-mediated head and neck squamous is increasing, and is now the most common HPV-mediated malignancy, surpassing cervical cancer [45, 46]. Between 2002 and 2012, the rate of oropharyngeal (HPV-related) cancer increased by a rate of  $2.5\%$  annually. Specifically, while the decrease in overall incidence in head and neck cancer has been especially seen in younger age groups, HPV-driven head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a biologically distinct entity when compared to non-HPV-mediated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [46], with a comparably more favorable prognosis [47]. Tumor HPV status is a significant independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. HPV-negative OCSCC may represent a distinct molecular entity when compared to HPV-negative OCSCC [46]. There is an inverse association in TP53 mutations and the presence of HPV with TP53 mutations being confirmed in only  $3\%$  of HPV-positive vs  $82\%$  of HPV-negative head and neck cancers. In addition, the pRB pathway may be disrupted in HPV-positive cancers. Furthermore, the distinguishing genetic features of these HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers may be shaped by virus-host interactions. Given the favorable prognosis of HPV-mediated cancers, current research is focusing on deintensification of therapy such as transoral surgical resection and dose-reduced radiation for early-stage cancers. Given the importance of HPV status in management, HPV status is now reflexively reported for oropharyngeal tumors in most centers. This is especially important given the reported increased risk of synchronous or metachronous (multiple) HPV-mediated cancers [48]. However, though the risk of synchronous [49] or metachronous tumors is thought to be higher in HPV-mediated OPSCC, there is a reported significantly lower incidence of a second primary malignancy when compared to non-HPV-medicated OPSCC [50, 51]. In general, the second primary malignancy rate in HNSCC was reported to be approximated  $36\%$ , necessitating the need for close follow-up. Before the 1990s, the subsites of the oropharynx and hypopharynx carried the highest risk of developing a second primary malignancy. However, since then, and the initiation of the era of HPV, the oropharynx now has the lowest risk of developing a second primary malignancy. The fact that second primary malignancies are relatively nonexistent in HPV-mediated OPSCC is consistent with the observa

tion that recurrent cancer in survivors of head and neck cancer in general is dominated by the risk factors for smoking and alcohol [52]. In general, patients with HPV-mediated OPSCC are more likely to be younger, and more have multiple tumors than those with non-HPV-mediated OPSCC. The second tumor is most likely to be the contralateral tonsil; therefore, it is recommended by most that a contralateral tonsillectomy be performed in HPV-mediated OPSCC [1]. In general, HPV-mediated SCC of the oropharynx is more radiosensitive than non-HPV-mediated SCC [47]. As such, de-intensification of therapy is indicated in HPV-mediated OPSCC in the form of a combination of omission of induction chemotherapy and/or reduced dosed radiotherapy [3, 53, 54]. The same trend is not demonstrated in OCSCC.

HPV can be identified in the tumor biopsy specimen, fine-needle aspirate, or core aspirates of neck nodes when possible. Cell morphology alone cannot predict the presence of HPV; however, HPV-infected tumors are characterized histologically by a non-keratinizing or basaloid morphologic pattern. The two techniques used to diagnose HPV are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). PCR is rarely available in diagnostic laboratories, few tests are available for clinical use, and it is a technically challenging method. ISH, though less sensitive than PCR, is highly specific and provides evidence of the viral genome via DNA or mRNA presence in the tumor nuclei. The presence of HPV is usually measured using immunohistochemical detection of p16 (p16-IHC), which serves as a surrogate marker of HPV status [55]. p16 status has been found to highly correlate with ISH (98% correlation) [56]. Numerically, p16 staining better predicts the presence of HPV when the cutoff is set at  $\geq 70\%$  of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining [57]. The role of HPV in the staging of OCSCC will be discussed later in the chapter.

# 33.3.3.2 Genetic Factors

The first step in carcinogenesis is the initiation phase when a genetic defect is created by environmental agents such as tobacco/EtOH/viruses (see above) [17]. In other cases, cancer regulatory genes are dysfunctional, including proto-oncogenes such as growth factors (FGF, PDGF, TGF $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ , NF $\kappa$ B), cell surface receptors (EGFR, FGFR), signal transduction factors (RAS), transcription factors (myc, JUN, FOS), cell cycle proteins (cyclin-dependent kinase), and inhibitors of apoptosis (bcl-2). The tumor suppressor genes p53 and retinoblastoma (RB) may also contain inherited defects, which initiate carcinogenesis. Regardless of the cause of the defect, inherited or acquired, initiation represents a mutation, which is self-perpetuating and irreversible, leading to malignant transformation of normal oral

keratinocytes. A promotion phase then follows, characterized by unchecked cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. The role of chronic inflammation has been investigated in oral carcinogenesis and is being investigated with respect to MMP expression in oral inflammatory conditions such as periodontal disease. Progression is the final stage of carcinogenesis and follows a stepwise pattern as described by Knudson. The "two-hit hypothesis" of tumor progression explains the phenomenon when initial injury to one allele of a tumor suppressor gene does lead to phenotypic change (tumor formation). Loss of heterozygosity also describes progression, where the normally functioning copy of the tumor suppressor gene inhibits cancer growth. Once the first injury occurs, a "second hit," by mutagenic agents, permanently disrupts the gene's function, resulting in potential tumor cell growth, and allowing invasion and metastasis to proceed unchecked [58, 59].

# 33.4 Race

When using the SEER database and assessing adult patients with primary OCSCC between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, the predominant racial cohort was whites  $(75\%)$ . The next most common racial cohorts affected were Hispanics  $(9.1\%)$ , Asians  $(8.3\%)$ , and blacks  $(7.6\%)$  [60]. However, using the same data, blacks had a  $68\%$  higher risk of mortality from their disease when compared to whites. However, this risk was less when adjusting for stage and insignificant when adjusting for insurance status. When compared to whites, blacks and Hispanics were more likely to present at later stages. When referring to all types of head and neck cancers, blacks have a significantly elevated T stage and N stage at primary presentation, while demonstrating a significantly lower overall survival rate when compared to whites [61]. In addition, despite controlling for stage and treatment, black subjects demonstrate poorer overall and disease-specific survival with SCC of the head and neck.

This trend can be found for other cancers of the head and neck such as salivary gland malignancies where black race is a risk factor for poorer disease-specific survival [62, 63]. The exception to this may be nasopharyngeal carcinoma where blacks and Asians may have a better disease-specific survival when compared to whites [64-67]. In all head and neck cancers, blacks were less likely to be offered surgery and more likely to refuse surgery when compared to whites [68]. The same trend is seen in OCSCCC where black patients are less likely to receive or be recommended surgery for oral cavity SCC and are more likely to refuse surgery [69].

# 33.4.1 Other Risk Factors

There is an increased risk of oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas in those with HIV/AIDS and who have undergone organ transplant [70]. There is a similar increase in cancer rates with both populations supported that immune deficiency is an independent risk factor for the development of cancer. Poor oral hygiene and severe caries have long been cited as risk factors for oral cancer. An increased risk factor has been associated with infrequent tooth brushing [71, 72] and lack of dental care [73]. Periodontal disease may be a risk factor for oral cancer [74]. This risk may be as much as twofold [75]. Poor oral hygiene may lead to the proliferation of pathogenic oral bacteria and cause chronic inflammation helping promote the genesis of oral cancer [76]. An increased incidence of oral cancer is associated with the presence of Candida. Genotypic variation between C. albicans strains between oral cancer and non-oral cancer patients suggests an association with the development of neoplastic changes [77].

# 33.5 Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders

Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are conditions that precede the onset of cancers of the oral cavity [78]. This term encompasses precancerous lesions and conditions referred to in earlier World Health Organization (WHO) definitions [79]. Other terms used to describe areas of the mucosa that precede cancer include "pre-cancer," "precancerous/premalignant lesions," and "intraepithelial neoplasia." The reason, in 2005, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer adopted the term OPMD, was that there is no certainty that all premalignant lesions will eventually develop into cancer [79].

OPMDs include erythroplakia leukoplakia, erythroleukoplakia, oral submucous fibrosis, actinic cheilitis of the lower lip, palatal lesions in reverse smokers, oral lichen planus, oral lichenoid reactions, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), oral lupus erythematosus, and some hereditary conditions, such as dyskeratosis congenita and epidermolysis bullosa.

Premalignant lesions are those lesions that are altered morphologically in that they are more likely to develop into cancer than normal tissue. Importantly, often these lesions are genetically altered as well when compared to normal mucosa. There are many traditional ways to classify premalignant lesions, including appearance and histological features. Histologic classification is important in these lesions as often the

appearance is unaltered. They can also be classified on whether they occur as an isolated lesion, or as with an associated condition.

# 33.5.1 Red, White, and Mixed Lesions

One of the most common ways to classify premalignant lesions is by gross appearance, in particular color. The three primary groups as defined by color are red, white, and mixed color lesions. Leukoplakia is defined as a white plaque or patch that cannot be characterized clinically or ascribed to another pathologic disease (Fig. 33.4). It is strictly a clinical diagnosis and by definition cannot be scraped or rubbed off. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is usually painless and may be raised, flap, irregular, smooth, or elevated. Lesions caused by frictional keratosis, morsicatio buccarum, chemical injury, hairy leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, oral lichenoid reactions, white spongy nevus, and nicotine stomatitis do not qualify as leukoplakia (Fig. 33.5).

Leukoplakias are usually diagnosed after the fourth decade of life, and alcohol is an independent risk factor [78]. In Caucasians, the most common sites for leukoplakia are the tongue and floor of mouth, and these are most worrisome for premalignant or malignant lesions (Fig. 33.6). However, in Asians, the buccal mucosa and lower buccal vestibule are commonly affected due to betel quid use in these locations (Fig. 33.7). The two main clinical types of leukoplakia are homogenous type, characterized by being uniformly flap and thin, and smooth serviced and the nonhomogeneous type. The nonhomogeneous type, which can be further categorized as speckled, nodular, and verrucous, and maybe more symptomatic. Tobacco use is often associated with

Fig. 33.7 Leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa, retromolar trigone, and gingiva with accompanied trismus from submucous fibrosis from prolonged betel quid use

leukoplakias, and over  $70\%$  of patients with leukoplakias are smokers [80]. However, though white in appearance, smoker's palate (leukokeratosis nicotina palati), palatal keratosis of reverse smokers, and snuff [or snus] dipper's lesions should be separated from leukoplakia. Cessation of smoking may or may not aid in resolution of the leukoplakia. Ultraviolet radiation exposure to the lower lip is often cited as a risk factor for leukoplakia to the lower lip, with chronic unprotected exposure placing individuals at highest risk. However, if lesions associated with actinic cheilitis cannot be considered leukoplakia, other causes of white lesions that must be ruled out include ill-fitting or sharp prostheses, poorly contoured dental restorations, and parafunctional habits or iatrogenic injury. The malignant transformation rate or presence of malignancy in leukoplakias may be as high as 17 [81]. And this may take as long as 7 years.

A leukoplakia without a discrete diagnosis should be biopsied to evaluate for pathology of the patch, but more importantly to rule out dysplasias or carcinomas. In the case of dysplasia, this will be graded by the pathologist. Candida species may also be found, which can then be treated. Histologically, leukoplakias consistently exhibit hyperkeratosis (Fig. 33.8); however, the underlying epithelium may exhibit normal, dysplastic, or invasive carcinoma.

Erythroplakias are much more worrisome and are characterized by red patches that cannot be scraped off or clinically characterized by another disease process (Fig. 33.9). The WHO defines erythroplakia as a fiery red patch that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other definable disease [78, 79]. The lesions of erythroplakia are usually irregular in outline, although well-defined, and have a bright red velvety surface. Occasionally, the surface is granular [78, 79]. Erosive disorders, desquamative gingivitis, discoid lupus, erosive lichen planus, pemphigoid, and other

inflammatory/infectious conditions erythematous candidiasis (denture-associated stomatitis) and erythema migrans are common clinical entities often mistaken for erythroplakias.

Almost all true erythroplakias demonstrate dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma with one large study demonstrating  $9\%$  of erythroplakias were mild-to-moderate dysplasia,  $40\%$  were carcinoma in situ or severe dysplasia, and  $51\%$  were invasive SCC [81]. The etiology of these lesions is poorly known, but thought to be similar to leukoplakias. The most common subsites are the palate, floor of mouth, and retromolar trigone [78, 79]. Erythroplakias are relatively uncommon on their own and often present as a mixed red-white lesion. As such, these should be classified under the term—erythroleukoplakia.

Mixed lesions, or erythroleukoplakias, are leukoplakias with a red component, which may indicated colonization of Candida species and are at increased risk of dysplasia and/or malignancy. Previously referred to as speckled leukoplakia, the red component shows either

atrophy or sometimes speckling (Fig. 33.10). Unlike its pure leukoplakia or erythroplakia counterparts, erythroleukoplakia may have an irregular margin. Soreness may result from the potential for Candidal hyphae. A malignant transformation rate as high as  $23\%$  has been noted in erythroleukoplakia [80].

# 33.5.2 Oral Lichen Planus

Oral lichen planus (OLP) differs present clinically in a variety of ways. Oral lesions are symmetrical and often present in multiple locations. There are several clinical subtypes including linear, annular, popular, plaque, reticular, atrophic, bullous, and ulcerative. It usually presents as a bilateral keratotic lace-like network of white striae (Wickham striae) on the buccal mucosa or lateral margins of the tongue (Fig. 33.11). The reticular type can be found on the gingiva, floor of mouth, mucobuccal fold, and labial mucosa. Atrophic and

ulcerative types may present as ulceration or erythematous areas. There is much debate whether oral lichen planus is premalignant or predisposing factor for OCSCC. Patients with OLP may exhibit a history of cutaneous lichen planus. Patients may also exhibit a history in other extraoral sites such as the genitalia. OLP is often characterized by periods of systemic flare-ups and remission, which may last several years. OLP can usually be diagnosed clinically; however, incisional biopsy and histopathological examination are needed to make definitive diagnosis [78]. Regardless of subtype of subsite, histopathological findings are similar. Older reviews and studies demonstrate a malignant transformation rate as high as  $5.6\%$  [82, 83]. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have revealed that oral lichen planus has a very low malignant transformation rate of approximately  $1\%$  [84, 85].

Oral lichenoid lesions (OLLs) often have features similar to OLP; however, unlike OLP, OLLs are associated with a causative agent. OLL caused by hypersensitivity to material such as restorations appears similar to OLP, making diagnosis challenging; however, OLLs are usually localized. OLLs caused by drug reaction are usually unilateral. OLL can also occur as a reaction to betel quid chewers at the location of betel quid use. Like oral lichen planus, oral lichenoid lesions have been reported to undergo malignant transformation. OLL is often difficult to differentiate clinically and histologically. However, oral lichenoid lesions have been found to have a malignant transformation rate of as high as  $2 - 3\%$ , slightly higher than that of oral lichen planus [6, 85].

When compared to SEER data, a greater proportion of women have lichen planus-associated oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas. When compared to SEER data, which can be assumed to be mostly non-lichen planus-associated oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas, lichen planus-associated oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas were more likely to be women, nonsmokers, drinkers, and present with early-stage localized disease [86]. In addition, patients with oral lichen planus-associated OCSCC may have increased overall and disease-specific survival, however is a greater risk of tumor recurrence or risk of developing a second primary tumor when compared to the general population.

# 33.5.3 Oral Submucous Fibrosis

Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a common OPMD often seen in India and Southeast Asia (Fig. 33.12). It is frequently associated with betel quid chewing. It is a chronic disease that affects the lamina propria of the oral mucosa [87]. It is progressive in nature advancing to

![](images/c8550eeba9f23d40795b1c91faf7be5bb877d8a20a06e0cd5869b71495fdd28d.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 33.12 Oral submucous fibrosis. Pictured is a patient with a long history of betel quid use, now with submucosal fibrosis and leukoplakia

the deep submucosa resulting in loss of elasticity (Fig. 33.13). There is an accumulation of inelastic fibrous tissue in the juxtaepithelial region of the oral mucosa, along with concomitant muscle degeneration. The clinician should suspect OSF in a patient with a history of betel quid areca nut chewing in an Asian population who has limited mouth opening. The betel nut is a seed of the Areca catechu, a type of palm tree. In India, it is commonly sliced or grounded up and wrapped in the leaves of the Piper betel vine. This is then often coated with lye, which altogether makes up betel quid. Tobacco or flavorful spices may also be added to this. Reported favorable effects include increased energy, thought to be from the nut's natural alkaloids, which release adrenaline, which can be associated with dependence.

Progressive limitation in mouth opening is pathognomonic. For OSF, it may be associated with other factors including those immunologic and autoimmune in nature. Nutrition may play a role in its etiology as well [87-89]. OSF is often a very progressive debilitating condition, characterized by the leathery mucosa, palpable fibrous bands, tongue rigidity, and associated muscle rigidity and trismus. Early findings include mucosal blanching and loss of natural pigmentation. Other findings include sunken cheeks, odynophagia with spicy foods, and difficulty with speech and swallowing. There also may be a loss of auditory acuity because of stenosis of the opening of the Eustachian tube [87]. The most common clinical findings are often progressive loss of mandibular opening and burning pain when eating spicy foods [88]. If the tongue is affected, it displays limited mobility, rigidity, and loss of papillae. In advanced cases, the soft palate may have horizontal bands, and the uvula may be small and deformed. Exophytic oral verrucous hyperplasia is a lesion often seen in betel quid chewers (  $\text{口}$  Fig. 33.7).

Histologically, OSF displays juxtaepithelial fibrosis with atrophy or hyperplasia of the overlying epithelium, keratinizing metaplasia, and a progressive loss of vascularity with accumulation of hyalinized collagen beneath the basement membrane [90, 91]. OSF may be thought of as a disease of collagen metabolism, with increased synthesis and reduced degradation of collagen [92]. A long-term study demonstrated a malignant transformation rate as high as  $8\%$  [89]; however, other systematic reviews have demonstrated malignant transformation rates between  $7\%$  and  $30\%$  [89, 91].

Just as in any OMPD, very close follow-up is imperative. Opinions vary give access to care and practice patterns, but follow-up and observation should be done by a well-qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeon, dentist, or oral medicine specialist. After initial diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy and found to not be dysplastic or carcinoma, close clinical follow-up along with patient-specific symptoms should drive further biopsy. An example of a lesion needing further biopsy is in the case of biopsy-proven OLP, or OSF with new worrisome clinical progression or new patient symptoms. This should guide the surgeon when and where to further biopsy to rule out the presence of dysplasia or carcinoma. In the case of dysplasia or carcinoma, patients should be managed per guidelines for head and neck cancer. Besides dysplasia or malignancy, other indications for surgery in patients with OSF include severe trismus leading to the inability to chew and eat. Surgical options include scar release [93], use of local/regional flaps [94, 95], and free tissue transfer [96].

# 33.6 Subsites of the Oral Cavity

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) uses defined anatomic subsites of the oral cavity to standardize tumor registries, report epidemiologic data to groups such as the SEER database, and streamline communication among physicians on the multispecialty team. The subsites are defined as and are illustrated in Fig. 33.1. The AJCC divides the oral cavity into seven distinct subsites [97]. Defining the origin subsite of OCSCC has important implications on surgical management, adjuvant therapy, and survival [98]. Floor of mouth and tongue are still the most common subsites affected by OCSCC with each subsite representing  $68\%$  of all OCSCC  $(34\%$  for each) [99]. OCSCC of the tongue, however, is associated with a higher cause-specific mortality when compared to other sites such as floor of mouth, upper gum, and retromolar [99]. The boundaries of the oral cavity are defined anteriorly by the vermilion cutaneous junction of the lips, posterosuperiorly by the junction of the hard and soft palate,

posteroinferiorly by the circumvallate papilla, and posterolaterally by the anterior faucial pillars.

# 33.6.1 Mucosal Lip

The lip has an upper and lower component that joins at the lateral commissures of the mouth. It serves as the mucocu

taneous transition to the oral cavity. For oncologic purposes, the lip can be divided into cutaneous and mucosal components. The "cutaneous lip" is the part of the lip external to the white roll. The "mucosal lip" is defined as the portion of the vermilion lip that remains in contact with the opposite lip. The white roll of the external lip serves as the junction between cutaneous and vermilion lip and is consisted of an abrupt transition from keratinizing

epidermis to mucosal epithelium. The area between the white roll and where the lips contact is divided by a transitional zone at the vermilion border called the "vermillion lip" (Fig. 33.14). The epidermis of the vermilion is thin with a superficial, dense, and rich capillary network owing to its red color. It is supported by the underlying orbicularis oris muscle and its predominant blood supply is the bilateral labial arteries, tributaries of the facial arteries. Sensation is provided by the mental nerve (third division of the trigeminal nerve), and motor function is provided by branches of the facial nerve.

Per AJCC 8th edition guidelines, SCC that occurs external to the white roll is staged as "cutaneous SCC (cSCC)," a common malignancy with a favorable prognosis, and those SCCs at the vermilion or mucosa of the lip are staged as mucosal SCC (mSCC), which are associated with significantly higher rates of nodal disease and worse outcomes [100, 101]. These cancers behave differently and predominately affect distinctly different patient populations. Cutaneous SCC of the lip behaves like its other cutaneous counterparts and has a much higher survival. It often affects older white men and is related to sun exposure. It is infrequently seen in dark-skinned races (Fig. 33.15). The most common location of UV light-associated lip SCC is at the lateral vermilion border of the lower lip. Mucosal lip SCC is more aggressive with a worse prognosis (Fig. 33.16). Like other mucosa SCCs of the oral cavity, the primary

and secondary risk factor for mucosal lip SCC is tobacco and alcohol. Whereas nodal metastases occur in  $2 - 5\%$  of patients with cutaneous lip carcinomas, it is seen in as many as  $18 - 44\%$  of lip carcinomas. Occult lymph node metastases are found in  $18 - 34\%$  of patients with T1-T2 mucosal lip SCC and a cN0 neck. These are similar rates of nodal metastases seen in other oral cavity subsites. Mucosal SCCs of the lower lip most commonly metastasize to level I and then to level II lymph nodes. Mucosal SCCs of the upper lip most commonly drain to preauricular, periparotid, and level II lymph nodes. For lower

lip carcinomas where the primary is close to or has crossed midline, bilateral neck metastases should be suspected. Upper lip primary mucosal SCC rarely exhibits contralateral lymph node metastases [102].

# 33.6.2 Buccal Mucosa

The buccal mucosa is made of mobile, non-keratinized lining mucosa connecting the maxillary and mandibular vestibules (keratinized mucosa of alveolar ridges) and includes all the lining of the inner surface of the cheeks and lips. The anterior border is the contact point between the upper and lower lips (mucovermillion junction). Underlying muscular structures include the buccinator and orbicularis oris muscles. The vascular supply is mainly from the buccal artery of the second division of the internal maxillary artery. Sensation is provided by the buccal branch of the third division of the trigeminal nerve, while motor sensation is provided by the buccal branch of the facial nerve.

![](images/e02a6cf3f3dda6cb7bfeb7ad3a432caaf24caba786224a9ec81fc5e264f844d4.jpg)

Though buccal mucosa OCSCC may represent only  $2 - 10\%$  of OCSCC in the USA (Fig. 33.17) [31, 103-107]. However, due to the use of betel quid, buccal OCSCCs are more common in Central and Southeast Asia, where it represents more than  $40\%$  of all OCSCCs [105, 108, 109]. It may have the poorest outcome of any subsite, displaying a high locoregional recurrence rate when compared to other subsites [110, 111]. with a local recurrence rate as high as  $56\%$  [112]. This is similar to the tongue and may be due to the lack of anatomic barriers to prevent tumor spread. Once the tumor invades the buccal space beyond the fascia of the buccinator muscle and into the buccal fat, there is virtually no substantial anatomic barrier. Ten to thirty percent of patients presenting with buccal mucosa OCSCC will have clinically evident regional lymph node metastases [105, 113, 114]. Occult nodal metastases are found to be present in  $13 - 32\%$  of western patients [105, 107, 108], an estimated  $30\%$  of Asian patients [105, 107, 108, 115]. The most common site of regional lymph node metastasis in buccal OCSCC is level I, followed by level II. Given the risk of regional spread, elective neck dissection is advocated for buccal mucosa OCSCC-staged T2 or high or when DOI exceeds  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$ .

# 33.6.3 Floor of Mouth

Composed of nonkeratinized, pliable mucosa, the floor of mouth includes the ventral tongue and alveololingual sulci bilaterally. The floor of mouth is second only to the tongue as the most common subsite for OCSCC. It is a unique subsite given its close proximity to other anatomic subsites and often difficult surgical access (Fig. 33.18). Therefore, removal of floor of mouth cancers often requires composite resection of adjacent

$\square$  Fig. 33.18 Patient with an exophytic erythroleukoplakic floor of mouth SCC

structures such as tongue, mandible, pharynx, and salivary glands. It has a higher propensity for positive surgical margins [116]. The floor of mouth is at a higher risk of regional nodal metastases when compared to other oral cavity subsites, and often it metastasizes bilaterally requiring management of both sides of the neck, even in early-stage unilateral tumors [117]. In fact, the risk for contralateral nodal metastases is greater in ipsilateral floor of moth primary tumors when compared to the ipsilateral tongue primary tumors [117]. Another option for the management of the contralateral cN0 neck includes sentinel lymph node biopsy [118]. However, the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in floor of mouth primary tumors may be difficult due to the close proximity of the first echelon level I lymph nodes as shine-through may obscure signals from sentinel nodes and impede intraoperative identification of the sentinel lymph node.

# 33.6.4 Oral Tongue

OCSCC of the tongue represents up to  $50\%$  of all OCSCC [31, 119]. The oral tongue, or anterior two-thirds of the tongue, is still the most common primary subsite for OCSCC (Fig. 33.19) [120]. It makes up the freely mobile portion of the tongue, and its borders are made up posteriorly by the anterior aspect of the foramen cecum/sulcus terminalis and circumvallate papillae. The posterior 1/3 of the tongue or base of tongue (BOT) is both histologically and anatomically distinct from the oral tongue and is classified as a subsite of the oropharynx. The oral tongue is divided into four subunits: the tip, the lateral borers, the dorsum, and the undersurface (nonvillous ventral surface of the tongue). The tongue is predominately muscular in nature, composed of extrinsic muscles (genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and palatoglossus) and intrinsic muscles. The blood supply is predominantly from the paired lingual, sublingual,

![](images/3d4ebf499714fe8b72773741144f7e7ac0ac40830b28450177fefa9b7f25fadc.jpg)  
Fig. 33.19 Patient with an erythroleukoplakic ventral tongue SCC

and deep lingual artery. Knowledge of the vasculature is important during glossectomy to prevent issues with tissue perfusion.

The predominant area of the tongue affected by SCC is the anterior 2/3 of the tongue (75%), rather than posterior third (25%) [121]. The oral tongue is at high risk of regional lymph node metastases. Similar to the buccal mucosa, this is thought to be due to the lack of normal anatomical barriers and due to the high muscle composition of the tongue and low resistance to tumor invasion [122, 123]. Forty percent of patients will have evidence of clinical lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis of an oral tongue primary OCSCC [122-125]. The most common site of regional lymphatic metastasis of primary oral tongue OCSCC is level II, followed by level III and level IV [126, 127]. Though ipsilateral tongue OCSCC usually metastasizes ipsilaterally, lesions of the tongue tip, or body, may metastasize to either or both sides of the neck. As discussed later in this chapter and per NCCN guidelines, in OCSCC of the tongue, a depth of invasion of greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  has been found to be associated with a significant risk of regional lymph node metastases to the neck [125, 128]. In addition, for high-risk subsites such as the tongue, a lower threshold of  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  DOI is suggested as a cutoff for suspicion of lymph node metastases and an elective neck dissection may be considered [129]. As in midline floor of mouth primary tumors, given the risk of bilateral nodal metastases, bilateral elective neck dissection may be warranted in the case of CN0 disease.

# 33.6.5 Mandibular Gingiva and Alveolar Ridge

The keratinized gingiva covering the alveolar processes can be divided into that of the maxilla and the mandible. Primary gingival OCSCCs make up  $2 - 18\%$  of the

OCSCCs and occur predominately in the mandible. The mandibular gingiva's borders are made up laterally and medially by the mucogingival junction (border where nonkeratinized mucosa of the buccal vestibule and floor of mouth transition to keratinized gingiva of the alveolus) (Fig. 33.20). The posterior mandibular gingival border is the junctions of the nonkeratinized and keratinized mucosa at the ascending ramus. Maxillary and mandibular alveolar ridges are different entities with different oncologic outcomes and presenting with distinct reconstructive challenges. Mandibular gingival SCC comprises only  $7\%$  of OCSCCs [130]. Tumors in this area may invade underlying bone using the periodontal ligament space as a conduit in dentate patients. Though readily visible to other providers when compared to other sites, gingival SCC may be mistaken for denture sore spots, gingivitis/periodontitis, infection, trauma, or inflammation, which may delay diagnosis. Misdiagnosis of SCC for the aforementioned conditions may lead to unnecessary procedures such as tooth extraction, incision and drainage, restorative dental procedures, and medical management for proposed infectious process. These procedures delay appropriate management of the underlying malignancy and have been shown to associate with a decrease in long-term survival [131-134]. Furthermore, there is a proposed theory that extraction further decreases survival by removing the barrier function that the tooth serves, permitting direct invasion of the tumor through the extraction site into the medullary bone. Given the thin nature of the alveolar gingiva, and its intimate nature to the underlying alveolus, invasion through the cortex of the jaws is common (T4a).

Appropriate clinical examination and evaluation of imaging are critical in deciding surgical management. Approximately one-third of gingival tumors will have

![](images/9c46931c6c3e288e0e3672cba9c524ec25e5677f97f34687a8fc03aaa6390d89.jpg)  
$\bullet$  Fig. 33.20 Patient with an exophytic erythroleukoplakic lesion of the mandibular gingiva extending just past the mucogingival junction

bony involvement. Detailed evaluation of preoperative imaging for osteolysis and distinguishing between cortical boney erosion and medullary bone invasion is critical, as the later will upstage a tumor to T4a and necessitate composite segmental resection. Notably, violation of this robust barrier, the mandibular cortex, symbolizes aggressive disease. Cortical erosion, without medullary involvement, may alleviate the need for segmental resection rendering the patient to a marginal mandibular resection only. The procedure of segmental vs marginal resection will be discussed in the next chapter.

In addition to segmental resection, the presence of medullary space involvement of the mandibular necessitates the need for reconstruction and postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. Therefore, diagnosis is critical. When clear transcortical invasion is not demonstrated on imaging, and marginal rim resection of the mandible is planned, the possibility of a segmental resection of the mandible and appropriate microvascular free flap harvest and reconstruction should be discussed with the patient in case either clear medullary space involvement is witnessed intraoperatively by periosteal stripping [135], or if frozen section of medullary cavity reveals carcinoma [136]. In fact, periosteal stripping at the time of marginal resection has been found to be much more accurate than clinical examination when predicting cortical invasion. In addition, the patient undergoing composite resection would likely need tracheostomy and have a significantly longer hospital stay as compared with marginal resection.

A combination of clinical examination, periosteal stripping at time of resection, panoramic radiographs, and CT scans should be used to diagnose mandibular invasion [135, 137, 138]. A combination of the three modalities is approximately  $78.5 - 82.6\%$  accurate in diagnosing frank cortical invasion. A combination of clinical examination and panoramic radiographs is more sensitive than CT; however, CTs are more specific than the two prior modalities. Both CT and panoramic radiograph have utility in assessing cortical invasion for mandibular gingival OCSCC primaries. Studies assessing mandibular invasion in segmental resection and marginal resection specimens found rates of invasion of  $65\% -83\%$  and  $7.6\% -33\%$  respectively [137, 139]. In addition, MRI has been found to be more sensitive than CT when assessing marrow space involvement [135, 138]. Though the literature on segmental vs marginal resection is controversial, when transcortical erosion is seen on any clinical examination or imaging modality, segmental resection should be performed [140].

The survival of T4aN0M0 SCC of the mandibular gingiva and alveolus treated with surgery alone has a reported 5-year overall survival of  $80.6\%$  [141]. Regional

lymph node metastasis occurs in  $24 - 28\%$  of mandibular gingival primary tumors [114, 131, 132, 142, 143]. Therefore, along with marginal or segmental resection, NCCN guidelines recommend elective neck dissection for ipsilateral tumors and bilateral neck dissection for anterior/midline tumors.

# 33.6.6 Maxillary Gingiva, Alveolar Ridge, and Hard Palate

The maxillary gingiva's lateral and medial borders are the mucogingival line where keratinized mucosa of the alveolus transitions into the lateral nonkeratinized mucosa and keratinized hard palate mucosa, respectively. The posterior margin is the pterygopalatine arch. Distinct from the mobile soft palate is a subsite of the oropharynx. As in the mandible, gingival carcinomas, given the intimate nature of the thin alveolar gingiva to the underlying maxillary bone, and short distance to cortical invasion of maxillary gingival primary tumors, maxillary SCC usually presents as advanced-stage disease (T3-4a) (Fig. 33.21). Given the indistinct boundary and continuous anatomic relationship between the maxillary alveolar ridge and hard palate, and similar oncologic behavior of these sites, primaries from these areas are managed alike [144]. These sites make up the least common site for OCSCC [145].

An ongoing area of debate is the utility of elective neck dissection for maxillary, gingival, alveolus, and palate SCC. Previously, it was thought that tumors of the maxilla with cN0 disease were at low risk of regional lymph node metastasis regardless of tumor size and depth. More recent larger studies suggest a high risk of metastasis and elective neck dissection [146]. Other studies have suggested elective neck dissection for T4a

![](images/e968b237114d19371d04bfbfe8e165745ebb393cb46a455f77484dbec6d4a13f.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 33.21 Patient with an exophytic erythroleukoplakic lesion of the mandibular gingiva extending just past the mucogingival junction

maxillary SCC with  $21 - 36\%$  of patients demonstrating cervical lymph node metastasis on clinical presentation and a regional failure rate of  $36\%$  [145-150]. Other studies have shown similar high rates of metastatic disease in T4aN0M0 maxillary SCC [144, 145], and even a higher than once thought rate of metastases for lower stage (T1-T2) disease [145]. The majority of recent literature supports elective neck dissection for T3 and T4a, cN0M0 disease [146, 149, 150]. More importantly as in other subsites, DOI may be a more significant prognostic factor than T stage in maxillary alveolar ridge and palatal SCCs. A threshold of  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of DOI has been suggested for predicting occult metastases and may be a reasonable cutoff for deciding to pursue an elective neck dissection [129]. Current NCCN guidelines recommend elective neck dissection for oral cavity SCC with a DOI greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$ , regardless of subsite. Unlike the mandible, additional management options exist for the management of ablative defects of the maxilla such as dental implant (zygomatic implant) retained prostheses. A multidisciplinary team including the maxillofacial prosthodontist should be involved early on in the care of maxillary tumors regardless of the use of free tissue transfer [151].

# 33.6.7 Retromolar Trigone

The triangular soft tissue pad covering the anterior ramus of the mandible bordered cephalad by the maxillary tuberosity and caudad by the posterior surface of the most posterior molar. Laterally, it borders the buccal mucosa. Medially, it borders the soft palate, anterior tonsillar pillar, and floor of mouth. Given the small area of the region, it makes up a minority of OCSCC representing  $2 - 6\%$  of oral cavity SCC (Fig. 33.22) [31, 104, 119]. Given its low prevalence, large volume studies with high-level evidence are lacking.

![](images/be673c4928070bf545a4af900d81994c28e6d504ef85efb6996a0ff8722eab13.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 33.22 Exophytic erythroplakic ulcerative lesion of the retromolar trigone

Given its proximity to other subsites, primary tumors of the retromolar trigone usually involve other subsites as well. In fact, patients' symptoms and findings are similar to that of oropharyngeal tumors as posterior extension is common. These findings include dysphagia, otalgia, and trismus. Lymphatic drainage of the retromolar trigone is predominately level IB and level II [126, 142]. Occult lymph node metastasis is more common than other subsites with  $27 - 64\%$  of individuals presenting with metastatic disease [152, 153]. Retromolar trigone SCC is considered an aggressive and insidious tumor. A marginal mandibulectomy or segmental resection is usually indicated for retromolar trigone primaries. Similar to mandibular gingival SCC, a combination of clinical examination, periosteal stripping, and panoramic radiograph, and CT should be used to assess for transcortical invasion of the tumor. In the case of marrow space involvement of the carcinoma, segmental resection with adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended [153-155].

Three-year recurrence rates for retromolar trigone carcinoma are as high as  $45\%$  [153]. Elective neck dissection is recommended for late-stage cN0 SCC of the retromolar trigone [154]. As in other subsites, depth of invasion may be used as a general guideline for performing an elective neck dissection in this area. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an alternative for early-stage tumors, for use as a diagnostic and therapeutic avenue for cervical lymph node management. Given the proximity of the retromolar trigone to other subsites, and depending on the direction of spread, the masticator space, tonsillar pillars and fossa, soft palate, tongue base, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, maxilla, parapharyngeal space, and palate may be involved and need to be managed. A combination of clinical and radiographic examination should be used to assess these areas [156, 157].

# 33.7 Regional Lymphatics

The cervical lymphatic basins draining the head and neck contain approximately 300 lymph nodes, which make up  $40\%$  of the body's total of  $\sim 800$ , and are invested in a network of fibrofatty tissue. The nodes are interconnected by lymphovascular channels. Considered the most important prognostic indicator in head and neck epithelioid carcinomas, regional lymph node metastasis decreases survival by more than  $50\%$  compared to localized disease. Therefore, the AJCC staging guidelines have long made the clinical and pathologic metastatic nodal status a critical factor in prognosis and management of the patient [158-161]. However, though the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) has long been reported to be a critical factor in prognosis of the

patient [162-166], it was not until the most recent edition of the AJCC (8th edition) that ENE was brought into the clinical and pathologic staging process. ENE is so significant that it now upstages all OCSCCs. Radical neck dissection, first described by Crile in 1905 [167], was once performed in conjunction with resection of nearly all primary head and neck cancers. Removal of at-risk lymph nodes may comprise an elective versus therapeutic neck dissection, i.e., lymphadenectomy in the absence or presence, respectively, of clinically or radiographically evident lymph node metastasis. In the current era, selective neck dissection with preservation of the internal jugular vein, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and spinal accessory nerve is recommended prophylactically for all but the most superficial head and neck tumors [168].

In addition to the presence of metastatic nodes, the presence of ENE, and the location (ipsilateral, contralateral, bilateral), size, and number of metastatic node, the location, and level have been found to be critical during the preoperative workup. Per NCCN guidelines, the preoperative workup for metastatic disease includes clinical examination, and a CT of the neck with contrast. Further adjuncts include the use of PET imaging and MRI. Some now recommend MRI as the standard of care when compared to CT for evaluating the neck for metastatic disease. To assist with treatment planning, the draining nodal basins are divided into seven anatomic and radiographic levels, I-VII (Fig. 33.23). The clinician should evaluate each level of the neck, systematically, with clinical examination and imaging. The level categorization of cervical lymph nodes was originally described by the group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering [169]. OCSCC tumors have relatively predictable lymphatic drainage patterns to the over 300 lymph nodes in the neck, and this has been well documented [126, 142, 170]. The purpose of the defined levels of the neck is to allow clinicians to have a uniform way to communicate with each other. In addition, clinicians can plan surgical management of the neck based on where the primary is located in the oral cavity (Table 33.1). In 2001, based on the biological and oncological significance of these areas, a report of the AHNS committee recommended the use of sublevels (A vs B) for defining selected lymph node groups within levels I, II, and V.

Radiograph landmarks have been developed to correlate with clinical landmarks of boundaries of the levels of the neck (Table 33.2 Radiographic levels of the neck). Level I is divided into two important lymph node groups commonly affected by OCSCC. Level IA, the submental group, is defined as those contained within the boundaries of the submental triangle (bordered by the anterior belly of the digastric muscles laterally, the

hyoid bone inferiorly, and the mandibular symphysis superiorly). Level IB, also called submandibular nodes, refers to the nodes that lie within the boundaries of the submandibular triangle (bordered by the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscles anteriorly and inferiorly, and the body of the mandible superiorly, and stylohyoid muscle posteriorly) [142, 169, 171]. Given these lymph node groups lie in close proximity to the submandibular gland, it is removed to facilitate complete clearance of all lymph nodes at level IIB. For primary sites such as the lip, buccal mucosa, anterior nasal cavity, or soft tissue of the cheek, perifacial lymph nodes, including buccinator nodes, that are located outside of the submandibular triangle superior to the mandibular body, may harbor metastases [172]. The neck dissection performed should be modified to encompass the perifacial nodes.

Level II is divided into two important groups and encompasses the region surrounding the upper third of the internal jugular vein and adjacent spinal accessory nerve. This level (A and B) extends inferiorly from the level of the carotid bifurcation (surgical landmark) or inferior body of the hyoid bone (clinical landmark) inferiorly to the skull base superiorly. The lateral border is the posterior aspect of the SCM, and the medial border

SCCs that arise from the oral cavity, anterior nasal cavity, and soft tissue structures of the midface and the submandibular gland are at greatest risk for metastasizing to this group.</td></tr><tr><td>Level IIA and level IIB (upper jugular)</td><td>Lymph nodes in this group are centered around the upper third of the internal jugular vein and adjacent spinal accessory nerve. Clinically this group extends from the level of the skull base cephalad, to the level of the inferior border of the hyoid bone below caudally. The medial boundary is made up by the stylohyoid muscle (the radiologic correlation to this is the vertical plane defined by the posterior surface of the submandibular gland). The posterior/ lateral boundary is the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Level IIA nodes are located medial (anterior) to the vertical plane defined by the spinal accessory nerve.
Level IIB nodes are located lateral/posterior to the vertical plane defined by the spinal accessory nerve. Primary SCCs from the oral cavity, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and parotid gland upper jugular nodes are at greatest risk for metastasizing to level II.</td></tr><tr><td>Level III (middle jugular)</td><td>Includes lymph nodes located around the middle third of the internal jugular vein (extending superiorly to the inferior border of the hyoid bone and inferiorly to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.

These lymph nodes most commonly harbor metastases from OCSCC, and nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx SCCs. This nodal groups often makes up the most inferior extent of an elective neck dissection for OCSCC primaries.</td></tr></table>

This nodal group are at most risk from metastasis from carcinomas of the that arise from larynx, hypopharynx, thyroid, and cervical esophagus.</td></tr><tr><td>Level VA and VB (posterior triangle)</td><td>This nodal group is composed mainly of the lymph nodes centered along the lower half of the spinal accessory nerve and the transverse cervical artery.

The inferior border is the clavicle, the medial (anterior) border is the posterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lateral (posterior) border is the anterior aspect of the trapezius muscle. L
Level VA is separated from sublevel VB by a horizontal plane line that marks the inferior border of the anterior cricoid arch. Sublevel VA includes the spinal accessory nodes, whereas
Sublevel VB includes nodal basins that follow the transverse cervical vessels and supraclavicular node. The exception is Virchow node (located in level IV).

The lateral borders are the common carotid arteries. These nodal basins are at greatest risk for metastatic spread from carcinomas arising from thyroid gland, glottic and subglottic larynx, cervical esophagus and apex of the piriform sinus.

is the stylohyoid muscle. A perpendicular plane defined by the posterior aspect of the submandibular gland could serve as the radiologic landmark for this medial border. Level II is further divided into sublevels IA and IIB (Table 33.2). These divisions are separated by the spinal accessory nerve, whereas it makes the posterior border of level IIA and the medial (anterior) border of level IIB [171]. Nodal metastases to sublevel IIB are greatest for tumors that arise in the oropharynx rather than OCSCC [173, 174] and laryngeal cancer [175-178]. The rate of metastasis to level IIB for pure OCSCC primaries has been shown to be  $7\%$ , and dissection of this level has to be weighed against morbidity to the spinal accessory nerve [179, 180].

Level III often serves as the most inferior aspect of elective neck dissection for N0 OCSCC [171]. It contains the middle jugular lymph node group, which is located around the middle third of the IJV and extends superiorly from the carotid bifurcation (surgical landmark) or the inferior aspect of the body of the hyoid bone (clinical and radiologic landmark). The inferior border is the junction of the omohyoid muscle with the IJV (surgical landmark), hence the old nomenclature of supraomohy

oid neck dissection (for dissection of levels I-III). The inferior clinical and radiologic landmark is a horizontal plane defined by the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. The lateral (posterior) border is the posterior aspect of the SCM (or sensory branches of the cervical plexus). The medial border is the lateral border of the sternohyoid muscle. The lateral aspect of the common carotid artery is the radiologic landmark for the medial border.

The level IV nodal group contains those around the lower third of the IJV. They extend superiorly from the omohyoid muscle (surgical landmark) or cricoid arch (clinical landmark) superiorly, and inferiorly to the clavicle. The lateral border is the posterior aspect of the SCM (or sensory branches of the cervical plexus), and the medial (anterior) border is the lateral aspect of the sternohyoid muscle. The radiologic medial border is the lateral aspect of the common carotid artery. There is also a debate whether level IV should be included in a selective neck dissection for OCSCC for N0 and N1 OCSCC. There is a fear of skip metastases to this level, although recent reports suggest this is not common [181]. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated very low rates of skip metastasis to level IV in patients with cN0 OCSCC [182].

Level V, or the posterior triangle group of lymph nodes, encompasses three predominant lymphatic pathways within the posterior triangle: nodes located along the spinal accessory nerve as it travels through the posterior triangle (VA), nodes located around the transverse cervical as it travels through the lower posterior triangle (VB), and supraclavicular nodes located just above the clavicle (VB). Level V is divided into level VA and level VB. The borders of level V include the anterior border of the trapezius muscle laterally (posterior), the posterior border of the SCM medially (anterior), and the clavicle inferiorly. Supraclavicular lymph nodes extend below the level of the upper horizontal border of the clavicle to include a particular node of importance—Virchow's node (sentinel). A horizontal plane that corresponds to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage divides level V into sublevels VA and VB. Metastases to level V are very rare for OCSCC primaries [142].

Level VA is bordered inferiorly created by the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage, superiorly by the apex made of by the convergence of the trapezius and SCM. The anterior border is made up of the posterior belly of the SCM (or sensory branches of the cervical plexus). The posterior border is made up of the anterior belly of the trapezius.

The inferior border of level VB is the clavicles. The superior border is the horizontal plane created by the lower border of the hyoid bone, the anterior border is the posterior belly of the SCM (sensory branches of the cervical plexus), and the posterior border is the anterior belly of the trapezius.

Level VI includes the lymph nodes of the anterior compartment of the neck, including the paratracheal, parathyroidal, and paralaryngeal (precricoid (Delphian)) nodes [169]. This group of lymph nodes surrounds the midline visceral structures of the neck. The superior border is the hyoid bone, while the inferior border is the suprasternal notch. Level VI is bounded bilaterally by the medial border of the carotid sheath. Metastases from OCSCC primaries to level VI are extremely rare. Metastases to level VI are most commonly from primary cancers of the thyroid gland, at the apex of the piriform sinus, and in the subglottic larynx, cervical esophagus, and cervical trachea. Except lymph nodes along the superior thyroid artery, the superior component of level VI does not usually contain any lymphatic structures.

Level VII is an often unreported area of the neck, which contains the superior mediastinal lymph node chains. It is bordered superiorly by the superior edge of the manubrium, inferiorly by the superior border of

the arch of the aorta. Its lateral borders are made up of the common carotid artery (left) and the innominate artery (right). It has a very low risk of metastases from OCSCC [169].

The nodal groups most at risk of metastasis are widespread throughout the neck and are those that extend from the mandible and skull base superiorly, to the clavicle inferiorly, to the posterior triangle bilaterally, to the midline viscera of the neck. Approximately  $30\%$  of clinically node-negative patients, that is nodal metastasis undetectable on clinical or imaging examination, will demonstrate occult metastasis on elective neck dissection. The management of the neck has changed significantly over the past several years, with the number of neck dissections increasing in those with OCSCC, the median node count increasing within those neck dissection specimens, and the prognosis for survival increasing in those receiving neck dissection since the 1970s [9]. The presence of regional metastatic disease in head and neck cancer  $(\geq \mathrm{N}1)$  lowers the survival of rate for head and neck cancer patient by  $50\%$ . There has been a growing body of evidence showing that depth of invasion is a predictor for occult nodal metastasis [129].

# 33.8 Diagnosis and Workup: NCCN Guidelines

Assessment and staging of the patient begin with the clinical examination. Specifically, on physical examination, the surgeons want to palpate the tumor and surrounding tissues assessing for the exophytic nature of the tumor, but more importantly, the induration of the tumor and fixation to underlying structures that suggest a more worrisome tumor. The entire external head and neck, and oral cavity and pharynx should be examined in a systematic way, regardless of known clinical findings (i.e., patient is referred for specific tumor).

# 33.8.1 Assessment for Bone Invasion

For oral cavity SCC, specifically with regard to gingival maxillary, and more importantly, mandibular carcinoma, assessment for bony invasion is critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and management. As discussed previously, preoperative clinical examination, preoperative imaging including orthopantomogram and CT, and intraoperative findings should be used to assess for signs of bone erosion that suggest an invasive growth pattern [135, 137-140, 183-185]. When planning segmental resection margins, a combination of clinical examination, and panoramic and CT imaging should guide the surgeon. Periosteal stripping may rarely change the

surgeon preoperative margin choice. This may happen in the case where there is a delay between clinical examination and imaging and surgery. Periosteal stripping and intraoperative findings may also change resection margins when the tumor is fast growing. Besides these two clinical scenarios, the combination of clinical examination and preoperative imaging is not perfect and the surgeon should be ready to and able to alter their plan in the intraoperative setting. In addition, OCSCC from other subsites such as the floor of mouth, tongue, retromolar trigone, and buccal mucosa often have gingival extension where bone marrow invasion needs to be assessed for oncologic management, and the needle to include maxillectomy, or marginal or segmental resection of the mandible.

# 33.8.2 Biopsy

Clinically suspicious lesions of the oral cavity that do not resolve spontaneously after 2 weeks require a tissue diagnosis. A tissue diagnosis is required before the formation of any definitive treatment plan. It is preferable for the treating surgeon and oncology team to evaluate the primary site and assess for regional disease. Excisional biopsies by referring providers can make initial staging of the lesions difficult. Often if the lesions are found to be malignant, the margins maybe are inadequate and if re-excision is necessary, however the original primary site maybe very hard to locate.

Incisional or excisional biopsies remain the gold standard for histopathologic diagnosis. Biopsies can usually be done in the office setting, but general anesthesia may be necessary for lesions that are difficult to access. Accurate dimensions of the lesions should be determined before biopsies. Intraoral photographs can be helpful in documentation. It is extremely important to make sure the biopsy is of adequate depth to capture the depth of invasion of the lesion, which is essential in deciding to perform an elective neck dissection for smaller tumors as obtaining the correct depth of invasion can affect the stage of the lesion and the need for elective neck dissection. When patients present with large lesions, it is best to take multiple biopsies, to increase the chance of obtaining a correct histologic diagnosis. It is not uncommon to see dysplasia at the margins and necrosis or inflammation at the central part of the lesion.

Older biopsies techniques have called for an inclusion of adjacent normal tissue. However, this is not necessary for lesions that are highly suspicious for carcinoma. The goals of biopsy of highly suspicious lesions are to provide a tissue diagnosis and to provide the depth of invasion if the lesion is malignant. The oral cavity is the only subsite in the head and neck that

inclusion of normal tissue has been advocated for. Historically, oropharynx and hypopharynx lesions have been diagnosed with cupped forceps without the addition of normal tissue.

# 33.8.3 Histological Features and Grading

The WHO classification of OPMDs is based on clinical appearance. However, premalignant lesions, that is, those where a cancer is more likely to occur, can be classified on their architectural cytologic findings as well. The presence of dysplastic areas of the epithelium of the aerodigestive tract is thought to be associated with a likely progression to cancer and that the more severe the dysplasia, the more likely that epithelium will progress to malignancy [186]. However, epithelium with no previous dysplasia may also transform to cancer.

A hypothetical model suggests there is an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that progresses along with histological change suggesting a correlation between genetics and cell morphology (Fig. 33.24) [187-189]. And though the prognostic significance is unknown, cells harboring mutations of the p53 gene can be found at in dysplastic epithelium at tumor margins suggesting an association between these mutations and premalignant lesions [190]. Though still not clinically applicable, many centers are working toward developing methods to correlate molecular biology changes in premalignant lesions with predicting prognosis [190, 191].

If dysplasia or malignancy is suspected, it should be biopsied. The specimen is then assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Dysplastic features of stratified squamous epithelium include cellular atypia, and loss of stratification and normal maturation. The WHO defines terminology used to describe dysplasia [186]. Alternative

assessment schemes for premalignant lesions include the Ljubljana classification developed by laryngeal pathologists [192], and the use of the term squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (SIN), or variations on this such as oral intraepithelial neoplasia [193]. The later was not favored by the WHO. Inter- and intra-rater reliability correlation coefficients have been found to be higher among pathologists using the Ljubljana systems. Of note, the extent of surface keratinization or lack thereof (atrophy, keratosis, or hyperkeratosis) is not significant in the assessment of dysplasia.

Traditional dysplasia grading classifies lesions into mild, moderate, and severe [186]. The challenge in making the diagnosis of dysplasia uniform is that it represents a spectrum of change rather than discrete stages that can be categorized [186]. In general, mild dysplasia is characterized by architecture disturbance limited to the lower third of the epithelium (Table 33.3). Moderate dysplasia is architecture disturbance that extends up to the middle third of the epithelium. Within moderate dysplasia, consideration is given to degree of cytological atypia. Despite not extending to the upper third of the epithelium, the presence of marked atypia would categorize a lesion as "severe dysplasia." Alternatively, the presence of mild atypia would suggest downgrading the lesion to "mild dysplasia" (Fig. 33.25). Severe dysplasia is traditionally defined by architecture disturbance in greater than two-thirds of the epithelium. As noted previously, architecture disturbance extending up to the middle third of the epithelium with sufficient atypia is upgraded from moderate-to-severe dysplasia. Some pathologists choose to add a fourth category of carcinoma in situ, which is characterized by atypical changes from top to bottom of the epithelium. However, many collapse severe dysplasia and CIS into one category [194].

The management of dysplasia is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, dysplasia may appear in normal-appearing mucosa, or in previously discussed lesions such as erythroplakia, leukoplakia, and erythroleukoplakia [194]. Sampling error may be present as well (i.e., severe dysplasia present in tissue not biopsied, and area next to biopsied area of tissue with moderate dysplasia). Adding to uncertainty is that inter- and intra-rater reliability correlation of grading has been found to be low among those reading specimens. Intra-rater reliability, or the ability of an examiner to agree exactly with their own diagnose, has been found to be as low as  $50\%$  [195].

Inter-rater reliability, or the ability of examiners to agree with each other, has been found to be as low as  $20\%$  [196]. Many studies display a maximum inter- and intra-rater reliability of  $80\%$  [194, 195].

The WHO grading system is a binary system that classifies all cases as low-grade dysplasia or high-grade dysplasia using the features in Table 33.3. A lesion is classified as low-grade based on the observation of fewer than 5 cytological changes or fewer than 4 architectural changes. A lesion is classified as high grade based on the observation of at least 5 cytological changes and 4 architectural changes [186]. Like the 4-grade system, intrarater reliability and inter-rater reliability are marginal.

Perhaps the most useful aspect of grading premalignant lesions is the ability to correlate the severity of dysplasia with the potential for malignant transformation. However, this trend is inconsistent in the literature. In a large study, dysplastic lesions were found to have a  $36\%$  increased risk of cancer progression when compared to normal mucosa [80]. Other studies have shown a trend in correlating degree of dysplasia for risk of malignant transformation; however, they did not reach statistical significance [197]. Important to note is the fact that many OPMD does not all go on to transform to cancer [198]. Another large-scale study demonstrated that the transformation risk in leukoplakias demonstrates moderate or severe dysplasia double that of that seen in mild dysplasia or hyperplasia [199]. The transformation rate in moderate and severe dysplasias may be as high as  $36\%$  [80]. In another study, leukoplakias with moderate-to-severe dysplasia had a significantly higher risk of transforming to carcinoma than mild dysplasia [200].

# 33.8.4 Adverse Histologic Features

# 33.8.4.1 Perineural Invasion

Perineural invasion (PNI) is the process by which tumor invades nervous structures and spreads along nerve sheaths [201]. PNI has been shown to be a predictor of

nodal metastasis and poor prognosis. In a study, it was found that PNI of nerves  $< 1 \mathrm{~mm}$  was found in  $52\%$  of patients, and PNI was significantly associated with local recurrence and a poor 2-year disease-specific mortality rate [202]. A systemic review suggests that large nerve or multifocal PNI is an independent indication for postoperative adjuvant therapy [203].

# 33.8.5 Lymphovascular Invasion

Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is the presence of neoplastic epithelium within lymphatic channels. More than  $50\%$  of OCSCC will have LVI [204]. LVI correlates with nodal spread [205] and is associated with a higher risk of locoregional recurrence [206].

# 33.8.5.1 Brandwein-Gensler Risk Model

In 2005, Brandwein-Gesler proposed a multifactorial risk assessment, combining PNI, lymphocytic response, and the worst pattern of invasion (WPOI), and the risk classification is highly predictive of locoregional recurrence and overall survival. Patients are categorized into low risk (score of 0), intermediate risk [1, 2], and high risk [3-9] (Table 33.4) [207]. This model was validated by a multicenter study in 2010 may be useful clinically [208].

# 33.8.5.2 Assessment of Regional Lymphatics

Evaluation of the neck begins on the initial physical examination. Usually, clinicians prefer to stand behind the patient inspecting the neck in a systematic manner starting at level I and ending at level VI. Using topographical landmarks, the clinician may want to start from the midline submental triangle and then move posterior to the submandibular triangle. Given the high rate of metastatic spread to these two areas, they are critical

in the evaluation of the patient with OCSCC. It is also critical to palpate for perifacial lymph nodes, which are at high risk of metastasis in OCSCC. Next, the clinician can continue palpating posterior to the peri-parotid area. The clinician can continue moving down to level III and level IV, and then posteriorly to level V. Finally, the clinician can palpate level VI including palpation of the thyroid gland for any masses. The clinician will want to note any palpable masses, noting if they are fixed to skin or underlying tissues as this would indicate metastasis. In addition, the clinician should note the size and level of the node, correlating this with imaging findings.

Unfortunately, clinical examination of the neck has been found to be unreliable when compared with imaging findings [209, 210]. Clinicians regardless of training and experience underestimated the size of smaller lymph nodes. When comparing to actual neck dissection specimens, the sensitivity of the clinical examination correctly identifying metastatic lymph nodes was  $74\%$ . However, the clinical examination only identified pathological cervical adenopathy  $75\%$  of the time. It should be noted that with the addition of a CT neck, this detection rate increased to  $91\%$  [209].

# 33.8.5.3 CT

As per NCCN guidelines, all patients should have a CT of the neck to evaluate for regional metastatic spread of OCSCC [211]. CT with intravenous contrast of the neck helps delineate vascular from lymphatic structures. Renal function, which is often compromised in elderly patients, should be evaluated at the least with serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) prior to administration of contrast, which is generally nephrotoxic. Three- to five-mm slices from the skull base to clavicles are generally recommended. A more superior field of view may be chosen, however, depending on the craniocaudal location of the primary tumor,

which is often evaluated as part of the same scan. Generally, a CT of the maxillofacial region is often obtained to delineate the extent of the primary tumor. CT slices with cuts of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  or less may be ordered in the case where the surgeon will be using virtual surgical planning for resection and reconstruction of oral cavity primaries, and where precision is needed for planning CAD/CAM fabrication of stereolithographic models, custom cutting guides, and patient-specific plates. In addition, in the case where virtual surgical planning for free flap reconstruction using patient-specific data is planned, the clinician may also order a CT of the donor site at the same time (i.e., CT lower extremities for free fibula flap reconstruction planning). Open biopsy of cervical lymph nodes is never recommended.

CT has been found to be more sensitive, specific, and accurate than clinical examination raising the detection rate of pathologic cervical lymphadenopathy from  $75\%$  to  $91\%$  [209]. In addition, CT adds to the accuracy of the clinical examination in identifying ENE, which is critical, per the AJCC 8th edition, guidelines, in appropriately staging the patient with OCSCC [212]. Radiographic markers of metastatic lymph nodes include nodes greater than  $1.5\mathrm{cm}$  in the jugulodigastric region, or greater than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in other areas of the neck [213, 214]. A round, sphere-like shape is more indicative of nodal metastasis than a normal or hyperplastic lymph node with a "bean shape." Metastatic lymph nodes will often have the presence of intranodal necrosis on imaging. This is especially true in HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma [214]. Pathological ENE is defined as extension of metastatic carcinoma from within a lymph node through the fibrous capsule and into the surrounding connective tissue, regardless of the presence of stromal reaction [215]. In addition, the CT should be examined for any markers for ENE, which include irregular nodal margins and absence of perinodal fat [216].

# 33.8.5.4 MRI

Alternatively, MRI has been advocated by some to be equal to superior to CT in evaluating cervical lymph node metastases of OCSCC. MRI offers superior soft tissue detail when compared to CT. However, the perinodal fat that surrounds cervical lymph nodes can sometimes interfere with image detection on MRI. When using MRI, T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, contrast-enhanced views may offer the optimal sequence to evaluate for cervical lymph node metastases [217, 218]. MRI also offers advantages in evaluating the primary tumor of the oral cavity, especially in soft tissue tumors such as

those subsites as the tongue and floor of mouth. The procedure of the MRI makes it often not amendable to head and neck cancer patients. MRI takes much longer to obtain when compared to CT; therefore, patients must remain motionless for an extended duration of time. For those with large OCSCC obstructing the airway, they may not be amendable to MRI. The same radiographic markers used for CT to evaluate metastatic lymph node spread, such as size and shape criteria, as well as identifying central necrosis, should be used when using MRI.

# 33.8.5.5 Ultrasound

Ultrasound has become increasingly popular in Europe for the evaluation of cervical lymph node metastases in not only the initial but also the surveillance period after treatment time frame. The advantage of ultrasound is that it is inexpensive, quick, and tolerated well by patients [219]. It is often used as an "initial" modality for imaging of the neck, prompting clinicians to seek additional imaging such as CT and MRI when indicated. The main disadvantage of employing high-quality USA for evaluating cervical lymph node metastases is that it is a very technique-sensitive [220, 221]. Reported sensitivities range between 80 and  $95\%$ , which is extremely helpful in the surveillance time frame. In addition, given that suspicious lymph nodes can be found in "real time," concomitant ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can be done at the same time [222]. Markers for metastatic lymph nodes using ultrasound are similar to that of CT and MRI. Characteristics that should be evaluated are lymph node size, shape, and central necrosis. On ultrasound, metastatic lymph nodes appear spherical and hypoechogenic. Features of ENE on ultrasound include loss of a defined border of the node. Normal lymph nodes are difficult to identify given they are indistinguishable from their surrounding fatty tissue. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) aspiration is not advocated in the diagnostic setting, however, may have more utility in the surveillance setting.

# 33.8.5.6 PET/CT to Diagnose "Regional" Lymphatics

[18]F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography(PET/CT), although now recommended per NCCN guidelines for the evaluation of distant metastatic disease in advanced OCSCC [223], may not add to accuracy of CT of the neck in the ability to identify metastatic regional lymph nodes. PET uses FDG uptake as a marker of glycolysis and enhanced metabolic activity among those areas

evaluated. Increased glycolysis or FDG avidity (uptake) represents a functional representation, rather than a morphologic representation of tissues. It is often combined and overlaid with CT to enhance the identification of the anatomic location of FDG avidity. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of PET were found to be  $60.3\%$ ,  $70.5\%$ ,  $66.0\%$ ,  $65.2\%$ , and  $65.5\%$ , respectively [224]. However, a more recent study demonstrated that in 128 patients with OCSCC, who had negative clinical examinations of the neck, when compared with histological findings of those patients' neck dissection specimens, the sensitivity of PET/CT was  $69.1\%$  vs  $35.7\%$  for CT/MRI [225]. Other studies have demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of  $90\%$  and  $94\%$  compared to CT  $(82\%, 85\%)$  and MRI  $(80\%, 79\%)$  [226-228]. PET may have a unique role in evaluating the N0 neck [229, 230, 231]. However, the specificity was higher in the CT/MRI group when compared to PET/CT. Other studies have demonstrated the superiority of PET/CT in identifying occult cervical lymph node metastases in patients with negative neck palpation findings on physical examination [232]. The drawbacks of PET/CT are its inability to differentiate between cancerous and inflammatory lymph nodes. Also, PET/CT offers less ability to delineate anatomic relationships of the primary tumor and lymph nodes with surrounding structures, especially those structures that are vascular in nature.

# 33.8.5.7 Sentinel Node Biopsy

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has long been reported as an adjunct in melanoma [233] and breast cancer [234]. SLNB is used in Europe and selected North American centers and is currently undergoing investigation as an alternative to selective neck dissection in the  $\mathrm{T}_{1-2}\mathrm{N}_0$  oral cavity primaries in a US multi-centered consortium-based clinical trial [235]. Per the 8th edition AJCC guidelines, sentinel node biopsy is an alternative to elective neck dissection for select smaller T1-T2 tumors [236].

# 33.8.6 Distant Metastasis Workup

The percentage of individuals with oral squamous cell carcinoma who present with distant metastasis at initial presentation is low. Despite the paucity of patients with

distant metastasis, it is prudent to thoroughly stage the patient for optimal treatment planning. The lungs are the most common site of distant metastasis, followed by liver and bone. At a very minimum, chest radiographs and evaluation of liver function tests (LFTs) are required for the metastatic workup. Per the United States Preventive Service task force guidelines, if the patient is a 55-80 with a history of smoking, a chest CT should be ordered to rule out a lung malignancy and distant metastasis [237, 238]. FDG PET/CT is recommended for locoregionally advanced cancer (T3 and T4 primary and  $\geq$  N1 nodal disease). The ACRIN 6685 multicenter trial found that FDG PET/CT has an high NPV for the N0 neck on T2 and greater head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The results of the PET/CT in this study changed the surgical plan in  $22\%$  of their patients [231].

The remaining part of the metastatic workup is driven by the imaging findings. Lung nodules with suspicious features or uptake on PET imaging require a tissue diagnosis. Image-guided transthoracic biopsy has been shown to have a sensitivity of  $86.1\%$  and specificity of  $98.8\%$  [239]. Lesions of the mediastinum are often amenable to endobronchial ultrasonography with biopsy (EBUS). EBUS has been shown to be highly accurate but maybe suspect for peripheral lung lesions [240].

# 33.9 Staging: AJCC

The TMN staging system is meant to serve as a common language among providers who collaborate in the multidisciplinary treatment of cancer patients, and also to guide management and provide guidance on survival based on published data. OCSCC staging is made up of three components, tumor (T), regional lymph node (N), and metastasis (M) (Table 33.5). Staging primarily is made up of tumor size (T). However, in 2018, the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer incorporated several important changes to the TNM classification and staging for lip and OC cancers (Table 33.6). These changes were made from the AJCC 7th edition staging in order to improve disease-free survival discrimination between overall stages, and T and N categories [97, 236].

Of note, tumor depth of invasion (DOI) by millimeter (not tumor thickness) was included as a modifier of the T (tumor) category as several reports have demonstrated that tumors with a larger DOI or thickness are associated with an increased risk of nodal metastasis and worse survival rates [241-243]. It is important to note that the new staging uses DOI, and not tumor thickness. The addition of depth of invasion is to separate superficial tumors with a good prognosis from small tumors that are deeply invasive and associated with poor prognosis [236]. Depth of invasion differs from tumor thickness in that tumor thickness measures the entire tumor. Tumor thickness can overestimate (for exophytic tumors) or underestimate (for endophytic tumors) potential tumor aggressiveness compared with DOI (Fig. 33.26).

DOI is measured by horizon line that is established from the basement membrane of the closest adjacent normal squamous epithelium (white arrow). A plumb line is then dropped from the horizon line to the deepest point of tumor invasion. The length of the plumb line corresponds to pathologic DOI [244].

The new 8th edition AJCC guidelines classify depth of invasion at  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  increments. Less-invasive tumors are  $5\mathrm{mm}$  or less, moderately invasive tumors are greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  and less than or equal to  $10\mathrm{mm}$ , and deeply invasive tumors are greater than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in depth. Essentially, the presence of increased DOI upstages the tumor designation such that a tumor  $\leq 2\mathrm{cm}$  is a T1 (Fig. 33.27). However, when the DOI is  $>5\mathrm{mm}$ , this makes it a T2. Or when a tumor is  $>2\mathrm{cm}$  and  $<4\mathrm{cm}$ , it is a T2. The exception to this is when  $\mathrm{DOI} > 10\mathrm{mm}$ . In the new AJCCC 8th edition staging, this makes it a T3. In the prior 7th edition AJCCC staging, a T4a was defined by invasion through cortical bone or involves the inferior alveolar nerve, floor of mouth, or skin of face (i.e., chine or nose) (oral cavity)

Fig. 33.26 Tumor thickness vs depth of invasion

Tumor invades adjacent structures (e.g., through cortical bone [mandible or maxilla] into deep[extrinsic] muscle of tongue [genioglossus, hyoglossus, palatoglossus, and styloglossus], maxillary sinus, skin of face). However, now, just with the tumor being  $>4$  cm and a DOI of  $>10$  mm makes it a T4a. Timing of T staging is also important, and this can be specified (clinical versus pathologic). The edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System (AJCC 8) also removed extrinsic tongue muscle involvement as an contributor for the T4a category. T0 has also been eliminated as a T category. In the previous 7th edition AJCC guidelines, the T0 category was reserved for when metastatic regional lymph nodes were found on biopsy for harboring metastatic carcinoma, yet no identifiable primary tumor was found on clinical examination, imaging, or directed biopsy of likely primary tumor sites. More than  $90\%$  of unknown

primary tumors (T0) in the head and neck, however, have been shown to have arisen from HPV + -associated oropharyngeal tumors. In addition, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is another virus-associated head and neck cancer that can present with regional nodal disease in the absence of an identifiable primary tumor at the expected mucosal site of origin. In the case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the viral origin is the Epstein-Barr virus. Accordingly, the revised 8th edition of the AJCC staging guidelines reserves the T0 designation for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and salivary gland carcinomas [245].

Clinical staging prior to definitive surgical management is designated by placing the prefix C (cTMN). The patient, however, may be restaged based on final pathology after resection and lymph node dissection. This is designated with a prefix P (pTNM). Alternatively, a patient who dies and receives autopsy will be designated with a prefix A (aTNM). If synchronous tumors are found at presentation, an m suffix may be used to denote the multiple primary tumors (TmNM). Other prefixes that may be used during management of the patient (post-systemic/radiation therapy) may be used (Table 33.6).

Other changes include subclasses to the N3b category as described below. N defines the regional

lymph node component of staging and is graded on the presence of nodes, greatest dimension, and side of involvement in relation to the primary tumor. With the new 8th edition of AJCC guidelines, there are now 7 subcategories for the N staging (N0, N1, N2a). In addition, the presence or absence of extranodal extension (ENE) was added as a part of the staging and risk assessment algorithm in that it now upstages nodal-positive OCSCC. Studies have demonstrated that extranodal tumor extension more than  $1.7\mathrm{mm}$  beyond the nodal capsule is negatively associated with disease-specific survival in patients with OCSCC [163]. Like DOI, identifying ENE upstages the pathologic N Lymph node category by 1 level in the revised 8th edition criteria. In the new 8th edition guidelines, clinical ENE is confirmed only with obvious evidence of physical examination findings, such as skin invasion, infiltration of musculature, dense tethering of adjacent structures, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, phrenic nerve, and sympathetic trunk dysfunction. In addition, clinical suspicion of ENE must also be supported by findings on imaging that suggest ENE for valid use in preoperative clinical staging. The presence of ENE, despite size and number of involved lymph nodes, now designates a patient as N3b. This designation highlights the presence of ENE on survival. Suffixes such as "sn" and "f" can be added to designate if the lymph node is identified on sentinel lymph node biopsy or fine-needle aspiration, respectively. The suffixes of "U" or "L" can be given to designate if metastasis is above or below the cricoid, respectively.

During pathological staging, the presence of ENE does not necessarily make a patient N3b. However, at the "p" time period, metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node,  $\leq 3$  cm with ENE, is pN2a. However, metastasis of a single ipsilateral lymph node,  $>3$  cm with ENE, is a pN3b. The presence of metastasis in multiple ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral nodes with ENE is a pN3b. Finally, the presence of a single contralateral node of any size with ENE is also a pN3b. The presence of distant metastasis is based simply on its presence (M1) or absence (M0). Prefixes that may be added are "c" for metastasis found during the clinical staging or "p" for metastasis microscopically confirmed.

# Key Points

- Oral cancer is the second most common mucosal malignancy of the head and neck.  
A history of smoking is still the single most common risk factor for oral cancer.  
In the new 8th edition AJCC guidelines, sentinel node biopsy is an alternative to elective neck dissection for select T1-T2 tumors

Tumor depth of invasion and extranodal extension have been widely known to be important in the prognosis of oral cancer. These factors were added to the staging and risk assessment algorithm in the new 8th edition of AJCC guidelines.

It should be noted that the new 8th edition of AJCC guidelines for oropharyngeal carcinoma now distinguishes  $\mathrm{HPV + }$  and HPV- disease as two distinct entities. This is due to the distinct tumor behavior, and the improved prognosis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Table 33.7). The expression of the tumor suppressor protein cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16-INK4a, p16) serves as a surrogate marker for HPV-driven tumor [246]. The mechanism of this is discussed previously [47, 247].

# Conclusion

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has published guidelines that guide the management of OCSCC. Unlike other sites of the head and neck, where primary treatment with radiation alone, or with concurrent chemotherapy (chem-RT) may be used as initial management, the primary management of OCSCC is surgery. This is because most early-stage and even advanced-stage OCSCCs are amendable to surgery. Certainly, primary and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy have a strong role in the management of OCSCC. Management per NCCN guidelines will be discussed in another chapter in this text. Definitive surgery is still the approach of choice for curative intent for OCSCC. Furthermore, with the advancement of reconstructive surgery and advent of microvascular free tissue transfer, definitive surgery, especially that in advanced-stage cancers, no longer always condemns patients to a poor functional and cosmetic outcome. Microvascular free tissue transfer will be discussed in another chapter. First and foremost, to manage the patient appropriately, the patient must be diagnosed and staged correctly as was described herein.
