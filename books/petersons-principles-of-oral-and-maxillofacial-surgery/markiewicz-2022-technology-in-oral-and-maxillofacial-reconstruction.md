# 50.1 Introduction

Recently, there have been a dramatic improvement and increased integration in the technology used to care for the oral and maxillofacial surgery patient. While the early to late twentieth century can be defined as an era of unprecedented innovation in the procedures we perform in our specialty, the present era can be credited as one of innovation in developing technological adjuncts for performing these tried and true procedures. Examples of this can be seen in the subspecialties of craniofacial surgery, orthognathic surgery, ablative head and neck surgery, reconstructive surgery, trauma surgery, and dentoalveolar and implant surgery, where the basis of the procedures themselves has remained relatively unchanged. These developing technologies and their effect on how we plan and execute these procedures are considered by many to define this current time period in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The refinement of computer-aided design and computer-aided modeling (CAD/CAM), developed several decades ago for neurosurgical and radiology procedures, has seen an accelerated growth most recent years leading to an even increased level of precision and impact on patient care. This chapter will discuss those technologies, their evidence, along with their advantages and drawbacks. There have been dramatic technological advances in dentoalveolar surgery and dental implant surgery. However, this topic is covered elsewhere in detail in this textbook and will not be covered in this chapter.

Computer-aided surgery can be divided into five phases (Table 50.1): (1) the data acquisition phase, in which all imaging, laser surface scans, clinical information, anthropometric, implant STLs (FIGURE Implant STLs), and measurements are obtained; (2) the planning phase (Fig. 50.1), in which CT data are imported into

a proprietary software program for the purposes of virtually planning the surgery; (3) manufacturing phase (Fig. 50.2. Of metal 3D printing), in which guides, stents, and patient-specific implants are fabricated using 3D printers; (4) surgical phase (Fig. 50.3), which is performed utilizing CAD/CAM-derived stereolithographic models, guide-stents, splints, and patient-specific implants, and/or intraoperative navigation; and (5) assessment phase (Fig. 50.4), in which the accuracy of the treatment plan transfer is evaluated using intraoperative (or postoperative) CT imaging. This phase is often neglected and however can be used to assess outcomes for the benefit of the patient or the clinician for either critically evaluating their outcomes and technique, or for research purposes (evaluating their outcomes on a larger scale).

# 50.1.1 Data Acquisition

The data acquisition phase is initiated on the first interaction with the patient. It occurs in the form of quantifying the clinical deformity or problem through clinical examination (Fig. 50.5) and obtaining high-quality clinical photographs (2D vs. 3D); through obtaining all necessary anatomic records necessary for virtual surgical planning (i.e., bite registrations and/or dental models via surface laser scanning) tumor measurements, and planned incision placement for vessel anastomosis; and through acquiring a CT scan of the patient, with the DICOM data to be imported into the appropriate planning software.

The clinical information necessary for computer planning is specific to the clinical application to which it is being used. For example, in preparation for a head and neck ablative and reconstructive surgical procedure, specific information regarding the particular pathologic diagnosis (benign versus malignant), location of inferior alveolar nerve, teeth, and neighboring structures), neurosensory disturbances, associated injury, hard and soft tissue involvement, and the extent of the planned surgical resection or reconstruction should be documented. It is generally not necessary to obtain bite registrations (unless occlusal-based cutting guides are to be fabricated). In contrast, computer-aided surgical simulation and clinical and radiographic data gathering in orthognathic surgery require registration of centric relation prior to CT imaging, registration of natural head position (optional), laser scanning of teeth or plaster dental models, and high-quality facial photography, as well as accurate anthropometric data. Clinical photos, imaging, and measurements are critical to have during the actual virtual surgical planning process where 3D planning imaging can be compared. For example, midlines and

cants seen on 3D imaging during virtual planning should be compared against clinical photographs and measurements. Alternatively, during ablative virtual surgical planning, tumor margins seen on 3D imaging should be compared against 2D radiographs such as panoramic radiographs as well as clinical imaging which demonstrate soft tissue components of tumors.

Once the clinical evaluation is completed and presurgical records have been obtained, the CT scan is completed using the standard scanning algorithm, matrix of  $512 \times 512$  at  $0.625\mathrm{mm}$  slice thickness,  $25\mathrm{cm}$  or lesser field-of-view (FOV),  $0^{\circ}$  gantry tilt, and 1:1 pitch. It is important to note that a slice thickness of  $0.625\mathrm{mm}$  is advised, and larger slice spacing may be used depending on the application. The DICOM-formatted CT images are then transferred to the appropriate surgical planning software.

Surface imaging, or scanning, is a technique in which a laser of other capturing device is used to replicate the 3D surface of soft tissue or patient surface anatomy, or dental cast. This data can then be imported digitally into a similar computer software program as the CT files. Advantages surface scanning compared to using 3D reconstruction of surface images of CT data include the lack of exposure to radiation and general anesthesia, particularly in the pediatric patient population, the convenience (can be done in clinical setting), and the accuracy [1]. Surface scanning software imports individual points on the face, anatomical surfaces, or models, and then combines then in the x, y, and z axes rendering a 3D representation of object being scanned. Therefore, the

scans resolution is limited by the number of points in can imported into its dataset which is increasing with the development of higher resolution laser acquisition software. Of note, the cost of surface laser scanning devices is significantly decreasing.

Facial surface acquisition devices are classified as either coordinate measurement machines (CMMs), range imaging, moire, stereophotogrammetry, or position tracking devices. Surface imaging devices have

shown accuracy in the sub-millimeter range when compared their real-life representations [1, 2], becoming especially popular in the field of craniofacial/cleft lip and palate surgery where precision is crucial for flap design and movement. One group in particular has rigorously developed and tested a 3D laser scanner for acquisition of the surface anatomy in the cleft/lip and palate population [1-3]. The patient is scanned at a set distance (i.e.,  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ) as controlled by a tape measure

fixed to the camera. The patient's facial surface then reflects the distorted light of the laser which is then captured by a charged coupled distributor camera and converted into distance information using triangulation principles. The system then captures geometric points on a scatter plot. Using a software program, the scatter plot is then transferred into surface information via a software program, which can then manipulate the surfaces texture and color rendering an accurate representation of the soft tissue profile of the patient.

# 50.1.2 Preoperative Planning

Surgical stimulation and manipulation of the 3D facial skeleton using data derived from CT datasets can now be performed on several software platforms [4-7]. This phase begins with choosing a software platform or a third party who assists with virtual planning (Fig. 50.6). Next the CT scan is integrated and denoised. The denoising step can be time consuming and is critical step prior to using CT data. Appropriate STL files such as implants to be used during the surgery are imported. The 3D representations of the CTs are then segmented into those being manipulated. Other pertinent anatomy such as tumors, vital structures such as the vascular sinuses of the brain and vasculature of the head and neck and donor sites can be segmented as well. The planned surgery derived from preoperative surgical simulation can then be combined with intraoperative navigation to implement the plan, check its accuracy, and modify it if needed [8, 9]. The simplest, yet most studied and effective way to perform hard tissue reconstruction is by mirroring the images of the opposite, unaffected side of the facial skeleton, to the affected side of the face using a variety of software programs. Virtual software allows segmentation of the area of interest and either virtual manipulation or reconstruction of the patient's native anatomy such as in congenital craniofacial, traumatic, or oncologic defects, or insertion of virtual implants into the virtual field such as in traumatic or postablative reconstruction.

Several CAD/CAM programs are currently available to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. Several offer the specific feature of back-converting data from the software's proprietary language to standard DICOM format. This allows the virtual data and subsequent work done in one software system to be transferred to another. This back-converting feature can also be used to import the virtual plan into navigation software where it can be used for real-time image guidance during surgery (i.e., guide the accurate placement of osteotomies, bone grafts, flaps or implant placement). The purpose of this

may be to use components of several software systems that are unique to each, or to display and teach via presentation in at other workstations loaded with the original software used to do a virtual procedure.

The craniomaxillofacial skeleton and donor sites can be virtually analyzed in the horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes. In the case of craniofacial and orthognathic surgery, clinical measurements can be obtained and the deformity can be analyzed three-dimensionally. In the case of tumor surgery, the tumor may be assessed and compared with clinical exam and 2D films. 3D measurements are obtained, and virtual osteotomies and tumor resection are made, segmented, and manipulated in the x, y, and z axes. Virtual surgery can be undertaken in minutes. Following the planned surgery, custom cutting/positioning guides and splints can be virtually planned for later manufacturing. This is what allows transport of the virtual surgical plan to the real-life surgical environment. Additionally, by using CT angiography imaging, in addition to hard tissue, the preoperative planning stage also offered excellent visualization of vascular structures such as perforator vessels in free flap harvest [10]. The sagittal sinus in cranial vault remodeling, and donor vessels in the neck. In addition, though nerves cannot be visualized on CT, there position can be estimated with accuracy by delineating their bony canals (i.e., inferior alveolar canal). These vascular structures and nerve cavities can be segmented and incorporated into cutting guides and SLMs.

# 50.1.3 Manufacturing

The preoperative and resultant virtual surgical outcome can then be transformed into a printed stereolithographic model (SLM) to be used in the surgical environment. Custom cutting and positioning guides can then be printed. Patient-specific implants can be printed or "stock" implants can be "pre-bent" prior to surgery based upon a "final" SLM model.

# Stereolithographic modeling

Developed and refined in the later part of the twentieth century [6, 11-13], stereolithographic models (SLMs) are plastic 3D representations of a virtual image (CT, laser scan, final planned reconstruction; Fig. 50.7). Using a variety of manufacturing techniques and materials they are a direct representation of a patient's computed tomography (CT) dataset. Early on, SLMs were milled from two-dimensional (2D) CT data. These models were useful as an adjunct in preoperative planning and helpful in getting a "general" view of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton, but by no means were taken for an exact

representation of the patient's hard tissues and were not accurate enough for precise procedures such as plate bending. However, with the advent and improvement of high-resolution CT and 3D printers (Fig. 50.8), the resultant accuracy of SLMs has increased immensely. Current manufacturing protocols fabricate models that are highly accurate (Fig. 50.9) and are fabricated with

a photocurable monomer hardened by lasers [14]. The advent of high-volume 3D printers (Fig. 50.10) has allowed the inexpensive, high-volume printing of splints (Fig. 50.11). SLMs may assist the surgeon in preoperative planning and intra-operative bony reconstruction [14-16]. These models offer an unprecedented level of accuracy and variations of these technique continue to be developed and used today [17].

The utility of SLMs is in the preoperative and intraoperative stages. There has been an abundance of studies demonstrating their efficacy in the preoperative stages of maxillomandibular reconstruction including anteroposterior jaw positioning, guiding plate adaptation, maxillomandibular contouring, and craniofacial and dental implant placement [18, 19]. SLMs are used many procedures including tumor resection and reconstruction, trauma surgery, craniofacial surgery, orthognathic surgery, and distraction osteogenesis. They give the surgeon a tactile and visual view of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton and donor sites allowing precise visualization of the pitch, row, and yaw of planned movements and vector plane [20]. Craniofacial surgery has reaped the benefits of SLMs using them in the preoperative planning of craniofacial reintouring and skeletal segment repositioning [21]. Likewise, preoperative planning

![](images/f97d4974b29a00cad9f84bf13a8d9846a45794d7707398cdf216520458340add.jpg)

using SLMs in head and neck tumor reconstruction has been implemented in the reconstruction of oncologic defects by aiding preoperative plate adaptation, planned tumor resection, and custom implant and osteocutaneous flap placement [22]. The reconstruction of complex orbital defects secondary to trauma or tumor ablation has significantly benefited from SLMs. SLMs allow the surgeon to visualize deep into the bony orbit and to adapt stock implants or construct custom plates to the intricate anatomy of the orbit. The utility of SLMs in traumatic orbital reconstruction was demonstrated on a cohort of patients with complex secondary traumatic defects and found SLMs to be extremely useful in reducing intraoperative plate adaptation and bone graft recontouring [23].

The drawbacks of SLMs lie in their poor representation of areas with thin bony walls such as the pediatric cranium in patients affected by craniosynostosis, the midface, and the orbital floor. These areas are especially misrepresented by lower resolution CT and may not be as accurately represented as other craniomaxillofacial structures. Therefore, it is pivotal that patients receive high-resolution CT when SLMs, and custom cutting and positioning guides and splints will be implemented.

Previously, the occlusal surfaces of the dentition were once thought not to be accurately represented on even high-quality CT. CT scanning the casts of teeth, or surface laser scanning the teeth themselves has avoided this roadblock. Accurate representation of the occlusal surfaces of teeth is especially important in surgical procedures where the final result is dependent on the bite, such as in orthognathic surgery or when occlusal based cutting guides are used for tumor surgery. However, recently, Xia and colleagues have circumvented this dilemma by digitally substituting laser scans of the teeth of plaster models for the low-resolution teeth of the CT, therefore allowing the surgeon to making accurate movements of the jaws and to digitally fabricate highly accurate intraoperative and final occlusal stents [24].

# 50.1.3.1 Patient-Specific Implants

The advent of SLM printing and being able to bend and shape a plate for a patient either in the preoperative or intraoperative setting was a significant step forward in which the accuracy and spend at which craniomaxillofacial surgery could be carried out. An identical paradigm shift and advancement in this technology was with the advent of patient specific implants. The reduction in cost yet ever-increasing accuracy of 3D printing has allowed for implants to be planned in the virtual environment and printed with speed and precision. High-volume industrial strength printers allow the quick and accurate fabrication of plastic cutting guides for craniomaxillofacial surgery (Fig. 50.12). Like the cutting and positioning guides that have been used for the past decade, the same CAD/CAM printing process can be used to make custom implants such as patient-specific implants and plates for craniofacial, orthognathic, traumatic, and oncologic and reconstructive surgery.

In particular advent of the 3D printing of metals such as titanium alloys has allowed for the fabrication of patient-specific plates based on the planned 3D movement in orthognathic and craniofacial surgery, and the planned resection and reconstruction in ablative and reconstructive surgery. Large-capacity 3D printers (Fig. 50.13) can turn out a high volume of patient-specific plates and guides. Metal plates and guides however carry disadvantage of usually taking more time to print when compared to plastic constructs (Fig. 50.14). Once printed in high volume, the patient-specific plates are then finished for irregularities and sent expeditiously to the surgeon for patient use (Fig. 50.15).

# 50.1.4 Surgery

Virtual surgical planning in and of itself is useful as an educational and teaching instrument by allowing three-dimensional analysis of the clinical problem and visual-

![](images/4a47950f080cd1eea5b3f60c6ee97f7695ce0d23d16e3b3274509aafaaa281e2.jpg)

ization of idealized digital manipulations. Without the ability to transfer the virtual plan into reality, however, it remains just an educational tool. The incorporation of CAD/CAM technology, into the head and neck work flow process at our institutions, as described in the previous section, has allowed us to replicate the virtual plan in the clinical realm.

The preoperative virtual plan is transferred to the surgical environment using SLMs, and cutting and positioning guides, stents, and splints. Furthermore, the virtual plan as well as STL files of implants can then my imported into intraoperative navigation software which can be used to confirm the virtual plan.

# 50.1.4.1 Intraoperative Navigation

Intraoperative navigation software programs import a DICOM CT dataset and allows the surgeon "real-time" confirmation of their position within the craniomaxillofacial skeleton. Intraoperative navigation is composed of three key components: (1) a localizer, which is the camera or device that tracks the movements of the (2) surgical probe, which is the actual position of the patient currently on the operating table, and (3) a CT scan dataset, which is projected and confirms the position of the

![](images/99c45f4bc719f1ba0007a41fc1fee677d1795094a9c264e5e504ca4e0d370a41.jpg)

probe within the patient to the preoperative 3D image. The patient's position in space is maintained by the tracking system via the placement of fiducial markers on stable and reliable anatomical points on the patient. The fiducial markers may be invasive and fixed, or noninvasive. In the invasive technique, the fiducial markers

![](images/beae42e3897b4008e3ad23889aaf4d072974e7edc3c38a5a59331135030a556c.jpg)

are secured into the patient's facial skeleton with screws via small incisions into the scalp or by the use of a custom splint that is adapted precisely to the patient face. When using these types of fiducial markers, the patients head must be immobilized by attaching it to a Mayfield headset. Noninvasive, surface fiducial markers are now commercially available in the form of individual adhesive markers, or LED mask. This technique is much quicker and far less invasive than the fixed techniques and offers more mobility of the patient during surgery. Disadvantages of the noninvasive technique include if the mask is in the operating zone such as when a coronal flap is utilized. In this instance, the fixed technique must be employed. A third, yet more time-consuming method is the "markerless" technique where a set of points on the patient's face are scanned and correlated with the CT dataset. The position of the surgical probe relative to the patient is determined by the computer using the "local rigid body" concept for which there must be at least 3 registration points (fiducial markers) [25]. A registration process is then undertaken in which the navigation software integrates the spatial information from the headset, surgical probe, and fiducial markers, and the end result is alignment of the Cartesian coordinates of the

actual patient in the x, y, and x planes onto the computer monitor in comparison to the preoperative CT dataset.

Tracking systems have changed dramatically in recent years. Older navigation systems utilize electromagnetic fields that are superimposed over the operative site "tracking" the surgical probe, which may be by itself, or attached to an instrument of the surgeon's choice. However, these systems carried the disadvantage interfering with the metallic surgical instruments used during an operation. More recent systems use an optical tracking system design, similar to the current motion activated gaming systems available today for the public. They rely on Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that are tracked by the optical systems. Optical tacking systems can be divided into two categories, active, and passive trackers. Active trackers are equipped with battery-powered LEDs attached to the surgical probe. These probes can be placed anywhere in the body with a high degree of accuracy. Passive optical tacking systems have reflectors on the surgical probe instead of LEDs, and carry the advantage of not needing electrical wires or batteries attached to the probe making for a lighter probe with more flexible maneuverability. However, the major disadvantage of passive optical tacking systems is that artificial light sources such as operating room lights may interfere with tracking.

Initially developed for neurosurgical [26-28] and endoscopic sinus surgical procedures [29], intraoperative navigation is utilized for a variety of facial surgery procedures including complex orbital repair [23], head and neck oncologic surgery [30], and craniofacial surgery [31]. Intraoperative navigation offers the advantage of virtual visualization of the patient's anatomy and access to areas of the facial skeleton that once required larger incisions and increased hard tissue exposure. There are several computer based surgical navigation systems available for use in facial surgery. Using frameless stereotaxy, which literally means "touching a point in space," these programs allow precise location of anatomical landmarks or implants to with a margin of error of  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  when compared to the projected CT in the operating room [32, 33]. There are several evidence-based indications for intraoperative navigation in the facial surgery patient, which will be elaborated in further detail in this chapter (Table 50.1).

# 50.1.5 Intra- and Postoperative Assessment

Technological advancements in intraoperative assessment include intraoperative CT and navigation (described above). Once the virtual plan has been transferred to the patient by performing osteotomies, or in setting grafts, flaps, or implants, the accuracy of the sur

gery is assessed (when appropriate) using a portable CT scanner. Available at many tertiary care facilities with an active neurosurgical presence, intraoperative CT assessment allows for any revision to occur prior to the patient leaving the operating room. This is particularly useful in orbital reconstruction, where the surgical access is limited and the relationship of the orbital implant relative to the orbital apex and critical medial and inferior "bulges" is unclear. The drawback with intraoperative CT is that the resolution is much less with a much thicker slice size. Given this large slice size, small details may be missed. Compounded with the face that monitors attached to intraoperative CTs are of lower resolution, small details in anatomic and implant placement may be unclear or missed. Additionally, accessing intraoperative CT is often difficult for the clinician as it requires a trained technician since these DICOM files are often not loaded onto the same Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) location as standard CTs.

# 50.2 Craniomaxillofacial Trauma and Reconstruction

Following the innovation of computer-aided surgery and navigation by the field of neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, perhaps because of their dental background, embraced new technologies. Perhaps since oral and maxillofacial surgeons often collaborate on managing the craniomaxillofacial trauma patient, it was the subdiscipline of trauma where computer-aided surgery was initially implemented.

# 50.2.1 Zygoma Reconstruction

As projection of the zygoma decreases, facial width increases. The zygoma, therefore, is key to restoring facial/orbital projection in severely displaced and comminuted fractures and should be returned to its natural "flat" contour [34]. The zygoma is a quadrangular structure composed of four articulations; the zygomaticomaxillary (ZM), frontozygomatic (FZ), zygomaticotemporal (ZT), and the sphenozygomatic (SZ) sutures. Since the SZ is within the orbit, and the ZM and FZ articulations represent vertical buttresses of the face, accurate restoration of zygomatic anatomy and reestablishment of facial projection, facial width, and orbital volume can be challenging [35]. Multiple approaches are required for repair when significant comminution of the anterior buttresses, zygomatic arch, and orbit is present, such as seen in high-energy injuries. Particular attention should be paid to restoring orbital volume and facial projection. Often surgical access can be minimized

with the use of computer-aided. As described below, any subtle increase or decrease in orbital volume may cause enophthalmos or exophthalmos, respectively [36]. Fractures of the orbital floor encompassing an area of greater than  $4.08\mathrm{cm}$ , or herniated tissue contents with a volume greater than  $1.89\mathrm{mL}$  are associated with enophthalmos of greater than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  [37]. Enophthalmos or exophthalmos of over  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  has been shown to be perceivable to the human eye [38]. Therefore, orbital volume and soft tissue content of the orbits are integrally related and must be addressed by the surgeon. Restoration of normal orbital volume and globe projection following traumatic injury or ablative tumor surgery is often difficult. Improper implant placement may often lead to inadequate restoration of orbital volume resulting in residual enophthalmos [39, 40]. Secondary repair of gross orbital deformities is difficult. Preoperative computer planning and intraoperative navigation has been shown to be a useful adjunct for secondary orbital reconstruction [41, 42].

# 50.2.2 Orbital Reconstruction

Despite the use of traditional reconstructive principles, lasting functional and esthetics complications such as enophthalmos, inaccurate globe projection, and vertical and horizontal dystopia may persist following orbital reconstruction of posttraumatic, and postablative defects [43]. This is especially true in traumatic injury leading to the "shattered orbit" or tumor resection with margins spanning multiple orbital walls. In these defects it is especially difficult to obtain previous orbital dimensions due to the lack of reliable bony landmarks to guide the placement of bony plates and implants. Specific areas of difficulty are re-establishing proper orbital contour, volume, and the ethmoidal and antral bulges of the medial and inferior floors respectively, as well as plate adaptation around the orbital apex. Three-dimensional imaging has not only assisted preoperative planning of orbital defects, but intraoperative navigation has allowed increased precision of traditional reconstructive techniques leading to a decrease in orbital volume and subsequent decrease in enophthalmos and more favorable position of the globe [44, 45].

A study by Ploder and colleagues attempted to assess the accuracy of the 3D CT and the software program, Analyze, in measuring the volume of fracture defect, and tissue herniation into the maxillary sinus of orbital floor fractures [46, 47]. Using human cadaver skulls, fractures defects were manually created with an osteotome, and herniation of the orbital contents was simulated with silicone impression material. Both fracture size and volume of silicone were assessed by direct mea

surement, 3D CT volumetric measurement, and measurement using Analyze software. Both 3D CT and analyze showed a significant linear correlation with direct measurements. A subsequent study by Ploder and colleagues found a direct correlation between both, the size of the fracture and degree of enophthalmos, and orbital volume and enophthalmos [37].

Gellrich and colleagues employed the use of 3D imaging in a study composed of subjects with increased enophthalmos and decreased globe projection secondary to posttraumatic orbital deformities [44]. In their landmark study, the investigators mirrored the unaffected orbit to the affected, traumatized orbit using 3D preoperative image software. Using this as their "goal" orbital dimensions, the subjects then underwent orbital reconstruction using intraoperative navigation. Navigation guidance was used to confirm plate placement of grafts at the "goal" dimensions set preoperatively. The investigators found a significant decrease in orbital volume and increase in globe projection in their study cohort. Markiewicz and colleagues performed a similar study, using the imaging software Analyze, to assess the change in orbital volume and globe projection in a cohort of subjects with not only defects secondary to trauma, but tumor ablation as well [23, 48]. Additionally, they employed the using a SLMs for preoperative graft contouring prior to surgery as well as confirming graft placement using intraoperative navigation. They found similar results to the study by Gellrich and colleagues with a significant decrease in orbital volume and increase in globe projection. In addition, they found a significant, linear correlation between goal and actual orbital volume and globe projection measurements following orbital reconstruction. The transantral endoscopic-assisted approach to the orbit provides direct access to the orbital floor. The first report of orbital floor repair via a Caldwell-Luc approach was by Walter in 1972 [49]. Though effective, this approach was abandoned for previously described transcutaneous and transconjunctival approaches for many years. However due to the discrete, but significant rate of complications associated with lower eyelid incision, there has recently been a resurgence of enthusiasm for the transantral approach to the orbital floor (Fig. 50.16) [50-58].

Building on the use of 3D intraoperative navigation, several protocols have been developed to build custom plate's specific to a patient's orbital defects [59-61]. Using an SLM derived from CT data, a plaster layer may be adapted to the orbital defect of the SLM and

contoured to the anatomy of the orbit [59]. Using conventional techniques for denture fabrication, the plaster is then immersed in stone, and burnt out leaving a template cast. Using traditional dental crown casting techniques, commercially annealed titanium is casted into the stone template making a custom titanium plate. Another protocol developed by Metzger and colleagues [61], removes the SLM stage of the previously described technique. In their unique protocol, a custom plate is made virtually to the contours of the patient's orbit and transported directly to a template machine for fabrication of a custom titanium mesh. For complex posttraumatic or postablative deformities, computer aided surgery can off a variety of reconstructive options including using preoperative planning, segmentation and mirroring of the un-affected side, and the fabrication of custom cutting and positioning guides to osteotomize and mobilize facial structures into an ideal position (Fig. 50.17). With the advent of patient-specific implants, using mirroring of the unaffected side to establish normal volumes, plastic and metal facial implants can be 3D printed to augment a posttraumatic deformity (Fig. 50.18).

# 50.2.3 Mandibular Reconstruction in the Setting of Trauma

While intraoperative navigation and intraoperative CT have been found to be invaluable in treating the midface and upper craniofacial skeleton, due to the mobility of the mandible, and relative easy visualization of fractures, except for in condylar and subcondylar fractures [62-64], their use is not as helpful. However, patient-specific plates, especially in the delayed or secondary reconstructive treatment setting, have been found to be a valuable adjunct for re-establishing maxillomandibular relationships.

level can provide tremendous advantages in both planning and clinical correction of dentofacial deformities [24, 67-71]. The multidimensional nature of the deformity can be readily appreciated, provides preoperative insight into the anatomic repositioning of teeth and skeleton and aids in improving the efficiency of the intraoperative experience that can aid in the delivery of a sound clinical outcome for patients.

Virtual planning has evolved with advances in radiology that allow accurate capture of anatomy of the head and neck. Three-dimensional imaging of bony anatomy and subsequent development of software that allows manipulation of the rendered anatomy has been successfully applied throughout the scope of oral and maxillofacial surgery including implant rehabilitation to total joint replacement as well as tumor ablation and

reconstruction via osteocutaneous flaps [72]. The application of computer simulated planning to orthognathic surgery has been a revolution similar to rigid internal fixation applied to stabilize bony osteotomies decades prior [73, 74]. The advances of each discipline have been merged to push the science of customized titanium fixation forward (Fig. 50.19).

Clinical records and plain films including panoramic radiographs and lateral cephalometric imaging were mainstays in the management of dentofacial deformities. The addition of PA cephs and submental vertex films were advantageous in asymmetrical cases to quantify deviation of the occlusal plane, chin, mandibular angles and pattern of ramus divergence. The pattern of ramus divergence aided in determining the best surgical technique for addressing mandibular ramus osteotomies, vertical ramus or sagittal split osteotomies respectively. Traditional model surgery conducted in a dental laboratory was often time consuming and tedious even with straightforward treatment plans. Inaccuracy at any point of data collection whether it be face bow record or transfer, centric relation record or mounting errors was

often unrecognized. The failure to appreciate an inaccuracy allowed the error to be carried unnoticed throughout the steps of the presurgical work up. An inaccurate centric relation record from displacement of the condyle can lead to a departure from the planned repositioning of the maxilla often appreciated as a skewed midline. The first indication of deviation from the intended plan unfortunately might be intraoperatively forcing a modified plan of "best judgment" to reorient the mobile segment. A more troubling outcome is the discovery of a planning error postoperatively that may require revision (Fig. 50.20).

Inherent human nature is also at play when managing the presurgical workup with traditional model surgery even when the casts have been mounted accurately. The occlusion represented with mounted stone models on an articulator lacks perspective and reference when on a lab bench. The absence of anatomic references with conventional model surgery may result in the required movements to establish multidimensional symmetry with to be over or under positioned, most frequently the latter. The lack of reference that stems from measure

ment of cusp tips to fixed points on an articulator is the root of surgeons second guessing their proposed movements that can lead to under treating the correction of asymmetric dentofacial deformities. The under treatment of asymmetry might commonly be perceived as a persistent midline disparity, residual chin deviation, failure to fully address yaw deformity as well as management of occlusal cant (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 50.21).

Planning surgical correction through a digital medium has continued to evolve from its initial origin. Bite jigs for centric relation record, fiducials to aid in merging data as well as a gyroscope for natural head position have been replaced with clinical photos, local scanning of models with CBCT and optical scanning of the occlusion.

Digital planning illustrates advancement between the proximal and distal segment that does not sync with that appreciated on postoperative radiograph after mandibular advancement. The anticipated occlusal correction was achieved with sound seating of the condyle intraoperatively, but the discrepancy can be traced to an inaccurate-centric relation record during data collection. The negligible movement illustrated with virtual planning a contrasted to the larger osteotomy gap on the postoperative panorex b

tion most commonly through cone beam CT scans housed within the surgery clinic. The accuracy at the occlusal level, however, is not captured via the scans of the maxillomandibular skeleton requiring the addition of dental anatomy. Stone models mailed to a service provider and subsequently laser scanned offsite or scanned locally via the office CBCT and transferred digitally allow for the occlusal topography to be merged with the skeletal data. A complete digital workflow exits from the use of an optical scanner to record the occlusal topography via an STL file that possesses superior accuracy to stone models aids in the establishment of postsurgical occlusion as well as form accurate fitting splints (Fig. 50.22).

Setting of the occlusion is accomplished through conventional haptic efforts with the surgeon articulating stone models or digital through manipulation of the occlusion within software programs. A digital work flow is greatly enhanced through engineer experience and repetition with a surgeon to establish the desired occlusion based on the existing deformity (Fig. 50.23).

The planning session conducted by an experienced engineer allows visualization of the occlusal and skeletal discrepancies through review of linear measurements to quantify midline deviation, skeletal asymmetry, cant referenced to the orbital rims, and calculation of yaw based on variation from the midsagittal plane. Treatment planning for the correction of dentofacial deformities is focused on establishing a functional occlusion while maximizing smile and facial esthetics.

The skeletal correction through digital planning is initiated as the established occlusion is manipulated from the existing incisor position referenced to natural head position. Accurate clinical records are needed to ensure natural head position is verified prior to the initiation of treatment planning. Many surgeons have moved to orienting head position via clinical photos from past iterations of face bows, laser levels, fiducials, and gyroscopes. An error in orienting natural head posi

tion can result in an inaccurate perception of the anatomic layout including midline displacement or canting that will subsequently lead to an inappropriate surgical plan. Multidimensional reorientation of maxillary central incisor position influences the necessary skeletal correction of the bony foundation as virtual osteotomies of the maxilla and mandible are manipulated. The correction of the malocclusion through digital manipulation of osteotomies allows tremendous preoperative insight into steps that will be encountered during the

surgical intervention. The movement of the occlusion and adjoining bone illustrates interferences or osteotomy gaps at the skeletal level providing insight into mitering or grafting requirements, respectively and can aid in providing a smoother intraoperative experience (Fig. 50.24) [75].

The gross perspective of the facial skeleton through digital planning allows the opportunity to visualize skeletal asymmetry that persists despite the correction of the malocclusion. The presurgical insight provides the

opportunity to discuss adjunctive measures preoperatively with a visual reference to aid in informed consent. A common example is asymmetry of the mandible and chin that is greater than the midline deviation at the dentition whereas correction of mandibular asymmetry through ramus procedures only, and the tunderlying asymmetry in the chin persists. An anterior segmental osteotomy allows the opportunity to reorient the chin into a symmetrical position in all three dimensions (Fig. 50.25).

Design of a patient-specific implant for orthognathic surgery is performed after occlusal and skeletal repositionings have been accomplished [72, 76-78]. The anticipated maxillary and/or mandibular anatomy is reconstructed which allows the design and contour of titanium fixation spanning the osteotomy gap. The titanium plate design can be guided by the bony osteotomy and an appreciation of the anatomic structures in the vicinity.

The continued evolution of software and corresponding advances in printing titanium has allowed the hardware to expand from that of a classic linear stock plate to encompass a wide range of geometric configuration. The size and thickness of the plate and subsequent screws can be specified and modified to provide additional reinforcement as it extends across the osteotomy (Fig. 50.26).

An occlusal guide that conforms to the indices of the dentition can be used as a reference for the subsequent

modifications at the skeletal level. Classic occlusal splints used to reorient the maxilla or mandible during orthognathic surgery can be modified through the addition of an attachment or arm that extends to the anatomic site of need such as the maxilla, chin, or ramus. The engineered arm or extension requires cognition of the adjacent structures including orthodontic appliances to ensure the avoidance of interference and an appreciation of soft tissue contours and anticipated dissection (Fig. 50.27).

Occlusal borne guides can allow reorientation of the repositioned bony segment or placement of patient-specific fixation through initial placement of predictive holes in the intact bone. The latter involves the application of patient-specific custom fixation plate across the osteotomy to stabilize the maxilla or mandible in the desired position using the predrilled predictive holes.

The accurate record of skeletal anatomy has allowed the generation of bone borne marking guides. Guides applied to the maxilla, ramus, and anterior mandible require an accurate fit to the bony contours and landmarks to ensure accuracy of both guide placement and ultimate surgical outcome. Guides in the maxilla index the piriform rim and the buttress laterally while those fabricated to guide osteotomies in the ramus engage regional anatomy: antagonial notch, sigmoid notch, posterior or inferior border, and ascending ramus.

The digital workflow and planning of occlusal and skeletal correction will continue to be refined and patient-specific customized plates within the maxilla and mandible that aid in transferring the surgical outcome implemented (Fig. 50.30).

# 50.3.2 Craniofacial Surgery

Craniosynostosis, or premature fusion of one or more of the 6 primary cranial sutures, is a condition that affects 3.1-6 per 10,000 live births [79-82]. The most common method of craniosynostosis repair relies on the artistic judgment of the surgeon and is prone to error depending on the experience of the surgeon. Lannelongue [83] and Lane [84] were the first to describe surgical correction of craniosynostosis performing strip craniectomies of the involved sutures. Tessier described a intracranial approach to the orbits and upper face that began the era of craniofacial reconstruction [85, 86]. Following Tessier's description, there was an explosion in the reported advancements and outcomes of cranial vault reconstruction [87-93]. However, until very recent years, there was a paucity in the progression of the technical aspects of craniosynostosis reconstruction. The benefits of virtual surgical planning for nonsyndromic and syndromic craniosynostosis repair have been documented [94-98]. The use of VSP and 3D printing has been found to lead more accurate reconstructions, while reducing operating time [94-96]. Computer aided sur

gery can used to assist with in both fronto-orbital advancement (Fig. 50.34) and posterior cranial vault remodeling (Fig. 50.35).

# 50.3.3 Custom Cranial Implants

Traditionally, reconstruction of cranial defects has been performed by the use of autogenous bone or alloplastic materials such as titanium mesh, acrylics such as polymethylmethacrylate [99], ceramics such as hydroxyapatite [100], or high performance thermoplastics such as porous high-density polyethylene or polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [101]. Traditionally, success rates have varied and are inversely correlated with the size of the size of the defect [102]. The choice of material depends upon the size and location of the defect, the quality and quantity of soft tissue coverage, the proximity to the paranasal sinuses, the presence or absence of infection, and the experience of the surgeon with a particular material.

Preoperative 3D CT imaging can be a valuable adjunct to assess the size and shape of the cranial defect. Using CAD/CAM software technology, custom titanium implants can virtually constructed and milled from preoperative CT data. This offers the ability to have a well-adapted implant before entering the operating room which reduces operating time and morbidity [103, 104]. Alternatively, stock plates

and implants can be adapted in the preoperative period to SLMs created from 3D CT datasets. In this instance, the SLM not only allows the surgeon to visualize the full extent of the defect, but also to reduce operating time by adapting the plate in the preoperative period [104]. Custom patient-specific cranial implants are an alternative to trans-cranial surgery in the adolescent of adult patient with a history of craniosynostosis and reconstruction as an infant (Fig. 50.36) [105].

tumors offered advantages such as evaluating the extent of tumor resection and margin confirmation and subsequent additional tumor resection, dissection of the ethmoid partitions, frontal stent placement, and frontal bone drilling. Preoperative 3D CT imaging and intraoperative navigation has been shown to be an effective way to outline the margins of tumor resection in other areas of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton [25, 27, 107-109]. Intraoperative navigation allows full visualization of the tumor using minimal exposure and morbidity to uninvolved tissues. Surgical resection of tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa, skull base, infratemporal fossa, paranasal sinuses, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ)

complex [30, 110, 111] may be performed with increased maneuverability (Fig. 50.37), yet with the ability to virtually visualize and defer from involvement of adjacent vital structures without necessarily exposing the overlying tissues. Preoperative 3D planning also affords the surgeon the ability to perform osteotomies, either digitally, or on SLMs manufactured from the CT data.

Tumor resection and severe trauma often renders loss of continuity of the maxillomandibular complex causing significant functional and esthetic defect. Perhaps the most significant advancement in reconstruction of the midface and mandible during the last 30 years has been the development of microvascular osteocuta

neous flaps, specifically, the free fibular osteocutaneous free flap (FFOF) [112, 113]. Considered by many centers the gold standard for the reconstruction of large hard tissue defects of the head and neck region, the FFOF offers the surgeon the ability to not only restore defects to original levels of preablative and pretraumatic skeletal dimensions, but also serves as a foundation to restore the dentition via the use of the endosseous dental implants [114, 115-118].

Rigid fixation and reconstruction plates offer the advantage of recreation of the shape of the native mandible by bending the plate to the contour of the mandible before tumor resection. However, this process is time consuming and unless multiple osteotomies are performed, clinical outcomes may not portray the preoperative mandibular shape of the patient. The increasing numbers of un-needed osteotomies of the FFOF adds to the complexity to the procedure and in the risk of adjacent soft tissue and vascular damage. In addition, in situ plate bending may not be applicable for tumors that invade neighboring soft tissues. SLMs developed from 3D preoperative imaging allow the surgeon to assess the contour the maxillomandibular complex by removal the external deformation left by the tumor creating "ideal" anatomical surfaces. In addition to transverse assessment of the jaws, sagittal relationships of the jaws may be assessed for proper anteroposterior positioning. Traditional FFOF reconstruction is often inadequate in the sagittal plan for appropriate maxillomandibular

relationships making dental implant reconstruction difficult due to over- or under-projection of the reconstructed mandible. SLMs developed from 3D imaging allow for precise plate bending, and maxillomandibular relationships allowing for ideal immediate dental implant placement at the time of FFOF inset in the maxilla and mandible [114, 119].

Using data from preoperative CT datasets, CAD/ CAM software offers the surgeon to virtually perform tumor resection, make custom implants, and to perform osteotomies on the 3D FFOF, inset the FFOF, and generate custom guide stents to reproduce osteotomies in the operating room (Fig. 50.38) [74, 120]. In the preoperative period, a CT of the fibula is obtained. This can be segmented to produce the bony part of the FFOF and imported into the virtual environment. Using preoperative planning software, ideal position and angle of osteotomy cuts are made by the surgeon, and final inset of the fibula is made to fit the precise dimensions of the virtual tumor resection defect. Using CAD/CAM technology, the data is exported and custom guide stents can be fabricated so virtual cuts can be precisely reproduced during the actual surgery. Final position of the FFOF in relation to the native maxilla or mandible may then confirmed using intraoperative navigation by comparing actual movements to the preoperative CT data present on the monitor in the operating room (Fig. 50.39). Additionally, dental implants may be placed into the

# 50.5 Robotic Surgery

As previously discussed, the twentieth century was an era marked by tremendous advancements in the scope of practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery with the twenty-first century representing an era marked by remarkable technological innovations. One such area of tremendous innovation has been the advent of robotic surgery. Over the past several decades we oral and maxillofacial surgeons have evolved to routinely utilize well-concealed incisions in the performance of facial osteotomies, open reduction and internal fixation of

fractures, placement of facial implants and in select cases incorporating endoscopic instrumentation to minimize the caliber of incisions with the goal of executing a successful operation while at the same time minimizing our surgical foot print. However, one area where such approaches were limited was the management of tumors of the oropharynx. Minimally invasive surgery in this setting posed significant challenges including illumination of the surgical field, protection of surrounding structures, avoidance of neurovascular structures, and the ability to manage surgical site bleeding and/or hemorrhage [121]. The seminal work of Wolfgang Steiner published in 1993, highlighting the potential of endoscopic laser resection of early-stage (Tis, T1, T2) glottic cancers, the most common type of laryngeal cancer, popularizing the technique of transoral laser microsur

gery [121-123]. This technique which involved the piecemeal removal of malignant tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract using a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser offered head and neck surgeons the ability to provide a sound alternative to radiation therapy, which at that time was the primary treatment modality for early-stage laryngeal and pharyngeal malignancies. This paradigm shift in the management of malignant neoplasms of the upper aerodigestive tract allowed surgeons to access tumor that were traditionally inaccessible via direct transoral route, and de-escalation of intensity of oncologic treatments (i.e., avoidance of lip-splitting mandibulotomy, reducing the need for radiation therapy). Furthermore, this paradigm shift in head and neck oncologic mucosal surgery would serve as the basis for what would become transoral robotic surgery (TORS).

Robotic surgery of the head and neck was initially described in 2003 by Haus and colleagues utilizing the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the performance of 4 different types of surgical operations of the neck (submandibular gland resection, selective neck dissection, partial parotidectomy, and thymectomy) utilizing an animal model, Yorkshire pigs [4]. Subsequently, the pioneering work of Weinstein and O'Malley from the University of Pennsylvania established the feasibility and safety of TORS in the extirpation of benign and malignant

tumors of the oropharynx (base of tongue, soft palate, palatine tonsils, and posterior pharyngeal wall) leading to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving robotic systems for TORS in 2009 [124-128].

Today, robotic surgery has made its way into many applications within oral and maxillofacial surgery/head and neck surgery including the following: robot-assisted radical tonsillectomy, robot-assisted surgery for base of tongue neoplasms, robot-assisted removal of salivary gland pathology (i.e., benign neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, salivary stones), and robot-assisted removal of benign or malignant parapharyngeal space tumors [1]. Furthermore, TORS has been utilized in reconstructive surgery in the inset of soft tissue flaps in difficult to reach areas, as well as, with recent reports of its application in cleft lip and palate surgery, placement of dental endosseous implants, and obstructive sleep apnea surgery (i.e., reduction of base of tongue tissue, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) [121, 129-131]. With increasing indications and the creative utilization of robotic surgery in the practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery/head and neck surgery, the majority of indications today for the utilization of TORS are in the management of malignant neoplasms of the oropharynx. Over the past 2 decades human papilloma virus associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV[+]OPSCC) has been on a significant rise

globally specifically in Western countries (i.e., the United States, Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands), especially in men less than 60 years of age [132, 133]. In this patients with  $\mathrm{HPV}[+]$  OPSCC TORS has been shown through several studies to have benefit patients in avoidance of radiation therapy or reducing radiation therapy treatment fields (i.e., pharyngeal-sparing radiation) [134] Furthermore, in the management of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma TORS has been shown to maintain a higher quality of life in patients in comparison to radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in reducing the requirement of a tracheotomy and/or gastrostomy tube [135]. In summary, technology will continue to advance the practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery in a myriad of ways and robotic surgery represents another tool in the surgical armamentarium that will continue to evolve in its indications and sophistication.

# Conclusion

Like the rest of dentistry and medicine, technology, when used prudently, can add the accuracy and speed in which oral and maxillofacial surgeons care for patients. Furthermore, with the use of technology, and building on traditional and sound surgical techniques, technology can provide care not previously possible. The use of technology should never be used as a substitute for thoughtful surgical planning and execution, and care should be individualized to the patient.
