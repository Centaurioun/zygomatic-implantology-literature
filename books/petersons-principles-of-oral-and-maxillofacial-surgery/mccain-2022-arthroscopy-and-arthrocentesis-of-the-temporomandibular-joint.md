# Learning Aim

To provide a detailed understanding of noninvasive treatment options for temporomandibular joint problems.  
To highlight the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of arthroscopy and arthrocentesis of TMJ.  
To encourage oral and maxillofacial surgeons to consider minimal invasive approaches to the TMJ prior to open surgical techniques.

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) reports that approximately 35 million Americans have some problem with their temporomandibular joint and most of those who seek treatment, fortunately, can be managed conservatively, but about  $10\% -20\%$  of them who seek treatment cannot be managed conservatively and will require a more invasive procedure. However, with the advent of TMJ arthroscopy, we can perform a minimally invasive procedure after we have determined that the conservative medical management approach has not been successful.

The management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders from a surgeon's perspective has improved significantly since the advent of arthroscopy. Arthroscopic observations have provided an in vivo examination of the joint. Disc position and quality, texture of articular cartilage, and vascularity and redundancy of synovium can be observed clearly and precisely. Prior to arthroscopy, joint pathology and surgical correction efforts were targeted toward disc displacement, condyle dislocation, and osteoarthrosis with osteophyte formation.

Currently, the emphasis has shifted to the surgical management of the chemistry of joint space inflammation. This refocus of priorities has been successful in reducing joint pain and increasing joint mobility. Structural joint reconstruction is completed secondarily following reduction of pain, when indicated. This chapter offers an arthroscopic cascade in the overall management of the orthopedic patient with TMJ.

Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that has a high expectation for patient improvement and extremely high expectation of providing the patient with the correct diagnosis so that if they have to go forward with any further treatment, the diagnosis is clearly established.

# 53.1 History

The first temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy was performed by Masatoshi Ohnishi in 1974. Murakami and coworkers, Holmund, McCain, Sanders, Koslin, Moses, and others soon followed. This history has been

well documented in the literature. Interestingly, arthrocentesis evolved from, rather than preceded, arthroscopy. Lack of proper equipment, poor insurance reimbursement, and good results despite poor arthroscopic technique led surgeons to explore joint lavage and manipulation in lieu of actual more invasive arthroscopic surgery, and positive results have been reported by Nitzan and others.

Currently, there are two tiers of arthroscopic surgeons: those who are capable of single-puncture basic procedures and those who are capable of multiple punctures and triangulation with the capability of advanced arthroscopic surgical procedures. Those who perform single-puncture arthroscopy can perform diagnostic and basic interventions. Reconstructive procedures on refractory cases are then managed with open arthrotomy techniques. Advanced arthroscopic procedures may be done with multiple-puncture techniques, in lieu of open surgery, by surgeons whose expertise is at a higher level. There still remains the need for open arthroplasty procedures because even advanced arthroscopy has its limitations.

# 53.2 Goals

As with other surgeries that have converted over the past decade from open to closed, less invasive techniques, the subspecialty of TMJ arthroscopy, has become popular once again. The goals include the ability to establish an accurate diagnosis, restore function, reduce pain, and diminish joint noise with a minimally invasive, safe, effective, and repeatable procedure with acceptable long-term outcomes. In addition, a reduction in the catabolic environment by the preliminary procedures places the joint in an anabolic state. If a reconstructive procedure such as discopexy does need to be performed after arthroscopy, it is done in a joint space that can better accept the surgical insult with a minimal amount of bleeding or scar formation, thereby yielding a more favorable outcome.

The ability to refine and improve upon current successful open arthroscopic procedures continues to motivate the advanced TMJ arthroscopist.

Goals for Arthroscopy

To return the joint to its prior condition.  
- Affect the chemistry of the joint by converting it from a catabolic state to an anabolic state.  
- Reduce joint stenosis and increase joint space.  
- Smooth joint surfaces, reverting them back to their normal appearances.  
Apply regenerative products into the joint.  
Reconstructive procedures such as disc repositioning and joint debridement.

# 53.3 Indications

Arthroscopy of the TMJ enables the surgeon to clearly visualize the joint space, methodically inspect the internal structures, and assess for current pathology. In addition, arthroscopic viewing confirms correct placement of the arthroscope and the irrigation outflow port, which will enable high-turbulent effective lavage of the joint.

The indications for arthroscopic intervention include patients who have pain and jaw dysfunction not responsive to nonsurgical dental or medical management. The general indications are shown in  $\triangleright$  Box 53.1. The most common presenting clinical signs and symptoms include limited mouth opening (Fig. 53.1), painful joint noises, and mandibular dislocation. Other candidates for at least a diagnostic arthroscopy procedure include patients who have persistent preauricular pain and the diagnosis of intra-articular TMJ pathology cannot be ruled out by clinical or imaging examination.

The clinician should formulate a preoperative differential diagnosis. The accepted terminology for articular

# Box 53.1 General Indications for Arthroscopy

1. Articular disorders (Wilkes classification)  
2. Mandibular dislocation  
3. Arthralgia  
4. Preauricular atypical facial pain

disorders includes the Wilkes classification system (▶ Box 53.2). This classification is based upon maximum interincisal opening (MIO), joint noise, and radiographic findings.

# Box 53.2 Wilkes Classification

I. Clicking without pain  
II. Clicking with pain  
III. Locking closed without bone changes  
IV. Locking with bone changes  
V. Crepitation

# 53.4 Contraindications

The contraindications to arthroscopy and arthrocentesis include bony ankylosis, advanced fibrous ankylosis, ankylosing osteoarthritis, and overlying skin infection.

Bony ankylosis typically requires autogenous or alloplastic joint replacement. Advanced fibrous ankylosis and ankylosing osteoarthritis will only temporarily respond to advanced arthroscopic techniques. These cases respond to open joint debridements, interpositional grafting, or joint replacement. Puncturing through an area of infected skin increases the potential complication of a septic joint postoperatively.

# 53.5 Advantages

The advantages of minimally invasive endoscopic interventions in the TMJ area are the following:

1. No significant skin incision or facial scar.  
2. Reduced incidence of cranial nerve VII injury.  
3. Diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.  
4. Procedure can be as short as 15 minutes and can be office based in certain situations using light sedation.  
5. Recovery is quick.

6. No damage occurs when going into the joint with an arthroscope as compared to an open jaw surgery.  
7. Procedure is less expensive than a joint arthroplasty replacement.

The disadvantages of minimally invasive procedures are:

1. Steep learning curve  
2. Cost of equipment

# 53.6 Patient Evaluation

The evaluation of the patient with TMJ can be an arduous task for the clinician. One needs to have a system to access the nature of the problem and its severity. The surgeon must evaluate the need for surgery. A problem-oriented history and physical examination must be completed. This skill must be developed at the risk of burnout and disinterest driving the provider away from participating in the care of these patients. Unfortunately, the characteristic traits of the temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patient, although not misinterpreted, have led to a certain "labeling" of those patients suffering from these disorders or diseases. Notwithstanding the nonmalignious nature of these prejudices, they will significantly diminish the clinician's capability to appropriately diagnose these conditions. Patients with TMJ come from all walks of life; males and females; young and old; married, widowed, and divorced; those with children; and those without. Many have the myofascial pain primarily or secondarily to a joint problem, and the astute clinician must be able to discern the clinical differences in order to most appropriately plan for treatment.

# 53.6.1 McCain TMJ Assessment Standardized Forms

An analogue-driven TMJ practice is recommended. The first document filled out by the patient, after proper introductions and instructions, is the pain and functional analogue (  $\bullet$  Fig. 53.2). This form is completed at the beginning of each visit to monitor progress.

# 53.6.2 Anamnesis

# 53.6.2.1 Chief Complaint

This extremely important step of patient assessment is probably the most easily dismissed area of anamnesis. Over the years, numerous options/windows have been added to a standardized TMJ assessment form, and the list remains fluid, because TMD symptomatology may present with a novel array of complaints that have not

yet prompted in-depth exploration by the clinician. As surgeons, our focus of interest is directed more at the orthopedic complaints because they are more likely to require an intervention. However, the patient may report only one, or a variety of, symptoms. "I can't open my jaw," "My joint clicks and hurts," "I have ear pain," and "I have headaches." Whether the otalgia is TMJ referred pain or not is an extremely important step in diagnosis. There are a significant number of patients with tinnitus or other acoustic complaints referred by ear-nose-throat/otorhinolaryngology (ENT/ORL) colleagues to rule out TMD. Some patients can accurately describe the joint noise that has prompted them to seek care (e.g., clicking, popping, grinding, grating). Whereas most patients will describe some form of masticatory dysfunction, some patients will be specific in their description of progressive restriction of mouth opening, transient jaw locking, and so forth, or they will need only a few targeted questions from the examiner in order to help them to delineate their condition.

# 53.6.2.2 Parafunction and Associated Causes

The clinician is often tempted to overemphasize parafunctional habits when examining the patient. Masticatory musculature spasm ("jaw stiffness"), matinal or vesperal, is a common complaint. However, unless the patient admits to vigil bruxing or clenching or the habit is witnessed, parafunction should not be attributed to etiopathogenicity in the particular TMJ condition. Mental or physical stress should definitely be taken into consideration. The surgeon must remain aware of the symbiotic interrelation between parafunction, stress, and the development of TMD.

# 53.6.3 Analog Scales

The visual analog scale (VAS) provides a real sense of the acuteness and urgency of the patient's perception of the problem. Remember that arthrocentesis and arthroscopy are elective procedures, so every patient must have insight into her or his condition and be motivated enough to improve her or his present status. The condition should be severe enough for the surgeon to believe it can be ameliorated or suppressed with surgical intervention. Preventive goals are secondary motivators.

# 53.6.4 History

A pertinent documentation of events should take place in accordance with patient's narrative description of the disease progression. The association between traumatic events and various TMJ conditions cannot be over

# TO OUR TMJ PATIENTS:

Please take a minute to answer these questions. We ask all of our patients these questions every time they come in. However, in some cases, we feel the answers may not be honest because one of the doctors may be present when you answer. We want a sincere, honest opinion from you because it helps you and those TMJ patients who we will treat in the future, as well as our colleagues who seek to help their patients with arthroscopy.

emphasized. Whether direct (when the mandible has been involved primarily) or indirect (e.g., after a dental appointment, extractions, endodontic treatment, oral surgical procedures, endotracheal intubation maneuvers), the patient may not correlate the events with this specific condition. The clinician should not indiscriminately dismiss minor indirect trauma as a factor in triggering TMD. An interesting fact is that the patient may omit reporting even direct trauma events to the jaw if they occurred in the distant past. The surgeon's keen sense of observation should allow documentation of even small facial cicatricial marks, especially in the inconspicuous submentosubmandibular area from prior chin trauma. When a history of motor vehicle accident (MVA) has been established, additional information may be gained from the details of the event (e.g., restrained vs. unrestrained, driver vs. passenger, deployment of airbag). The majority of patients will be able to provide pertinent descriptions of the specific TMJ-related problems, including jaw clicks or pops, crepitus, locking (open or closed), and dislocation as well as the circumstances of each occurrence, frequency, remission/

relapse sequence, aggravating and alleviating factors, pain radiation, and so forth.

# 53.6.5 Diet

The consistency of the patient's diet is an important indicator of the level of TMJ dysfunction and the necessity to consider surgical management. The surgeon must correlate this information with the analogue scales.

# 53.6.6 Treatment

All prior attempts to treat the TMJ condition both medically and surgically should be recorded. A previous ENT/ORL or neurologic evaluation will, in most instances, provide the surgeon the results of acoustic-vestibular or neuropathic pain workups, helping the specialist to "zero-in" on the TMJ workup of the condition. It is important to know whether the entire spectrum of conservative treatment has been exhausted. The surgeon

must ascertain whether the noninvasive therapy (e.g., Boering modifications, orthotics, over-the-counter [OTC]/prescription medications) or surgical treatment has been appropriate and evaluate the outcomes of these treatments and, additionally, the compliance of the patient with these previous regimens.

# 53.7 Physical Examination

# 53.7.1 Mouth Opening and Range of Motion

The physical examination should be problem focused and brief, but pertinent. Ask the patient to open the mouth and observe the velocity of opening and measure the MIO. A rapid opening to  $40\mathrm{mm}$  is not a very exciting finding for the surgeon in order to motivate a patient toward the operating table, unless you are assessing an undiagnosed facial pain syndrome. A patient who opens to  $30\mathrm{mm}$  then catches and clicks to gain further opening certainly should get the attention of the surgeon. Regardless of their subtlety, lateral deviations should be measured and noted in the record. Complete documentation of range of motion (ROM) in lateral excursive movements and during jaw protrusion follows next. The lack of translation of the condyle may imply a nonreducing disc. Condyle subluxation or dislocation may be palpated in the preauricular region or within the external auditory canal.

# 53.7.2 Joint Noise

A correlation must be made next between the ROM and associated joint noise/noises. Joint sounds may be audible and/or palpable. Reciprocal clicking may reflect a recapturing of the disc. Opening clicks may suggest a fixated, or stuck, disc or subluxating condyle. A grating sound is the result of the condyle pressing against a fragmented edge of disc. The edge of disc can also be compressed against the fossa and/or eminence. Crepitation may not be accompanied by pain, and loss of function is only a clinical sign and requires periodic follow-up, not necessarily invasive surgery.

# 53.7.3 Pain Assessment of the Joint and Adjacent Musculature

For the purposes of access and feasibility, only the lateral and posterior poles of the condyle are palpated. Pain at the lateral pole may indicate synovitis, osteoarthritis, joint effusion, or disc dislocation. The latter is best elucidated by palpating superiorly on the neck of

the condyle, posterior and slightly inferior to the prominent lateral pole itself. This particular area of the posterolateral pole of the condyle is the site of the attachment of the disc to the lateral capsule and condylar neck. Both acutely and chronically inflamed disc dislocations may provoke a pain response upon palpation. Intrameatal pain suggests a posterior capsule retrodiscal inflammatory process. Both lateral capsular and endaural joint tenderness to palpation are common findings in TMD. The closed-lock patients will invariably demonstrate a "soft tissue crepitance" in at least a portion of their range of normal mouth motion. This bruit is caused by the bilaminar retrodiscal tissues rolled between the condyle and the eminence. Reciprocal, mediolateral, and late opening clicks, although less frequent, may still be encountered. The muscular examination is limited to the superior portion of the anterior margin of masseter muscle and the insertion of the temporalis tendon on the coronoid process. These particular elevator muscles of the mandible provide the most precise information regarding myofascial pain dysfunction (MPD) syndrome and are most likely to be involved with that process. All clinical findings should be recorded on the checklist form (  $\square$  Fig. 53.3).

# 53.7.4 Joint Locking or Dislocation

# 53.7.4.1 Mahan's Sign

The most important pathognomonic sign is the "Mahan sign," named after Parker Mahan who described this sign in 1990 (Fig. 53.4). The working condyle is loaded by biting on blades with the contralateral canines. If positive with elicitation of pain, there is generally an orthopedic problem in the joint. The sign is usually positive in patients with Wilkes II, III, and IV. Some patients with Wilkes II will not be positive and that affects the choice of intervention. Patients with noninflamed (negative Mahan's sign) Wilkes II may be managed better with discopexy, and patients with Mahan-positive Wilkes II are managed with nonsurgical interventions before discopexy.

The reason that patients with Wilkes V will not have a positive Mahan sign is because the condyle will traverse the perforation and not compress the retrodiscal tissues. Patients with Wilkes V, however, will have the second important pathognomonic sign, crepitation.

skeletal classification. Also, the Ellis occlusal class, dental interferences during function, and evidence of occlusal wear should be noted.

# 53.7.6 Panoramic Radiograph

The Panorex is then evaluated with a focus on the condyles and joint spaces. Maintenance of the oval morphology is considered normal. Flattening of the head, loss of cortical detail, osteosclerosis, osteophyte formation, narrowing of the joint space, and subcortical cysts are important bone changes to factor into the Wilkes classification.

# 53.7.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging

On occasion, the patient may present with a copy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results, as a part of a pertinent referral from another clinician. Whereas the surgeon should become familiar with the radiology interpretation of the study, the arthroscopist should "reread" the MRI and interpret it according to his or her clinical and surgical experience. In the most stable relationship, the rather thick posterior band of the disc occupies the greatest concavity of the glenoid fossae (Fig. 53.5). Henceforth, a closed-mouth MRI view showing the posterior band in the 10:30 to 11:00 position should be read as abnormal. Preoperative changes on the MRI mandate close consideration of surgical detail and postoperative physical therapy. As long as the disc itself is salvageable, disc form should not preclude disc suturing and/or stabilization. The openmouth MRI view (Fig. 53.6) will give the practitioner the most accurate perspective of the disc position with function (i.e., recapture of the disc in the case of disc displacement), especially in cases that correlate with

![](images/3446b8a3f90f6a1b07a59747f042dd16901fb312ed52dd924840e761ef052097.jpg)

reciprocal or double clicking on physical examination. Although T1-weighted open- and closed-mouth MRI views are paramount for confirming the clinical diagnosis, the T2-weighted images more accurately reflect an associated inflammatory component of the joint disease, such as the presence of joint effusion (Fig. 53.7). This completes the patient assessment.

# 53.7.8 Etiology

The etiologic factors are organized into five categories/ classes.

I. Parafunction (direct microtrauma, associated MPD). The effects of psychological stress may cause the masticatory system to spasm, thus compressing and disrupting normal joint articulation. Bruxism and clenching inflict repetitive and abnormal overloading

![](images/273222983a746e8ce7ace0dc1e67f60b524b652025ad499cdc203a5ae68eac8f.jpg)

Fig.53.7 T2 weighted MRI - joint effusions

of the joint and muscular system, causing spasm and muscle pain to develop with intermittent clicking.

II. Dentofacial deformities and nalocclusions (direct microtrauma). Articular dysfunction occurs from disharmonious motion between the maxillary and the mandibular arches. The most common patient in this category is the one with vertical maxillary excess (VME) in combination with mandible retrognathia/ hypoplasia. A majority of internal derangements may be caused by various components of mandibular retrusion. A class I occlusion in some patients may, however, exhibit vertical maxillary deficiency (VMD), causing early loss of posterior dentition with subsequent posterior or vertical collapse and bite closure. In this case, the dysfunction is the result of the col

lapse of the vertical dimension, with a direct microtrauma effect on the joint over an extended time.

III. Direct macrotrauma. Direct trauma involves an acute direct trauma to the mandible with or without fracture. Most of the time, patients can specifically recall the event because their TMJ problems developed immediately after the event. In some situations of direct trauma to the mandible, there are no immediate effects on the joint. However, as years progress, the classic symptomatology develops in the joint and no other finding of anamnesis indicates any other etiologic factor.  
IV. Indirect macrotrauma. These are patients reporting injuries of the acceleration-deceleration type phenomenon, followed by progressive symptoms consisting of muscle splinting that advances to arthralgia and joint noise.  
V. Systemic disease. Most of the diseases with TMJ involvement fall into the categories of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and benign or malignant tumors, although the latter two are rather infrequent occurrences.

# 53.7.9 Diagnosis

In most cases, the patient will present without prior advanced imaging; however, a comprehensive history and clinical examination will allow a diagnosis to be formulated, and an MRI is indicated only if the clinical examination is equivocal. A diagnostic staging should be made for each patient according to the Wilkes classification system.

# 53.7.10 Discussion

The conclusion of the TMJ consultation form is the formulation of an initial treatment plan. A few remarks are in order after the completion of the standardized form. If the TMJ anamnesis examination is performed correctly, it will definitely elucidate the necessary information about the patient. This can be achieved only by developing an accurate, concise, and repeatable technique for collection of data. A complete TMJ workup (including diagnosis and initial treatment plan) could be completed in 15 to 30 minutes, using standardized forms and clinical experience.

# 53.7.11 Rapid TMJ Assessment

As the clinician becomes more experienced, more accurate and more comfortable with all the rigors of the TMJ examination, the assessment procedures can be

expedited. Eventually, the TMJ surgeon performs the same rapid TMJ assessment for the initial assessment of a new patient as well as for the follow-up patients. This rapid assessment helps the surgeon to conduct a problem-focused assessment using a standardized form (see  $\square$  Fig. 53.3), thus further increasing the speed of evaluation. The TMJ follow-up form  $(\square$  Fig. 53.8) gives the practitioner all the pertinent information with regard to the patient's condition, progress, future course of action, and follow-up. As a quick review, the clinician should assess ROM of the mandible in all excursions, while listening/auscultating and palpating the joints, periarticular structures, the masseter, and temporalis muscles as previously described. Also, a check should be performed for Mahan's sign, and all findings should be correlated with those from previous visits.

# 53.8 Arthrocentesis

In 1991, Nitzan and Dolwick identified a unique clinical situation of closed lock of the TMJ that could not be explained by conventional methods of diagnosis of the disease process. Prior to their description, Murakami in 1986 identified the ability to recapture a persistently displaced anterior disc displacement with a single-puncture technique to accomplish a pumping action and the use of hydraulic pressure in the superior joint space. It was Nitzan and Dolwick, however, who questioned the usual mechanisms of development of disc displacement and identified a condition of severe, limited mouth opening  $(<30\mathrm{mm})$  without translation, no joint noise, which could occur at any age, was not a result of macrotrauma, was unrelated to disc shape or position, was unresponsive to nonsurgical TMJ therapy, and was responsive to the technique of joint pressure lysis and lavage (arthrocentesis). They were convinced that this condition was different from classic disc displacement. The lack of condylar translation was attributed to adherence of the disc to the fossa due to a "vacuum" or "suction-cup" effect of the convex disc pressed against the anterior slope of the glenoid fossa, and this situation is more likely to occur in joints with decreased synovial fluid volume and increased viscosity. Several studies showed the efficacy of dual-puncture arthrocentesis in relieving "disc adhesion" (the stuck disc) with acute painful limited opening and allowing a rapid improvement in mouth opening and decrease in pain. It is important to consider performing the procedure early after the onset of symptoms (<3 months) and consideration of the use of bite splint therapy postoperatively to unload the joint space. Whereas corticosteroids have been used routinely in the joint space after the arthrocentesis procedure, several studies have indicated that the use of sodium hyaluronate may have better short- and long-term benefits. Over the years, studies

have shown comparable results of arthroscopy and arthrocentesis primarily due to the lysis and lavage portion of the technique, resulting in clearance of inflammatory mediators and relief of a vacuum effect in the joint space. It has been concluded that arthrocentesis could be considered as an intervening treatment between nonsurgical management and arthroscopy, especially in cases that could be identified as disc adhesion with acute onset of symptoms. The procedure is relatively simple to perform in office with a low cost and minimal chance of complications (fluid extravasation into soft tissues, transient facial nerve weakness) and potentially high benefit if it can resolve the clinical symptoms. Of course, the major benefits of arthroscopy over arthrocentesis include direct visualization of the joint space and the ability to perform a variety of invasive procedures as described in detail in this chapter, whereas arthrocentesis does little to address the specific etiology of the disc problem or prevent recurrence. Whereas treatment decisions must be individualized in each patient, arthrocentesis should be considered before more invasive techniques.

# 53.8.1 The Arthroscope

The arthroscope is a specific endoscope designed to extend the eye of the arthroscopist to the tip of the instrument, inside the intra-articular space (Fig. 53.9). Ideal properties of a TMJ arthroscope are as follows:

1. Sophisticated optics that provide excellent intraarticular images.  
2. A good light source.  
3. Simplified engagement system between the cannula and scope.  
4. Focal length should be zero which means that it provides the surgeon with a complete view of the inside of the joint. Some scopes have a focal length of  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , which means that visual information will be missed in the first 3 millimeters of viewing the joint.  
5. Good angulation view.  
6. Durable and that can be sterilized and reused again.  
7. The scope should be under  $2\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter which allows the scope to negotiate the small joint space without damage once inserted into the arthroscopic cannula.

# 53.8.2 Technology of Video Arthroscopy

The video camera is routinely used in TMJ arthroscopy for viewing the surgical field indirectly on a monitor. The advantages of its use are better operative field sterility (less action in and around the operative field), surgeon comfort, and, most importantly, a high-quality image magnified on the monitor, enhancing visibility and engagement of the entire surgical team (Fig. 53.10). It

is invaluable in the evaluation of intra-articular pathology by both the surgeon and assistant as well as a teaching modality. Recorded media allows for review of surgical findings during the postsurgical visit. The patient can now be educated by virtual means regarding her or his joint disease process. Also, the medicolegal record-keeping is very accurate. The disadvantage of the entire system is, obviously, pecuniary. The sophisticated

miniaturized video camera, high-resolution monitors, as well as the quality recording equipment necessary for video arthroscopy may be rather expensive. In addition, this quite complicated equipment requires basic understanding of electronics and video electronics in order to set up and operate appropriately.

The TMJ arthroscopy requires a cold-white bright light source to adequately illuminate the joint cavity. The light source must be variable in intensity to adjust for changes in illumination requirements for different parts of the joint. This has been accomplished by controlling the quantity of light delivered at the light source with a variable iris aperture, via an autosensing light source that determines the strength of the video signal and increases or decreases the iris aperture accordingly, thus controlling the quantity of light delivered to the light cable. The arthroscopic system also employs an automatic gain control system of the video signal that leaves the light intensity constant and varies the strength of the video signal proportional to the required illumination.

Light sensitivity is the degree to which the camera determines an image in low-light situations. It is measured in lux. The signal-to-noise ratio is a measure of the video signal to the background electronic noise. A larger ratio denotes a better, clearer picture. It is measured in decibels.

# 53.8.3 Armamentarium

# 53.8.3.1 Hand Instrumentation

# Cannulas

The delivery system facilitates not only passing of hand instruments into the joint but also irrigation and maintenance of joint insufflation. The markings on the cannula begin at  $15\mathrm{mm}$  from the tip and continue in  $5\mathrm{mm}$  increments (Fig. 53.11). Similar cannulas must be

![](images/a65153caa1abf0c587dc7d6067f88345e59b0dcd710a2c88bdeb7c1aa37f15cd.jpg)  
Fig. 53.10 Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy

used in double-puncture arthroscopy to allow for the interchanging of instruments and scope between portals. The 1.7-mm-diameter hand instruments leave a  $0.3\mathrm{mm}$  space for irrigation outflow. All instruments are marked in  $5\mathrm{mm}$  increments. For larger-diameter instruments (i.e.,  $2.7\mathrm{mm}$ ), the author has designed a switch-stick, facilitating the interchange between the 2.0- and the  $3.0\mathrm{-mm}$ -diameter cannulas.

# Probes

The straight probe is the most basic arthroscopic hand instrument. It is used for palpation, severing adhesions, and mobilization/temporary immobilization of tissue (i.e., disc). The hooked probe is similar to the latter except for a small terminal hook. It is the preferred instrument for palpation in cases of chondromalacia. The typical use of this probe is to elevate the anterior aspect of the disc after anterior releasing procedures and to complete the dissection of the disc from capsule and pterygoid muscle. The hooked probe is also preferred in difficult cases of disc reduction, with lax/redundant retrodiscal tissue, where a straight probe may lacerate the structure. Hooking of the oblique protuberance before disc reduction enables reduction without herniation of tissue (Fig. 53.12).

# Biopsy Forceps/Tissue Graspers

Removing tissue and taking from joint synovium and/ or joint space can be achieved with the same instruments (Figs. 53.13a, b and 53.14). Some of these forceps even have integrated suction for convenient joint aspiration during major joint debridement or removal of fragmented tissues (Fig. 53.13a).

The French no. 3 myringotomy suction tip will evacuate clots or heme during arthroscopy (Fig. 53.15). The  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  cannula easily accommodates this suction.

# Meniscus Mender

This packaged set consists of straight and curved spinal needles with stylet and a suture loop used to snare the suture once passed through the needle (Fig. 53.16). The most common instruments used during discopexy procedures are the straight needle and the suture loop snare (Figs. 53.17 and 53.18). While in the process of designing a less invasive replica of meniscus mender, the author uses a 20 gauge needle to pass the suture or 28G wire for discopexy procedures.

# 53.8.3.2 Other Hand Instruments

In the advent of the latest advancements in motorized, electrical, but most of all, laser technology, a number of hand instruments have become obsolete. The suction punch, bone rasps, curettes, banana blades, forked blades, sickles, and others are only rarely used and in very specific situations. Also, the golden retriever in this cate

gory should, however, never be missing from the arthroscopist's arsenal (Fig. 53.18). This tool is an invaluable magnetized instrument specialized in the apprehension and delivery of intra-articular broken instruments.

# 53.8.3.3 Motorized Instruments

The unique concept of motorized shavers and abraders enables suctioning of the arthroscopic field while cutting and removing tissue in an efficient manner. Four factors are paramount for these instruments to function efficiently: (1) the design of the cutting blade, (2) the pressure balance between the suction and the continuous irrigation fluid, (3) the revolution speed (rpm) of the instrument, and (4) the type of tissue that the surgeon is attempting to cut. The author has discovered that the ultimate parameters of efficiency for the shaver are reached at the lower spectrum rpm-range speed. After developing a refined intra-articular tactile sense for the instrument, the author has noticed that the most efficient "shaving" occurs with a repeated pistoning motion.

# Shavers

The larger of the two shavers in use at present,  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter, is used for more aggressive arthroscopic arthroplasty. A  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$ -diameter suction punch may become necessary with the use of this shaver. For the sake of maintaining the procedures in the least invasive manner, the author has, lately, used only the  $1.9\mathrm{mm}$  shaver.

# Whisker Shaver

The one disadvantage of this shaver is its ability to generate intra-articular iatrogeny if not controlled appropriately. It can scuff articular surfaces and cause cartilaginous defects transfixiant to the subjacent osseous structures. The instrument has been so profiled that the articular surfaces are completely protected from the cutting portion of the active part (Fig. 53.19). The perforations in the external sleeve of the instrument promote a suction effect on the soft tissue that the inner blade cuts next. The whisker shaver has been designed for the debridement of fine fragmented fibrocartilage from articular surfaces, small fibrous adhesions, or small fragments of the disc periphery. It may remove fibrotic or desiccated synovial tissue; however, its use on intact/vascular synovium is discouraged.

# Full-Radius Shaver

Available in 1.9 and  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  diameters, it is a more aggressive instrument designed to resect tissue of an even more fibrotic consistency, such as fibrous bands, adhesions, large areas of desiccated synovium, and fragmented edges of meniscus.

# Abraders

These bone drills (the round and barrel-shaped abraders) are used to decorticate the osseous structures and

create pinpoint areas of microhemorrhage in order to promote cartilaginous regeneration.

# 53.8.4 Coblation

The term "Coblation" means "controlled ablation." This technology entails the creation and application of a high-energy field called "glow discharge plasma." This plasma field ablates tissue via a chemical reaction as highly energized particles in the plasma break down molecules in the tissue. When using coblation during TMJ arthroscopy, the isotonic irrigation fluid is dissociated into free sodium ions, which provoke the destruction of intercellular bonds, occasioning tissue dissociation. This process is achieved at temperatures between  $60~^\circ \mathrm{C}$  and  $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (compared with  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in electrosurgery). The presence of low temperature and irrigating isotonic fluid helps to limit the amount of heat delivered to the adjacent structures. Coblation technology provides multiple advantages to the TMJ arthroscopist. The lower temperatures when compared to other radio frequency (RF)-based technologies and the  $100\mu \mathrm{m} - 200\mu \mathrm{m}$  plasma field (about the size of a human hair) allow for precise removal of soft tissue with minimal thermal damage to untargeted tissue (Fig. 53.20a, b).

release (McCain technique), electrosurgical synovectomy, and electrocautery for hemostasis have afforded the experience necessary to understand the effects of electrosurgery or coblation on intra-articular temperature. Extensive intra-articular thermocoupling studies have enabled the author to elaborate an irrigation protocol for these procedures. The authors recommend irrigation with lactated Ringer's solution.

# 53.8.5 Laser

Laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) technology transmits energy in the form of light beam. The laser beam is columnated, equally spaced apart and coherent in the same time and space. Laser energy is delivered in a continuous or a pulsated wave. The wavelength of a particular laser determines the physical properties of a laser in the clinical use setting. Due to its safety and surgical precision, the Holmium laser seems to be the most suitable for TMJ arthroscopy.

# 53.8.5.1 Holmium:Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet Laser

This laser's wavelength is  $2140~\mathrm{nm}$ , making it somewhat similar to the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser with regard to its high hydroabsorbability. The holmium laser, however, has a limited depth of penetration (0.3–0.5 mm), making it very useful intra-articularly. In this author's hands, this laser variety is the most versatile for arthroscopic techniques on the TMJ, such as anterior release, synovectomy, posterior scarification, and debridement of fibrocartilage. The small size of the delivery tip facilitates excellent access in limited spaces, while its metal encasement prevents the breakage of this quartz fiber. To this date, the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser is considered the most safe and effic

# 53.8.6 Portals of Entry and Danger Zones

# 53.8.6.1 Fossa Portal

This puncture site has to be situated inside a 20-mm-diameter circle centered under the glenoid fossa (Fig. 53.22a). The osseous boundaries of this circle are the apex of the articular eminence anteriorly, the middle of the acoustic meatus posteriorly, the glenoid fossa superiorly, and finally, the disc, retrodiscal tissue,

and posterosuperior of the condyle inferiorly. The superficial correspondent of the posterior osseous landmark is the middle of the tragus, because it is situated  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the tragal apex and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the anterior wall of the osseous external auditory canal. This authors' observations have placed the peak of the cartilaginous wall of the meatus at the exact level of the posterior aspect of the TMJ capsule. The neurovascular bundle (auriculotemporal nerve, superficial temporal vein, and artery) is, in  $80\%$  of cases, 5 to  $8\mathrm{mm}$  anterior

to the midportion of the tragus. Within the limits of the glenoid fossa circular trough, the anatomic structures are, from lateral to medial, dermis, subcutaneous tissue, superficial parotid fascia, superior and posterior parotid lobule, auriculotemporal nerve, superficial temporal vein, and superficial temporal artery (see Fig. 53.22b).

The anatomic structures at this site are, from lateral to medial, the tegument, the superficial parotid fascia, the superoanterior parotid gland lobule, the deep parotid fascia, and the most posterior point of intersection of the frontal branch of the facial nerve; the masseter; the masseteric nerve, artery, and vein; the anterolateral aspect of the TMJ capsule; and the lateral pterygoid (see Fig. 53.23b). Measuring from the midportion

of the tragus anteriorly, the frontal branch of the facial nerve would be found ranging 13 to  $40~\mathrm{mm}$  with a mean of 20 to  $25~\mathrm{mm}$ . The zygomatic branch lies anterior to the frontal branch.

# 53.8.6.3 Danger Zones

Before proceeding with the fossa puncture, then the diagnostic sweep, the surgeon must be cognizant of the "danger zones" and proximity of vital structures associated with this procedure. The three "danger zones" are the dura mater and temporal lobe situated immediately cranial to the glenoid fossa, with a thickness of 0.5 to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 53.24); the tympanum ossicles and middle ear; and the entire length of the medial aspect

of the capsule represented by the lateral pterygoid. The vital structures that have to be given special consideration are the mandibular division of the trigeminus, especially the lingual and inferior alveolar branches, the ATN, and the internal maxillary artery together with all the small branches supplying the capsule (Fig. 53.25).

# 53.8.7 Internal Arthroscopic Anatomy

# 53.8.7.1 Posterior Pouch

The first structure encountered upon entering the joint is the synovium. The synovial membrane is mesenchymal in origin and a continuation of the cambium layer of the periosteum. Similar to other joints, the TMJ synovium covers the capsule and periarticular disc tis

![](images/8beab62842fa734aa6b8cfe3e806b1a39bc657ac417115c33c17d4ea5c875cb7.jpg)

sues, with the exception of the articular surfaces of the cartilages. The synovial lining is grayish with a translucent background and soft in consistency. The normal synovium has a mild amount of capillary proliferation, diffuse throughout the lining. With the condyle in a forward position (Fig. 53.26), the synovium of the posterior pouch lies flat and tight over the retrodiscal tissue. The oblique protuberance is a classic structure of the posterior pouch. With condyle forward, the oblique pro

tuberance is a fibroelastic band that protrudes into the retrodiscal tissue. It is located two-thirds medial from lateral to medial into the joint. With the condyle seated, the synovium "buckles and ruffles" like an accordion being closed (Fig. 53.27). The synovial tissue attaches from the back portion of the disc. The posterior band of disc running over the retrodiscal tissue attaches to the posterior aspect of the of the glenoid fossa at approximately midportion or the superior one-third of the gle

noid posterior wall of the glenoid fossa. The medial synovial drape appears normally as a gray, translucent synovial lining. Very distinct striae run superior to inferior, defining the medial synovium. It serves as another classic landmark in the arthroscopic examination. In the background of the medial aspect of the drape, the pterygoid shadow reflects with a red/purple tinge.

# 53.8.7.2 Intermediate Zone

In the middle of the joint, the fibrocartilage of the glenoid fossa is visible, thin, white, and not very reflective. Anterior to the glenoid fossa and along the back slope of the articular eminence, the fibrocartilage becomes whiter and more reflective of light and also takes on a classic appearance of striae formation that runs anterior to posterior. Changing the angle of view inferiorly, with the condyle forward, part of the disc can be seen as milky white, highly reflective of light, and without striations. With the condyle forward, a normally positioned disc completely covers the condyle. The clear junction between the synovium and the posterior band of the disc is represented by a red-white line where the capillary proliferation stops and the disc begins. A U-shaped depression or flexure between the synovial juncture and the posterior band of the disc can be observed. With the condyle seated, the disc covers the condyle and the flexure deepens significantly to the normal anatomic position of the disc. Toward the most lateral depth of the joint are the articular eminence and the trough within the eminence where the disc moves with the condylar translation.

# 53.8.7.3 Anterior Recess

In the anterior recess, the anterior slope of the articular eminence is evident. The fibrocartilage and anterior band of the disc are both white, reflective, and without striae. The synovium is tightly attached and has a gray, translucent background with mild capillary proliferation widely dispersed throughout. The synovium is also attached tightly to the anterior aspect of the ascending aspect of the articular eminence. Looking medially, the continuation of the medial synovial drape can be seen. The vertical striae of the drape are nonexistent, and the background consistency is deep purple secondary to the reflection of the pterygoid muscle fibers, much closer in this area. The lateral synovium is not tightly bound down but maintains the same color as the medial synovium. The posteroanterior trough on the medial aspect of the joint is where the synovium descends off the medial synovial drape and then attaches to the disc in the same fashion as the medial trough. The attachment of the lateral pterygoid muscle is immediately deep to the disc synovial crease within this medial trough.

# 53.8.7.4 Inferior Joint Space Anatomy

With the exception of very specific situations, such as existing disc perforation permitting the inferior joint space exploration without inducing any additional surgical trauma to the joint, this author does not advocate routine inferior joint space arthroscopic exploration.

# 53.8.7.5 Posterior Recess

In the posterior pouch of the inferior joint space, the synovium is similar in appearance, color, and capillary proliferation as previously described in this chapter. However, the consistency is softer and the synovium is not as adherently attached to the capsule.

# 53.8.7.6 Intermediate Zone

The inferior aspect of the disc has a more grayish appearance than the superior aspect. The striae are absent. The disc is similarly reflective. The fibrocartilage is glistening white and highly reflective, without striae.

# 53.8.7.7 Anterior Recess

The synovial tissue has identical consistency. It is more attached to and less mobile onto the subjacent capsule.

# 53.8.8 TMJ Arthroscopic Technique

# 53.8.8.1 Immediate Preoperative Steps Examination Under Anesthesia

The importance of this initial step of the procedure is paramount. It provides the surgeon with valuable information both pre- and postoperative. The preoperative examination ascertains joint mobility, joint noise, and, most importantly, the degree of difficulty of the upcoming punctures. Once the anesthesiologist administers the muscle relaxant, all myofascial factors related to condylar motion or disc function are eliminated. The clinician should be aware of the conditions that reduce mandibular range of motion independent of muscular tonus (e.g., advanced muscle fibrosis, extra-articular osseous impingements such as coronoid hyperplasia, Eagle's syndrome). Each joint is palpated separately. Normally, the condyle should subluxate, but not dislocate, the articular eminence with gentle manipulation. An inconsistent but common finding in patients with nonreducing disc derangements is the absence of this normal eminence subluxation. The operative documentation should include this particular observation pertaining to the examination under anesthesia. Joint noise has to be elicited and described. By pressing the condyle anterosuperior against the posterior slope of the eminence, then translating moving the condyle in all excursions, simulating mastication mechanics, clicking, and crepitus can

easily be achieved. A "seating-click," for instance, is used to describe a reducing disc displacement situation, when it is elicited during examination under general anesthesia.

# Ear Examination

Otoscopic examination of the ears is performed and documented to evaluate the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal. The examination is repeated after arthroscopy is performed.

# Palpation of TMJ Anatomy

To establish the puncture site, the maximum concavity of the glenoid fossa and the posterior slope of the articular eminence is palpated. Asking the assistant to move the jaw (condyle) backward and forward and side to side, in the closed position, can further orient the surgeon about the relation of the condyle to the glenoid fossa. The puncture is ideally located under the maximum concavity of the glenoid fossa behind the articular eminence.

# Marking the Fossa Portal Puncture Site

The Holmlund-Helsing line is drawn with marker between the lateral canthus and the apex of tragus. A marking point is made at about the midportion of the external tragus. From this point, approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$  anterior and  $2\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the line, the maximum concavity of the fossa is located. This is an adjunct for the surgeon while palpation gives a more accurate idea about the idea location for the puncture.

# Insufflation

The purpose for distention of the joint in this particular case is to expand the target area. In this process,  $3\mathrm{ml}$  of lactated ringers solution in a  $3\mathrm{mL}$  syringe with a 25 gauge is used. A vasoconstrictor should not be used because it could mask a correct diagnostic evaluation of engorgement of capillaries or reperfusion hypoxia phenomenon reflecting synovitis. The author does not recommend using plain xylocaine since its vasodilating characteristics may exaggerate the synovial hyperemic appearance. The injection is performed with an inferolateral technique. Midway between the tragus and the inferior aspect of the ear lobule, with the condyle in a forward position to open the posterior pouch of the joint, the needle is inserted 45 degrees to the skin surface within the preauricular skin crease aiming toward the midportion of the posterior slope of the articular eminence. Bone is lightly contacted with the tip of the needle. If the needle touches a thin glenoid fossa instead, excessive pressure may lead to glenoid fossa perforation. The surgeon should always aim slightly anteriorly. Aiming posterior may result in fluid deposition in the ear canal. The

![](images/58fc9463af86bbc255b4c53f49a955b1af3bcb7e5336d96d1298bdff38b877f1.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 53.28 Cannula and trocar are advanced to the inferolateral aspect of the zygoma, then inferiorly stepped off the osseous ledge

average joint will take approximately  $3\mathrm{mL}$ . A plunger rebound greater than  $0.5\mathrm{mL}$  indicates sufficient insufflation. Adequate joint distention is indicated by the amount of pressure on the plunger. Stenosed or fibrotic joints will typically take less fluid and the pressure required to insulate the joint is increased ("early rebound"). Hypermobile joints or joints with disc perforations without adhesions may require more fluid.

# 53.8.8.2 Operative Steps Fossa Puncture

The puncture is placed at maximum concavity of the glenoid fossa. The cannula is held in the right hand for a right joint puncture or in the left hand for a left joint puncture. The index controls the tip, and the palm of the hand controls the base of the cannula. With the condyle forward, the thumb of the opposite hand palpates the fossa portal and guides the trocar/cannula under the glenoid fossa. The trocar penetrates the skin in a rotational motion aiming toward the inferolateral aspect of the glenoid fossa. The trocar is used almost in the same fashion as a periosteal elevator after it perforates the periosteum at the level of the zygomatic bone. The distance from the skin to the ledge is approximately  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 53.28). The thumb of the nondominant hand helps guide the tip of the trocar to dissect the periosteum of the inferior lateral surface of the glenoid fossa and off the ledge (Fig. 53.29). The trocar is then rotated until a slight pop is felt (Fig. 53.30). It is then inserted approximately 10 to  $15\mathrm{mm}$ . Upon removal of trocar from the cannula, the reflux of fluid confirms perforation of the capsule. A blunt obturator is inserted and locked into the cannula. The obturator is then used to follow the contour of the glenoid fossa into the superior joint space. The cannula should not be inserted more than 20 to  $25\mathrm{mm}$  from tegument to the center of the joint (Fig. 53.31). Before inserting the scope, the surgeon backwashes the joint in order to remove all

blood and synovial fluid. The backwashing is continued until the return fluid is clear. The scope can be inserted next. The image on the monitor will confirm correct entry into the joint space. The image may not be very clear due to the absence of outflow.

# Technique Pearls and Pitfalls

It is very important to maintain the trocar pointing anteriorly during the puncture. A straight or posterior direction can result into injury to the external auditory canal, the tympanic membrane, or the middle ear. The puncture should be located immediately under the maximum concavity of the glenoid fossa. If the puncture site is more posterior, one is likely to puncture into the retrodiscal tissue even if the trocar is aiming anteriorly to avoid injuring the ear. One clean puncture should be done. Having multiple punctures into the joint capsule can result in fluid extravasation.

# Outflow Needle Puncture

With the mandible protruded, the scope is directed to the center of the fossa area of the joint. The assistant insufflates the joint with about  $2\mathrm{mL}$  of fluid in order to achieve joint distention. The purpose of the outflow needle is to establish a patent irrigation needle and, at the same time, maintain the joint adequately distended for intra-articular instrumentation. A 22 gauge,  $1^{1}/_{2}$  inch needle is inserted approximately  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the fossa puncture site, perpendicular to the curvilinear surface of the skin. The tendency is to point toward the scope with needle while, in reality, most endoscopes have a 30-degree angle of view looking anteriorly. Despite having a patent irrigation outflow system, care should be taken with joint irrigation to avoid fluid extravasation through the joint capsule.

# 53.8.8.3 Diagnostic Sweep (Seven Points of Interest of TMJ Arthroscopic Examination)

Seven anatomic areas are examined during the sweep: medial synovial drape, pterygoid shadow, retrodiscal synovium (where the oblique protuberance, the retrodiscal synovial tissue attached to the posterior glenoid process, and the lateral recess of the retrodiscal synovial tissue have to be closely inspected), posterior slope of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa, articular disc, intermediate zone, and anterior recess (with special consideration for the disc-synovial crease, the midportion, the medioanterior corner, and the lateroanterior corner) (Fig. 53.32). Losing orientation inside the joint, even for a short time, can be a frustrating experience for the novice arthroscopist. Adding to the obstacles of inexperience

ence, intra-articular pathology can deepen the confusion. The easiest method of preventing this occurrence is for the operator to be comfortable with the four classic intra-articular anatomic landmarks: medial synovial drape with its distinct superior-to-inferior striae, oblique protuberance of the retrodiscal synovium, posterior slope of the articular eminence with distinct anterior-to-posterior striae and anterior disc-synovial crease, and juncture of anterior synovium and anterior band of disc, which is the

area for placement of a second or working cannula.

# Area 1. Medial synovial drape (Fig. 53.33)

In many situations, the surgeon will run into one of the classic landmarks, typically, the oblique protuberance or the posterior slope of the articular eminence. The drape can be reached by pistoning the arthroscope in past the retrodiscal tissue until the drape becomes visible. In cases of retrodiscal redundancy, the retrodiscal tissue may obstruct the view of the medial synovial drape. This particular articular entity represents one of the most important barometers of TMJ synovitis. In acute inflammatory states, capillary proliferation with hyperemia of the medial synovial drape is increased (Fig. 53.34). In addition, erythematous patches (petechiae) may be seen on the drape (Fig. 53.35), or the entire drape may have an erythematous appearance (Fig. 53.36). Occasionally, an in-bulging or prolapsing of the drape

into the joint space occurs. Adhesive phenomena can also be seen (Fig. 53.37). In chronic synovitis, the drape has a fibrotic or whitish appearance (Fig. 53.38).

# Area 2. Pterygoid shadow

This second area to be examined will be reached by swiveling the scope anteriorly and pistoning medially until the shadow comes into view. A medial trough leads from the medial synovial drape anterior to the pterygoid shadow. The normal-appearing pterygoid shadow has a purple tinge attributed to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid subjacent to the synovial lining (Fig. 53.39). Also, an obvious, well-delineated color difference is present between the drape and the shadow.

Fig. 53.43 Oblique protuberance. a, Oblique protuberance. b, Articular disc. c, Articular tubercle

During pathologic states, the pterygoid shadow takes on the appearance of marked erythema and marked hypervascularization and becomes quite thin (Fig. 53.40). The synovial lining can thin to the extent at which it causes a perforation of this area and herniation of the pterygoid muscle directly into the anteromedial aspect of the superior joint space (Fig. 53.41).

# Area 3. Retrodiscal synovium

This third area to be examined is reached by backtracking the initial path of the scope. Once the medial synovial

drape is visible, the scope is pistoned-out (lateral) and swiveled minimally to bring into view both anterior and posterior components of the retrodiscal synovium (Fig. 53.42). The arthroscopically normal retrodiscal synovium with pertaining structures have been previously described. In inflammatory pathologic states, the synovial tissue takes on the appearance of increased hypervascularity and erythema along with a redundant pattern.

Zone 1: Oblique protuberance: This area is visualized by pistoning-out the scope. It is located about one-third of the way lateral from the drape (Fig. 53.43).

Zone 2: Retrodiscal tissue attached to posterior glenoid process: This area takes a superior swivel of the scope to visualize (Fig. 53.44).

Zone 3: Lateral recess of the retrodiscal synovial tissue: This area can be accessed by pistoning-out from the

oblique protuberance (see Fig. 53.44). In this zone as well, the pathologic states induce a hyperemic or petechial appearance of synovium (Fig. 53.45).

# Area 4. Posterior slope of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa

This fourth area of the intra-articular examination is reached in the following manner. From the lateral recess, the scope is swiveled forward and superiorly. The fibrocartilage of this area has a distinct, classic white and highly reflective appearance with anteroposterior striae within the fibrocartilage (Fig. 53.46). As it tapers toward the glenoid fossa, the fibrocartilage becomes darker (more brownish) and thinner. The arthroscopist has to give special consideration to this area because it is the most prone to iatrogenic injury (scuffing) during intra-articular scope manipulation. The fibrocartilage

over the bulk of the posterior slope of the articular eminence is significantly thicker compared with the glenoid fossa. The pathology occurring often in this area has various stages of chondromalacia. This important entity is discussed in detail later in this chapter. To complete the examination of this area, the scope is swiveled superiorly and posteriorly. From that position, pistoning-out to the joint periphery will permit visualization of the glenoid fossa. Normal fibrocartilage over the glenoid fossa is thin, white, and without striae. When destruction (thinning) of the fibrocartilage is advanced, the underlying bone appears slightly yellow or brownish. In inflammatory states, creeping of the synovial tissue can be observed in the glenoid fossa (Fig. 53.47) and the posterior slope of the eminence (Fig. 53.48).

# Area 5. Articular disc

When the examination of the glenoid fossa is complete, the scope should be at the extreme periphery of the joint and in position to examine the fifth area. From this posterolateral position, the posterior band of disc is located. The posterior band should always be visible in the posterior recess. With the condyle forward, the inspection proceeds in an anterior and inferior direction from this peripheral position. The normal disc anatomy has been previously described (Fig. 53.49). In pathologic states, the synovium creeps onto the surface of the disc (Fig. 53.50). Fragmentation of the disc surface (Fig. 53.51) is usually an indication that a perforation of the disc is either imminent or present (Fig. 53.52). In cases of disc perforation, the inferior joint space can

![](images/bbf88140a69f103580f157e920f2d4eefe5d2f6dae9a67b32b977cb4e969518f.jpg)  
Fig. 53.53 Condyle forward with  $100\%$  roofing

be examined by introducing the scope through the perforation into the inferior joint space.

Joint dynamics and disc mobility: The next step of the diagnostic sweep is to examine dynamics and mobility from the posterolateral position. The scope needs to be at the most peripheral posterolateral position, almost exiting the joint space. If the operator does not ensure the appropriate position of the scope in this instance, damage to the retrodiscal tissues and the disc may occur along with scuffing of the glenoid fossa and the back slope of the eminence. At this stage in the operation, the assistant manipulates the condyle in a seated position in a reciprocal fashion, together with the surgeon. Observation of disc mobility between the fossa and the disc can now be ascertained and disc mobility between the condyle and the disc can be inferred. In nonpathologic states, the disc should glide smoothly along the articular eminence in a fluid movement, without any anteroposterior or mediolateral erratic movements. If an erratic movement is noted in the anteroposterior direction with a simultaneous audible or palpable clicking phenomenon, then a reducing disc is the most likely situation.

Arthroscopic assessment of disc position: This is possible whether or not the disc is in a normal position. In normal arthroscopic anatomy, the posterior band of the disc lies adjacent to the back slope of the fibrocartilage of the articular eminence and the glenoid fossa when the condyle is in the forward and seated positions, respectively. To identify the reducing disc, arthroscopic observation is performed first with the condyle forward. In the seated position, the retrodiscal synovium comes into view. The nonreducing disc is determined arthroscopically by observing the roofing of the disc with the condyle forward. In non-roofing situations, the disc is not reducing.

Roofing: This concept was developed to evaluate the covering of the articular disc over the condyle when the

Fig. 53.58 Condyle seated with  $0\%$  roofing (complete disc displacement)

condyle is either forward or seated. An attempt is made to specifically grade the amount of displacement by arthroscopic observation of the disc. The first observation of roofing is made with the condyle forward (Figs. 53.53, 53.54, and 53.55). When viewed in physiologic disc position, with the condyle  $100\%$  roofed by the disc, the posterior band of the disc can be seen lying adjacent to the posterior slope of the articular eminence, thus giving a white-on-white appearance. The disc flexure with its U-shape is prominent; the retrodiscal synovial tissue appears normal, without hypervascularity. The second observation of roofing is made with the condyle seated (Figs. 53.56, 53.57, and 53.58). This assessment describes the degree of displacement in reducing the disc. Gradations of roofing are ascertained by the arthroscopic view of the posterior band of disc as it abuts the midportion of the glenoid fossa and the articular eminence. In nonpathologic states, with the condyle  $100\%$  roofed, the posterior band of the disc abuts at approximately the

midportion of the glenoid fossa or just at the beginning of the back slope of the articular eminence. When evaluating the degree of roofing with the condyle seated, occasionally there are some technical difficulties. In certain instances, the condyle cannot be completely seated into the glenoid fossa because it is obstructed by the tip of the arthroscope, notwithstanding the capsular peripheral position of the scope. In abnormal situations of disc displacement and marked redundant retrodiscal synovium, the arthroscopic view quickly becomes obstructed by the redundant synovium, even though the condyle is seated and the position of the scope maintained. These factors are valuable diagnostic indicators that disc displacement in the seated position is occurring.

# Area 6. Intermediate zone

In order to examine this sixth area, with condyle forward, the scope is pistoned to facilitate placement at approximately  $1\mathrm{mm}$  away from the interface between the articular eminence and the articular disc. From this position, the scope contours the path of the articular eminence. In normality, this area should have a complete white-on-white appearance, with the fibrocartilage, cranial, white, and the disc, caudal, also white (Fig. 53.59). The scope is swiveled, first anteriorly, contouring down the articular eminence, then laterally, positioning it in the lateral synovial trough while observing the intermediate zone. With the condyle forward, the scope is pistoned and swiveled anteriorly as far as permitted. With disc displacement without reduction, it is paramount to note when disc tissue is first observed. The degree of roofing can be assessed by comparing the white fibrocartilage, cranial, and the red retrodiscal synovium, caudal. The scope is then pistoned as far anterior as permitted to the apex of the articular eminence. When the arthroscope cannot be negotiated any more anterior, the condyle is

seated. A triangle reflecting an open space and pathway to the anterior recess should be visualized. The triangle is limited by the apex of the anterior slope of the articular eminence, the articular disc inferiorly, and the beginning of the anterior synovium anteriorly (Figs. 53.60 and 53.61). Seating the condyle and pistoning the scope into the anterior recess must be precisely coordinated.

# Area 7. Anterior recess

This seventh area is the last one to be examined. Examination can only begin after the condyle is seated and the anterior triangle identified. The arthroscope is pistoned directly into the anterior recess until the midportion of the anterior synovium is visible. At this point, by swiveling and pistoning the scope slightly posteriorly as well as inferiorly, the anterior disc-synovial crease is

identified. The crease is examined by following it to the terminal medial point, the most extreme medioanterior corner of the crease and the pterygoid shadow (Fig. 53.62). The scope is then pistoned-out along the synovial crease to the periphery of the capsule. At the lateral and anterior limit, the juncture between the anterior disc-synovial crease and the lateral synovial capsule can be viewed. In pathosis, the vascularity of the anterior synovial pouch increases, and all characteristics of inflammation of synovium are present. Occasionally, synovial redundancy, plicae, and adhesions (Fig. 53.63) are also present. Creeping of synovium onto the articular eminence can also be seen. The disc below in the anterior recess may appear "buckled," with the anterior band becoming prominent (Fig. 53.64).

![](images/a71f1939840e09f7eb8c7dfc8919d1cf7700039b74579011384445f38cde7752.jpg)

Manipulation under anesthesia: A slight increase in the level of sedation will be necessary for this step of the procedure for most patients. A relatively cooperative patient is preferred. Unassisted first, then assisted maximal MIO are performed. When the patient fails to open at least 35 to  $40\mathrm{mm}$ , the surgeon executes a very gentle "pry bar" assisting in the achievement of an acceptable MIO. This manipulation not only provides the initial step in the patient's postoperative rehabilitation/physical therapy (PT) but also represents a prediction factor for the postoperative course of the case. One of the pertinent observations we have made over the years is that, in cases of Wilkes III and IV, pain at the end range of opening is a high predictive factor for requiring discopexy. In other words, notwithstanding the reversal of these patients to "no clicking" or a Wilkes I (painless click), these particular entities usually relapse to a stage II (painful click), III (closed lock), or IV (bony changes), making disc repositioning/discopexy a necessity as the next step of the arthroscopic cascade.

# 53.8.8.4 Intra-Articular Pathology

Before continuing with the description of surgical therapeutic arthroscopic techniques, a review of intra-articular pathology entities is necessary to correlate with the diagnostic findings.

# Synovitis

The acute form consists of acute inflammation with dilated superficial capillaries without hyperemia in the early stages, progressively increasing hyperemia in the early stages, and total obliteration of the superficial vascularity in the most severe stages. For clinical description purposes, it has been staged 1 to 4, with 2 and 3 for the intermediate stage. The chronic form is character-

Fig. 53.66 Synovial chondromatosis (panoramic radiograph)

ized by synovial hyperplasia with increasing proliferation of tissue folds, particularly in the retrodiscal area.

# Fibrosis

Intra-articular hemorrhage results in the formation of a fibrin scaffold for the fibroblasts to migrate upon and produce fibrous adhesions. In addition, pseudodigit villous proliferations are frequently present. Fibrosis can present as fibrous adhesions or total synovial fibrosis.

# Villonodular Synovitis

This arthroscopic finding consists of diffuse pigmented multiple nodular villi, which can involve the entire synovium (Fig. 53.65). Typically, it occurs after prolonged inflammation stages, most commonly seen in conjunction with osteoarthritis. This is an arthroscopic term independent of pigmented villonodular synovitis, even though they could coexist.

# Synovial Chondromatosis

This rare disease of the synovial membrane presents with multiple osteocartilaginous bodies attached to the synovium and others floating freely in the joint space.

This rare entity deserves to be documented with the appropriate imaging: Panorex (Fig. 53.66), computed tomography (CT) views (Figs. 53.67 and 53.68), three-dimensional reconstruction images (Figs. 53.69 and 53.70), and arthroscopic images of the three stages of the disease (Figs. 53.71, 53.72, and 53.73).

# Rheumatoid Arthritis

RA is a systemic disease of undetermined etiology. It is considered an autoimmune disease with a rheumatoid antibody factor, anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG), present in  $85\%$  to  $90\%$  of patients. From a TMJ perspective, it is characterized by synovial hypervascularity with elongated villous lesions and aggregates of lymphocytes, as

well as dilated capillaries. More than  $50\%$  of the RA patients have TMJ involvement.

# Pseudogout/Chondrocalcinosis

As opposed to gout, where the crystals are deposited in the synovium, synovial villi, fibrillated and fragmented fibrocartilage (chondromalacia grade III), chondrocalcinosis is characterized by calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the synovium with an unaltered articular cartilage.

# Joint Stenosis

In cases of synovitis without any disc or cartilage pathology, some joint stenosis accompanies the condition along with generalized capsulitis. This will cause a restriction of the ROM of the joint. Small intrasynovial adhesions are not likely to restrict joint motion; how

ever, the combination of these adhesions, alteration of synovial fluid mechanics, and generalized capsulitis and stenosis will restrict condylar motion from both a functional and a pain standpoint. In this author's experience, adhesive synovitis is most commonly diagnosed in the anterior recess, with the posterior recess being the second most common area. Less frequent, lateral recess adhesions are identified, whereas medial wall and medial trough adhesions are rather infrequent. It is important to mention that lateral adhesions cannot be determined without an arthroscopy. Characteristically, patients with lateral adhesions present with limited opening status posttrauma, essentially negative disc mechanic problems, and negative arthritic changes in the joint. During the diagnostic sweep, when the arthroscope is contoured toward the front, the mechanical blockage is encountered, which prohibits the scope's advancement. This obstacle is a fibrotic adhesion in the lateral recess that most often begins to occur at approximately the peak or anterior portion of the articular eminence. This fibrous and synovial adhesive phenomenon restricts translation. At this point, the scope should not be levered or forced any farther. On the monitor, a partial eclipse of the normal arthroscopic view is visible, indicating bending of the arthroscope, with imminent risk of dislodging the lens. After appropriate documentation of the problem, the procedure should be discontinued, and, pending symptomatology, the joint should be arthroscopically reentered in the operating room with a double- or multiple-puncture procedure.

# Articular Dysfunction

From an arthroscopic perspective, the discussion revolves around reducing and nonreducing discs. In the

![](images/7027d09f7d9f33fa834287996e5da4a99d1b3da33f28d528531845c47bbd13c6.jpg)  
Fig. 53.74 Normal appearance of the posterior slope of the eminence (chondromalacia stage 0) of the right TMJ

situation of a reducing disc, the posterior band of the disc is visible and accessible for suturing when the condyle is in the forward position. In the nonreducing disc, no posterior band is seen with the condyle forward. Also, the entire anterior band may be obscured with fibrosis. Obviously, the cases of chronic disc dislocation associated with fibrosis and pseudowall formation will obliterate the disc-synovial crease.

# Osteoarthritis

The studies of Boering and Rasmussen seem to support the idea of a natural process of joint aging. Whether this process occurs slowly or rapidly, the operative procedures to treat this condition are limited by joint size, stenosis, and pathologic state, not to mention the technical limitations of the surgeon and instrumentation. One of the typical arthroscopic findings when dealing with this particular entity is articular cartilage degeneration that can be observed along the posterior slope and peak of the articular eminence. A brief discussion of chondromalacia at the same time with the classification of this pathognomonic finding follows.

# 53.8.9 Chondromalacia Grading

# 53.8.9.1 Grade I: Softening of Cartilage

Softening of cartilage is caused by digestion of proteoglycan collagenases from injured chondrocytes. Clinically, the cartilage turns opaque white, as opposed to a tannish normal (Fig. 53.74) appearance. The difference is quite subtle; however, palpation of the articular cartilage, very gently with the scope, will determine its compressibility and friability, as well as the dimpling

![](images/fa7a8b3cb2178fb633a45d35b2b860398625623ae3e50327101c432338f52d0b.jpg)

or pitting effect of this edematous tissue, evident mostly on the posterior slope of the eminence (  $\square$  Fig. 53.75).

# 53.8.9.2 Grade II: Furrowing

Furrowing is the result of disruption of some of the deep-zone collagen fibrils at the calcified and noncalcified cartilage attachment and hydrated swelling of the proteoglycan-depleted areas along the fibrils in the TMJ (Fig. 53.76).

# 53.8.9.3 Grade III: Fibrillation and Ulceration

Fibrillation and ulceration are caused by rupture of the deeper collagen fibrils from their calcified and noncalcified cartilage attachment and then the disruption of the parallel articular surface fibrils. These disruptions result in fibrillar strands of degenerating cartilage that can be observed hanging from the posterior slope and peak of the articular eminence when suspended in the Ringer's lactate arthroscopic medium (Fig. 53.77).

$\square$  Fig. 53.78 Chondromalacia stage IV (crater formation and subchondral osseous structure exposure)

# 53.8.9.4 Grade IV: Crater Formation and Subchondral Bone Exposure

Crater formation and subchondral bone exposure are a result of a progressive breakdown of the deep and superficial fibrils followed by a breakdown of the intermediate cartilage fibrils (Fig. 53.78).

# 53.8.9.5 Arthrofibrosis

We chose to describe this condition separately from the "fibrosis" discussed previously for the severity of this condition and its association with the severe hypomobility of Wilkes stage IV and V. It also represents one of the most difficult surgical challenges for the TMJ arthroscopist. Correlation with clinical findings compels us to reiterate that severe trismus in the presence of good excursive joint

motion should raise the surgeon's suspicion for an extra-articular condition. The patient with intra-articular degeneration and hypomobility presents typically with minimal opening, minimal excursive motion, and focal joint pain. Documentation of baseline interincisal opening should be done under sedation/anesthesia immediately before the procedure. The entire diagnostic arthroscopy for this particular entity becomes very different from what we have presented earlier. Particular consideration in puncturing into the hypomobile joint has to increase the awareness of the surgeon. Frequently, the greatest concavity of the glenoid fossa is less evident, whereas the condyle becomes difficult to palpate, particularly if the lateral pole is degenerated or absent. Also, insufflation of the superior joint compartment is made difficult by the inability to palpate the lateral capsular wall distention and the absence or reduced capability of ascertaining plunger rebound. These are typical signs of joint stenosis and intra-articular fibrosis or, more concisely, arthrofibrosis. The diagnostic sweep is attempted. However, a "white-out" of fibrillar tissue makes visualization of structures very difficult. A lysis maneuver can be performed blindly, using a blunt obturator, to increase the working space. During this initial sweep, it is paramount that the contours of the fossa and eminence are palpated at all times. The joint is again backwashed and the scope reinserted. The glenoid fossa and eminence should be visible at this point. Sometimes, the condyle is visible as well. As previously described, the next step of the diagnostic sweep is the positioning of the scope medial into the joint to identify the medial synovial drape. Extreme caution should be exercised so as not to violate this structure and venture too medially, where the internal maxillary artery as well as other vital structures could be found. This complication can be avoided by continuous awareness of cannula depth.

# 53.9 Arthroscopic Operative Procedures

# 53.9.1 Second Puncture

The variations in second-puncture site and technique are dictated by the anterior recess volume and condition of the joint. Conditions such as synovitis, disc displacement with or without reduction, and osteoarthritis will present with a normal or reasonable (increased or slightly decreased) anterior pouch volume. The second puncture (Fig. 53.79) is performed with the condyle seated in the fossa. The irrigation needle is removed, and then the puncture site is located according to the triangulation principles. The vectors of instrument orientation create an equilateral triangle, facilitating a repeatable and safe pattern of placement for the second punctures. The depth of the arthroscope can be assessed on the cannula. A second measuring cannula is posi

tioned flat against the tegument with the tip (0 mm marking) contiguous with the scope at the point of entry (skin) and continuous (in a straight line) with the plane of the arthroscope. The depth of scope penetration is now translated to the cannula. Depending on the angle formed by the arthroscope and the tegument, 1 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  can be added to the previous measurement. The site for the second puncture has now been established. The ideal position of the working cannula is directly parallel to the disc-synovial crease in the anterior recess in order to facilitate the operative procedures. In a fashion similar to the fossa puncture, the assistant insufflates the joint with  $2\mathrm{mL}$  of irrigation fluid. The trocar/cannula penetrates perpendicular to the tegument and then continues in the very same direction, ensuring the appropriate geometry and orientation of triangulation described previously. The tendency to direct the cannula posteriorly has to be avoided. The trocar is rotated through the skin and advanced transfixant to the osseous structure. The attempted point of contact is the juncture between the anterior aspect of the anterior slope of the articular eminence and the continuation of the zygoma. As opposed to the fossa puncture, no vigorous dissection of the periosteum is performed at this level. The frontal ramus of the temporofacial division of cranial nerve VII crosses the anterior aspect of the eminence in close proximity to the second puncture site. Only the tip of the trocar should gently touch the subjacent cortical plate. Next, the trocar/cannula is rotated through the capsule and synovium. The trocar is observed on the monitor entering the joint space. Once intra-articular, the trocar is removed and drainage of the irrigating fluid is noted through the cannula. The assistant stabilizes the working cannula while the surgeon proceeds with instrumentation. In the case of fibrosis or advanced arthrosis, the anterior recess is difficult to negotiate. The scope will be maneuvered as far as possible during the diagnostic sweep. When the arthroscope cannot be advanced or laterally positioned any further and the condyle has been seated, the second puncture is placed at the most anterolateral aspect permitted by the pathology of that particular joint. The joints with advanced arthrofibrosis, stenosis, or fibrous ankylosis present a distorted intra-articular anatomy. Henceforth, the second puncture is placed in the most open area of the joint. When no open space can be visualized arthroscopically, confirmation of the arthroscopic cannula in the superior joint space is confirmed by palpation. Once the cannula position is confirmed, the scope is removed and the obturator inserted. With the blunt obturator, a blind lysis maneuver is performed until osseous contact is perceived (Fig. 53.80). This will create the opening necessary for the placement of the second puncture.

# 53.9.2 Lysis and Lavage

Although there are still practitioners performing the traditional lysis and lavage procedure (Fig. 53.81) with a certain degree of success, the limitations of the procedure are obvious.

In addition to the diagnostic lysis and lavage, the double-puncture arthroscopic lysis and lavage emphasizes more on the lytic aspect. Utilizing a straight probe, the pouches and recesses of the superior joint space can be directly manipulated. The lysis procedure is designed to distend all pouches and recesses along the capsule in order to give the physical therapist a head start in postoperative joint manipulation.

# 53.9.2.1 Anterior and Posterior Recess Adhesions

The sequential lysis of adhesions in the superior joint space follows an anterior-to-posterior pattern, avoiding repeated motion of instrumentation from the back to the front of the joint, increasing the risk of unnecessary articular surface scuffing. The lysis maneuvers with a probe under direct arthroscopic visualization are performed according to the triangulation techniques. The purpose of the procedure is to restore the volume and architecture of the joint. The probe is first placed in the most medial aspect of the joint and then swept laterally along the disc-synovial junction with an inferoanterior maneuver. Then, by sweeping medially to laterally along the articular eminence, a superoanterior maneuver is executed to complete the lysis (Fig. 53.82). These maneuvers are repeated until an adequate recess volume is restored. The lysis maneuver should be deliberate but excessive force should be avoided in order not to tear the synovium and the capsule. In many instances, the anterior recess lysis is followed by posterior recess lysis. Under direct observation, the probe and the scope are translated back into the posterior pouch. Upon release of lateral adhesions, a marked increase in the ROM of the condyle occurs immediately. There is one critical observation the author has made over thousands of procedures performed. Medial wall synovitis is, in many instances, related to the inflammation of the insertion of the superior belly of the lateral pterygoid, causing myalgia, restricted ROM of the mandible, and pain.

# 53.9.2.2 Lateral Recess Adhesions

Lateral adhesions can be identified only during the diagnostic arthroscopic examination. Typically, the patients with lateral adhesions present with posttraumatic restricted ROM, essentially negative disc mechanical problems, and negative arthritic changes. During the diagnostic sweep, when the scope is contoured toward the front, the mechanical obstruction encountered will

prohibit the advancement of the arthroscope. This blocking fibrotic adhesion in the lateral recess is part of an adhesive phenomenon that restricts translation. In most cases, it occurs at the peak or anterior portion of the articular eminence. A partial eclipse of the arthroscopic view will become apparent on the monitor, indicative of bending of the arthroscope. Excessive bending of the instrument can break or dislodge the lens, rendering the scope unusable. In order to access this particular pathology, the second puncture is positioned at the posterior limit of the adhesion. When a blunt probe lysis does not suffice, a small motorized

whisker shaver will perform a débridement of fragments of adhesions from the joint. If necessary, bipolar electrocautery or laser will execute the lysis of more resilient fragments. The release of lateral adhesions facilitates an immediate increase in the ROM.

# 53.9.3 Intra-Articular Medications

# 53.9.3.1 Steroids

Before the advent of arthroscopy, intra-articular steroids were injected via blind technique. The double

puncture arthroscopic technique, however, has made possible the injection of medications specifically targeting various anatomic articular sites. The authors do not recommend routine blind intra-articular injections without performing diagnostic arthroscopy. In the past, some beneficial results have been shown in cases of marked synovitis and/or marked redundancy, particularly in stage III and IV medial wall synovitis. This author's experience and research support the theory that medial wall synovitis is related to inflammation of the insertion of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid, which, in turn, causes restricted opening pain. The benefit of the steroid injection is the reduction of muscular

irritation and spasm, thus decreasing joint pain with function. For localized hyperemia, targeted deposition of steroids can be done using a spinal needle through the operative cannula. With generalized synovitis, a steroid "flush" of the joint space can be performed.

# 53.9.3.2 Botulinum Toxin A

The positive therapeutic effect of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) on functional disorders and symptomatology in connection with the treatment of cervical dystonia is very well documented. The later studies of von Lindern, Israel, Mendes, and others have explored local injection of Botox as treatment method for chronic facial pain associated with hyperactivity of the masticatory muscles, with promising outcomes. Some literature described targeted deposition of Botox into the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle through the overlying synovium. Botox spreads about  $1\mathrm{cm}$  circumferentially from the injection site, so by inserting the needle past the synovium overlying the superior belly of the lateral pterygoid, it is expected to reach its target.

# 53.9.3.3 Hyaluronic Acid

This polysaccharide of the glucosaminoglycans family is a component of many extracellular tissues including synovial fluid and cartilage. It is a product of the articular chondro- and synoviocytes. The concept behind TMJ injection of hyaluronate is the stimulation of the endogenous synthesis of hyaluronic acid by the exogenous hyaluronic acid. Hyalgan is a 500 to  $730\mathrm{kDa}$  molecular weight fraction of highly purified avian

sodium hyaluronate buffered  $(\mathrm{pH}6.8 - 7.5)$  in physiologic saline. This author believes hyaluronate to be an excellent intra-articular lubricating agent that facilitates navigation during arthroscopy while minimizing iatrogenic intra-articular injury (scuffing).

# 53.9.4 Débridement

There are instances when adhesions cannot be overcome with the probe or the breaking of adhesions results in fragments tenaciously attached to the walls. A motorized whisker shaver is then used to débride these fragments. Sometimes, it is necessary to use an alternating sequence of whisker shaver and coblator electrocautery to first desiccate and then remove some of the more resilient fragments. In the absence of the débridement, there is a high chance of postoperative crepitation in the area.

# 53.9.5 Synovectomy

The most effective technique of reduction of redundant synovium is bipolar electrocautery. Redundant synovium most often occurs in the posterior pouch, especially after disc reduction procedures. Occasionally, it may be encountered in the anterior recess. Hypervascularity and redundancy can effectively be reduced by means of coblator electrocautery. The synovial clinical response is shrinkage and a change in color from bright red to off white or even a light brown. On occasion, the synovial tissue cauterized and desiccated fragments fail to vaporize with bipolar electrocautery. For these situations, the Ho:YAG laser will effectively perform the synovectomy.

# 53.9.6 Anterior Release

Conditions such as chronic disc dislocation, fibrosis, adhesive bands, or pseudowall formation can obliterate the disc-synovial crease. Using a blunt probe, a lysis procedure is performed, if necessary, in the anterior recess until the entire disc-synovial crease can be visualized from medial to lateral. Just before commencing the release, the disc-synovial crease is confirmed with a hook probe. If the crease is not properly identified, iatrogenic disc perforation may occur during the anterior release procedure. If the anteroposterior disc dimension appears adequate and a relatively normal disc shape is ascertained, the release starts in the medial one-half of the disc-synovial crease (Fig. 53.83). Using an Ho:YAG laser, the synovial capsule is incised just anterior and parallel to the anterior margin of the disc (Fig. 53.84). The surgeon observes the muscle fibers inserting into the disc and capsule. Dissection should be

performed to a depth no greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  or until the anterior band is freely mobile and without tethering (Fig. 53.85). Caution must be observed when making the myotomy at the most anteromedial corner. When the anteromedial synovial drape is incised at the junction with the disc (Fig. 53.86), an artery, approximately 1 to  $2\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter, is usually found directly subjacent to the junction. Arthroscopically, it appears as a white tubular structure. If this vessel is inadvertently incised, copious intra-articular hemorrhaging will occur. This vessel cannot be cauterized or tied off by any current means. To tamponade the bleeder, all instruments must be removed and constant lateral pressure maintained on the joint for 5 minutes by the clock, while the condyle is held in a forward and contralateral position. The puncture techniques are then repeated and the joint is lavaged

and suctioned free of clots. No further releasing is done in that area and the release is completed laterally. Identification of this artery will avoid this problem and the myotomy can be carefully completed around the artery. The other potential bleeding points encountered in this sculpted lateral pterygoid can be relatively easily controlled with bipolar cautery. The lateral one-third to two-thirds of the anterior release may be performed more expeditently with less concern for hemorrhage. One of the concerns with an excessively deep anterior release is that of avascular necrosis that has been documented on postoperative MRIs. The most plausible explanation for this complication is that the fibers inserting in the pterygoid fovea (of the condyle) have been transected,

causing subsequent venous congestion in the condylar head and, ultimately, changes on the MRI. In light of these observations, this author surmises that the myotomy should be confined to a depth of  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , to only release the superior head insertion. The message here is to always err on the conservative side.

# 53.9.7 Disc Reduction

Once the anterior release is achieved, the disc reduced in the anatomic position. To begin the reduction, the blunt probe is introduced and passed posteriorly by contouring the intermediate zone. Simultaneously, the condyle is distracted anteriorly and to the contralateral side. Once the probe is positioned in the posterolateral recess, the retrodiscal tissues are depressed in a posteroinferior direction. Disc reduction should be felt by the surgeon and confirmed arthroscopically. The disc is held in reduced position with the probe and the working cannula, while the scope is retracted to a lateral position. Then the probe pressure is released in order to ascertain passive reduction/positioning of the disc in the anatomic position.

# 53.9.8 Posterior Scarification/Cauterization

Once the disc reduction is achieved, an increased amount of redundant synovium is noted in the retrodiscal flexure. Even with minor disc repositioning procedures and less evidence of redundancy of posterior synovium, in the absence of discopexy, this procedure should be performed. Special consideration should be given to this step in the APS procedure. Postoperative MRIs have shown thickening of the retrodiscal tissue in a number of cases. This author's extensive experience has confirmed the most plausible theory explaining this occurrence as a certitude. It is mostly the inadequate ablation and, to a much lesser extent, the hypertrophic scar that cause the postoperative redundancy of the retrodiscal tissue. Typically, a "reefing" phenomenon occurs, in which the retrodiscal tissue is bunched up and needs to be reduced in bulk with cautery. If not, this fairly large amount of tissue can fibrose during healing. During postoperative settling, the disc may then be displaced by this potential space-occupying tissue. Retrodiscal ablation should, therefore, be performed until a normal-shaped retrodiscal flexure (Figs. 53.87 and 53.88). The inflamed synovium is cauterized and the areas of excess tissue bulk ablated with electrocautery, laser, or both. Deep electrocautery of the oblique protuberance should then be performed. An examination of the anterior and posterior pouches is then completed.

Fig. 53.88 Posterior Scarification (After)

# 53.9.9 Disc Function

Before making the decision to exit the TMJ, joint mechanics have to be reascertained. If disc reduction is inadequate or clicking is noted, the anterior release is revisited with the blunt probe. If tethering is observed, it is most likely in the medial muscle insertion area or in the most lateral extent of the crease. Once the anterior release is extended, disc function is rechecked. If clicking persists or the disc position does not present satisfactory stability, the discopexy procedure needs to be seriously contemplated.

# 53.9.9.1 Arthroscopic Discopexy

The prevalence of displaced TMJ disc with or without reduction among asymptomatic individuals has been reported to be as high as  $33\%$ . In asymptomatic internal derangements, retrodiscal tissue may demonstrate an adaptive capacity to form pseudo-disc in response to

functional loads. However, a restoration of a normal condyle-disc relationship may be necessary for symptomatic internal derangements to arrest the natural course of osteoarthritis. Arthroscopic discopexy is an advanced arthroscopic technique which restores functional intra-articular anatomy. This technique addresses both the reducing and the nonreducing disc.

# 53.9.9.2 Discopexy Technique Placement of the Suture Passing Needle

First, the position of the disc must be carefully examined. In the case of the nonreducing disc, anterior release and posterior cauterization are performed in the same fashion described previously to facilitate the reduction of the disc. The reducing disc may not require these additional procedures as the disc may already be in an acceptable position.

The surgeon reduces the disc with a blunt probe through the operative cannula while the condyle is positioned forward. Once the ideal position of the disc is achieved, the surgeon hands the assistant the blunt probe to keep the disc reduced. The ideal place for placement of suture is between the middle and the medial third of the disc. Next, the arthroscope is swiveled into the lateral recess, and the vector technique is applied to determine the exact point of entry of the suture passing the needle through the skin. The scope is positioned in the lateral recess directly lateral to the posterior band of the disc. This location will correlate with the lateral pole of the condyle. The depth of the scope is noted, and then using an empty cannula, this distance is marked off on the skin at this point. The suture passing needle enters the skin at this point. An 18-gauge  $1\frac{1}{4}$ -inch needle threaded with a single 1-0 polydioxanone suture is passed perpendicular to the skin and advanced until the lateral pole of the condyle is palpated with the needle. The needle tip is then "walked" superiorly until it slides off the head of the condyle (Fig. 53.89). An upward bulging of the posterior band will be noted at the point where the needle is passing through the disc. The suture passing needle is redirected to engage approximately  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of posterior band tissue. The needle tip is advanced and observed in the greatest concavity of the fossa. This area provides the greatest accessibility for suture retrieval.

# Placement of the Suture Catching Needle

A straight needle from the meniscus mender II meniscal repair system (Smith & Nephew) is passed percutaneously from the preauricular skin crease at the level of the pinna. The meniscus mender set consists of an interchangeable obturator and a lasso-type suture retriever. Once it enters the skin, the mender is advanced anteromedially and toward the maximum concavity of the glenoid fossa. As it enters the superior joint space, the mender should avoid incorporation of the disc. The

scope is fixed on the greatest concavity of the glenoid fossa, and once the mender is visualized, it is positioned in close proximity to the suture passing needle (Fig. 53.90). At this point, the stylet is removed, and the suture retriever is inserted. The lasso retriever is slipped over the straight needle, and the needle is advanced (Fig. 53.91). The suture is advanced through the suture passing needle and retrieved with the lasso (Figs. 53.92 and 53.93). The suture passing needle and the meniscus mender are removed, leaving the two free ends of the sutures exiting the skin.

$\square$  Fig. 53.89 Technique of placement of the suture passing needle

# Retrograde Passing of the Anterior Suture End

Two stab incisions are placed along the suture exit points with a no. 11 blade. Using a fine straight hemostat, blunt dissection is performed adjacent to the suture ends down to the joint capsule. Using a no. 3 half-circle, tapered, French spring-eye needle, the anterior suture is passed back down its needle tract to the capsule. The suture needle is then redirected posterior-superiorly along the extracapsular fatty tissue. The tip should merge in the center of the superior blunt dissection wound and is retrieved with an Adson. The passing of the needle through the middle of both blunt dissections is a very deliberate move, avoiding any impingement on epidermal or dermal tissue layers. If impingement occurs, a dimple in the skin will be noted and a less ideal disc traction results. This may also lead to frontal branch impingement. The suture is tied down in the extracapsular fatty tissue (Fig. 53.94). Once the knot has been cinched down for the first time, the condyle is seated by the assistant and the knot is cinched down again. Additional ties are placed in the suture, and the suture is trimmed at the knot. The skin incisions are closed with a single interrupted suture.

# Arthroscopic Rigid Disc Fixation

Rigid disc fixation is a triple-puncture technique in which the disc is fixated to the posterolateral pole of the condyle using a screw. The third cannula is placed in the preauricular crease into the joint space. The disc is reduced with a blunt probe through the second operative cannula. Then, the TMJ disc and condyle complex are secured using a screw. Historically, OsteoMed  $2\mathrm{mm}$  cannulated screw, the Linvatec bicortical "smart-nail," and the inion screw have been used.

![](images/19dc50c027420369896ee370ee49491d6e6c578a67d3f0a8bc3b129b158ea0b6.jpg)

Fig. 53.94 Suture discopexy closure

This technique exhibits several advantages over the suture technique. First, the disc is rigidly fixated to the condyle, which allows immediate postoperative physical therapy. This may reduce the incidence of hemarthrosis and subsequent arthrofibrosis. Second, this is a more user-friendly technique without the use of multiple-suture passing and capturing needles. Because of the lack of suture along the course of the facial nerve, there is less incidence of nerve injury. Lastly, there is a considerable decrease in the level of postoperative pain.

Despite all the advantages, the rigid fixation technique resulted almost consistently in postoperative malocclusion. In the majority of situations, a resolution was achieved between 2 and 8 weeks. Unfortunately, a small number of cases with irretractable malocclusion had to undergo subsequent open discectomy. Wilkes IV cases with decreased intra-articular space were especially susceptible to this side effect. The "smart nail," extrapolated from orthopedic surgical technique, was oversized, often transfixating the condyle. The inion screw demonstrated significant cavitation defects in cases associated with severe synovitis. Because of these disadvantages, the nonrigid technique using a suture is a preferred method at this time. The rigid disc fixation, however, remains a solid option for all Wilkes II and III situations, in which adequate disc shape and joint volume are still present.

# 53.10 Postoperative Patient Management

# 53.10.1 General Anesthesia Considerations

When deciding the anesthesia plan for the patients with TMJ, special attention must be directed to the patient's airway assessment. Temporomandibular joint disorder patients often present with a limited mouth,

but trismus secondary to pain must be differentiated from ankylosis or mechanical obstruction. Awake fiberoptic intubation is the preferred method in the latter case. Generally, nasoendotracheal intubation is recommended in both arthrocentesis and arthroscopy to effectively manipulate the mandible during the surgery. The teeth must be in occlusion when the surgeon is attempting to enter into the anterior recess with an arthroscope.

Once the surgery is completed, the patient must be awakened with minimal coughing and bucking. The spastic perimandibular muscular contractions secondary to the gag reflex, in patients who have undergone suture discopexy, may result in the suture tearing through the disc. If the anesthesia team is amenable, deep extubation is recommended to prevent this complication. The surgeon should also carefully observe the patient during extubation and apply pressure over the surgical sites to minimize jaw movement.

# 53.10.2 Analgesia/Pain Management

Intravenous or intramuscular administration of Toradol is a consideration before extubation for a smooth transition from general anesthesia to intravenous or oral analgesia. A regimen of oral Toradol, if tolerated, is instituted for the next 5 to 7 days, with class III narcotic analgesics for breakthrough pain, in the majority of cases. If a chronic pain provider is managing the patient, a prior arrangement on the pain medication regimen is recommended. A consultation with an acute pain service may be necessary for those with intractable immediate postoperative pain.

# 53.10.3 Anti-Inflammatory Management

Regardless of the positive effects of Toradol administered by the previously mentioned protocol, patients are receiving tapered doses of intravenous/oral steroids for the next 18 to 24 hours postoperatively. On occasion, the patient diagnosed with osteoarthritis may be prescribed a longer (up to 4 weeks) regimen of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

# 53.10.4 Antibiotics

Every patient receives a preoperative dose of intravenous cephalexin (Keflex) or clindamycin in a penicillin-allergic patient with the continuation of intravenous antibiotics in the patients who remain in the hospital for postoperative observation or pain control. Patients treated with discopexy are bridged from intravenous to

oral cephalexin (Keflex) for no more than 8 to 10 days, in the absence of intolerance or allergic reactions.

# 53.10.5 Diet

The full liquid diet is advanced to a strictly soft diet in a very gradual fashion. The expected transitional malocclusion, usually with posterior in occlusion, is a period of intra-articular settling that has to occur in an undisturbed environment. This critical postoperative transition to norm-occlusion cannot be encroached upon by an accelerated return to function or parafunction. The importance of an appropriate orthotic for this postoperative period cannot be overemphasized. The description of the occlusal splint falls beyond the scope of this chapter. It is sufficient to emphasize that all patients wear a soft splint for 6 to 8 weeks after the surgery.

# 53.11 Postoperative Rehabilitation

There are specific situations in which the patient benefits from the help of the therapist, mainly cases that have very slow progress, no progress at all, or the opposite. Routine referral to a physical therapist is not necessary as long as the patients adhere to the following strict physical therapy regimen postoperatively. The table in Fig. 53.95 addresses the stages of rehabilitation, specific objectives, and exercises.

# 53.11.1 Stage I Physiotherapy

Physical therapy is imperative to prevent cicatricial tissue formation within the joint space after any TMJ surgery. Stage I rehabilitation focuses on reducing discomfort, pain, spasms, and inflammation (mainly swelling). Stage I exercises consist of limited ROM exercises and gentle isometrics. This regimen is recommended in patients with articular disc disorder treated with suture discopexy and hypermobility patients treated with retrodiscal tissue scarification.

The entire physiotherapy is performed slowly and comfortably, short of any sharp pain. Regardless of the results of postoperative manipulation under anesthesia, the patients will typically only hinge-open 10 to  $20\mathrm{mm}$  (one finger width). The target of the stage I PT is for the patient to open two finger widths  $(30 - 35\mathrm{mm})$ . Patients are asked to set their passive physical therapy device at  $35\mathrm{mm}$  to perform their exercises. The following exercises are performed in a series of 20 repetitions each four times a day. Patients are educated to feel the rotation of the joint, avoiding excessive translation. Hypermobility patients who can open more than two finger widths are

<table><tr><td>Stage</td><td>Goal</td><td>Exercises</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>Maintain mobility and strength</td><td>1. Limited active vertical opening, right and left excursion and protrusion
2. Isometrics in neutral</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>Increase range of motion</td><td>1. Active assisted exercises (guided by hand) to opening
2. Left and/or right side excursion
3. Protrusion</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>Smooth active range of motion without deviation or asymmetry</td><td>1. Feel for deviation in rotation, translation, and protrusion

2. Side excursion
3. Protrusion</td></tr></table>

$\square$  Fig. 53.95 Rehabilitation stages, goals, and exercises

generally asked to limit their mouth opening to  $35\mathrm{mm}$  during this delicate time of recovery. Lateral excursion exercises are performed with a finger on the incisor teeth and moving jaw tooth to tooth. Protrusion exercises involve only lining up of the anterior dentition. One way to characterize excursion exercises in stage I is "just-to-border" ROM. Isometrics are accomplished by gentle resistance to the elevators and depressors of the mandible in all excursions, with tongue in the palate and slightly in occlusion. Stage I PT is performed for at least 2 weeks postoperatively.

# 53.11.2 Stage II Physiotherapy

The obvious goal of stage II PT is to increase ROM with stretching exercises, using intraoral manipulation. The joint is stretched into the rotation, translation, protrusion, lateral excursion, and longitudinal distraction, in order to prevent the development of adhesions and/or muscle rigidity/shortening. Hypomobility and fibrous ankylosis patients treated with TMJ arthroscopy skip stage I physiotherapy and initiate stage II physiotherapy immediately after the surgery to ensure maintaining any increase in MIO achieved during the operation.

PT stage II follows the same basic philosophy and frequency as described for stage I. Patients should feel stretching and some discomfort, short of sharp pain or ripping sensation. The following are time-tested PT exercises allowing the patient to maintain and increase ROM. The "contract-relax" is an opening exercise consisting of attempting maximal intermaxillary opening while using a hand to resist opening and closing isometrically and then opening a little farther. In the "hook-pull," another opening exercise, the patient hooks the index around the menton attempting maximal MIO and then giving a gentle pull. The most effective opening exercise is "prybar." The patient places each pollicis on the incisal margins of the anterior maxillary dentition and each index or middle finger on the antagonist mandibular dentition. The MIO is gently increased by assisting the end motion (prying the mouth open). To increase the ROM of excursions, the exercises described for stage I are performed in a "past borders" fashion. The unilateral surgery cases require more patient education in performing the PT assignments because stretching a joint past the point of restriction, especially in the opposite direction dictated by the contralateral working condyle, has a certain learning curve from the patient's perspective.

# 53.11.3 Stage III Physiotherapy

Stage III PT consists of muscle reeducation. The patient is assessed for asymmetry or interruptions in motion, overstretching, and/or inappropriate movement patterns. Because stage II has already addressed the possible ROM problems, adequate joint mobility should be present. Nevertheless, the patients continue with the entire gamut of earlier stages of PT, while making neuromuscular progress in order to ensure the maintenance of ROM. Patients learn to correct vertical opening, protrusion, and lateral excursion movements with the goal of fostering appropriate function. Correction of asymmetries is achieved by an increased perception of "internal cues" (correction of restrictions and deviations using fingers and tongue as guides). Visual input (mirrors) is discouraged. Opening deviations are corrected by opening to the point of deviation/excessive translation and using a hand on the contralateral side to resist the incorrect motion. Once the initial correction is achieved, the tongue takes over by inserting the apex into the palate and controlling vertical opening without deviation. Also, isometric and isotonic exercises are performed opposite the deviation, at the particular point in the ROM at which the deviation occurs.

# 53.11.4 Stage IV Physiotherapy

The goal of stage IV PT is to progressively strengthen the mastication musculature until the return of full functional ROM, and premorbid diet is reached. Isotonic and isometric exercises are performed throughout the entire ROM. Close monitoring of the patient will prevent the development of synovitis and myositis. Prevention of injury by loading in the extremes of motion is implemented. Advancement of diet is also monitored closely in order to prevent accelerated detrimental progress.

The importance of postoperative physical therapy cannot be overemphasized. Adherence to the prescribed regimen will determine the outcome of TMJ arthroscopy.

# 53.12 Complications of TMJ Arthroscopic Surgery

# 53.12.1 Damage to Cranial Nerve VII and Facial Palsy/Atony

Paresis of the facial nerve occurs in approximately  $0.6\%$  of procedures for TMJ arthroscopy [1-3]. Invariably, these patients had undergone open arthrotomy before

the minimally invasive procedure. This is suggestive of scarring of the preauricular tissues, causing an added amount of pressure on the nerve branches from joint distention. The incidence of facial nerve injury is lower in the diagnostic TMJ arthroscopy technique, whereas multiple-puncture techniques for discopexy and advanced debridement increases the risk of this complication. When approaching the TMJ for a glenoid fossa portal puncture, the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve is located anterior, whereas it is found posterior to an operative cannula puncture. However, the zygomatic branch may be in jeopardy with the operative cannula puncture.

The injury to the frontotemporal branch manifests as atony of the orbicularis oculi and the frontal division of the occipitofrontalis, translated in the partial ability to elevate the eyebrow and to completely occlude the superior palpebral, both in the immediate postoperative period. A definite diagnosis is made 24 hours postoperatively. Typically, the duration of signs varies between 1 week and 6 months. An additional mechanism of injury for cranial nerve VII is the extravasation phenomenon with/without hematoma formation. Misplacement of the irrigating cannula or overpressure joint lavage can force solutions beyond the confines of the capsule into the adjacent tissues. The immense undisputed majority of incidents involving cranial nerve VII are compressive in nature, in which injuries include both mechanical deforming forces and ischemic factors. Cranial nerve VII injuries associated with TMJ arthroscopy generally have a good prognosis for restitutio ad integrum of function.

# 53.12.2 Damage to the Collaterals of Cranial Nerve V (Auriculotemporal [ATN], Lingual, or Inferior Alveolar Paresthesia)

The incidence of cranial nerve V damage is less than  $1\%$ , but it has been reported to be higher than the frequency of the cranial nerve VII injury  $(0.6\%)$  [1-3]. It typically presents as postoperative anesthesia along the distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve, which spontaneously resolves within 2 weeks. No hyper- or dysesthesia has been reported. The ATN, along with the superficial temporal artery and vein, is posterior but in close proximity to the fossa puncture site. This complication stems in placement too far posterior of the fossa portal as a consequence of operator concern for cranial nerve VII damage. When the lingual nerve is concerned, the most immediate proximity to the mandibular condyle report comes from Johansson [4]. On an extensive cadaver study, the mandibular nerve was dissected running verti

cally from foramen ovale at approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the foramen. It then divided into the inferior alveolar and lingual rami, with the later passing  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the condyle. The nerve can be injured if the operator is not very cognizant of the intra-articular anatomy and perforates the drape at a distance of more than  $35\mathrm{mm}$  from the tegument. Another possibility is the medial extravasation of irrigation fluid secondary to medial capsular perforation without a correct irrigation system, also involving the inferior alveolar nerve. Hyperesthesia of the infraorbital nerve is associated with long operative time, excessive volumes of irrigation fluid, and extravasation of irrigant into the medial tissues. The condition is self-limiting because the fluid is resorbed into the lymphatic and venous systems. Extravasation is prevented by careful puncture technique, observation of the surgical site, gentle pressure to irrigation, and a patent inflow/outflow system.

The arthroscope should not advance more than  $20 - 25\mathrm{mm}$  with the initial fossa puncture.

# 53.12.3 Damage to Cranial Nerve VIII and Vestibulocochlear Dysfunction

Tympanic membrane perforation and ossicle disruption in the middle ear has been reported, including otitis media with subsequent hypoacousia. The mechanism of entry into the middle ear is through either the osseous or soft tissue external auditory meatus. In addition to the iatrogenic injury, the arthroscopists must be aware of the presence of the foramen of Huschke, also known as the foramen tympanicum. It is an anatomical variation, where the anterior wall of the EAC is absent, connecting the EAC to the TMJ. The prevalence of this defect has been reported to be  $4.6 - 20\%$  [5-7]. All the patients undergoing TMJ surgery must obtain a facial CT to rule out this anatomic variation. If the tympanic membrane is perforated and the ossicles appear in the view field, immediate cessation of the procedure and intraoperative ENT consultation is warranted. The ossicles have a classic melted-wax appearance. If no manipulation is performed, the incidence of permanent disruption of ossicles is low, and the complication will be limited to the tympanic membrane. Small perforations in the anterior or inferior portions of the tympanum typically cause minimal hearing loss and heal uneventfully, without sequelae. Posterior tympanic injuries may dislocate the ossicles and potentially result in more significant loss of hearing. All perforations involving more than  $30\%$  of the tympanum surface or the posterior portion of it should be managed by an ENT. Postoperative complaints of severe hearing loss and/or vertigo alert the surgeon for a possible middle ear injury, and an ENT

referral should not be delayed. Laceration of the external auditory meatus occurs by transfixion of the canal with the arthroscope at the junction of the tragus and osseous meatus. Minor hemorrhage is controlled with bipolar cautery, while the external auditory meatus is treated with hydrocortisone suspension drops for up to 2 weeks. If granulation tissue develops at the osseous/ cartilaginous junction, bipolar cautery is employed. Baldursson and Blackmer have suggested the existence of a correlation between specific sensorineural hearing loss, with a predictable decrease in hearing levels at the 1000 to  $2000\mathrm{Hz}$  range, and TMJ dysfunction and/or parafunction [8]. All patients regained normal hearing levels within 2 months postoperatively. This confirms the fact that arthroscopy does not affect hearing levels if no direct trauma to the middle ear has occurred. Close consideration of the detail of not advancing the scope past 20 to  $25\mathrm{mm}$  without accurately checking its position will prevent the occurrence of this complication.

# 53.12.4 Scuffing of Fibrocartilage

The cartilage covering the eminence and fossa is most prone to iatrogeny, the most common arthroscopic complication. At the time of insufflation, the needle point is directed toward the posterior slope of the eminence, making contact with the fibrocartilage. Also, examination sweeps of the joint cavity, involving translation of arthroscope along with cannula, could also release pieces of cartilage into the superior joint space. If scuffing becomes significant, it impairs visibility during arthroscopic procedures to the point of misdiagnosis of chondromalacia by the inexperienced arthroscopist.

# 53.12.5 Damage to the Maxillary Artery/ Collaterals with or without Formation of Arteriovenous Fistula

As it courses medial to the condylar neck, the artery was found immediately lateral to the lateral pterygoid in two-thirds of reviewed cases. This author has encountered this complication, resulting in one isolated case of left pterygoid arteriovenous fistula (AVF).

# 53.12.6 Damage to the Superficial Temporal Vessels with or Without Formation of AVF

Whether profuse or not, all cases of hemorrhage from the superficial temporal artery and vein intimately related to the posterior aspect of the joint capsule were

managed uneventfully by applying controlled pressure. Other authors have reported the formation of an AVF. Typically, the patient complains of a constant "hissing" or "whishing" sound over the operated TMJ. The fistulctomy and subsequent embolization of the superficial temporal artery were uneventful.

# 53.12.7 Perforation of the Glenoid Fossa

As previously discussed under "danger areas," this complication can be consistently avoided by directing the instruments toward the tubercle and away from the fossa. Most violations of the middle cranial fossa will result in cerebrospinal fluid leaks that resolve spontaneously. Should the leak persist in the wound or through the incision, a pressure dressing is applied, and the patient is hospitalized with head elevation. Persistence of leak after 48 hours mandates neurosurgical consult and lumbar subarachnoid drain placement. Head CT with bone windows is obtained to document the site. Surgical dural neurorrhaphy is very uncommon.

# 53.12.8 Damage to the Disc

Repairs of the meniscus result in a fibrous tissue seal of the surfaces as seen arthroscopically. Core biopsies have shown minimal tissue reaction at the area of repair, consisting of fibrous cell repair with sparse vasculature. There is minimal collagen formation at the repair state and no collagen penetration or angioproliferation into the substance of the repaired meniscus. All needle punctures are filled in and smooth with the meniscus surface 12 weeks postoperatively. Exposed nonresorbable sutures are covered with translucent fibrous tissue. The cellular response to meniscal tears stems in four potential sources: the adjacent synovium, the capsule vascularity, the intra-articular microhemorrhage, and the free synovial cells. The adjacent synovium contributes angioblastic and cellular tissue for peripheral meniscal tears. The synovium proliferates in the area and migrates over the disc in a similar way to the pannus noticed on articular cartilage defects. Tears in the lateral one-third of the meniscus have abundant vascularity for hemorrhage and angioblastic proliferation. The avascular portion of the disc presents fibrous tissue healing response 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively.

# 53.12.9 Hemarthrosis

Hemarthrosis is a consequence of laceration of the superficial temporal artery and vein and severely inflamed synovium/retrodiscal tissue upon entry, as well

as laceration of the pterygoid artery during myotomy for anterior release procedures. Hemorrhage can be significant enough to cause abortion of procedure. When pressure irrigation cannot tamponade the hemorrhage (despite some clearing of the surgical field), the joint remains congested, prolonging the healing, increasing postoperative discomfort, and extending recovery time. While the intra-articular coagulum organizes, it increases the risk of formation of adhesive bands and scarring, reflected clinically in fibrous ankylosis. This results in a limited range of motion of the mandible in all excursions (vertical, protrusive, and lateral). The interincisal opening will be less than  $35\mathrm{mm}$  while the lateral and protrusive movements are in excess of  $6\mathrm{mm}$ . The following protocol is utilized when excessive hemorrhage is encountered:

1. The pressure in the irrigation bag is increased.  
2. A small amount of Healon  $(0.5\mathrm{mL})$  is injected intraarticularly.  
3. Cautery/laser is applied to the bleeding area.  
4. Using a 31/2 inch spinal needle on a  $3\mathrm{mL}$  syringe, passed through the cannula into the affected area, a small amount of local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor is administered directly into the bleeding site.  
5. De novo insufflation of the joint with a local anesthetic, transcannula (2% lidocaine 1/100,000 epinephrine) should tamponade the hemorrhage.  
6. The entire joint is insufflated under pressure, with irrigation fluid, while all cannulas are obturated for 5 minutes for the hydrostatic pressure to achieve tamponade of the site.  
7. Should all previous measures be unsuccessful, all the instruments are removed from the joint and direct palmar or digital external pressure is applied for 5 minutes by the clock. For added pressure, the condyle is seated in the fossa, particularly if the source of bleeding is located in the posterior pouch. If the source is in the anterior pouch, the mandible is manipulated to a protrusive position. The instruments are then reinserted in their original portals, and the condition of the joint is reassessed.  
8. A no. 4 catheter balloon is inserted through the working portal and inflated with normal saline. It is left in place for 5 minutes, and then deflated, and the joint is reassessed.  
9. If all measures were rendered unsuccessful, the joint is approached via open technique.

# 53.12.10 Infection

Infection is rare as a result of proper sterilization, sterile operating environment, forgiving high vascular tissues, antibiotic therapy, and high-volume of irrigation. The presentation is with erythematous puncture sites with

surrounding edematous halos 3 to 5 days postoperatively. Administration of cephalexin for 7 days resolves the problem. Preoperative cephalexin (with the alternative for erythromycin in penicillin-allergic patients) is administered at recommended doses. The intravenous antibiotics are continued while in-patient status is maintained. Oral antibiotics are continued for 7 days in discopexy patients with hardware placement.

# 53.12.11 Non-infectious Postoperative Effusions

Non-infections postoperative effusions present with preauricular edema, with a higher level of tenderness to palpation than normally encountered postoperatively. The patients were managed with a soft diet, joint rest, and application of heat over the affected area. NSAIDs were prescribed as needed. Uneventful, complete resolution of symptoms was evident at 4 weeks postoperatively. If an effusion is persistent after 6 weeks, it can be aspirated. If that fails, a steroid injection is administered as the last nonsurgical modality. Caution should be exercised to avoid misdiagnosis of this condition because some effusions develop a few weeks/months after the surgery. Those are an indication of the progression of degenerative disease.

# 53.12.12 Instrument Failure/Loose Bodies

Instrument failure can be attributed to manufacturing defects, misuse, and wear of parts of the instrument itself, all potentially leading to breakage. Backup instruments, including the arthroscope, are mandatory while performing arthroscopy. The surgeon should test all instruments with flexible parts before introduction in the joint (including OnPoint scope, trocar/cannula, scissors, biopsy forceps). Application of excessive force, extreme bending of the scope, especially when negotiating access to the most anterolateral aspect of the superior joint compartment to determine the site for the second puncture, can cause damage or breakage to the optical system and need for replacement or repair. The "golden rules" include the following: never force an instrument; use ferromagnetic instruments; always have a "golden retriever" available; avoid force in removing the instruments; and confirm that every movable instrument is closed before removal. In the case of such an inadvertent event occurrence, a standard protocol has been established:

1. Stop the procedure while maintaining the position of the arthroscope and working cannulas.  
2. Keep the instrument or foreign body in view.

3. Check the inflow bags to confirm sufficient irrigation fluid remains in order for the joint to be maintained distended at all times.  
4. Record and measure the depth of the instrument with a scored cannula.  
5. Have adequate removal instruments available, including extras.  
6. Adjust inflow to ensure optimal visibility.  
7. Take a radiograph of the joint if the instrument cannot be located arthroscopically.  
8. Consider fluoroscopic assistance.  
9. Remove the fragment/object.  
10. When using a grabber, tips may not fit in the working cannula upon removal. It may be desirable to step up the working cannula to a  $3\mathrm{mm}$  diameter, using a "switch stick," and then perform the retrieval maneuvers. If the instrument cannot be retrieved, the next arthroscopic attempt should be made in the early postoperative phase (10 days to no longer than 6 weeks postoperative). Should this second attempt fail, the doctor and the patient must review all possible outcomes associated with leaving the foreign body as is. The possibility/likelihood of future osteoarthritis or foreign body reaction must be very well understood by the patient.

# Key Points

1. TMJ arthroscopy is a safe procedure with a low complication rate when performed properly by an experienced arthroscopist.  
2. The incidence of the facial nerve injury is  $0.6\%$  with the majority of cases being temporary.  
3. Routine otoscopic examination is recommended for all patients undergoing TMJ arthroscopy and arthrocentesis.  
4. Immediate specialty consultation is warranted when glenoid fossa or middle ear perforation is noted intraoperatively.

# Conclusion

This chapter contains rather overwhelming information for the reader, whether a resident training in our specialty or a seasoned specialist. One of the points we have, time and time again, made over the years is that training in this particular aspect of our specialty is inadequate. Henceforth, it is not our intention to dissuade the oral surgeon from pursuing training in this specific aspect of our specialty, but the contrary. By writing this chapter, we hope to make the readership aware of how underrated this subspecialty is in reality.

Throughout our formation as maxillofacial surgeons, we have self-trained to give particular consideration to minute detail. This author has designed the office arthroscopy procedure banking on this particular trait of character of the OMS. It is one of the products of almost 30 years of experience in the field of arthroscopy. The surgical procedure has been refined and simplified to prevent the surgeon from thinking the arthroscopy is complicated and inefficient. Whereas the advanced arthroscopist does need to possess not only skill but also a certain personality to develop the interest in perfecting her or his knowledge and technique, the office-based arthroscopy is designed in such a manner that makes it feasible and predictable in the hands of all OMSs. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, the lysis and lavage procedure will resolve the acute TMJ-related symptomatology in  $65\%$  to  $70\%$  of patients. Performed arthroscopically, this procedure provides valuable visual information and makes the surgeon comfortable with basic arthroscopic maneuvers. We feel most surgeons will develop the interest to make the progression to advanced arthroscopy once confident at this level.

The second major point we are making at the end of this chapter is the importance of the arthroscopic cascade. This concept is also a product of this author's vast experience. The results of treating TMJ disorders based on this concept have shown impressive percentages of success. These results have been published numerous times over the past few years. The predictability of achieving success in the arthroscopic treatment of Wilkes stages I to V disease dramatically decreased the necessity for traditional "open-joint" surgery. Although many reputed academicians of OMS will retort by showing numbers revealing success with open technique, ultimately culminating with a total joint replacement, we should bear in mind that, as successful as it may be, the final treatment (i.e., total joint) is the end point of TMJ surgical therapy. It is the strong belief of this author that the TMJ surgeon should not indiscriminately stampede to the final treatment. One of the characters that brought Clint Eastwood to stardom, inspector Harry Callahan a.k.a. "Dirty Harry," often used to state that "A man's gotta know his limitations!" As TMJ surgeons, we need to accept the idea that we are managing an existing problem and not curing a disease. Notwithstanding the tremendous results and improvement in the quality of life of the patient after total joint replacement, these devices have major limitations that fall out of the purpose of discussion of this chapter. The arthroscopic cascade stems in these very premises. It will postpone the endpoint procedure, in most instances, indefinitely.

We close the circle of conclusions for the chapter with a pleonasm, exactly where we started. As difficult as TMJ arthroscopy seems, attention to detail, and strict adherence to the steps and stages of the arthroscopic technique will make the surgeon not only successful but also comfortable and confident. We are overemphasizing this concept because, as opposed to traditional surgical technique, any minor deviations from the arthroscopic surgical technique will result in less than desirable outcomes or complications.

Ending on a positive note, this very reasonable approach to the orthopedic management of TMJ-related problems has a very high rate of acceptance and satisfaction with patients. Because the progress of science and technology is virtually unstoppable, the discipline of TMJ arthroscopy will continue to evolve. This author is committed to the advancement of technology by directing several manufacturers in specifically decreasing the size of instruments, making them more accurate, more multitasking, and more suited to minimally invasive TMJ arthroscopic surgery.
