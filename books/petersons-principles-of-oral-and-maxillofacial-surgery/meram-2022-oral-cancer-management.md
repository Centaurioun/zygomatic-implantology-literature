# 34.1 Introduction

Oral cavity cancers account for  $30\%$  of head and neck cancers and represent a significant challenge to clinicians. Management requires multidisciplinary expertise and is complicated by the complex role that the oral cavity plays in speech, mastication, and swallowing. Oral squamous carcinomas account for approximately  $90\%$  of oral cavity malignancies and are the focus of this chapter [1]. Although discussion is limited to the management of squamous cell cancers, oncologic principles outlined in this chapter can be applied to other malignancies affecting the oral cavity [2-4].

Regardless of advances in diagnosis and treatment, mortality from oral cancer has not changed significantly in the past 50 years. Approximately  $50\%$  of patients diagnosed with oral cancer will ultimately die of their disease [5, 6]. Advances in treatment modalities, including improved reconstructive techniques, however, have led to improvements in quality of life. Early detection and appropriate treatment of cancers remain the most effective weapons against cancers of the oral cavity. Unfortunately, public and professional awareness and knowledge of oral cancer are low. An editorial referred to oral cancer as "The Forgotten Disease." [7] Incidence and mortality for oral cancer is nearly double that of cancer of the cervix (30,300 vs. 13,500 and 8000 vs. 4400, respectively); yet few adults can remember their last oral cancer examination, whereas most women are aware of their last gynecologic examination and Pap smear [8]. Patient knowledge of other cancers, such as skin, breast, and prostate, has increased in recent years because of public awareness campaigns. Only recently, however, has oral cancer begun to receive some of the same attention. The American Cancer Society recommends a cancer-related checkup, including examination for cancers of the oral cavity, every 3 years for asymptomatic men and women aged 20-39 years and yearly

for men and women aged 40 years and older [9]. Although the oral cavity is readily accessible for examination, results of a study by Holmes and colleagues [10] questioned whether healthcare professionals were screening for asymptomatic cancers. In addition, smaller symptomatic cancers often went undetected in their study and were ultimately detected at a later stage. Interestingly, all asymptomatic cancers were referred from dental practices, and the average clinical and pathologic stage of cancers referred from physician offices were statistically higher [10]. This is unfortunate because the population at highest risk for development of an oral cancer is four to six times more likely to seek care from a physician than a dentist [11, 12]. Clearly, there is a need for increasing the public's awareness of oral cancer and improving screening for early oral cancers in order to improve outcomes regardless of treatment modality employed.

# 34.2 Histology

Just as the molecular events leading to the development of squamous cell carcinoma are a multistep process, the histologic progression of benign mucosa to invasive cancer typically follows an orderly progression, although the timeline for this progression may be variable. Whereas squamous cell carcinoma is the most common, variations exist that require alterations in treatment.

Verrucous carcinoma is generally considered an uncommon variant of squamous cell carcinoma, representing only  $5\%$  of oral cancers [13]. It has a predilection for the buccal mucosa, and typically appears as a thick white cauliflower-like growth (Fig. 34.1). The basement membrane is typically intact, and the cells are very well differentiated. It is not uncommon to find focal areas of invasive squamous cell carcinoma within the excised specimen, and patients should be prepared for this eventuality. The prognosis is excellent after adequate excision.

Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma represents another rare, and some believe more aggressive, form of squamous carcinoma. It affects males predominantly and is associated with a high rate of cervical and distant metastases [14]. Histologically, basaloid cells are arranged in nests or cords. Perineural invasion and a high mitotic index are common and coincide with its tendency to recurrence and worse prognosis, with a  $38\%$  mortality at 17-month follow-up [15]. Given the aggressive nature of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, elective treatment of the neck and postoperative radiotherapy with or without adjunct chemotherapy are probably indicated.

With regard to biopsy, an incisional biopsy in the thickest portion of the lesion should include the full thickness, if possible or practical. Although sampling the interface of lesional and normal mucosa is useful in some situations, it should be avoided when possible if malignancy is suspected because it will require extension of the final resection margins beyond where the biopsy was extended into normal tissue. Adequate depth of biopsy is important because it allows the pathologist to provide a depth-of-invasion measurement on more superficial lesions, which is predictive in regard to occult metastases, and helps determine the need for elective neck dissection (see discussion on elective neck dissection later in this chapter). Depth of invasion will not influence treatment of deep, indurated, or fixed lesions. The use of slowly resorbing sutures, which will serve as a marker if an excisional biopsy is performed, is best if closure is required.

# Key Points

Verrucous carcinoma and basaloid carcinoma represent uncommon variants of squamous cell carcinoma that highlight both less and highly aggressive variants, respectively.  
- Incisional biopsies should be obtained from thickest portion of lesion while avoiding interface of lesional and normal mucosa.

# 34.3 Management of Premalignant Lesions

Leukoplakia is defined as a predominantly white lesion of the oral mucosa that cannot be characterized as any other definable lesion (Fig. 34.2) [16]. Worldwide estimates of its prevalence range from  $1.5\%$  to  $2.6\%$  [17]. Lower socioeconomic status seems to be associated with higher prevalence [18]. The potential for malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia to invasive squamous cell carcinoma is well recognized, and leukoplakia can be considered a precancerous lesion (i.e., "a morphologically altered tissue in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparent normal counterpart") [16]. Estimated rates of transformation, however, vary widely. This most likely relates to the heterogeneity of the lesions included in most studies. Whereas homogeneous white leukoplakia has a relatively low risk, erythroleukoplakia has a high incidence of associated dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and frank carcinoma. In their oft-quoted study of 257 patients followed for a mean of 8 years, Silverman and coworkers [19] found transformation rates for leukoplakia to range from  $6.5\%$  for homogeneous lesions to  $23.4\%$  in erythroplasia. Lesions containing dysplasia had a transformation rate of  $36.4\%$  [19]. Of note, the risk of malignant transformation of leukoplakia seems to be higher in nonsmokers, and clinicians should consider excision or close follow-up in these patients [20]. The annual transformation rate in one population was less than  $1\%$ , which still demonstrated a 36-fold risk increase for squamous cell carcinoma in patients with oral leukoplakia over the population in general [21].

A number of devices have recently been promoted to aid in the detection of premalignant and malignant changes based on the absorption patterns of different light sources. Unfortunately, none has demonstrated improvement over a thorough examination with incandescent light [22]. Also, advances in molecular biomarkers and microarray analysis have as yet failed to produce a marker or set of markers that reliably predicts which lesions will undergo malignant transformation [23]. Studies have shown that the most important factor influencing the probability of malignant transformation is the clinical appearance of the lesion (i.e., nonhomogeneous vs. homogeneous). In one study, this variable alone outweighed all others including presence of dysplasia, site, demarcation, smoking, and surgical intervention [24]. Given its asymptomatic nature, the primary indication for treatment of leukoplakia is an attempt to prevent subsequent malignant transformation. Treatment modalities include excision, ablation, and chemoprevention. Unfortunately, no treatment modality has been shown to prevent subsequent development of squamous cell carcinoma, leading many to question the need for treatment beyond clinical follow-up [25, 26]. These and other studies were summarized in the first Cochrane review on therapy for leukoplakia, which concluded that there was no reliable therapy to prevent the transformation of leukoplakia to oral squamous cell carcinoma [27]. Furthermore, there were no effective preventive measures to halt the development of oral leukoplakia. No surgical procedures were included in the Cochrane review because of the lack of randomized clinical trials evaluating surgical excision. Chemopreventive agents including retinoids, betacarotene, green tea, and bleomycin were evaluated. Retinoids held the most promise and were associated with resolution of lesions, but at the expense of significant side effects (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.10 later) [25, 27, 28]. The ultimate goal remains prevention of subsequent malignant transformation, and unfortunately, none of the agents demonstrated this reliably.

Smoking and alcohol cessation are probably the most effective nonsurgical interventions at this point, but even these have not been shown to definitively decrease the risk of malignant transformation [26].

Surgical excision with scalpel, cautery, or  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser techniques remains an alternative for dealing with worrisome lesions. Excision of erythroplasia or erythroleukoplakia is probably indicated given the higher probability that such lesions can harbor severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or superficially invasive carcinoma.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser ablation has been used to treat widespread superficial lesions in an attempt to limit scarring and morbidity associated with large excisions. It does not provide a histologic specimen, however, and

multiple biopsies are probably indicated before ablation [29, 30]. One study reported on leukoplakia that was biopsied and revealed only mild dysplasia and was subsequently completely excised and analyzed. Histopathology identified cancer within  $10\%$  of the specimens, suggesting excision rather than ablation may be more appropriate [31]. Laser ablation can be a useful technique for dealing with large areas of leukoplakia. Removal of these areas can make subsequent follow-up and detection of worrisome signs of transformation easier. Unfortunately, recurrence of leukoplakia after excision or ablation is not uncommon, and it does not necessarily prevent malignant transformation [24, 26].

Given the high rates of multiple lesions and their propensity to recur, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is gaining popularity as a potential method for dealing with multiple diffuse lesions. PDT relies on a complex interaction of a photosensitizing agent, which is preferentially concentrated in abnormal tissue, with light of various wavelengths, depending on the photosensitizer, to create necrosis through a nonthermal reaction. The most common photosensitizing agents used in head and neck cancer are Photofrin, Foscan, and d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The choice of the photosensitizer depends on the depth of necrosis required based on the thickness of the tumor. Tissue necrosis is mediated through the creation of singlet oxygen, a highly reactive species that induces cellular damage through several mechanisms. Advantages of PDT include minimal damage to surrounding tissues and no cumulative damage as opposed to radiation therapy, which theoretically allows unlimited treatments. Given the propensity for these patients to develop multiple lesions, this is an important advantage over excision or ablation using traditional methods. Disadvantages include marked photosensitivity, especially with regard to sun exposure, for variable lengths of time after the administration of the agent. This can be minimized by using photosensitizers, such as Foscan, which require a longer wavelength for activation. Whereas useful for thicker lesions, thinner areas of carcinoma in situ and superficially invasive cancer require a photosensitizer that has more limited penetration. Areas treated undergo healing through mucosalization with minimal or no scarring. Although a complete review of PDT is beyond the scope of this chapter, excellent reviews are available [32-34].

PDT has been used with some success in the endoscopic treatment of dysplastic Barrett's esophagitis to prevent its transformation to adenocarcinoma [35]. Similarly, attempts have been made to treat diffuse oral leukoplakia with PDT with some success [36]. It has been reported in the management of oral dysplasia, but patients require close follow-up for recognition and salvage of new lesions [37]. In addition to its role in the

management of leukoplakia, trials of PDT applied to invasive squamous cell carcinoma of selected sites in the head and neck have been reported. Copper and associates [38] reported on 25 patients with T1 and T2 lesions of the oral cavity and oropharynx treated with PDT. Complete remission was noted in  $86\%$  of lesions. Recurrences were salvaged with conventional therapy [38]. In addition to its application to mucosal lesions, interstitial delivery of light may allow treatment of more deeply situated tumors. PDT can be applied to salvage more deeply situated lesions not amenable to surgical therapy or reirradiation therapy (RRT) protocols. Although results are promising, PDT for leukoplakia and oral cavity cancers remains investigational, and its role in the management of leukoplakia and squamous cell cancers of the head and neck awaits clarification.

# Definition

- Premalignant lesion is defined as a morphologically altered tissue in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparent normal counterpart.  
Leukoplakia is defined as a predominantly white lesion of the oral mucosa that cannot be characterized as any other definable lesion.  
- Erythroplakia is defined as a red patch on the oral mucosa that cannot be accounted for by any specific disease entity.

# Key Points

Malignant transformation rates of leukoplakia and erythroplakia vary widely but estimates show an incidence of roughly  $6.5\%$  for leukoplakia to  $23.4\%$  for erythroplakia.  
The annual transformation rate has been shown to be a 36-fold risk increase for squamous cell carcinoma in patients with oral leukoplakia over the population in general.  
Photodynamic therapy is a novel yet promising management aid for treatment of diffuse leukoplakia.

# 34.4 Role of Panendoscopy in Treatment Planning

Once a histologic diagnosis of oral cancer has been made, a patient evaluation is initiated in an attempt to define the extent of the locoregional disease as well as the existence of distant metastases. The doctor-patient dialogue that began with the biopsy is now continued with the knowledge that a malignancy is present and

that further work-up is necessary to define the extent of disease. Patients frequently feel a sense of urgency once a diagnosis of cancer is rendered. They want treatment initiated quickly. It is important to convey that cancer is not a surgical emergency and that the growth rate of epithelial malignancies allows for an appropriate evaluation that must be completed before making treatment recommendations. It should also be remembered that there is a high incidence of depression among the head and neck cancer patient population. The level of family and community support should be gauged, and appropriate referrals should be made if deemed necessary. The patient's overall medical condition should also be assessed in preparation for any planned treatment. Aside from the standard history and physical examination, including head and neck examination, nasopharyngoscopy or indirect laryngoscopy in the office should be considered. Mutagens responsible for malignant transformation in the oral cavity have also had an opportunity to affect the mucosa of the remainder of the aerodigestive tract, and the rate of synchronous primary tumors (SPTs) has been reported to be as high as  $20\%$  in some head and neck cancer populations [39]. Office nasopharyngoscopy and indirect laryngoscopy may be forgone if formal panendoscopy or "triple endoscopy" under general anesthesia is planned to search for SPTs.

Following McGuirt's 1982 study of panendoscopy [40], examination of the esophagus, larynx, and bronchus was considered mandatory in the workup of the patient with cancer of the head and neck. A mirror examination of the nasopharynx was also frequently included. McGuirt's finding of synchronous tumors in  $16\%$  of patients led most clinicians to include formal panendoscopy in their evaluation [40]. Recently, its routine use has been called into question for a variety of reasons, including cost containment, improved imaging modalities, and lower rates of SPTs of the head and neck than was previously expected. Some clinicians still believe there is a role for an examination of the primary cancer under general anesthesia, along with panendoscopy. They argue that the ability to examine some larger primary cancers is compromised in the clinical setting because of patient discomfort and that panendoscopy affords the clinician an invaluable opportunity to examine the primary cancers without this constraint. Others argue that the low yield of bronchoscopy over chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans and the ability to perform an examination of the larynx with flexible nasopharyngoscopy mitigate against the usefulness of rigid laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. Also, many patients with cancer of the head and neck receive a flexible esophagoscopy at the time of placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. For these reasons, panendoscopy should probably be symptom-driven [41].

# 34.5 Choosing a Treatment

Once the initial evaluation, data collection, and staging are complete, a discussion regarding treatment is undertaken. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) offers online access (▶ www.NCCN.org) to standard treatment algorithms developed by experts in their respective fields. Whereas clinicians are encouraged to consult these algorithms in making treatment recommendations, significant latitude exists in choosing treatment options, reflecting the heterogeneity of oral cancer patients. The clinician and the patient are ultimately faced with deciding which treatment modality or combination offers not only the best chance for cure but also the best preservation of quality of life. Quality of life issues are becoming increasingly important in treatment planning. Despite media hyperbole on cancer treatment "breakthroughs," cancer treatment still falls into three basic categories: surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, or some combination thereof. Choosing the appropriate treatment depends on many factors, including the patient's medical condition as well as the modalities available to the clinician. Certain therapeutic modalities, such as neutron beam radiotherapy, may hold promise for certain tumors but are limited in their availability. Although each is discussed separately in the upcoming sections, most patients will ultimately receive more than one form of treatment.

# 34.6 Surgery

Surgery remains the cornerstone of most treatment regimens for oral cavity cancer. Surgery offers several advantages, including the harvest of a specimen for histopathologic analysis and the possibility of removing the cancer utilizing one treatment modality in one session. Surgical resection with frozen-section analysis of the margins is advocated by most clinicians for most stage I and stage II cancers of the oral cavity. Although primary radiation to T1 and T2 lesions may offer similar disease control, the side effects of radiation to the oral environment outweigh those of surgery in most situations. In addition, given the rate of second primary cancers in the head and neck cancer patient population, it is often better to hold radiation if possible in case it is needed in the future. The oral cancer patient population is prone to the development of second primary cancers, and some would argue that radiation for borderline indications might be withheld for future use should the need arise. RRT, although possible in some circumstances, is associated with a high degree of morbidity.

The importance of obtaining clear histologic margins has been a foundation for surgical treatment of oral cavity cancer and has been supported by several

studies that have demonstrated decreased survival associated with positive margins, even if follow-up radiation is given. Unfortunately, clear pathologic margins are not always an assurance of a good outcome. Field cancerization is a concept that was proposed by Slaughter and colleagues in 1953 [42], after they reviewed resection specimens from the oral cavity and oropharynx. They found multiple foci of cancer in  $11\%$  of specimens. Areas of dysplasia also existed distant from the primary site [42]. Additional studies have shown that margins that are clear histologically may still have cells at the margin that demonstrate premalignant changes, and this can be associated with recurrence. An altered  $P53$  gene was identified in  $52\%$  of patients in one study, and recurrence occurred in almost half of these patients [43]. Other markers have been shown through molecular analysis to exist at margins that are clear histologically; specifically, the proto-oncogene  $eIF4E$  has been shown to be associated with a decreased disease-free interval (DFI) when present at the resection margin [43]. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is defined as the loss of a normal allele at a particular locus within a cell's genome already harboring a deleterious mutation on the matching allele. LOH found at a histologically clear margin has also been shown to correlate with development of recurrent tumor after excision [44]. Some authors have suggested that the concept of "marginal zones" as opposed to strict "margins" may more accurately reflect what is occurring at the tumor-host interface, where molecular changes may be present even in the face of histologically normal "clear" margins. Surgeons will likely continue to debate what constitutes an adequate margin with the understanding that the heterogeneity of squamous cancers of the oral cavity makes adequate margins in one case wholly inadequate in another [45]. This concept is reflected in an interesting study by Thomson [46] on patients with unilateral squamous cell carcinomas or premalignant lesions. Biopsies were taken on the opposite side of the mouth in the same area as the contralateral cancer or premalignant lesion. These so-called mirror image biopsies revealed frank dysplasia or carcinoma in situ in  $30\%$  of patients [46]. This concept of "condemned mucosa" has caused clinicians to question the ability of surgeons to obtain clear margins in some patients and in some cancers. Studies have clearly shown, however, a decreased local control and survival in patients with positive margins even in patients receiving adjuvant therapy. Jacobs and coworkers [47] analyzed patients who had received postoperative radiation; patients with satisfactory margins suffered an  $11\%$  relapse rate, whereas patients with unsatisfactory margins relapsed  $26\%$  of the time. This is most likely due to the inability of radiation therapy to deal with the increased tumor cell burden in

some cases of final positive margins [47]. Some investigators have suggested the feasibility of real-time intraoperative margin analysis for markers such as p53 or EIF4e to improve margin control [48]. In addition, improved control may be obtained in the case of unsatisfactory margins by the addition of brachytherapy to standard external beam postoperative radiation [49]. Improved survival was demonstrated in patients with positive margins who received this intensive radiation [49]. It is agreed by most that surgeons should strive for clear margins, given the impact of positive margins on survival. Excision with  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  of normal tissue beyond the obvious tumor edge is generally sufficient. Thin specimens of the margins should then be harvested from either the specimen or the wound resection periphery depending on the surgeon's preference. These thin strips are oriented for the pathologist using a specimen map. Mucosal margins as well as deep margin specimens are submitted; however, frozen-section analysis is helpful but not infallible. The role of frozen analysis of margins in oral cavity cancer has been heavily debated and its cost-effectiveness has been called into question, leading some surgeons to abandon the practice. Although frozen-section analysis is highly accurate and has a high correlation with final histologic analysis of the submitted tissue samples, its ability to predict whether the entire tumor surface of the final specimen will be clear of close or involved margins is not as reliable. For this reason, frozen sections appear to be more beneficial in smaller localized tumors [50-52].

On occasion, a surgeon will be faced with a situation in which the frozen margins obtained at surgery were negative but the final processed specimen shows involvement of one or more margins. This phenomenon can have several explanations. First, sampling error can occur. It is not uncommon for tumors, especially those involving the tongue, to show narrow streaks or small satellite islands well ahead of the main tumor front [53]. Second, if the margins analyzed by frozen technique were taken from the tumor resection bed, then it might lie just beyond the cancerous margin. Also, tumor shrinkage of approximately  $25\%$  to  $30\%$  occurs when the tumor is removed from the body. Finally, a multifocal tumor or an undiagnosed synchronous second primary may exist [53]. When faced with this dilemma, the surgeon has several options. Re-excision of a positive soft tissue margin is difficult and rarely productive. Wound closure or reconstruction of the defect distorts tissue, and it is frequently impossible to determine exactly where the positive margin was. For this reason, a final positive margin may represent an indication for postoperative radiation therapy (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.7, later). Conversely, clearance of cancer within bone with radia

tion is difficult and recurrence rates are high, suggesting that patients with positive bone margins should be strongly considered for re-excision. Recent reports illustrate that pathologic margins that are positive on final analysis are more likely a reflection of the aggressiveness of the particular cancer than a reflection on the surgical procedure, and histologic risk assessment is more predictive for DFI and survival than margin status [54, 55]. Sutton and associates [56] found that final positive margins had a high correlation with aggressive histologic parameters such as perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Thus, the biologic aggressiveness suggested by positive margins may in itself account for the poorer outcome of patients with positive surgical margins and be an indication for multimodality therapy instead of attempts at re-excision. Indeed, one of the main advantages of surgery as the initial treatment modality for oral cancer is the ability to obtain a specimen to examine for known indicators of biologic aggressiveness—histologic grade, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, lack of inflammatory front at the tumor-host interface, sialatropism—and use these as a guide to the need for adjuvant therapy (see discussions on  $\triangleright$  Sects. 34.7 and 34.8, later). In addition, whereas clinicians and patients are often comforted by a report of "clear margins," it must be understood that pathologic analysis at the light microscopy level is not  $100\%$  accurate and a certain number of false negatives invariably occur. This can be especially true with regards to tissue after multimodality therapy [57].

Despite its central role, surgery in patients with head and neck squamous cancer presents a series of variable and unique challenges that surgeons should be prepared to face. The following discussion offers an overview of some of the perioperative issues facing patients and surgeons. Subsequent sections review surgical points pertinent to specific sites within the oral cavity.

# Key Points

Surgery remains cornerstone of treatment for most oral cancers.  
- Clear histologic margins are extremely important in surgical treatment of oral cavity cancer.  
Multiple studies demonstrating decreased survival associated with positive margins, even with postoperative radiation.  
Excision with  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  of normal tissue beyond the obvious tumor edge is generally sufficient.  
- Frozen-section analysis, while highly accurate and correlatable with final histologic analysis, remains poorly reliable as predictor of clear or close margin on final specimen.

# 34.6.1 Perioperative Issues in Oral Cavity Cancer Treatment

The decision to operate on a patient with head and neck cancer must involve consideration of potential complications. Studies have demonstrated that age itself is not associated with increased complications, but medical comorbidities are associated with both increased complications and lengthy hospital stays [58]. This is especially true regarding complex reconstructive efforts, such as vascularized tissue transfer [59]. Several factors deserve special attention in the patient undergoing surgery for a malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract.

# 34.6.2 Airway

If there is any doubt concerning the ability of a patient to maintain an airway in the perioperative period, a tracheotomy is advisable. A tracheotomy tube does not prevent aspiration and, paradoxically, may actually increase its likelihood because of tethering of the trachea and impaired glottic closure. Tracheotomy is not without its own risks, and the nursing staff performing tracheotomy care must be well versed in suctioning and maintenance. Decanulation can generally be performed soon after edema has decreased.

# 34.6.3 Perioperative Antibiotics

Operations on the oral cavity are considered "clean-contaminated," and therefore, perioperative antibiotics are indicated. Several well-controlled studies have demonstrated that antibiotics started before the incision and continued for no more than 24 hours serve to minimize perioperative infections and emergence of resistant strains. First-generation cephalosporins and clindamycin represent the most commonly used prophylactic antibiotics in oral cancer surgery. Topical antimicrobials such as chlorhexidine and clindamycin rinses have also been shown to successfully reduce the incidence of infections [60, 61].

# 34.6.4 Alcohol Withdrawal

Many patients with oral cavity cancer are dependent on alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal has been reported to affect around  $3\%$  of head and neck cancer patients after major head and neck surgery [62]. Alcohol withdrawal can culminate in delirium tremens leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Appropriate prophylaxis with benzodiazepines is recommended if the patient drinks daily. Lorazepam is commonly used because of its predictable

onset and lack of active metabolites. Intravenous alcohol (5–10% alcohol with 5% dextrose in water) can be used in the postoperative period and slowly tapered as the patient recovers from surgery. Lansford and colleagues [62] demonstrated improved outcomes in head and neck cancer patients with alcohol withdrawal when a standardized, symptom-driven protocol for recognition and implementation of treatment with pharmacologic therapy and nutritional support was instituted.

# 34.6.5 Deep Venous Thrombosis

Patients who will be immobilized for a significant time during or after surgery should receive prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). This prophylaxis most commonly takes the form of mechanical compression devices that cause endothelial cells to release antithrombogenic factors and prevent stasis. It is important that these be placed and activated before surgery. Pharmacologic agents are generally reserved for known cases of thrombosis because of their propensity to cause bleeding in the postoperative setting. Low-molecular-weight heparin may be an option in this setting. If the patient has undergone microvascular reconstruction, aspirin or low-molecular-weight dextran may be indicated.

# 34.6.6 Fluid Management

Most patients undergoing surgery for oral cavity cancers can be managed without invasive monitoring of fluid status. Colloids may be needed to prevent undue amounts of crystalloid leading to a significant increase in edema. Preoperative and daily weights can be used to track fluid status. In patients with compromised cardiovascular reserve or in those undergoing large resections and free-flap reconstruction, invasive monitoring with central venous monitoring or via a Swan-Ganz catheter may be necessary. Although uncommonly performed, patients requiring bilateral resection of the internal jugular veins will need fluid restriction.

# 34.6.7 Transfusion

Controversy exists regarding the perceived impact of transfusion in the setting of head and neck cancer with some investigators demonstrating that transfusion is an independent predictor of poorer outcome [63]. Interestingly, the use of erythropoietin to correct anemia during radiation therapy has also been demonstrated to lower locoregional tumor control rates and survival [64]. More work is needed to elucidate the

interactions between anemia, transfusion, and survival. At this time, a hematocrit less than 25 generally requires transfusion and those between 25 and 30 may need transfusion based on clinical parameters.

# 34.6.8 Nutrition

Many patients with head and neck cancer will present with decreased nutritional reserves. Even patients without weight loss are often faced with therapies that will leave them unable to maintain their nutrition. The ability to bypass the upper digestive tract during intense multimodality therapy by the endoscopic placement of a gastric feeding tube (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tube) is invaluable. This procedure offers a minimally invasive "lifeline" for patients undergoing intensive therapy to the head and neck. Placement of a PEG tube has become commonplace in head and neck cancer patients despite anecdotal reports of seeding squamous cell carcinoma to the abdominal wall if the PEG is placed before resection [65]. This rare complication has led some surgeons to recommend PEG placement in the postoperative period. Even if a PEG is placed, the patient should be encouraged to continue some oral intake, because the risk of esophageal stenosis increases if the patient completely stops oral alimentation during radiation treatment. This is especially true during combined chemoradiation protocols.

# 34.6.9 Complications of Surgery

Complications of surgical resection are many and vary directly with the patient's comorbidities, such as ischemic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and alcoholism. Medical manifestations of preexisting chronic disease states, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and pneumonia, however, can be precipitated by major surgery, a long general anesthetic, and a prolonged intensive care unit stay. Time under anesthesia has been shown to be an independent predictor of complications and length of stay [58]. Significant morbidity or death can be the result. Technical surgical complications, such as failure of reconstructive flaps, development of fistulas, and the other myriad problems that may require return to surgery for management, are pale in significance to the greatest complication—locoregional recurrence of the cancer.

# 34.7 Radiation

A complete review of radiation physics and medicine is beyond the scope of this chapter, and excellent reviews on the topic are available [66]. Surgeons dealing with oral

cancer should have an understanding of radiation therapy and its advantages and disadvantages. This entails a familiarity with radiation biology and the interaction of radiation with living tissue as well as the biology of cell death. Cell death can be divided into two types: reproductive cell death, which results from damage to cellular genetic material, and apoptosis, which is programmed cell death. Reproductive cell death can occur as a result of single DNA strand breaks, which are common and easier for the cell to repair, or double-strand breaks, which are more difficult for the cell to recover from. Apoptosis occurs when a cell enters a programmed cell death mode as a result of damage. Radiation can cause either type of cell death and also slows cellular division. Classically, radiation is discussed in terms of the four Rs: repair, reoxygenation, redistribution, and regeneration.

Radiotherapy is primarily given by external beam using electromagnetic radiation or particulate components. X-rays and gamma rays represent photons. X-rays are produced by a man-made source and gamma rays are produced by radioactive decay, most commonly of cobalt 60. Particulate radiation using electrons plays an important role in head and neck cancer. Another form of particulate radiation is neutron radiotherapy, which may have a specific role in salivary gland malignancy [67]. Regardless of the source, radiation interacts with tissue to produce several types of damage to cells. The radiation particle-cell interaction may be either direct, or more commonly indirect, whereby impact with  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  molecules creates secondary particles that interact with cellular DNA. The absorbed dosage unit of radiation energy is reported as a gray (Gy), which is 1 joule of absorbed dose per kilogram. Previously, the dosage unit was reported as a rad, which was defined as 100 ergs absorbed per gram. One gray is equal to 100 rad and 1 centigray (cGy) equals 1 rad (1 cGy = 1 rad).

In the early to mid-twentieth century, radiation was given as orthovoltage (125-500 KeV). Currently, radiation is delivered as megavoltage  $(>1\mathrm{MeV})$ . Megavoltage results in more radiation delivered to deeper tissues with less superficial (skin) damage. By comparison, a superficial radiograph unit (x-ray machine) delivers 30-125 KeV. Radiation therapy is typically given in daily doses of  $200~\mathrm{cGy}$ , except in altered fractionation schedules.

Fractionation refers to the schedule on which the radiation dose is administered. Standard radiotherapy is administered daily, 5 days a week, with weekends off. In an effort to maximize damage to the more rapidly dividing tumor cells while sparing normal tissues as much as possible, fractionation schedules have been altered. Although used primarily in clinical trials, clinicians should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of other fractionation schedules because it is likely that their use will become more widespread. Accelerated fractionation refers to an overall reduction in treatment

time accomplished by giving two or more daily-dose fractions of close to conventional size each day. Hyperfractionation implies that the overall treatment time is conventional or slightly reduced, but an increase in total dose is achieved by giving two or more small-dose fractions on each treatment day. Each of these regimens is associated with varying degrees of early and late toxicities. For example, some clinicians believe that long-term effects such as osteoradionecrosis are increased with hyperfractionated schedules, especially when combined with concomitant chemotherapy. This view is not universal, however, and as more experience is gained, questions regarding toxicity will be answered [68, 69].

Aside from changes in radiation schedules, other facets of radiation delivery technique have undergone recent changes. Radiation is delivered to a specific target area that is limited by shielding (defined as radiation portals or "ports") that is placed to protect areas that are not suspected of harboring tumor or that are less tolerant of radiation (i.e., the spinal cord). The radiation treatment plan is typically standardized for each subsite in the oral cavity. Conformal radiation treatment refers to more localized delivery of radiation to the suspect site. By linking CT images with the ability to manipulate the radiation beams, radiation therapists are able to more accurately focus the radiation dose on the tumor bed and avoid adjacent uninvolved areas that may be more susceptible to radiation damage (Fig. 34.3). There is still concern that highly conformal treatment plans may result in increased recurrence rates because of the more limited field of radiation. Intensity-modulated radio

therapy (IMRT) is an example of a conformal treatment plan combined with varying radiation doses that is frequently used for head and neck patients to limit the collateral damage to surrounding areas [70, 71].

Brachytherapy or interstitial radiotherapy is administered by placing a radioactive source, typically radium ([109]Ra) or iridium ([197]Ir), directly into the tumor mass using needles or loop catheters. In this manner, radiation is delivered continuously. This does not allow the tumor cells to "repopulate" between fractions as in external beam therapy. Unfortunately, cells native to the area cannot recover either, which carries an increased risk of extensive radiation-induced fibrosis and osteoradionecrosis. This technique, however, allows a higher total dose of radiation to be given to a primary site than does external beam because the radiation is placed directly in the tumor mass. Brachytherapy has developed a reputation for creating chronic wounds and for increasing the risk of osteoradionecrosis when used adjacent to the mandible. Its current use is generally limited to treatment of some tongue or tongue base primaries, and it is usually combined with external beam radiation. Brachytherapy has also been advocated for treatment of close or positive margins after surgical excision [49]. Brachytherapy patients may require a tracheotomy for airway control because of airway compromise from edema. Wound healing is also severely compromised. Some clinicians have recommended only limited biopsies in the treated area if recurrence is suspected because chronic nonhealing wounds can develop from the biopsy alone [72, 73].

Radiation can be administered with curative intent in the preoperative setting or as an attempt to shrink a tumor presurgically (neoadjunct). When the primary tumor is to be treated with radiation, the clinician must also consider elective radiation of the neck for control of occult metastases. Because of the dependence of radiation on oxygen for effectiveness, bulky neck disease with its attendant hypoxic core should probably be treated with neck dissection, either before radiation or as a planned procedure within approximately 4 weeks of the completion of radiation. Early-stage oral cavity cancer (T1 or T2) responds equally well to radiation or surgery. The morbidity of radiation and the inability to use it again in the case of a second primary cancer or recurrent disease make surgery a more attractive modality in most situations. Larger tumors (T3 and T4) generally respond poorly to radiation alone. Preoperative radiation given in an attempt to shrink larger tumors is hampered by the fact that tumors do not shrink concentrically. Viable islands of tumor cells can be left beyond the new, clinically evident margins. In theory, surgeons are committed to excising back to the original margins, something that seldom happens in clinical practice.

# Indications for Postoperative Radiation Therapy

Two or more lymph nodes containing metastatic disease in a neck dissection. (Many clinicians contend that one positive node is an indication, which was supported by Shrine and coworkers [74] who demonstrated improved survival when postoperative radiation therapy was given to patients with T2 lesions and one lymph node involved.)  
- Extracapsular extension (ECS) of cancer beyond the confines of a node.  
- Poor histologic factors: extensive perineural or perivascular invasion, positive (close) soft tissue margins.  
Large (T3 or T4) primary cancers.

The primary role for radiation in oral cavity cancer is in the postoperative setting when there is potential for persistent disease. Clinical protocols vary among institutions, but there are accepted indications for postoperative radiation therapy. Reports have found ECS to be associated with decreased survival: disease limited to the node was associated with a  $70\%$  survival, whereas ECS was associated with a  $27\%$  survival at 5 years [75]. Million and associates [76] found that  $35\%$  of patients with clinically negative necks converted to positive if the primary cancer was treated with surgery alone. This dropped to  $5\%$  if radiation therapy was added. Even microscopic evidence of ECS is associated with a higher rate of

recurrence and death [77]. The decision to add radiation treatment must be made with a clear understanding of the morbidity of its use.

In advanced disease, clinicians are faced with a choice of preoperative or postoperative radiation treatment. Planned preoperative radiation treatment is rarely used but may lower the probability of positive margins and may allow smaller surgery (controversial). Lower doses of radiation are required because of the better oxygenation in areas not disturbed by surgery. Postoperative radiation treatment allows easier surgery and better healing in tissues not disturbed by radiation-induced fibrosis. Frozen-section analysis of margins is easier in this setting, and surgery allows improved treatment planning based on final pathology. Postoperative radiation therapy remains the mainstay in most cases of resectable cancers of the oral cavity. A study by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [78], RTOG 73-03, compared  $50\mathrm{Gy}$  preoperative radiotherapy with  $60\mathrm{Gy}$  postoperative radiotherapy. The 10-year follow-up demonstrated no survival advantage to either regimen, but postoperative radiation treatment demonstrated superior locoregional control [78]. How much is enough? Results from an MD Anderson Cancer Center (University of Texas, Houston) study showed that  $54\mathrm{Gy}$  was needed in the postoperative setting and  $57.6\mathrm{Gy}$  was needed if ECS was present [79].

Timing of the initiation of radiation therapy after surgery is controversial. Vikram [80] demonstrated a clear survival advantage in patients whose radiation therapy was started within 6 weeks of surgery. For this reason, reconstructive options that led to reliable healing in this amount of time were advocated [80]. A more recent study failed to replicate Vikram's earlier findings, leading some to challenge the supposed impact of timing on ultimate outcome. Other studies have reported improved outcomes when postoperative radiation begins within 6 weeks and ends within 100 days of surgery for oral cavity squamous cancers [81, 82].

The future direction for radiation treatment may include the development of effective radioprotectants and radiosensitizers. Radioprotectants, such as amifostine, are given in an attempt to protect normal tissues. Amifostine was developed by the military as a possible protection from nuclear attack and has been applied to head and neck cancer patients to protect salivary gland function during radiation therapy [83]. Xerostomia is a long-term problem that has a significant effect on patients treated with radiation therapy to the head and neck, with  $64\%$  of patients reporting moderate to severe permanent xerostomia [84]. Decreased incidence of candidiasis, a frequent side effect observed in patients with radiation-induced xerostomia, has been used as an

end point in amifostine therapy used for its protective effect on salivary gland function [85]. Its use is associated with side effects such as hypotension, and some patients do not tolerate it. In addition, it is costly, and there remains some fear that its radioprotective effects might extend to the cancer cells as well, resulting in higher recurrence rates. Radiosensitizers are chemotherapeutic agents that enhance that effectiveness of radiation (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.8, later).

# 34.8 Chemotherapy

Until 1991, the role of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer was limited to its use in the management of recurrent and/or metastatic disease. A landmark study that changed our view of chemotherapy was from the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group who reported a multi-institutional trial on patients with advanced laryngeal cancer [86]. Their study demonstrated larynx preservation and equivalent survival among patients who received induction chemotherapy followed by radiation, as opposed to traditional laryngectomy and postoperative radiation [86]. Although criticized by some for its lack of a radiation-only control group, the results fostered a renewed interest in the use of chemotherapy in the management of advanced head and neck malignancy, including squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Several reviews are available on the evolving role of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer. The following summarizes the basics of chemotherapy in oral cavity cancer and discusses several potential future applications.

Before analyzing the results of chemotherapy in oral cavity cancer, an understanding of the basic biology of chemotherapy and the associated terminology is necessary. In many ways, chemotherapy for cancer is conceptually similar to chemotherapy for infections; however, the immune system in general is not inherently competent to destroy the cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents kill a constant fraction of cancer cells, leaving behind a certain amount of resistant cells. These resistant cells subsequently divide and the tumor mass once again increases. In infectious diseases, the body's immune system aids in the destruction of the decreased burden of

cells, whereas in cancer, the patient usually does not have an immune system that can deal with the rogue cell line. Similar to infections with resistant strains, multidrug protocols have been developed to counter the development of resistant cell lines in cancer. Principles of chemotherapy have been developed to overcome the development of resistant cell lines such as the use of multiple agents that have demonstrated independent activity against the cancer type, the combination of drugs with differing toxicities to allow maximum dosing of each agent, and the maintenance of short intervals between dosing agents while allowing adequate recovery of normal tissues. Solid tumor growth is governed by gompertzian kinetics, which means that growth slows as tumor bulk increases. Because chemotherapeutic agents are most effective against cells undergoing replication, smaller and faster-growing tumors are more susceptible [87].

# Chemotherapeutic Effects on Tumor

Complete response: defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease.  
- Partial response: at least a  $50\%$  reduction in size as defined by the previous formula.  
Stable disease: less than a  $50\%$  reduction in tumor size.  
Progression: an increase of  $25\%$  or appearance of new lesions.

Assessment of the literature regarding chemotherapy is complicated if one does not understand the definitions of complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progression. Each of these is determined by the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumors. Measurements are obtained at the beginning of treatment and at completion. An important point to remember is that tumor regression must last for only 4 weeks. It is understandable, therefore, that reports of a complete response often have little impact on improved survival. The response rate represents the total percentage of patients achieving complete and partial responses. An additional problem with chemotherapy trials is patient selection bias. Increasingly, the role of comorbidities in ultimate outcome and the impact of performance status on survival are being recognized as important contributors to survival in head and neck cancer (see later discussion). Performance status is typically reported using the Karnofsky performance status (PS), which rates patients on a scale of 0 (death) to 100 (normal, no evidence of disease), or the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, which rates patients on a scale of PS 0 (fully active) to PS 5 (death) [88, 89]. Most clinical trials

require a certain PS to qualify, leading to enrollment of healthier patients and improved outcomes.

Timing of chemotherapy has been the subject of much investigation. Again, definitions are the key to understanding and interpretation of results of clinical trials. Palliative chemotherapy is given to patients with incurable disease to temporarily reduce tumor volume in the hope of improving quality of life and lengthening survival. This is typically the arena that serves as a testing ground for new therapeutic agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to patients who have undergone treatment of their primary cancer site with surgery and/or radiation. Goals of treatment include elimination of occult disease, especially distant metastases. As the patient no longer has visible or palpable tumor with which to gauge response, agents must be selected that have proven activity against the cancer type. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (also known as induction chemotherapy) is given to patients before definitive treatment of the primary cancer site [87]. This tactic is generally chosen in an attempt to decrease the size of the primary cancer to make definitive treatment possible. For example, a large tumor deemed unresectable may be "downstaged" by neoadjuvant chemotherapy that shrinks it to resectable proportions, although the actual stage itself does not change. As stated earlier, tumors do not shrink concentrically, and islands of tumor may remain beyond the visible margin. An additional advantage to neoadjuvant therapy is the ability to evaluate response. Squamous cell carcinomas represent a heterozygous population even within the same tumor. Some will be exquisitely responsive to a particular regimen, whereas others will not. Medical oncologists can tailor their treatment more accurately if visible or palpable tumor is available to evaluate response. The biggest criticism of neoadjuvant therapy is that it delays the definitive treatment of the primary cancer. Local failure is still the biggest cause of death in oral cavity cancer, and delaying treatment of the primary site increases the difficulty of obtaining control of the primary cancer. In addition, initial chemotherapy can theoretically select more hardy cell lines that are resistant to all therapy. Critics of the Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group larynx trial contend that neoadjuvant chemotherapy simply selected out less aggressive cancers that would respond to radiation treatment. Currently, the role of chemotherapy that has generated the most interest is combination with radiation treatment for an "organ-sparing" approach. Chemotherapy in combination with radiation treatment can be given in a sequential or a concurrent strategy. Concurrent therapy takes advantage of the radiosensitization of certain drugs and avoids delay in treating the primary cancer site. The

downside is a marked increase in side effects and toxicity that can lead to breaks in radiation treatment, which have been shown to be associated with a decrease in local control. In an attempt to control some of these toxicities, chemotherapy is usually given at the beginning of radiation treatment and frequently at the completion of radiation. Sometimes, radiation therapy is interrupted (split-course radiation) on purpose, and chemotherapy is given. Again, radiation breaks are considered to be associated with decreased control and are, therefore, not recommended.

Chemotherapeutic agents are under constant development, and a complete discussion of available agents is beyond the scope of this chapter. Several principles deserve mention. In general, drugs can be divided into cell cycle-specific and non-cell-cycle-specific agents, depending on whether the particular agent requires that the target cell be in a certain phase ( $\mathbf{G}_0$ ,  $\mathbf{S}$ ,  $\mathbf{G}_1$ , or mitosis) to be effective. Agents can also be categorized based on their principle mode of action. Antimetabolites, such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), block development of certain metabolites critical for cell metabolism. 5-FU is a fluoridated pyrimidine analog that inhibits thymidylate synthetase, blocking the generation of thymidine, which is necessary for DNA synthesis. It is frequently used in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Typically, it is combined with other agents, and it is a radiosensitizer. Methotrexate, an analog of folic acid, blocks conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolic acid, which is a precursor of thymidylic acid and purine. This results in an interruption of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Once a standard for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, methotrexate is now typically used only for palliation. Its side effect profile and ability to be administered intramuscularly on an outpatient basis make it a good option for this purpose. Cisplatin and carboplatin are alkylating agents that form cross-links in DNA and arrest cell division. Cisplatin is more effective in squamous cell cancer but is associated with more renal and neurologic side effects than carboplatin. Taxanes are plant-derived and interfere with microtubule formation, which subsequently interferes with the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. Recently, the addition of taxanes, specifically docetaxel, to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy has shown some benefit [90]. Erbitux (cetuximab) is a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It inhibits ligand binding to the EGFR and can stimulate antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity. Side effects are minimal with the exception of a variable rash reaction, the intensity of which seems to correlate with the effectiveness of the drug [91, 92]. Other agents used less frequently in head and neck squamous cell cancer include

paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubular formation and arrests cells in  $\mathbf{G}_2$ , and bleomycin, which creates DNA breaks. Agents under development include flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that has been shown to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in squamous cell cancer lines in vitro and for which a phase I trial is underway [93, 94].

Standard therapy for resectable disease remains surgery followed by radiotherapy, if indicated. To date, induction chemotherapy followed by surgery has not shown a survival benefit in oral cavity cancer. Questions remain regarding the addition of chemotherapy in the postoperative setting. The results of two major phase III trials, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 22931) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG 9501), offer some guidance [95-97]. In each study, stage III/IV patients with high-risk features, such as extranodal extension, multiple positive lymph nodes, and positive surgical margins, were randomized to receive radiation alone or concurrent radiation and platinum-based chemotherapy. Both demonstrated improved locoregional control in the combined group, but only the European trial demonstrated a survival advantage. It should also be recalled that both studies included multiple subsites of the head and neck and only a portion of the patients represented oral cavity cancers. At this point, chemotherapy in the postoperative setting should probably be reserved for cases of extracapsular extension and/or positive resection margins in patients whose performance status is such that it is believed they will tolerate the intensive therapy [95-97].

In patients with unresectable disease, chemotherapy is combined with radiation treatment. Organ preservation (not to be confused with organ function) through the use of concurrent chemoradiation protocols has received much attention. Meta-analyses by El-Sayed and Nelson [98] as well as by Munro [99] have demonstrated that concurrent treatment is better than neoadjuvant therapy and that locoregional control and survival were improved in advanced head and neck cancers. Stenson and colleagues [100] reported on the effectiveness of an intensive course of systemic chemotherapy and concurrent radiation for advanced-stage oral cavity cancer. They compared this group with a subset of patients that received surgery followed by chemoradiation therapy and found comparable progression-free and overall survival rates of  $65.9\%$  and  $66.9\%$ , respectively. Overall function in the chemoradiation group was judged excellent. It should be noted that the risk of osteoradionecrosis in the chemoradiation group was significant at  $18\%$ , and eight patients  $(7.2\%)$  died directly as a result of treatment toxicity. The study, however, did demonstrate an alternative treatment option for

advanced oral squamous cell cancers, and we will probably continue to see an increasing role for primary systemic chemotherapy in the management of patients presenting with advanced disease [100].

In an attempt to avoid the systemic effects of chemotherapy, investigators have attempted to deliver agents topically as well as intratumorally with both intraarterial injections and intratumoral depot forms via polymers and gels (see later discussion on recurrent tumors). A novel form of concurrent chemoradiation is the intra-arterial cisplatin and radiotherapy(RADPLAT) protocol popularized by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and University of Tennessee at Memphis, which has shown promise for advanced cancers with bulky primary cancers and nodal disease [101]. Treatment involves supradose cisplatin delivered directly into feeder vessels of the tumor bed by microarterial catheters placed under angiography. Sodium thiosulfate, which is a neutralizing agent for cisplatin, is administered systemically, allowing doses five times larger than standard protocols. Results of patients with T4 N2-3 disease treated with the protocol revealed 4-year local control of  $84\%$ , disease-specific survival of  $46\%$ , and overall survival of  $29\%$  [101]. Unfortunately, the protocol is associated with significant toxicity, including death. Use of the RADPLAT protocol is currently limited to centers that have gained familiarity with the technique and management of the toxicities associated with it. Most of these concurrent chemoradiation protocols involved oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers and are plagued by noncompliance because of toxicity and side effects. Mucositis is intense and placement of a PEG tube is usually mandatory [101].

Other novel techniques for minimizing the systemic side effects of chemotherapeutic regimens are under development, including the PDT discussed previously under the management of leukoplakia.

Trials of chemotherapy limited to the oral cavity are few. At this time, the clearest indication for chemotherapy in oral cancer is in metastatic and recurrent disease. Historically, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic or recurrent oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma involved combinations of cisplatin or carboplatin and 5-FU. Median survival rates of 5-7 months and 1-year survival of  $20\%$  were obtained. Recently, Erbitux (cetuximab) in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU has been shown to offer an advantage over platinum-based therapy alone for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. This is a remarkable advance considering that for the past 25 years no other regimen has shown an advantage over platinum-based therapy. In addition, this was without a significant increase in toxicity and led to improved overall survival [102]. One must be cognizant of the fact that

these are not curative therapies, and education of patients and families is critical to establish realistic goals and end points of therapy. Investigations continue to define a role for chemotherapy in advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. Unfortunately, early responses to chemotherapy have not demonstrated improvement in overall survival and only modest gains in median survival time [103].

Current research in chemotherapeutic agents focuses on those agents that bind to specific receptors in an attempt to limit effects to target cells. Similar to the hormonal therapy used in breast and prostate cancers, investigators are experimenting with agents such as EGFR inhibitors discussed earlier [104]. Gene therapy that targets known alterations in head and neck squamous cell cancer lines, such as TP53, is also an area of growing research [105]. Restoration of these altered genes, possibly through viral vectors, holds promise in certain populations [106].

# 34.9 Immunotherapy

Over the last 40 years, the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has not changed drastically in terms of surgery, radiation therapy, and platinum-based chemotherapy. In spite of advances in surgical techniques and reconstruction, radiation, and the use of chemotherapy in advanced disease, over half of all patients recur locoregionally or distantly. Research has shown that the interaction between tumor cells and host immune cells is both complex and dynamic. Tumor cells from various malignancies including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have developed mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and the host's immune response. The most common mechanisms for carcinogenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are local immune evasion, induction of immune tolerance, and disruption of T cell signaling [107].

Cancer is able to evade the immune response via mechanisms such as development of T-cell tolerance, modulation of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines, downregulation of antigen processing machinery (APM), and the expression of immune checkpoint ligand end receptors. Immune suppressive hematopoietic cells recruited into the head and neck cancer immune suppressive microenvironment includes myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells produce arginase-1 to metabolize L-arginine, an essential amino acid that is required for T cell and natural killer cell proliferation [108]. Tumor-associated macrophages play a critical role in tumor immunosuppression, migration, metastasis, and portend a poor clinical outcome. Regulatory T cells produce immunosuppressive cytokines interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF

beta) which suppress T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic function, downregulates expression of co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and inhibit dendritic cell maturation, macrophage activation, cytolysis by both natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).

Immune tolerance is the failure to mount an immune response to an antigen. Cancer cells with low levels or no levels of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) exhibit low immunogenicity and are less likely to be detected and eliminated by the host immune system versus cancer cells with high levels of TAAs or TSAs. The antigen-presenting machinery components work to generate antigenic peptides, translocate them into the endoplasmic reticulum, load MHC class 1 H chain with peptides, and transport the MHC Class 1 molecules to the cell surface to present the peptides to the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Tumor cells are able to reduce T cell-mediated recognition by downregulating or mutating HLA 1 molecules and/or APM components to impair antigen presentation. This has been observed in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas [109].

T-cell signal recognition relies upon the interplay that T-cell receptors have with co-stimulating ligands and co-stimulatory receptors. Besides evading the host immune response by inhibiting T cell-mediated recognition and activation through downregulation of MHC 1 antigen presentation to endogenous T cell receptors, tumor cells also evade the immune response by stimulating inhibitory receptor pathways such as inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1). Both of these receptors are expressed by activated T cells. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for the binding of CD80/CD86 (B7 ligands) which are expressed by professional antigen-presenting cells in lymphatic tissues. CD28 provides the main costimulatory signal for T-cell priming by amplifying T-cell receptor signaling. It is believed that CTLA-4 inactivates T cells by recruiting and inducing phosphatases counteracting CD28 and T-cell receptor-induced signal transduction, as well as by sequestering and removing B7 ligands from antigen-presenting cells. The PD-1 receptor has phosphatase-recruiting motifs in the intracellular domain and in normal cells binds to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to decrease T-cell effector activity and terminate the immune response. PD-L1 expression is induced by proinflammatory cytokines, therefore preventing autoimmune reactions to the host's peripheral tissues. However, PD-L1 is overexpressed by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells thereby inactivating effector T cells and inducing immune tolerance. Both CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors prevent excessive T-cell responses with CTLA-4 limiting the

priming of  $\mathrm{CD4 + }$  T cells in lymphatic tissues and PD-1 limiting the action of  $\mathrm{CD8 + }$  cytotoxic T cells in the periphery [110]. Other inhibitory co-stimulatory receptors upregulated in exhausted T cells isolated from solid malignancies include T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), lymphocyte activation gene 3, and T-cell tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain [107].

The goal of immunotherapy is to reactivate the immune system to target malignant cells. Types of immunotherapy include antibody-based therapies such as targeted monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and cytokine therapy. Monoclonal antibodies are derived from human or murine antibody components that bound to tumor-associated antigen leading to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy is the most widely used form of cancer immunotherapy currently and includes immune checkpoint-target MoAbs, tumor antigen-targeted MoAbs, cytokine-targeted MoAbs, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family costimulatory targeted MoAbs. An example of these monoclonal antibodies is epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in the inhibition of apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenic potential. EFGR expression is increased in  $95\%$  of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, correlates with aggression of the cancer, and is responsible for tumor progression. Anti-EGFR MoAbs mediate antigen-specific immune responses via direct killing using natural killer cells or monocytes lysis or tumor phagocytosis and subsequent antigen processing. Cetuximab and panitumumab are EGFR-targeted therapies and have been proven to be effective against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma either alone or in combination with radiotherapy [112]. The landmark phase III trial by Bonner et al. showed that cetuximab combined with radiation therapy offered superior locoregional control and overall survival when compared to radiation alone for locoregionally advanced HNSCC. Platinum combination was the standard treatment until the 2008 extreme study reported the benefit of Cetuximab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy. The extreme regimen currently represents the new first-line standard of care for recurrent-metastatic head and neck cancer (RM-HNC).

Nobel Prize winner James P. Allison, PH.D. changed the field of immune oncology when he established the new concept that, apart from antigen presentation, activation of cytotoxic T cells needed a secondary costimulatory signal to achieve antitumor immunity. Immune oncology was further revolutionized with the discovery of coinhibitory pathways (called immune checkpoints), which suppress T-cell activity leading to tumor growth.

Checkpoint inhibitors block these inhibitory pathways via monoclonal antibodies, resulting in tumor regression. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab were approved in 2016 by the Food and Drug Administration for second-line treatment of recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (studies KEYNOTE-012 and CheckMate 141) [111]. Three hundred and sixty-one patients who progressed on or within 6 months of platinum-based therapy were randomized to a treatment of the investigator's choice (cetuximab, docetaxel, methotrexate) or nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody. Those randomized to nivolumab showed a  $30\%$  reduction in the risk of death, median overall survival was 7.5 months for nivolumab vs. 5.1 months in the standard group, and the response rate was  $13.3\%$  in the nivolumab group versus  $5.8\%$  in the standard group. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 anti-PD-1. Sixty patients  $(38\%)$  HPV positive, both treatment-naive and pretreated patients with no limitations for the number of treatments) with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with at least  $1\%$  of PD-L1 expression were treated with pembrolizumab. PFS and OS were 2 and 13 months. PD-L1 expression levels were associated with overall response and PFS. These results were confirmed with an expansion cohort of KEYNOTE-012. A group of 132 patients unrestricted for PD-L1 positivity were given  $200\mathrm{mg}$  of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The response rate was  $18\%$ , PFS and OS of 2 and 8 months. Other checkpoint inhibitors being investigated include Durvalumab and Atezolizumab. Durvalumab and Atezolizumab are Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies that block PD-L1 from binding to its receptors PD-1 and CD80 [107].

Cancer vaccines are derived from patients' tumor cells, and are designed to contain a desired antigen which could be a single antigen such as RNA, DNA, or peptides; or multiple antigens such as pulsed dendritic cells or whole cells. These vaccines activate the adaptive immune system through the presentation of tumor antigens by antigen-presenting cells. It is better that they target tumor specific antigens to avoid an autoimmune reaction to normal cells. Advantages of vaccines are they can stimulate long-lived immunity with minimal toxicity and can be combined with other modalities. Disadvantages are that they are costly, take a long time to generate an immune response, and cannot be used for fast-growing cancers. A phase Ib trial combining dendritic cells with wild-type p53 peptide was conducted in 16 patients with HNSCC. Eleven of 16 patients  $(69\%)$  had increased p53-specific T-cell frequencies and 2-year disease-free survival was  $88\%$ . A peptide vaccine targeting LY6K, CDCA1, and IMP3 was studied in a phase II trial for locally advanced HNSCC and showed a median

OS of 4.9 months in those vaccinated vs. 3.5 months for the unvaccinated group [107]. Numerous vaccine trials for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are currently being conducted.

Cytokines are signaling molecules that help cells of the immune system communicate with each other to generate a response to a target antigen. The tumor microenvironment favors immune suppressive cytokines over immune-stimulating cytokines allowing immune escape of HNSCC cells. Peritumoral delivery of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in unresectable HNSCC patients has been shown to increase peripheral NK cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and increased T-cell cytotoxicity within the tumor [107, 112]. A phase III trial added perilymphatic IL-2 to surgery and radiation in patients with resectable advanced HNSCC. Injection of IL-2 at the cervical lymph nodes significantly increased disease-free survival and overall survival. Subsequent studies have confirmed that local delivery, peritumoral, or perilymphatic of IL-2 has been beneficial in HNSCC patients [107]. IRX-2 is purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and is composed of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis alpha. It has been used with cyclophosphamide and indomethacin in untreated, resectable, locally advanced HNSCC patients. Tumor response was seen in  $16\%$  of patients,  $74\%$  of patients had decreased or stable tumor size prior to definitive surgery, resulting in substantial increase in lymphocyte infiltration at the tumor and regional lymphatic sites,  $65\%$  event-free survival at 2 years, and  $65\%$  overall survival at 5 years [107].

Immunotherapy shows promise and very well may become the fourth modality in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treatment. However, it is far from perfect as immune checkpoints inhibitors have so far only shown an average objective response rate of approximately  $15\%$ . Activity is less than desired with at least  $80\%$  of HNSCC patients not demonstrating any tumor size reduction. No significant difference with immune checkpoint inhibitors was shown for progression-free survival when compared to standard of care groups in both the CheckMate and KEYNOTE studies. Hyperprogression was seen in  $29\%$  of patients with recurrent-metastatic HNSCC treated with anti PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents and resulted in a shorter progression-free survival [111]. The research suggests that a high proportion of patients are resistant or may acquire resistance to immunotherapy. There are numerous ongoing trials currently evaluating immunotherapy as first-line and second-line treatment, alone and as companion drugs in multi-agent and multimodality treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

# 34.10 Chemoprevention

An additional area of intensive research is the evaluation of chemoprevention agents, which are defined as agents that reverse or suppress premalignant carcinogenic progression to invasive malignancy (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.3, earlier). The role of such agents would be twofold: (1) to treat premalignant lesions to prevent their evolution to invasive carcinoma, and (2) to prevent development of second primary squamous cell cancers in patients who have already undergone treatment of cancer. Given its accessibility to clinical observation, leukoplakia has been used to monitor responsiveness to certain chemoprevention agents in clinical trials. Of the agents evaluated, including retinoids, beta carotene, and vitamin E derivatives, retinoids have demonstrated the most efficacy in eliminating leukoplakia. It is important to note, however, that reversal of these lesions has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing cancer, and the lesions soon return after cessation of treatment. 13-Cis-retinoic acid, which is more commonly used to treat acne, has been studied extensively in both the treatment of premalignant lesions and the prevention of second primary cancers. It may act through the upregulation of a distinct retinoic acid receptor, RAR-fl, whose downregulation is associated with development of head and neck cancer. Results of trials to date have been mixed. Although effective in eliminating leukoplakia, side effects limit its use, and lesions return after discontinuation of the drug. Second primary tumors occur in  $4 - 7\%$  of patients treated for head and neck squamous cancer and are the major cancer-related cause of death in early-stage cancer patients. The prevention of these tumors is, therefore, of critical importance. Studies of 13-cis-retinoic acid have shown a decreased incidence of second primary cancer but no effect on primary disease recurrence. This suggests that retinoids may prevent cancerous development in damaged cells but will not treat fully transformed cancer cells. Also, overall survival was not affected. The required doses of retinoids have side effects, including mucocutaneous toxicity (peeling and cheilitis) and elevation of liver function tests. Development of second-generation retinoids may attenuate some of these side effects. One study demonstrated a worrisome increased incidence of primary lung cancer in patients treated with beta carotene [113, 114].

Investigators continue to search for chemotherapeutic agents with more acceptable side effect profiles. One of these agents is the Bowman-Birk inhibitor, a protein derived from soybeans that has shown clinical activity against leukoplakia without the attendant side effects of retinoids [115]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been investigated since chemoprevention activity was found in some cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.

COX-2 influences several steps in the development of malignancies, such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and immune surveillance [116, 117]. COX-2 expression has been noted in high-risk premalignant lesions [118]. In addition to their potential role in chemoprevention, COX-2 inhibitors hold promise in the treatment of invasive squamous cell carcinomas [119]. Although chemoprevention offers hope for patients at high risk for development of second primary cancers and treatment of patients with high-risk lesions (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.3, earlier), its use is currently restricted to clinical trials and off-label use. Further work is needed to establish a safe and effective chemopreventive regimen.

# 34.11 Special Treatment Considerations by Site

# 34.11.1 Lip

Although classified as an oral cancer, squamous cell carcinomas of the lip typically follow a different clinical course than those of oral mucosal cancers. The pri

mary etiologic agent, sun exposure, is different from oral cancers, and the location of lip cancers usually leads to earlier discovery. The behavior of squamous cell cancers of the vermilion border is usually intermediate between squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and that of the mucosa. The vast majority arise on the lower lip where sun exposure is greatest. Most lip cancers are treated by surgical resection using  $0.5 - 1.0\mathrm{cm}$  margins and frozen-section control. Although often referred to as a "wedge" resection, the actual specimen more closely resembles a shield with parallel sides and a tapering base. "Wedge" excisions may be combined with a vermilionectomy or "lip shave" procedure, removing vermilion that has suffered extensive actinic damage or contains carcinoma in situ (Fig. 34.4).  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  laser ablation of the surface of the lip is also useful as an alternative to vermilionectomy for diffuse actinic changes. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip shares with squamous cell carcinoma of other cutaneous sites a potential for perineural invasion. A large perineural tumor deposition along the inferior alveolar nerve, several years after a lip cancer, can be mistaken for primary intraosseous carcinoma.

Neck dissection is usually not indicated for lip cancer unless there is clinical evidence of lymph node involvement by examination or imaging. Cancers of the upper lip and commissure can metastasize to the periparotid lymph nodes, and superficial parotidectomy may be required if there are clinically enlarged nodes. Some larger lesions can be treated with radiation alone if surgical resection will result in unacceptable compromise in appearance and function.

Five-year survival for lip cancer is good for early-stage disease (90% for stages I and II) [120, 121].

# 34.11.2 Buccal Mucosa

Buccal squamous cell carcinomas represent approximately  $10\%$  of oral cavity cancers in the United States compared with  $41\%$  in India. Squamous cell carcinomas of the buccal mucosa can be deceptive in their clinical course. Because of the intimacy to the buccal space and

deeper structures, cancers that penetrate the buccinator muscle can be difficult to eradicate (Fig. 34.5). Patients may present with involvement of the pterygoid space posteriorly or the parotid gland laterally. Extension either superiorly or inferiorly can lead to invasion of the maxillary alveolus or mandibular alveolus, respectively. These cancers often arise in wide areas of damaged mucosa, and adequate excision of these lesions often results in complex defects of the cheek that can be difficult to reconstruct. Primary radiation may be an option for smaller lesions. Although up to  $50\%$  of patients with buccal squamous cell carcinoma can present with neck metastases, the rate of occult disease in the neck is approximately  $10\%$  [122]. As with other oral cancer sites, elective treatment of the neck with radiation or surgery is indicated in T3 or T4 lesions. Consideration should also be given to elective treatment of the neck in deep T1 ( $>4\mathrm{mm}$ ) and larger T2 lesions. Combined therapy for large lesions with surgery and radiation may offer the best chance for cure [123].

Two-year overall survival rates for early-stage disease treated with a variety of treatment modalities range from  $83\%$  to  $100\%$ . Stage III survival rate is  $41\%$  and stage IV is  $15\%$ . Available survival statistics, however, are often not accurate because of the inclusion of verrucous carcinoma in some of the published reports.

Diaz and colleagues at the MD Anderson Cancer Center reported on 119 consecutive patients with buccal squamous cell carcinomas, the majority of which were treated with surgery followed by radiation if indicated (positive margins, nodal involvement) [124]. Five-year survival rates for patients with stages I, II, III, and IV disease were  $78\%$ ,  $66\%$ ,  $62\%$ , and  $50\%$ , respectively. The significant impact of nodal involvement was noted. Five-year survival rates of  $69\%$  with nodal involvement have been reported, which decreased to  $24\%$  in cases with extracapsular extension [124].

# 34.11.3 Retromolar Trigone

Given their proximity to the pterygomandibular space, tonsillar pillars, mandible, and tongue base, squamous cell carcinomas of the retromolar trigone (RMT) can behave in a more aggressive fashion, more like an oropharyngeal primary cancer (Fig. 34.6). Smaller lesions are amenable to wide local excision with or without a marginal mandibulectomy depending on the proximity to the bone (see later discussion). Larger lesions may invade the pterygomandibular space and extend cephalad toward the skull base. Such tumors require segmental composite resections with neck dissection. Significant trismus can be an indication of pterygoid involvement and may make radiation treatment with or without concomitant chemotherapy a better option than surgery. Elective neck radiotherapy or elective neck dissection with a selective neck

dissection should be considered in T2 or greater lesions. As with other sites, a depth of invasion greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  in T1 lesions may be an indication for elective treatment of the neck.

Kowalski and colleagues [125] reported on 114 RMT cases treated with surgery with or without radiation and found 5-year survivals of  $80\%$  (T1),  $57.8\%$  (T2),  $46.5\%$  (T3), and  $65.3\%$  (T4). Overall 5-year survival was  $55.3\%$ . They recommended adjunctive radiation in stages III and IV [125]. In an excellent review of the management of RMT cancers, Genden and coworkers [126] also suggested that the addition of preoperative or postoperative radiation confers a survival advantage. Radiation therapy alone for RMT lesions is an acceptable alternative with local control and survival rates similar to surgery, provided there is no bone involvement [127]. Surgical salvage may be indicated, however, in cases of incomplete response, and this must be explained to the patient who is unable or unwilling to undergo surgery as the primary treatment.

# 34.11.4 Tongue

The oral tongue, that portion anterior to the circumvallate papillae, is the most common location for intraoral squamous cell carcinoma, which typically presents as a painless indurated ulceration. If pain is present, it is usually due to secondary infection. Clinicians should attempt to determine the epicenter of the tumor and to classify it correctly because the behavior and treatment of cancers of the oral tongue is sufficiently different from those of the posterior tongue (oropharyngeal tongue or tongue base). This may be difficult in the case of larger cancers. The oral tongue poses significant challenges to clinicians. Seemingly small lesions can metastasize early and can recur after treatment. Control rates for small lesions of the oral tongue  $(60 - 80\%)$  are lower than those of similar size in other oral cavity subsites. There are minimal barriers in the tongue to tumor invasion, and there is frequent invasion into adjacent or deeper structures at presentation. Although more commonly associated with oropharyngeal primary cancers, referred otalgia is not uncommon for cancers of the oral

tongue, and limitation of tongue mobility with resultant dysarthria is associated with invasion of the deeper musculature. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in evaluating the depth of invasion.

Treatment of tongue lesions should be aggressive, and strong consideration for elective treatment of the neck should be given in all cases except for the most superficial lesions  $(< 2\mathrm{mm})$ . Although Fakih and associates [128] were not able to demonstrate a survival advantage in patients who underwent an elective neck dissection versus a watch-and-wait policy, they did demonstrate that deeper lesions were associated with a significant rate of cervical metastases. Up to  $10 - 12\%$  of tongue cancers with metastases to the neck can demonstrate "skip" metastases to level IV, and consideration should be given to extending the neck dissection to include level IV [129]. Postoperative radiation should be considered in situations in which multiple frozen-section specimens were sent before obtaining clear margins, perineural invasion, microvascular or microlymphatic invasion, or other worrisome findings that are present.

Smaller superficial tumors are amenable to wide local excision and reconstruction via primary closure, split-thickness skin grafting, or healing by secondary intention. Larger tumors are reconstructed with vascularized tissue transfer, and mandibulotomy may be needed for adequate access to large or posterior lesions. Radial forearm or lateral arm microvascular free flaps allow excellent mobility and little bulk (Fig. 34.7), whereas the anterolateral thigh flap can provide bulk, if needed. Unilateral or bilateral pedicled nasolabial flaps can occasionally be used for anterior tongue lesions. Large oral tongue cancers that cross the midline present the surgeon with a difficult choice. If resection is chosen, it is often better to tailor the radial forearm flap smaller than the resected area to allow the remaining tongue musculature less bulk to move during excursions (Fig. 34.8). Near-total glossectomy (resection of the oral tongue with only tongue base remaining) almost always results in high morbidity and is associated with a high incidence of aspiration that may ultimately require laryngectomy for aspiration control. Treatment with external beam radiation alone is associated with unacceptable failure rates. In this setting, consideration should be given to organ-sparing protocols with concomitant chemoradiation therapy if surgery will be associated with unacceptable morbidity. Brachytherapy combined with external beam radiation is the treatment of choice at some centers. Technical expertise is required, and

most tongue brachytherapy patients require tracheotomy for airway control.

Tongue base tumors, although actually an oropharyngeal subsite and not considered an oral subsite, are discussed here for completeness. The tongue base allows tumors to grow silently, and diagnosis at an early stage is the exception rather than the rule. Most small (T1 and some T2) lesions can be treated with surgery or radiation treatment. Larger tumors are typically treated with an organ-sparing approach using chemoradiation therapy or external beam therapy, sometimes combined with brachytherapy. Results with external beam alone have been disappointing. Reconstruction of smaller posterior tongue defects is best accomplished by radial forearm or lateral arm flaps, if primary closure or healing by secondary intention is inappropriate. Larger excisions (75% to total) typically are reconstructed with a free rectus flap, although the anterior lateral thigh flap offers an alternative [130]. A new surgical modality has been developed and has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that entails the use of a surgical robot to access and effectively resect cancers from the base of tongue and other oro- and hypopharyngeal sites [131]. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) may allow tumor resection with clean margins resulting in a defect that can be allowed to heal by secondary intention. This obviates open mandibulotomy or pharyngotomy and can usually be done without a tracheotomy.

Most treatment failures of the oral tongue involve locoregional recurrence. Second primary cancer rates are high  $(30\%)$ , and this also contributes to treatment failure and death. Three-year survival for T1 and T2 lesions is  $70 - 80\%$ , but this decreases to  $15 - 30\%$  in patients with lymph node metastases [132, 133]. Some clinicians have opined that tongue squamous cell carcinoma arising in young patients may represent a more aggressive subset and warrant more aggressive therapy. Overall survival for younger patients is actually similar to those of older patients with the same stage because of their lack of intercurrent illnesses. It was found, however, that oral tongue cancers in younger women did behave more aggressively and were associated with higher recurrence rates. This subset may warrant more aggressive initial therapy [134, 135].

# 34.11.5 Floor of Mouth

The floor of the mouth (FOM) is the second most common location for oral cavity squamous cell cancers (Fig. 34.9). FOM cancers can extend along the ventral tongue and cause fixation. In addition, FOM tumors can become fixed to the mandible or extend directly into level I of the neck. McGuirt and colleagues [136] have demonstrated improved outcome with elective treatment of the neck, and elective treatment of the neck should be considered in all but the smallest thin lesions  $(< 3\mathrm{mm})$ . Sagittal or "inner-table" mandibulectomy may be considered in smaller tumors that abut the mandible without evidence of invasion (see later discussion), but large inner-table resection is technically difficult and can significantly weaken the mandible. Small primary cancers can be equally treated with surgery or radiation, although surgery is the choice of most clinicians. Anterior lesions may require sialodochoplasty to reroute the submandibular ducts if the submandibular gland is not removed by ipsilateral neck dissection.

![](images/d84d41fe2e19515db19854e5d74b3e7e0139dd1ac5ab4f6418bf5392abe6d9e3.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 34.9 Advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior floor of the mouth

Smaller FOM defects can be closed primarily or left to heal by secondary intention. A partial closure of the defect will often suffice. Larger FOM defects, particularly those that include mylohyoid resection, benefit from a bulkier reconstruction, such as a vascularized radial forearm flap or bilateral nasolabial flaps placed in a one- or two-stage operation.

Local recurrence remains a problem with FOM squamous cancers and results in high rates of locoregional failure. Five-year survival rates are  $64 - 80\%$  (stage I),  $61 - 84\%$  (stage II),  $28 - 68\%$  (stage III), and  $6 - 36\%$  (stage IV) [137].

# 34.11.6 Alveolus and Gingiva

Gingival squamous cell cancers represent a unique subset in oral cavity cancers that arise on the attached gingiva and that should be differentiated from those that arise on the unattached mucosa of the alveolus. Occult neck metastasis is rare in the absence of bone invasion, and elective treatment of the neck is not necessary in smaller lesions. Larger lesions may require partial maxillectomy, or marginal or segmental mandibulectomy, if bone invasion is suspected. Indications and variations on mandibulectomy are discussed later. In general, control rates are excellent for gingival primary cancers if treated with adequate margins.

Alveolar cancer arises from the unattached mucosa of the alveolar ridge and has a different clinical behavior than gingival carcinomas. It requires more aggressive therapy and more extensive resection of bone.

Most anterior and some posterior maxillectomies for alveolar and gingival squamous cells can be accomplished via a transoral approach using techniques of orthognathic surgery (Fig. 34.10) [138]. The pterygoid plates require removal only if there is evidence of invasion through the posterior maxilla. Larger tumors may indicate the need for a transfacial (Weber-Fergusson) approach for adequate exposure. Posteriorly situated tumors and especially those with extension into the pterygoid or infratemporal areas may be more easily accessed via a midline mandibulotomy and mandibular swing approach. Reconstruction of maxillary defects can be accomplished with local flaps, such as the temporoparietal galeal or temporalis muscle flap, or free-flap reconstruction. The complex nature of maxillary defects and the bulk of some of the flaps, however, often leave a less than satisfactory result. Whereas most maxillectomy defects are best reconstructed primarily, prosthetic obturation of the defect may offer advantages in some situations, including a simpler operation, easier early

detection of recurrence, and replacement of teeth. Dental implants in general, and the zygomatic implant in particular, can offer a vast improvement in prosthetic function [139].

Most maxillary alveolus and gingival squamous cells that invade the sinus involve the infrastructure lying below Ohngren's line, an artificial line that runs from the medial canthus to the angle of the mandible and separates the maxillary sinus into an infra- and a suprastructure. If superior extension results in exposure of dura mater as part of a skull base resection, flap coverage is advisable.

Overall 5-year survival for alveolar ridge carcinoma is  $50 - 65\%$  for both the upper and the lower alveolar ridge. Poor outcome is associated with advanced stage, perineural spread, and positive margins. In these cases, as well as nodal involvement, adjunctive radiation is recommended [140].

# 34.11.7 Palate

Squamous cell cancers of the palate, hard and soft, are rare in the United States, but are more common in India owing to the phenomenon of "reverse smoking," which assaults the palate with both carcinogens and heat. The soft palate is considered an oropharyngeal subsite (Fig. 34.11). Cancers arising from the hard palate, however, may extend onto the soft palate and vice versa. The periosteum of the palate acts as a significant barrier, and smaller lesions can be treated with wide local excision. Healing by secondary intention under a protective stent secured to the palate is a viable reconstructive option if the palatal bony structure is not removed. The patient should be informed that despite preservation of palatal bone, a small fistula may still develop during the healing process. Oral-nasal communications in the hard palate can be treated with an obturator or a local flap, such as an anteriorly based midline tongue flap. Oral-nasal fistulas in the soft palate are best treated with temporary obturation, because the majority will close spontaneously. Previously, it was thought that occult cervical metastases are rare among maxillary and hard palate cancers  $(10 - 25\%)$ , and elective treatment of the neck was generally not indicated except in T3 or T4 lesions [141, 142]. A recent report by Schmidt and coworkers [139] found a higher incidence of occult metastasis  $(21.4\%)$  with cancers involving the palate and maxilla and a high incidence of regional or distant metastasis  $(50\%)$ . This and other reports call into question the wisdom of observation alone for the clinically negative neck in maxillary and hard palate cancers [143, 144]. In addition, metastases may occur to the retropharyngeal nodes, and consideration should be given to irradiation of the neck to include this area if suspected.

# 34.12 Management of the Mandible in Oral Cavity Cancer

Management of the mandible in oral cavity cancer continues to be the subject of much controversy. In the past, the mandible was routinely sacrificed in the treatment of FOM and tongue cancers, as it was believed that the regional lymphatics coursed through the mandibular periosteum, necessitating an in-continuity resection of the tongue, FOM, mandible, and neck dissection (commando operation). The morbidity of this approach was thought necessary to eradicate in-transit metastases, a belief that was likely based on mistranslation by McGregor [145] of an article published by Polya and von Navratilin 1902, in which they actually recommended removal of the periosteum or rim of the mandible and not a segment.

Marchetta and associates [146] subsequently demonstrated that lymphatics did not flow through the mandible and that the periosteum of the mandible actually served as a barrier to invasion. It was found that squamous cell carcinoma invasion occurs most commonly through the periodontal ligament in the dentate mandible and through the porous occlusal surface of the edentulous mandible [146]. O'Brien and colleagues [147] also demonstrated that an inflammatory front preceded cancer that stimulated subperiosteal resorption and the creation of bony clefts that allowed cancer to invade the cortex. Once the cortex was invaded, the inferior alveolar canal was usually involved, especially in edentulous mandibles [147, 148]. These findings have prompted surgeons to advocate preservation of mandibular continu

ity through the use of a marginal mandibulectomy in cases without obvious bony involvement. It is important to note that these principles apply only to the nonirradiated mandible because cancer invasion of a previously irradiated mandible may occur through multiple sites.

The clinical and radiographic evaluations of mandibular involvement are frequently inaccurate. Clinical findings such as impairment of inferior alveolar nerve function or fixation of the tumor to the mandible raise the index of suspicion. The history of an extraction of a tooth in an area of a cancer may suggest local mandibular invasion. Although used by some, bone scans are cumbersome to obtain and difficult to interpret accurately. A high-quality panoramic radiograph is probably the most commonly used tool to decide on mandibular marginal resection versus segmental resection. CT scanning using DentaScan software has also been used, although recent studies have shown that an MRI demonstrating enhancement of the marrow signal was a better predictor than CT scanning of mandibular involvement. Also, newer techniques that modulate the magnetic field in an attempt to examine changes in the bone marrow hold promise for evaluating mandibular involvement. Tumor invasion into the marrow space is accompanied by a lower intermediate signal. A strong bright marrow signal associated with normal marrow fat underlying the dark cortex typically excludes mandibular involvement [149]. The specific role of cone beam CT scanning in mandibular invasion assessment awaits clarification, although this modality probably offers the best-quality imaging of the mandible available in the office setting [150].

At this time, the most accurate assessment of mandibular involvement occurs at the time of surgery when the surgeon can inspect the bone. Some surgeons send periosteum for frozen-section analysis, whereas others submit cancellous scrapings for frozen analysis [151]. Once a decision has been made to perform a marginal mandibulectomy, the surgeon has several choices for osteotomy design. Some surgeons advocate rim mandibulectomy, preserving at least a  $1\mathrm{cm}$  inferior border, whereas others advocate a sagittal marginal mandibulectomy or a variation thereof [152]. Reinforcement of an aggressive marginal mandibulectomy with a reconstruction plate may be helpful to avoid later pathologic fracture (Fig. 34.12). Marginal mandibulectomy can be effectively performed via a transbuccal approach [153].

An important point is the avoidance of right angles in the osteotomy design that serve as stress risers and

may lead to fracture. We prefer an osteotomy that begins in the sigmoid notch and sweeps inferiorly and anteriorly for lesions located in the posterior mandible. It is important to note that the thick cortical bone along the posterior ramus is rarely involved, even when the mandible is invaded, and it can usually be preserved and serves as an area for plating. Extending the osteotomy through the sigmoid notch also removes the coronoid process, which also decreases stress on the residual mandible. Atrophic edentulous mandibles are generally not candidates for marginal resection, although this is not an absolute rule. Wax and coworkers [154] and Shah [155] have published excellent reviews of the topic of segmental and marginal resection, and the reader is directed to their reviews for a more in-depth discussion. If the surgeon is anticipating a marginal resection, and a segmental resection becomes indicated based on operative findings, he or she is faced with a surgery for which both surgeon and patient might not be prepared. Frank discussions before surgery help prepare the patient and their family for this eventuality. Mention should be made of the possibility of return to the operating room if the final pathologic analysis reveals an unexpected amount of bone involvement, necessitating a segmental resection and more elaborate reconstruction.

Fig. 34.12 Panorex demonstrates plate reinforcement of residual mandible after marginal mandibulectomy

Splitting the mandible, or mandibulotomy, is often necessary for access to large cancers, especially of the posterior tongue or tonsillar region (Fig. 34.13). Technical refinement of mandibulotomy helps avoid complications. Mucosal and gingival incisions should be staggered and not placed directly overlying the proposed osteotomy site. Division of the mandible at the parasymphysis or symphysis is preferred over an osteotomy in the body region. If the mandibular osteotomy is being performed for access to the tongue, the cut should be made anterior to the mental foramen to preserve sensation. Precise preadaptation of plates will allow reestablishment of the preoperative occlusion and contour without maxillomandibular fixation.

# 34.13 Management of the Cervical Lymph Nodes in Oral Cavity Squamous Cancer

The ability of a cancer to metastasize most commonly manifests itself by tumor deposition and growth in regional lymph nodes. Therefore, management of the regional lymphatics is a fundamental consideration in any cancer. Lymph node status is the single most important prognostic factor in head and neck cancer with nodal involvement decreasing overall survival by approximately  $50\%$ . Unfortunately, approximately  $40\%$  of patients with oral cancer will harbor cervical lymph node metastasis at presentation. In addition to the presence or absence of lymph node involvement, prognostic features related to the regional lymph nodes include: laterality (whether the metastasis is ipsilateral or contralateral to the primary), number of involved nodes, size of nodes, anatomic level (involvement of lower neck nodes fairing much worse), ECS, permeation of perinodal lymphatics, and overall pathologic N stage [156].

Surgical treatment of the neck is justified for two reasons: the removal of gross disease in patients with clinical evidence of nodal involvement (therapeutic neck dissection) or a high enough index of suspicion of occult cervical metastases to justify an elective neck dissection (END). Some surgeons would also suggest that unreliable patients should undergo END because follow-up may be irregular. Excluding the hard palate and lip, approximately  $30 - 40\%$  of patients with oral cavity cancer will present with cervical metastases [157]. The decision to treat the N0 neck is based on the probability of nodal involvement, with most authors recommending

END if the risk of occult metastasis is greater than  $15 - 20\%$ . Evaluation of the neck for cervical metastases remains a critical component of the evaluation of the patient with oral cavity cancer. Manual palpation is regarded as the first step in this process and is usually accomplished before biopsy to avoid postbiopsy inflammatory nodal enlargement. In most necks, a lymph node must be at least  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter to be palpable. The accuracy and reliability of palpation are low, however, with an overall error of approximately  $30\%$  in several studies [158]. Imaging modalities including CT, MRI, ultrasonography, and positron-emission tomography (PET) have become increasingly important in the evaluation for cervical metastases and in guiding therapy.

A CT scan with contrast from the skull base to clavicles has become the most common imaging modality used for detection of cervical metastases (Fig. 34.14). Specific criteria for nodal metastases, including node size greater than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  (except the level II jugulodigastric node, which must be  $>1.5\mathrm{cm}$ ), central necrosis, and morphology (round instead of oval), have increased sensitivity to over  $90\%$  [159]. MRI neck evaluation has gained popularity in recent years and is typically used if the primary site is being imaged with MRI, such as for a tongue cancer. CT and MRI, in that order, are the most widely used imaging modalities for detection of occult metastases in the United States.

# Radiographic Criteria for Nodal Metastasis

- Node size greater than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  (except the level II jugulodigastric node which must be  $>1.5\mathrm{cm}$ )  
Central necrosis  
Morphology (round instead of oval)

The characteristics of the primary tumor may also predict metastases. Spiro and associates [160] demonstrated that depth of invasion in tongue cancer was a reliable predictor of lymph node metastases in cancer of the oral tongue. They found that cancers with  $2 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  depth of invasion had a significantly higher rate of lymph node metastases than those with invasion of less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  (25.7% vs. 7.5%). Depth of invasion greater than  $8\mathrm{mm}$  was associated with a  $41\%$  rate of occult metastasis. Tumor thickness less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  has been associated with a  $13\%$  incidence of lymph node metastases and  $3\%$  would ultimately succumb to their disease, whereas greater than  $9\mathrm{mm}$  of invasion was associated with a  $65\%$  incidence of lymph node metastases and  $35\%$  would die of their disease [160, 161]. Ocharoenrat and colleagues [162] also demonstrated an increased risk of cervical metastasis in tongue cancers with a depth of invasion greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  and correlated this with poor outcome even in early-stage (I and II) tongue cancers. Similar results were reported by Kurokawa and coworkers [163], who found that depth greater than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  was associated with an increased risk for development of late cervical metastases in patients with moderately differentiated squamous cell cancers of the tongue and diminished overall survival. This has led to recommendations that even in the absence of evidence of lymph node metastases, the neck should receive elective treatment (either END or irradiation) for thicker primary tumors, and in the latest AJCC staging, depth of invasion has been added to the staging of oral squamous cancers. Chen and Schmidt [164] made a persuasive argument for considering END for any oral primary.

Two additional imaging modalities used for evaluating nodal metastases deserve mention. Ultrasonography and positron-emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) with or without combined CT (PET or PET/CT) are gaining in popularity for initial staging and follow-up staging of patients with head and neck cancer. Although not commonly used in the United States, ultrasonography has been used in outpatient clinics for evaluation of oral cancer patients in Europe for some time. Ultrasonography criteria for malignant changes include nodal size and changes in echogenicity, central necrosis that will lead to an echogenic hilum, and a hypoechogenic periphery. Its ability to improve on

manual palpation of cervical lymphadenopathy has led to its increased use in the United States. It can also help to evaluate carotid or jugular invasion. When performed by an experienced clinician and combined with aspiration cytology, ultrasonography is very accurate [165]. Knappe and associates [166] reported a sensitivity of  $89.2\%$  and a specificity of  $98.1\%$  in 56 patients who underwent preoperative ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration followed by elective or therapeutic neck dissections.

PET and PET/CT have become increasingly popular in the staging and follow-up of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. By identifying areas of high glucose uptake, PET scans allow clinicians to identify potential metastases in the preoperative workup (Fig. 34.15). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) are assigned based on the amount of glucose uptake and can offer some prognostic information [167]. The overall incidence of clinically identified distant metastasis in head and neck cancer patients is  $2 - 18\%$  and presence of distant metastases may influence the choice of initial treatment [168, 169]. The role of PET scans in the evaluation of occult cervical metastases is limited by the need for at least  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  [3] of tumor for detection. Carlson and colleagues [170] evaluated the use of PET/CT in the preoperative staging of patients with oral/head and neck cancer and found a sensitivity and specificity of  $79\%$  and  $82\%$  respectively, in the N0 neck and  $95\%$  and  $25\%$  for the  $\mathbf{N}+$  neck. They concluded that currently PET/CT was inadequate to guide the need for neck dissection nor could it guide the surgeon as to which levels should be dissected [170]. Technologic advances and refinements in technique continue, and PET scanning will likely become increasingly accurate at the detection of occult metastasis.

PET or PET/CT is frequently employed in the workup of patients with cervical metastases and unknown primaries, but its specific role continues to be explored [171]. It has been shown to be of some value in locating occult primary sites in patients presenting with a neck mass but has not supplanted the role of panendoscopy with directed biopsies and tonsillectomy in these patients [172]. PET is also used to examine patients who have undergone chemoradiotherapy for recurrent disease [173]. These patients are notorious for their difficulty in examination secondary to extensive changes in the soft tissue. It is recommended that at least 3 months pass after therapy completion before obtaining a PET scan because of the persistent inflammation associated with radiation and the tumoricidal effects that persist after radiation is completed. It

should also be remembered that current technology requires that a focus of squamous cell carcinoma be several millimeters to be detected [174]. Findings on follow-up scans should be interpreted within the context of the entire clinical picture because false positives in postoperative and postradiated fields of the head and neck are not uncommon. In the past, it was stated that distant metastases were a late finding in head and neck cancer patients and most patients succumbed to locoregional disease. It was once thought that less than  $1\%$  of head and neck cancer patients had distant disease at presentation. As the use of PET scanning in the initial evaluation of patients with oral cavity cancers becomes more widespread, detection of distant metastases at the initial evaluation is becoming more common. One result of these improvements in detection of distant disease is stage migration. In other words, as our ability to detect distant disease improves, more patients are assigned a higher stage at presentation. This does not mean that patients are being diagnosed later in the course of their disease than in the past but simply that our diagnostic abilities have improved.

# 34.14 Neck Dissection in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Cancer

Appropriate surgical management of the regional lymphatics plays a central role in the treatment of oral cancer patients. Removal of the at-risk lymphatic basins serves two important purposes: (1) to remove and identify occult metastasis in patients in whom cervical metastasis are at risk; the elective neck dissection (note should be made here that the term "prophylactic neck dissection" should be avoided and replaced with the more accurate term elective neck dissection when discussing removal of at-risk lymphatic basins in the absence of clinical evidence of metastasis); or (2) to remove macroscopic disease in patients in whom metastasis are highly suspected based on imaging, clinical examination, or biopsy via fine-needle aspiration: termed therapeutic neck dissection. A brief overview of neck dissection follows with more comprehensive reviews outlining technique available elsewhere [175].

The importance of treating the cervical lymph nodes was stressed by Crile in his landmark 1906 paper [176] and was later popularized by Martin and coworkers [177]. Generations of surgeons were trained in the classic radical neck dissection (Fig. 34.16). Improved understanding of the regional lymphatic flow and nodal basins at risk for metastases from different primary locations has led to an increasing number of modifications of the standard radical neck dissection. The resultant, often misused, terminology of neck dissection was standardized by the American Academy of Otolaryngology's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology in 1991 [178]. Revisions were proposed in 2002 to improve communication among clinicians [179]. These proposed changes were primarily in regard to the selective neck dissections, and specific names such as "supraomohyoid neck dissection" were eliminated in favor of the phrase "selective neck dissection" followed in parentheses by the levels removed.

# Definitions

The definitions pertinent to oral cavity cancer are

Radical neck dissection: Refers to the removal of all ipsilateral cervical lymph node groups extending from the inferior border of the mandible to the clavicle, from the lateral border of the sternohyoid muscle, hyoid bone, and contralateral anterior belly of the digastric muscle medially to the anterior border of the trapezius. Included are

levels I through V. This entails the removal of three important nonlymphatic structures—the internal jugular vein, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the spinal accessory nerve.

- Modified radical neck dissection: Refers to removal of the same lymph node levels (I-V) as the radical neck dissection, but with preservation of the spinal accessory nerve, the internal jugular vein, or the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The structures preserved should be named. Some authors propose subdividing the modified neck dissection into three types:  
- Type I preserves the spinal accessory nerve.*.  
Type II preserves the spinal accessory nerve and the sternocleidomastoid muscle*.  
- Type III preserves the spinal accessory nerve, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the internal jugular vein.*.  
- Selective neck dissection: Refers to the preservation of one or more lymph node groups normally removed in a radical neck dissection. In the 1991 classification scheme, there were several "named" selective neck dissections. For example, the supraomohyoid neck dissection removed the lymph nodes from levels I to III (Fig. 34.17). The subsequent proposed modification in 2001 sought to eliminate these "named" dissections. The committee proposed that selective neck dissections be named for the cancer that the surgeon was treating and to name the node groups removed in parenthesis. For example, a selective neck dissection for oral cavity cancer would encompass those node groups most at risk (levels I–III) and be referred to as a selective neck dissection (levels I–III).  
Extended neck dissection: Refers to the removal of one or more additional lymph node groups, nonlymphatic structures, or both, not encompassed by a radical neck dissection. For example, mediastinal nodes or nonlymphatic structures such as the carotid artery or hypoglossal nerve.

Fig. 34.16 Standard radical neck dissection of the right neck

It is important to remember that classification schemes are continually changing, and as science evolves, the indications for different dissections will certainly change. For an oral cavity primary without evidence of lymph node metastases, a selective neck dissection removing lymph nodes from levels I to III is the generally accepted procedure. Shah and associates [180] demonstrated supraomohyoid neck dissection to eradicate occult metastatic disease in  $95\%$  of patients. Some surgeons, however, advocate including level IV (extended supraomohyoid neck dissection) to decrease

the risk, however small, of missed occult metastases (see earlier discussion). Extension on the left side does entail an increased risk to the thoracic duct and the possibility of a chyle leak. Modifications of neck dissections have been made in an attempt to prevent the morbidity of radical neck dissection. Preservation of the spinal accessory nerve decreases the incidence of painful shoulder syndrome. Extensive skeletonization of the nerve, however, can result in significant dysfunction even if the nerve is preserved. Several studies have suggested that dissection of level IIb (above the nerve) may be unnecessary in the clinically negative neck because of the low incidence of metastases in this area  $(1.6\%)$  and is recommended only if bulky disease is present in level IIa [181].

If there is clinical evidence of lymph node metastases, controversy exists over the proper type of neck dissection (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.16, later). The application of supraomohyoid neck dissection to the  $\mathrm{N + }$  neck (therapeutic neck dissection) has yielded mixed results [182]. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients undergoing selective neck dissections for N0 necks have a higher rate of recurrence in the neck if positive nodes are ultimately found in the pathologic specimen. This can be improved by the addition of postoperative radiation treatment [183]. The question remains as to whether this is due to the type of neck dissection or simply the biology of the tumor [184, 185]. Most surgeons advocate some form of neck dissection if there is demonstrable evidence of metastatic disease in the neck, and a diminishing number of surgeons maintain that the evidence of lymph node metastases is justification for nothing less than a standard radical neck dissection.

Another controversy regarding the evolution of neck dissection concerns the concept of in-continuity versus discontinuous neck dissections. In the past, it was considered mandatory to remove the primary tumor in direct continuity with the neck dissection, in one

specimen. Work by Spiro and Strong [186] found no adverse impact on survival when neck dissection was performed in a discontinuous manner. Bias might have occurred, however, because smaller lesions were in the discontinuity group. A study by Leemans and colleagues [187] found worse outcomes in stage II cancer of the tongue with discontinuous neck dissection, with local recurrence rates of  $19.1\%$  versus  $5.3\%$  and a 5-year survival of  $63\%$  versus  $80\%$ . Most surgeons prefer an incontinuity approach if technically feasible, without the resection of obviously uninvolved structures such as the mandible.

The controversy surrounding END versus elective neck irradiation (without neck dissection) continues. Advantages of surgery include the production of a surgical specimen that guides the need for further treatment. If no lymph nodes are identified, radiation can be held. The possibility of future second, third, or even fourth primary cancer arising in this at-risk population makes reserving radiation attractive. A comprehensive discussion of the management of cervical lymph nodes in head and neck cancer is beyond the scope of this chapter. Three excellent reviews are available and

recommended [157, 188-190]. Although several studies have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage in patients who undergo END versus careful follow-up and therapeutic neck dissection if a metastasis develops, most surgeons would agree that the morbidity associated with a selective neck dissection is minimal and would have a low threshold for performing it.

# Key Points

- Removal of at-risk lymphatic basins serves two important purposes: (1) to remove and identify occult metastasis in patients in whom cervical metastasis are at risk; or (2) to remove macroscopic disease in patients in whom metastasis are highly suspected based on imaging, clinical examination, or biopsy via fine-needle aspiration.  
Most surgeons advocate some form of neck dissection if there is demonstrable evidence of metastatic disease in neck.  
- Most surgeons prefer in-continuity approach if technically feasible, without resection of obviously uninvolved structures such as mandible.

# 34.15 Sentinel Node Biopsy

As the evolution toward less invasive surgical modalities proceeds, dissection of the N0 neck (staging neck dissection or END) is becoming increasingly limited. The sentinel node technique, first popularized for melanoma, has been investigated for use in head and neck cancer [191, 192]. Theoretically, it allows the identification and removal of the first-echelon lymph node ("sentinel node") that would first receive metastases from a given site. The technique involves injecting the area surrounding the primary site with a radioactive-labeled material,[99m] Tc-sulfur colloid. Various molecular weights can be chosen depending on the transit time desired. A radiograph is then taken to identify and locate the sentinel node or nodes. The patient is then taken to the operating room where the surgeon may also inject isosulfan blue dye around the primary tumor site. The dye will also drain to the sentinel node and stain it blue, assisting the surgeon in identification during surgery (Fig. 34.18). The surgeon will also use a gamma detection probe counterprobe to identify the node with the highest concentration of radioactive colloid. The best results are obtained when at least two of the three localization techniques—preoperative imaging, intraoperative identification using blue dye, and/or intraoperative identification using the gamma probe—are used in combination.

The node is then removed, confirmed with the gamma probe, and if it is histologically positive, further

treatment such as radiation may be indicated. In melanoma, sentinel node biopsy has a reported sensitivity of  $82\%$  to  $100\%$  and very few false negatives [193, 194].

The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) technique has been investigated in the head and neck with varying results. Problems with the application of the sentinel node technique to squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity relate to the rich lymphatic drainage with possible bilateral drainage as well as the complex anatomy in the neck, leading to difficulty in dissecting out a single node. Close proximity of the sentinel node to the primary cancer, for example, an FOM primary cancer and a closely adjacent submental node, can lead to the accumulation of colloid around the primary cancer, which obscures the sentinel node. The rich lymphovascular network can also lead to drainage to several nodes. Cevantos and coworkers [195] used the sentinel node technique in 18 oral cavity cancers with N0 necks. They compared sentinel node biopsy with CT images and PET images by obtaining a CT and PET followed by SLNB and neck dissection. They found ten true positives, six positive nodes identified on frozen section, two positive notes on evaluation of permanent pathologic specimens, and two on immunoperoxidase staining for cytokeratin. In six specimens, the sentinel node was the only positive node. They also found seven true negatives and one false negative. In one case, the sentinel node identified by the radioactive colloid did not contain cancer but another cervical node did. They also found that tumor in the node can lead to obstruction and redirection of lymphatic flow [195]. Pitman and associates [196] further demonstrated the use of the SLNB technique for the N0 neck. Hyde and colleagues [197] reported on 19 patients whose radiographic and clinical test results on their necks were negative and who underwent SLNB and PET scanning followed by conventional neck dissection. In 15 of the 19 patients, the sentinel node as well as the remaining nodes were negative. In three of the 19 patients, the sentinel node was positive along with other nodes. In one patient, the sentinel node was negative, but another node removed in the neck dissection was positive. The node was located close to the primary cancer, which often leads to difficulty discriminating activity due to the tumor and that of adjacent nodes. Interestingly, PET failed to reveal cancer in the four patients with subsequently identified cervical metastasis (see discussion on PET scanning, earlier) [197].

Shellenberger [198] offers an excellent review of the application of SLNB in oral cavity squamous cancer. An important point in the application of SLNB technique to oral cavity cancers is that multiple lymph nodes (usually 3-5) are usually removed from an area selected by the localization technique, making the procedure actually a very highly selective neck dissection [198].

Recently, Civantos and coworkers [199] released the results of a multi-institutional trial evaluating the efficacy of sentinel node technique for interrogating the N0 neck in oral cavity cancer. They reported 140 patients treated over a 3-year period among 25 institutions. The majority were oral tongue cancers, and small lesions ( $<6\mathrm{mm}$  diameter and "minimally invasive") were excluded. They found a negative predictive value for SLNB of  $94\%$ , which improved to  $96\%$  with additional sectioning and immunohistochemistry. Extrapolating this to a population with an occult metastatic rate of  $30\%$  would lead to a  $4\%$  failure rate in the neck. As with previous studies, accuracy was improved with tongue lesions as compared with FOM sites. Importantly, they found acceptable results with relatively inexperienced surgeons. Their finding that additional sections and immunohistochemistry play a critical component of SLNB technique is in agreement with other studies [199]. It must be emphasized that the increased pathologic scrutiny (additional sectioning and immunohistochemistry) applied in SLNB technique has resulted in a significant number of necks being upstaged (as many as  $8\%$ ), compared with traditional pathologic techniques. The clinical significance of this example of stage migration remains unclear. One wonders how many negative ENDs for the clinically N0 neck are, in fact, therapeutic and whether further treatment with comprehensive neck dissection or neck irradiation should be indicated for these micrometastasis.

# 34.16 Therapeutic Neck Dissection

Patients presenting with nodal disease will usually undergo some form of therapeutic neck dissection, the nature of which varies with surgeon's preference. Some surgeons will treat all patients with suspected cervical metastases with a radical neck dissection. Most consider a modified radical neck dissection adequate, removing the internal jugular vein or sternocleidomastoid muscle if indicated by proximity to or involvement with tumor. There is some evidence that selective neck dissection may be adequate for the  $\mathrm{N + }$  neck in certain carefully selected patient populations (see discussion of selective neck dissections, earlier). Anderson and associates [200] reported the results of three academic centers in which patients with previously untreated clinically and pathologically  $\mathrm{N + }$  necks underwent selective neck dissection. They reported a regional control rate of  $94.3\%$ . Their results were comparable with those of patients undergoing more extensive neck dissections [200]. Patients presenting with massive nodal disease who are going to be treated with chemoradiotherapy or combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy can

present a challenge to surgeons who are faced with the option of surgery before or after radiation. Not infrequently, surgeons are faced with complete clinical resolution of disease and neither surgeon nor patient looks forward to a neck dissection in a heavily irradiated field. There is some variation in approaches to this dilemma. Some surgeons recommend pretreatment neck dissection to remove bulky disease, whereas others plan a neck dissection 4-6 weeks after treatment regardless of response. Still others recommend a CT scan at 4 weeks and CT-guided biopsy of any suspicious nodes. This is followed by neck dissection if the node biopsy is positive for cancer. McHam and colleagues [201] found that clinical factors did not predict patients with residual disease after chemoradiation therapy and recommended neck dissection in all patients initially seen with N2 to N3 disease. This recommendation was made in light of a  $26 - 35\%$  complication rate in patients undergoing neck dissections after chemoradiation therapy [201]. The role of PET scanning in this situation has not been completely defined. Some investigators have demonstrated that a negative PET/CT scan may be an indication for observation alone after complete response to chemoradiotherapy, even in the face of necrotic nodes and nodes larger than  $3\mathrm{cm}$  [202]. Patients with recurrent cancer after multimodality therapy typically have a poor outcome, making salvage surgery an unattractive alternative.

Surgical management of cervical lymph node metastasis, both occult and evident, continues to evolve. It is clear that metastases are an indication of aggressiveness and portend a poorer prognosis. Once the cancer has developed, the necessary genetic mutations to break free and colonize independent of the primary tumor, the chance of cure with single-modality therapy diminishes. In his presidential address to the New England Surgical Society, Blake Cady referred to "... lymph node metastases as the speedometers of the oncologic vehicle, not the engine. Indicators, not governors of survival." [203] Clearly, the role of the radical neck dissection has diminished greatly over the past few decades as less invasive surgical techniques for dealing with the cervical lymphatics have gained popularity. This trend will likely continue as the role of surgery in the control of metastatic disease is better defined [204-206].

# 34.17 Recurrence and Follow-Up Surveillance

In 1984, Vikram and coworkers [207-209] published a series of reports that discussed patterns of failure in patients treated with multimodality therapy for head and neck cancer. This classic series of articles outlined

failure characteristics at the local site, neck, and distant sites as well as the development of second malignant neoplasms in patients treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York [183, 207-209]. Ninety percent of patients who will suffer a recurrence of oral cavity cancer will do so in the first 2 years. For this reason, patients are placed in a structured follow-up. Stage at recurrence is the most important predictor of survival, with stage I at recurrence associated with a median survival of 24.3 months and a disease-free survival at 2 years of  $73\%$ , whereas stage IV recurrence was associated with a median survival of 9.3 months and a 2-year disease-free survival of  $22\%$  [210]. Follow-up protocols vary widely and are intended to detect recurrences early. De Visscher and Manni [211] suggested the following protocols:

1. Every 2 months for 1 year.  
2. Every 3 months for year 2.  
3. Every 4 months for year 3.  
4. Every 6 months for years 4 and 5.  
5. Then yearly.

Despite this and other suggested follow-up protocols, the follow-up schedule must be tailored to the individual patient and must take into account the patient's likelihood of having a recurrence, possible continuation of smoking or other habits, ability to travel and keep appointments, and the potential availability of local medical or dental care that might assist in follow-up surveillance. Follow-up appointments include an update of patient history and review of systems as well as clinical examination for recurrence or detection of new primaries. Questions raised by physical examination should prompt an appropriate imaging study, rebiopsy, or examination under anesthesia. Caution should be used, however, in performing biopsies in patients who have received intensive multimodality therapy, such as RAD-PLAT, brachytherapy, or hyperfractionated radiation schedules combined with chemotherapy. Extensive biopsy wounds are notorious for slow healing in this setting and can lead to the development of chronic wounds.

Appropriate imaging, including a baseline CT or MRI at the completion of multimodality therapy, is invaluable. PET scanning can also play a useful role in surveillance, but findings should be correlated with other clinical data, because false positives occur. Combined with CT, PET has been shown to be accurate in predicting the need for salvage surgery in some settings [212]. Failure at the primary cancer site will ultimately occur in approximately  $20\%$  of patients, and regional recurrence in the neck will occur in  $10\%$ . Death from distant metastases is rare, occurring in only approximately  $1 - 4\%$  of cases in which locoregional control is maintained. An unfortunate consequence of

improved control at the primary cancer site with multimodality therapy is an increasing incidence of patients with distant metastases. In addition to recurrences, prospective studies have demonstrated that second primary cancers develop at a rate of  $4 - 7\%$  annually in patients who have had a head and neck squamous cancer. Second primary cancers are the leading cause of death among patients who have undergone treatment for early-stage oral cancer [183, 207-209].

The ability of a cancer to metastasize depends on the development of a series of genetic mutations, allowing for cells to disseminate from the primary tumor, arrest in the microcirculation, extravagate, infiltrate into stroma, and survive and proliferate as a new colony. Surveillance for distant metastases, therefore, becomes an important component of the follow-up evaluation. The lungs are the most common site for distant metastases, followed by the liver and bone. Yearly or biannual chest radiographs can detect lung metastases, the most common distant site of metastasis for oral cavity cancer, as well as primary lung cancers, which are not uncommon in the population at risk for oral cancer [213]. Given the current unavailability of an effective treatment regimen, however, some authors have questioned the use of annual or semiannual chest radiographs [214]. PET scanning may prove to be a more valuable alternative for detection of distant disease and, in the case of second primary tumors, may identify these lesions at a stage early enough that they can be successfully treated. Yearly laboratory work to include liver function studies is also recommended. In patients who have received radiation as part of their treatment, periodic thyroid function tests are helpful, because some will slowly become hypothyroid.

Collins [215] stated that patients with head and neck cancer are probably never cured and that it is better to consider that the host-tumor relationship has been durably altered in favor of the host. It is important to realize that approximately one third of patients with presumed localized disease will relapse and die of cancer. In advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,  $20 - 30\%$  will survive,  $40 - 60\%$  of patients will suffer locoregional recurrence, and  $20 - 30\%$  will succumb to distant metastases. Hence, the majority of treatment failures remain recurrence of locoregional disease [215]. Patients with recurrent disease are reevaluated, which requires a similar evaluation as the original. Although this process is often referred to as "restaging," the original tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage remains unchanged. Panendoscopy and examination under anesthesia take on greater importance when a clinician is faced with examination of tissue scarred and distorted by previous surgery and radiation. Distant metastases should be ruled out to the extent possible

before deciding on aggressive retreatment. If the recurrence is confined to the locoregional area, treatment decisions are limited by previous therapy. RRT protocols exist but are accompanied by significant morbidity [216]. Intensive RRT and chemotherapy protocols are being investigated and show some promise [217]. RRT protocols combining chemotherapy with additional radiation are gaining popularity in some centers. Side effects are significant, but manageable in most cases, and 1- and 2-year survival rates of  $40 - 50\%$  and  $15 - 27\%$  have been reported [218]. These studies of RRT include all head and neck subsites, and RRT of local oral cavity recurrence entails much greater morbidity.

The morbidity of such treatments is significant, and their use should be restricted to clinical trials at this time. Surgical salvage remains the primary option, but the extent of salvage surgery must be considerably broader than might initially be considered. Goodwin [210] reported on the outcome of salvage surgery for recurrent head and neck cancers and found benefit in stages I and II. Success was limited in more advanced disease [210]. DFI is an important prognostic indicator, and DFIs less than 1 year are associated with poor prognosis [219]. In the future, biologic markers may play a crucial role in evaluating prognosis and guiding therapy. For example, low expression of EGFR is associated with improved outcome after salvage surgery for locoregional relapse. Clearly defined goals should be established between surgeon and patient for salvage surgery. Is the operation for cure or palliation? Palliative surgery should be undertaken very cautiously because surgical complications may greatly overshadow the palliative goals. Patients and their families must have realistic expectations as well as understand that there is no benefit from repeated surgical intervention for recalcitrant cancer.

As discussed earlier (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.9, earlier) immunotherapy is showing promise for recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Two immune checkpoint inhibitors, Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab were approved in 2016 by the Food and Drug Administration for second-line treatment of recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (studies KEYNOTE-012 and CheckMate 141) [111].

Patients with inoperable cancer pose a unique challenge to the clinician. Because cure is no longer a realistic option, treatment modalities to prolong life and improve quality of life assume a higher priority. Chemotherapeutic options are improving (see  $\triangleright$  Sect. 34.8, earlier). Pain control becomes a significant issue in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer. Long-acting sustained-release formulations such as transdermal narcotic patches combined with short-acting

narcotics for breakthrough pain are typically required. Rhizotomy is an option for intractable pain. Pain control can be a realistic goal of palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Novel methods for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into the tumor are under development. A combination of cisplatin and epinephrine gel injected into recurrent tumors demonstrated significant palliation without major side effects in most patients [220]. Wound management becomes an important issue, and dealing with large malodorous wounds can be taxing on patients and families. Patients presenting with advanced head and neck cancer will typically survive 6 to 12 months without treatment, and patients with end-stage head and neck cancer will have a median survival of 101 days [215]. The most common cause of death is aspiration pneumonia.

There is a natural tendency for clinicians to avoid the dying patient. There is a reluctance to face a disease whose biology has resisted their best efforts and whose treatment has left patients debilitated and frequently deformed. While family members and clinicians are discussing further treatment options, patients are frequently simply concerned with pain control and the effects of massive doses of narcotics on bowel function. Frank, thoughtful discussions must be held with the patients and their families regarding end-of-life issues and will help surgeons focus on these very real concerns. Hospice provides an excellent resource at multiple levels, and once the patient is enrolled, most families are greatly appreciative of the support offered by these professionals in end-of-life care.

In this era of improved treatment modalities for local and regional disease, clinicians are finding that factors unrelated to the primary cancer and beyond their control are influencing survival. It is becoming increasingly evident that factors affecting outcome in oral cancer patients are multiple and may relate more to patient characteristics than the cancer itself or the treatment they receive. Researchers are finding that genetic factors of the primary cancer have an impact on the response of the particular tumor to any treatment [221]. High expression of EGFR is associated with poor outcome and may indicate the need for more intensive multimodality therapy. Alterations in TP53 have been associated with recurrence in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck that was refractory to radiation treatment. Future treatments may include restoration of TP53 function [222].

Importantly, studies are also demonstrating that comorbidities and performance status predict survival independent of stage at diagnosis. Performance status has been shown to be a predictor of survival independent of TNM stage. Many head and neck cancer patients suffer other medical problems related to tobacco and

alcohol use, and these can result in decreased overall survival despite what might be a more favorable cancerspecific survival. Ribeiro and associates [223] found that daily alcohol consumption, smoking, poor body mass index, and other comorbidities had an independent impact on prognosis. As discussed earlier, there may indeed be a more aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma that affects younger patients, but data from the National Cancer Data Base indicate that younger patients have a survival advantage that is most likely related to their lack of comorbidities [224]. Frequently 5- and 10-year survival curves are affected more by these comorbidities than the tumor characteristics recorded in the TNM system (see later discussion) [225]. The TNM staging system will continue to undergo revisions to enhance its use.

# 34.18 Future Treatments

In the future, biologic markers hold out promise as the key to treatment of head and neck squamous cancers. Serving as potential targets for gene therapy, biologic markers may also determine appropriate treatment strategies and may select which patients should be treated with surgery, radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or combination treatment. Certain subpopulations of squamous cancers, those with high levels of  $TP53$  expression and low levels of the marker Ki-67, for example, have higher relapse rates after initial therapy. These patients may benefit from more aggressive combination treatments [221, 222].

Every few years, a new cancer therapy is heralded as the end of cancer surgery. For the present, surgery will continue to play the key role in management of oral cavity cancers, and surgeons must be knowledgeable in all diagnostic and treatment modalities as they continue their captainship of the oral cancer team. The surgeons treating oral cancer, regardless of their discipline, must learn from the contributions and mistakes of their forebears and add the benefit of their own training and experience. They must then use their knowledge base and the input of other treating colleagues to synthesize a plan of treatment tailored to the unique patient who sits before them. They must interact effectively with colleagues of other disciplines with the patient's benefit their foremost concern. They must execute the surgical components of the treatment plan with accuracy and skill. They must be supportive to their patients and their patients' families at a time of great stress in their lives and must not turn away from adversity or complication. They must accept the fact that not all patients can be cured. They should derive inspiration from those who survive and satisfaction from those who might succumb in a way made more favorable by the surgeon's input.

# Conclusion

Oral cavity cancers require multidisciplinary expertise often complicated by the complex role that the oral cavity plays in speech, mastication, and swallowing.

Nearly half of those diagnosed with oral cancer will

die of their disease, with no significant change in this mortality rate over the last 50 years. Early detection and appropriate treatment of cancers remain the most effective weapons we as clinicians have against this disease. Advances in diagnosis and treatment modalities continue to evolve and show promise. Clearly, there exists a need for increasing the public's awareness of oral cancer and improving screening for early oral cancers in order to improve outcomes regardless of treatment modality employed. An in-depth knowledge of the management of oral cavity cancer extends far beyond the reach of this chapter, but with further advancements and research, a clinician will be able to use this knowledge base to better help patients afflicted with this complex disease.
