# 57.1 Introduction

End-stage disease represents the very worst condition or disease state of an organ system, at which point the organ is functioning minimally or not at all. Systemic examples are end-stage renal disease where the kidneys have essentially shut down and the patient requires dialysis or transplant in order to accomplish the role of the kidneys and end-stage cardiac disease where the heart is functioning very poorly and may need mechanical support (e.g., left ventricular assist device) or cardiac transplantation in order for the patient to survive considering the essential role of the cardiovascular system. Applying the term "end-stage" to the body's functional joints, end-stage joint disease indicates a joint that is so architecturally negatively affected by disease or injury that severe functional impairment results for the patient. As with all other joints, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is affected by any and all of the end-stage joint diseases (▶ Box 57.1) that can result from developmental disorders (▶ Fig. 57.1), neoplasia (▶ Fig. 57.2), trauma, arthritic disease (▶ Figs. 57.3 and 57.4), failed prior joint surgery (▶ Fig. 57.5), or fibrous or bony ankylosis (▶ Fig. 57.6). Regardless of the etiology of the end-stage disorder, it should be noted that the goals of any reconstructive joint surgery include improvement mandibular function and form, reduction of further suffering and disability, containment of excessive treatment and cost, and prevention of further morbidity (▶ Box 57.2) [1].

Reconstruction of the TMJ presents unique problems because of the integral and complex roles this joint plays in establishing and maintaining proper function and form within the stomatognathic system. The TMJ not only provides a secondary growth center for the mandible in prepuberty but also is primary to the functions of mastication, speech, airway support, and deglutition in both childhood and adulthood. Presently, there are three accepted management modalities available to reconstructive TMJ surgeons for total temporomandibular joint reconstruction including autogenous bone

tion osteogenesis techniques. Bioengineered TMJ devices are currently being investigated and may provide a viable option for the future [2, 3].

This chapter will discuss the management of end-stage TMJ disease considering all four of these treatment modalities, present an evidence-based literature review for each, and provide a suggested algorithm based on those reviews from which the reconstructive surgeon may determine which alternative provides the best management option for salvaging TMJ function and facial form for each individual clinical case scenario.

# 57.2 Autogenous Bone Grafting

Classically, end-stage TMJ disorders have been managed with the use of autogenous bone and soft tissue grafting (▶ Boxes 57.3 and 57.4). The costochondral

graft has been the most frequently recommended autogenous bone for the reconstruction of the TMJ due to its ease of adaptation to the recipient site, its gross anatomical similarity to the mandibular condyle, the reported low morbidity rate at the donor site, and its "growth potential" [4-9] (Fig. 57.7). The advantages of autogenous tissue TMJ reconstruction are listed in

$\triangleright$  Box 57.5; the disadvantages are enumerated in  
$\triangleright$  Box 57.6 [10]. In theory, costochondral allografts will "grow with the patient"; however, often this so-called growth potential has been reported to be unpredictable or may result in ankylosis due to allograft and/or fixation failure or may be related to noncompliance of the young patient with post-reconstruction physical

therapy [4, 11-24]. Recent studies have questioned the necessity for using a cartilaginous graft to restore and maintain mandibular growth [25, 26]. Long-term reports of mandibular growth in children whose temporomandibular joints were reconstructed with costochondral grafts revealed that excessive growth on the treated side occurred in  $54\%$  of the 72 cases examined, and equal growth with the opposite side occurred in only  $38\%$  of the cases [23, 27-32]. Further, Peltomäki et al. [33-35] in an investigation of mandibular growth

after costochondral grafting supported previous experiments with regard to the inability of the graft to adapt to the growth velocity of the new environment. Cole et al. [36] recommend the use of a composite costochondral-iliac crest technique to resolve the issue of the flexibility of growing patient ribs. The authors state that "although graft instability and resorption seem to affect adults much more frequently, we believe the limited, sometimes overly malleable costochondral material harvested in pediatric cases leads to an unacceptably high rate of failure." The authors conclude "...in the adult population where costochondral grafts for the TMJ are decidedly unpredictable, this modification may also be advantageous." Peltomäki et al. [33] studied the growth of the mandible in the marmoset animal model after costochondral grafting with emphasis on the required amount of cartilage to be included in the graft. These investigators found that depending on the amount of cartilage in the unilateral costochondral graft, the mandible is shifted toward the unoperated side. This occurs during the entire period of growth which indicated to them a strong hormonal influence. These authors concluded that these results supported previous experiments with regard to adaptability [4, 5, 34, 35] in that costochondral grafts do not seem to adapt to the growth velocity of the new environment. Poswillo [5] had reported this adaptability in young monkeys; however, the animals used in his experiments had essentially ceased their craniofacial growth. Ellis et al. [25] compared the use of sternoclavicular grafts to costochondral grafts in the monkey and concluded that these grafts behaved similarly with regard to growth/overgrowth suggesting that in growing patients maintenance of biomechanical architecture and reasonably normal function may be more important than the nature of the autogenous graft used for condylar replacement. Further, these investigators recommended retaining as little cartilage as possible to prevent overgrowth when replacing the mandibular condyle with a costochondral graft in growing individuals. While contour overgrowth with deviation of the chin to the contralateral side was reported as a significant aesthetic problem, Perrott et al. [28] state that they documented contour overgrowth of the articulating surface of only "a small group" of growing and nongrowing patients. Despite the fact that these patients did not develop malocclusions, they developed decreased mandibular range of motion as has been reported by other investigators [23, 24]. MacIntosh [9] states that the chief disadvantages of costochondral grafting are their unpredictable growth, particularly in childhood and adolescent application, and the potential for re-ankylosis when used to treat cases of ankylosis. Saeed and Kent [37] retrospectively reviewed 76 costochondral grafts (57 patients)

after a mean of 53 months (range 24-161). They reported that in patients with no previous TMJ surgery, "arthritic disease" or congenital deformity, the costochondral graft performed well. However, they concluded that a preoperative diagnosis of ankylosis was associated with a high complication rate suggesting caution in such patients using the autogenous costochondral graft.

With increasing patient age, adult ribs become mainly cortical bone and therefore contain very little cancellous bone. Consequently, when transplanted to the mandible, ribs are free grafts that rely on the ability of the local tissues to provide the optimal conditions for revascularization and ultimately the graft's survival and function. As with any bone grafting technique, it is important not only that the receptor site support revascularization and promote osteogenesis but also that stable fixation is provided over this period to allow incorporation of the donor bone into the host site. The vascularity of the recipient site will be adversely affected by the scar tissue that invariably develops from previous surgery thus compromising the vascularity and ultimate success of the autogenous costochondral free graft. It has been reported that capillaries can penetrate a maximum thickness of 180 to 220 microns of tissue, whereas scar tissue surrounding previously operated bone averages 440 microns in thickness. This may account for the clinical observation that free autogenous tissue grafts, such as cartilage and costochondral and sternoclavicu

lar grafts often fail in cases of multiply operated patients or those with extreme anatomical architectural discrepancies resulting from pathology [38]. Reitzik [39] reported that in an analogous situation to autogenous costochondral grafting, cortex-to-cortex healing after vertical ramus osteotomy in monkeys requires 20 weeks and probably 25 weeks in humans. Typically, in patients reconstructed with costochondral grafts, maxilloman-dibular fixation is maintained for only 4-6 weeks in order to return the mandible to function and prevent ankylosis. Despite screw/plate fixation, micromotion at the donor-host interface in such cases will invariably occur with early mandibular function resulting in shear movements of the graft leading to poor vascularization, nonunion, and/or potential failure [40]. Matsuura [41] reported a high incidence of failure and ankylosis of autogenous costochondral grafts in sheep after condylectomy if the jaws were only partially immobilized. Further, Whitaker et al. [42-44] reported the incidence of pneumothorax in 149 rib graft harvest patients as  $5.3\%$  and in the next 151 such patients to be  $18\%$ . They report pneumothorax in  $20 - 30\%$  of the 793 patients they studied [44]. James and Irvine [45] reported an incidence of postoperative donor site chest wound infection after rib harvest to be  $14.6\%$ . Ohara et al. reported that the frequency of residual rib deformity in donor sites was  $20\%$  when ribs were harvested from patients older than 10 years of age, while it was  $63.6\%$  in patients younger than 10 years old. The biomechanical impact of these deformities was considered because of respiratory movement of the thorax and injury to the germinal growth center of the ribs [46]. In a systematic review of the literature, Kumar and colleagues assessed the growth potential of the costochondral graft for TMJ replacement in patients with ankylosis or hemifacial macrosomia [47]. They concluded that the only evidence was in the form of case series, the lowest level of evidence. Thus, based on available evidence, they concluded that the use of a costochondral graft for TMJ replacement for its growth potential lacks scientific evidence [47]. A recent case series demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients with idiopathic condylar resorption following endoscopic condylotomy and costochondral reconstruction of the TMJ [48]. All patients had a class II malocclusion and were reconstructed to a normal overbite with a mean advancement of  $6.89~\mathrm{mm}$ . Twenty-six patients were followed for at least three years with  $88.5\%$  maintaining a normal overbite and three developing an anterior open bite. Twenty-six patients were followed for five years following costochondral graft reconstruction of their TMJs [48].

Utilization of free fibular reconstruction has also been reported in reconstruction of the TMJ in patients with hemifacial microsomia. In a case series of eight patients who underwent reconstruction of their TMJ for hemifacial microsomia, utilizing a fibula, five patients developed ankylosis of their grafts [49]. Ankylosis occurred at a mean seven years. Employing a contralateral releasing osteotomy and interposing tissue between the graft and the cranial base reduced the risk of ankylosis. Despite these complications, autogenous reconstruction still remains an appealing reconstructive option in the pediatric population, since long-term studies are not yet available for the use of alloplastic reconstruction in these patients [49]. A recent treatment algorithm for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients with TMJ involvement was published from a multinational consensus group (TMJaw) [50]. In this patient population requiring TMJ reconstruction, autogenous, orthognathic, and alloplastic reconstructions remain viable reconstructive options depending on patient disease severity [50]. Hawkins et al. queried a cohort of surgeons from the American and European Societies of Temporomandibular Joint Surgeons about their TMJ reconstruction preferences;  $95.5\%$  preferred alloplastic TMJ replacement to autogenous bone. This preference was reported based on fewer postoperative complications and more predictable outcomes using alloplastic TMJ prostheses [51].

# 57.3 Transport Distraction Osteogenesis

The use of transport distraction osteogenesis, which induces new bone formation along the vector of movement without the use of a bone graft, has been employed as a reconstruction option for a variety of mandibular defects, including condylar reconstruction [52-54]. The techniques described include a vertical ramus-type osteotomy of the mandible following correction of the indication for TMJR (e.g., gap arthroplasty for ankylosis). Following the ramus osteotomy (or corticotomy), a distraction device is placed with a vertical vector to move the proximal segment of the mandible toward the glenoid fossa (Fig. 57.8). This form of reconstruction takes advantage of the fibrocartilaginous cap that forms on the advancing front of the distracted bone heading towards the fossa, thereby creating a "cartilage cap" on the newly formed condyle, which may function more normally than a pseudoarthrosis (Fig. 57.9). Stucki-McCormick et al. [45, 46, 55, 56] reported the applica

![](images/1ad25d42c1bbd52790911bd3a803d8ec9e8758db0ff7ff52006a2793efed7d50.jpg)

tion of transport distraction osteogenesis to reconstruct the mandibular condyle in two patients as well as in the animal model. Cavaliere et al. [47, 57] reported using similar methods to manage hemifacial microsomia patients with 1- and 2-year follow-up, respectively. The long-term growth potential for the use of this modality in the reconstruction of prepubescent cases also has yet to be determined. McCarthy et al. [52] in 1992 developed the technique for mandibular elongation in patients with hemifacial microsomia and Nager's syndrome. Since then, distraction osteogenesis has been used for craniofacial lengthening [58-60], bifocal distraction for repair of mandibular defects [61, 62], mandibular widening [63], and increasing alveolar height [64]. Pensler et al. [65] in 1995 reported a case of a  $5 - 1 / 2$  -year-old with micrognathia and TMJ ankylosis treated with distraction osteogenesis. Diner et al. [66] in 1997 reported on a series of 9 children with mandibular hypoplasia caused by TMJ ankylosis treated with distraction osteogenesis. Acero-Sanz [67] et al. also in 1997 reported the use of distraction osteogenesis in the management of a 2-year-old with bilateral TMJ hypoplasia. In 1999, Dean and Alamillos [68] and Papageorge and Apostolidis [69] reported the management of TMJ ankylosis in growing patients utilizing simultaneous distraction osteogenesis and TMJ arthroplasty. These studies stress that experience with this technique in the management of childhood ankylosis and long-term follow-up are important,

but according to Moss' functional matrix theory [70], with the association of distraction osteogenesis and TMJ arthroplasty, the conditions for normal mandibular growth should develop properly. In 2000, Yanehara et al. [71] reported a case of an 11-year-old boy with bilateral TMJ ankylosis and resultant severe micrognathia managed with bilateral distraction osteogenesis. They describe the greatest advantage of distraction osteogenesis as the gradual distraction of the soft tissues as well as the hard tissues associated with the mandible. Yoon and Kim [72] in 2002 reported good results after more than 2 years follow-up after the use of intraoral distraction osteogenesis in a growing and an adult patient with mandibular asymmetry and unilateral TMJ bony ankylosis. Molina [73] and Ortiz Monasterio et al. [74] state that many cases of hemifacial microsomia treated in infancy will require a second course of distraction osteogenesis or formal orthognathic surgery later in life to maintain the position of the mandible. However, in cases associated with mandibular hypoplasia as the result of TMJ ankylosis, the etiology is traumatic, rather than developmental, in nature, and therefore, correction of function of the associated bone and soft tissues should result in normal mandibular growth potential based on the functional matrix theory [70]. A further demonstration of Moss' theory may be inferred from a report by Nitzan et al. [75] They report on the management of 4 patients (3 female, 1 male, ages 9-48 years) with Type III TMJ ankylosis in whom they freed the ankylosis and retained of the displaced disc and condyle complex only followed by aggressive active physiotherapy to restore mandibular function. After 15-to 60-month follow-up, all patients had significantly improved mandibular function, and the 9-year-old with preoperative facial asymmetry demonstrated complete symmetrical growth 5 years after surgery. In the other growing patients, 15 months postoperative, improved facial symmetry was reported. Despite the short-term promising clinical results, the histomorphologic changes in the associated joint structures, i.e., cartilage, disc, and masticatory musculature, have not been elucidated completely. Experimental studies with rabbits and monkeys addressing this issue have appeared in the literature [76, 77]. Based on their animal experiments, Zhu et al. [77] list several potential advantages of mandibular condyle reconstruction using transport distraction over conventional autogenous bone grafting: (1) avoidance of donor site morbidity; (2) the rigid distraction device allows for immediate postoperative physical therapy which allows for the formation of a pseudo-arthritis and prevents ankylosis; and (3) the risk of bone graft necrosis and resorption is greatly reduced compared to nonvascular

ized free-bone grafts (i.e., costochondral) because the transported bone in this technique retains its internal muscle and periosteal blood supply. However, these experimental studies were carried out in animals with normal TMJs, and extrapolation of this data to patients with compromised TMJ anatomy due to pathology or multiple prior surgeries remains a question and concern when utilizing this technique.

# 57.4 Bioengineered Tissue for Total Joint Reconstruction

Mandibular condyle tissue engineering has been proposed recently to address the current limitations of both autogenous and alloplastic reconstruction options [78, 79]. A tissue engineering strategy would incorporate a biodegradable scaffold delivering biologic substances

such as cells, genes, and/or proteins to regenerate the bone/cartilage tissues of the mandibular condyle. Tissue engineering could be applied to regenerate localized defects or, theoretically, the entire articulating condylar surface. Implementation could take one of three approaches: (1) ex vivo growth of tissue on the scaffold/biologic composite in a bioreactor before implantation on the mandible, (2) implantation of the scaffold/biologic composite at secondary surgical site before implantation on the mandible, and (3) direct implantation at the mandible site [79]. While this modality holds the potential to revolutionize the TMJ reconstruction in the future, there are many biological, physiological, mechanical, regulatory, and ethical issues that must be tested and addressed before it becomes a clinical reality.

Salash et al. concluded that the management of patients requiring TMJ reconstruction as the result of (1) irreparable condylar trauma, (2) developmental or acquired TMJ pathology in skeletally immature patients, (3) hyperplasia, and (4) documented metal hypersensitivities could be indications for bioengineered condyle and ramus TMJ components [80]. There was consensus that Wilkes Stage III internal derangement might be an

indication for use of a bioengineered TMJ disc or possibly even a disc-like bioengineered "fossa liner." However, there was some controversy as to whether TMJ arthritic disease (e.g., osteoarthritis) and reconstruction after failed alloplastic devices should be indications. Contraindications for the use of bioengineered TMJ components could include patients with TMJ disorders and multiple failed surgeries, parafunctional oral habits, persistent TMJ infection, TMJ rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosis unless the underlying pathology can be resolved [80]. Lastly, utilization of intra-articular stem cells remains an exciting option both for its potential regenerative capacity and anti-inflammatory properties [81].

# 57.5 Alloplastic Total Joint Reconstruction

In order to avoid the donor site morbidity associated with autogenous bone grafting, alloplastic TMJR has become an acceptable alternative to autogenous grafting.

In 1960, Sir John Charnley, the father of orthopedic low-friction alloplastic joint replacement, reported the use of a total alloplastic prosthetic hip reconstruction system utilizing a metal-backed, polyethylene-lined acetabular cup articulating with a chromium cobalt femoral head attached to a titanium femoral shaft component that was cemented to place with polymethylmethacrylate [83]. Modifications of this device, utilizing highly cross-linked ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene and no cement, have become the "gold standard" not only for hip but also for knee and shoulder, replacement devices in orthopedic surgery [84]. The modern practice of reconstructive orthopedic surgery would be unthinkable without the use of alloplastic joint replacements.

All implanted alloplastic devices (dental implants, orthopedic, and TMJ prostheses) depend on the principle of osseointegration of the components for their ultimate stability and longevity. Osseointegration implies the direct incorporation of the implant by the bone without the preliminary phase of fibrous tissue ingrowth. The requirements for osseointegration are essentially the same

as for primary fracture healing – the transmission of forces from the implant to the bone and vice versa – must occur without relative motion or without intermittent loading [85]. Therefore, just as with a dental implant, the most important principle in total joint alloplastic reconstruction is primary stability of the device components from the moment of their implantation (▶ Box 57.6).

In orthopedic surgery, total joint alloplastic devices can be initially stabilized by press fitting or cementation into the cancellous shaft of the host long bone. Unfortunately, in the case of the TMJ, the anatomy of the mandible and the nonlinear architecture of temporal glenoid fossa do not provide such options. Therefore, screw fixation of both the fossa and ramus/condyle components of all TMJ alloplastic devices must be utilized for initial fixation and stabilization. Compounding the stability problems in the TMJ region is the fact that most patients presenting with indications for total TMJ alloplastic reconstruction have either fossa or ramus anatomy distortion as a result of end-stage disease. There may be local and/or systemic relative contraindications to alloplastic TMJR (▶ Box 57.7).

# 57.6 History of Alloplastic TMJ Reconstruction

Alfred Stille [86] said "Medicine, like all knowledge, has a past as well as a present and a future, and ... in that past is the soil out of which improvement must grow." Therefore, a look back is important to the understanding of the use of alloplastic materials in joint reconstruction.

The citations made in this section are intended to show that many surgeons in the past found a need for alloplastic TMJ reconstruction in particularly difficult clinical situations. Further, it provides an archive the materials and methods used in these cases (▶ Box 57.8). Typically, the materials used in these devices mirrored their introduction into industry and medicine. It must be noted that in many instances the reports of the use of these materials were of single cases and their follow-up was typically 1 year or less with the only criteria for success being that the patient could open their mouth.

Prior to 1980, alloplastic joint replacement or resurfacing (hemiarthroplasty/partial joint replacement) was performed mainly in cases of ankylosis, after ablative surgery and trauma, or in severe joint disease. After the mid- to late 1980s, partial and total TMJ devices were also being used to manage failed nonsurgical and surgical TMJ patients.

In 1840, John Murray Carnochan [87] was credited with the idea of interposing material between the surfaces of a diseased joint. He reported an attempt to mobilize a patient's ankylosed TMJ by placing a small block of wood between the raw bony surfaces of the residual mandible after creating a gap at the neck of the condyle. In 1890, a German surgeon, Gluck [88], reported total joint arthroplasties using ivory prosthetic TMJ and hip joints which he stabilized with cement made of colophony, pumice, and gypsum. Risdon [89], in 1933, reported the treatment of an ankylosis of the TMJ by interposing gold foil between the bony surfaces after a gap was created. Eggers [90], in 1946, and Goodsell [91], in 1947, reported the use of tantalum foil in cases of TMJ ankylosis. In 1951, Castigliano [92] and Kleitsch [93] resurfaced the bone in TMJ ankylosis cases with vitallium. In 1952, Smith [94] reported hemiarthroplasty for ankylosis using stainless steel. Ueno [95], in 1955, reported experimental and clinical results with zirconium in TMJ ankylosis. In 1960, Henry [96] described replacement of an ankylosed TMJ with prosthesis, and Robinson [97] reported correction of a TMJ ankylosis by creating an artificial stainless steel fossa. In 1963 [98], 1964 [99], and 1970 [100] Christensen reported resurfacing of the glenoid fossa with a thin vitallium fossa-eminence prosthesis in cases of TMJ ankylosis. He added a ramus-condyle component with a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) head and a vitallium ramal component to create a total TMJ prosthesis. Chase et al. [101], in 1995, reported on the results of the use of both devices in recent use. In 1996, a chromium-cobalt condylar head was offered as an option to the PMMA. Recently, Garrett et al. [102] reported the use of a custom modification of the standard Christensen total alloplastic TMJ prosthesis for use in multiply operated patients. Small et al. [103] experimented with the use of Teflon and Silastic in mandibular reconstruction and in 1964 reported that Teflon seemed more adaptable to restoration of large mandibular resections, whereas Silastic seemed better suited for replacement of the condyle. In 1968, Robinson [104] reported on the use of Silastic in a case of temporomandibular joint ankylosis as an interpositional material; other reports of the use of Silastic for partial TMJ reconstruction soon followed [105–111]. Hellinger [112], also in 1964, reported the use of tantalum foil in such cases and was the first to stress the importance of physical therapy in the rehabilitation of

these patients. Hahn and Corgill [113], in 1970, first reported the use of ramus-condyle hemi-arthroplasty prosthesis for the treatment of ankylosis. The condylar component was fashioned from dental polymethylmethacrylate. The ramus component was stainless steel wire mesh. In 1971 [114], 1975 [115], and 1977 [116] Morgan presented another form of fossa resurfacing device which consisted of a vitallium eminence prosthesis and a Silastic fossa component. He added a variation of the Hahn and Corgill ramus-condyle component with a polyoxymethylene (Delrin) condyle to make a total joint prosthesis. House et al. [117], in 1984, reported the results of the use of the Morgan devices. In 1992, Morgan [118] reviewed the development of alloplastic materials for TMJ prostheses with an emphasis on his prostheses described above. In 1972, Taurus [119] first reported the use of a custom-made cast gold ramus-condyle hemi-articulation in reconstruction of a TMJ.

Hinds et al. [120] in 1974 reported the use of a Proplast-Teflon-coated vitallium ramus-condyle component for hemi-articulation reconstruction of the TMJ. Kent, in 1983, reported the use of a Dacron/Proplast-Teflon (VK-I) and later still a Dacron/ProplastTeflon/ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) (VK-II) fossa [121-123].The ramus-condyle and fossa components were then reported as used as a total alloplastic TMJ reconstruction prosthetic device. Kent et al. [124], in 1993, reported long-term follow-ups.

In 1974, Kiehn [125] applied the principles used in total hip reconstruction to the TMJ, utilizing a vitallium mandibular fossa plate reinforced on its temporal side with polymethylmethacrylate and a vitallium modified Cargill-Hahn ramus/condyle prosthesis. In 1978, the same author presented a follow-up of 27 patients who had undergone total TMJ reconstruction using the same prostheses previously described for the treatment of ankylosis, arthritis, neoplasm, infection, or refractory pain. They reported 23 successful cases over a 1- to 3-year period of follow-up, success being defined by the authors as being the ability to open the mouth to eat without pain [126].

In 1978, Kummooana [127] essentially reproduced the work of Kiehn in 6 monkeys. After 9 to 10 months of function, half failed due to condylar component failure. Microscopically, there was a minimum of inflammatory cells, no evidence of infection, well-organized granulation tissue, and collagen fibers with fibrous tissue beneath the cement and condylar component. Reaction to the bone cement appeared good. Collagen fibers ran parallel to the implant. The bone in the surrounding area was vital and healthy, and, in some areas, the fibrous tissue had turned to bone. Microradiographs demonstrated tolerance of the metallic joint and bone

cement, with incorporation by healthy granulation tissue, collagen fibers, and new bone to such an extent as to justify complete biological acceptance of the implant by the natural tissue. This was the second report of animal studies with alloplastic TMJ devices after Ueno [95].

In 1985 [128] and again in 1990 [129] Schonnenberg and Schonnenberg reported the use of a total TMJ device which consisted of a cobalt-chrome-molybdenum (CoCrMo) ramus-condyle component which articulated against an UHMWPE fossa. This mimicked the materials and geometry used in the design of orthopedic alloplastic joint replacement prostheses. Van Loon evaluated potential wear rates of a TMJ prosthesis utilizing an in vivo model of a metal-on-polyethylene joint. The wear rate of the polyethylene was found to be  $0.47\mathrm{mm}$  [3] per million cycles. This corresponds to an expected in vitro wear rate of  $0.65\mathrm{mm}$  [3] per year, which was within an acceptable rate of wear and volume loss [130].

Others reported on the development and use of alloplastic partial and total temporomandibular joint reconstruction prostheses. The indications for their use ranging from ankylosis to reconstruction after ablative surgery for disease and/or trauma to the multiply operated failed TMJ patient [131-141]. Mercuri et al. [142] in 1995 reported preliminary, prospective subjective and objective outcomes with the use of a patient-fitted CAD/ CAM total alloplastic TMJ reconstruction prosthesis (Techmedica, Camarillo, CA). The ramus component of this prosthesis was titanium alloy, while the condylar component was CoCrMo. The fossa component had a

UHMWPE bearing surface backed by commercially pure titanium mesh. This was followed by further long-term studies as the TMJ Concepts (Ventura, CA) TMJR device that provided further data indicating the safety and effectiveness of TMJR for the TMJ using this device (Fig. 57.10) [143, 144].

Presently, there are two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sanctioned TMJR systems available for implantation – the 1999 FDA-approved TMJ Concepts (nee, Techmedica) patient-fitted device (TMJ Concepts, Ventura, California) (Fig. 57.11) and the 2006 FDA-approved Zimmer Biomet (nee: Biomet Lorenz) (Jacksonville, Florida) (Fig. 57.12) TMJR stock system. The Zimmer Biomet custom TMJR system to date is not FDA approved, but is presently available outside the United States. The pre-1976 Amendment Christensen stock as well as the Christensen/Garrett custom devices (nee: TMJ Implant, Inc., Golden, Colorado; then Nexus CMF, Salt Lake City) (Fig. 57.10) are no longer marketed.

TMJ Implants, Inc., and Nexus CMF also manufactured a hemiarthroplasty fossa-eminence device, originally designed to manage TMJ ankylosis, and then utilized as a disc substitute. Hemiarthroplasty, a metallic bearing surface articulating with normal articular cartilage, is frequently utilized in orthopedic surgery for fractures of the hip and shoulder in geriatric patients. The surgery was reported successful in cases where functional demands were low [145]. However, over time, the metallic component against the articular cartilage

caused cartilage wear and pain requiring total joint replacement. For this reason, hemiarthroplasty is generally not performed in young patients or in patients with preexisting degenerative joint disease [146, 147]

(  $\square$  Fig. 57.5). This device is currently not available in the United States.

While some surgeons have also advocated partial joint replacement utilizing only the condylar component, it is best to perform a total joint replacement [148]. Lindqvist [137] in 1992 and Westermark [149] in 2006 found that in cases of condylar element replacement

![](images/06373fbce61b8e2e13e837cfb3026fb98269ae2af5b3ad35e3694c8da44fb209.jpg)

alone, there was severe erosion of the fossa with significant heterotopic bone formation (Fig. 57.13).

Stock joint replacement devices require bone recontouring to develop stable platforms for component fixation. This also allows for intraoperative adjustments to optimize fit and clinical outcomes. The primary advantage of a stock TMJR device is its immediate availability. All patients require CT imaging prior to alloplastic reconstruction to determine whether a stock device is suitable or a custom device is required based on the quantity and quality of the host bone available [150, 151].

In 2005, the FDA approved the Zimmer Biomet TMJR prosthesis following a 10-year prospective Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study. Data from 224 cases is available. At 3 years, patients were found to have a significant improvement in pain, with preoperative scores decreasing from a mean of 8.5 to 2.8 out of 10. Maximum interincisal opening (MIO) improved from  $20.1\mathrm{mm}$  to  $29.3\mathrm{mm}$  at three years. Most importantly, patient satisfaction scores were high, with  $99\%$  of patients stating that in hindsight, they would undergo the surgery again. A  $3.2\%$  revision rate was seen with no mechanical failures. Revisions were secondary to infection or heterotopic bone [152].

Patient-fitted or custom-made devices, which are designed and manufactured for each specific anatomical situation, can conform to any unique anatomical situation and require no host bone alteration or supplementation to achieve initial implantation stability. Since the components interface precisely with the host bone, the screw fixation secures the components to the host bone mitigating micromotion and maximizing the opportunity for osseointegration of the components and fixation screws [153, 154].

Rapid prototyping (CAD/CAM) technology has made it possible to push the boundaries of custom

![](images/cf23db460736b29d56306a32e8dd1e9a145e32995a825ad645a7bc037e273179.jpg)

made TMJ devices to include extended versions (eTMJR) (Fig. 57.14), which may replace segmental mandibular defects or defects in the skull base with extended components for the ramus and fossa, respectively [155-160].

Ellege et al. reported on the emergence of TMJR systems around the world. They reported that a literature and internet search to date had discovered 15 countries had developed, or were developing, 27 TMJR systems, 21 being custom designed. However, only four had regulatory approval. All the devices were designed to have both a skull-based glenoid fossa component and a mandibular ramus or condyle, and 22 were similar to the designs of the TMJ Concepts and Zimmer Biomet systems. Twenty-one devices employed an UHMWPE fossa-bearing surface, and 10 had a titanium alloy condyle. Nineteen manufacturers reported that a titanium alloy was used for the ramus portion of the condyle/ramus component. Preclinical laboratory tests on 12 of the systems were reported, but no outcomes have yet been reported on nine of the 27 reviewed. The authors concluded that based on this review, not all systems were equal in terms of design, material composition, preclinical laboratory testing, manufacturing methods, regulatory status, and reports of clinical outcomes. These elements varied widely among the systems that are currently emerging; therefore, it is important that surgeons and patients understand the importance of these data when deciding on the best TMJR to employ in each specific case [161].

In 2003, Wolford et al. compared the two available TMJR systems, the stock TMJ Implants (Golden, CO) system (23 joints) and the patient-fitted or custom TMJ Concepts (22 joints) in 45 patients. The average number

of previous surgeries was 3.9 for the TMJ Implants patients and 2.6 for the TMJ Concepts patients, and the average follow-up period was 2-3 years. It was reported that the TMJ Concepts patients had statistically significant improved subjective and objective outcomes compared to the TMJ Implants group. Both groups showed good skeletal and occlusal stability over the follow-up period [162].

In 2017, in a systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis, Johnson et al. determined that functional scores improved with the TMJ Concepts patient-fitted or custom prosthesis, but this was the only prosthesis for which data were available. The Zimmer Biomet prostheses appeared to demonstrate a greater increase in MIO mean gain compared to TMJ Concepts or Nexus prostheses; however, this was heavily biased by one study. Without that bias, there was no real difference in MIO among these devices. Therefore, the authors concluded that the TMJR prostheses are similar, but most data are available for the TMJ Concepts prosthesis, with results being favorable [163].

Zou et al. in 2018, in a meta-analysis of the TMJR literature showed that stock and patient-fitted or custom TMJR devices deliver similar outcomes for decreased pain and improvements in function, diet, and MIO [164]. Table 57.1 demonstrates the major differences between stock and custom TMJR devices.

Returning the joint(s) and muscles of mastication to function as soon as possible postoperatively enhances healing and decreases the development of intra-articular scar tissue that will compromise mandibular range of motion [165]. One of the biggest advantages of alloplastic over autogenous TMJ replacement is the ability to start active physical therapy immediately postoperatively utilizing any of the commercially available jaw exercising devices (Fig. 57.15).

When calculating cost of a procedure or device, it is important that not only is the cost of the device considered but also all factors associated with its placement, including overall treatment time and patient morbidity. The major advantages of alloplastic over autogenous TMJ reconstruction are that there is no need for a second surgical site with the potential increasing morbidity, and the expensive intraoperative and postoperative hospital time is greatly decreased.

$\square$  Fig. 57.15 Postoperative home physical therapy using a commercially available jaw exercising device

Finally, the concern often raised that any alloplastic devices when utilized in the TMJ will result in the same scenario as Proplast-Teflon/silicone rubber are unfounded and unsubstantiated in a growing body of literature [142-144, 166-174]. The results of these studies support the surgical implantation of both stock and custom TMJR systems. Further, they demonstrate that properly designed and tested TMJ replacement devices, manufactured using biologically compatible materials, implanted correctly, for the appropriate indications provide safe and effective, long-term function and mandibular form management options for patients with end-stage TMJ pathology while increasing quality of life.

In conclusion, this chapter discussed the management end-stage TMJ disease employing the management options of autogenous tissue, alloplastic materials, osseodistraction, and bioengineered tissue and presented an evidence-based literature review for each of these modalities from which the reconstructive surgeon may determine which alternative provides the best management option for regaining and maintaining savaged TMJ function and facial form in the face of end-stage disease for each individual case.

Table 57.2 provides a useful resource when considering clinical options for TMJR based upon the specific indication for surgery. It should be kept in mind that in general total joint reconstruction may be considered a "salvage" procedure for end-stage TMJ disease and that "success" may need to be qualified especially in the multiply operated patient with chronic facial pain. The quality of life in these patients remains poor, and possible revision procedures may be necessary in the life-long management of this patient group.
