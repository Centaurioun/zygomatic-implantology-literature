# 45.1 Introduction

Injuries to the terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve may occur commonly after routine oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures, and the overwhelming majority of these injuries undergo spontaneous neurosensory recovery without medical or surgical intervention. Third molar surgery accounts for most of the injuries that occur to both the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the lingual nerve (LN). The reported incidence of iatrogenic nerve injury varies in the literature, but both temporary and permanent rates of paresthesia must be considered. The potential for trigeminal nerve injury exists for dentoalveolar and preprosthetic surgery, mandibular and maxillary orthognathic surgery, maxillofacial trauma, temporomandibular joint surgery, dental implant placement, endodontic therapy, esthetic facial surgery, infectious and inflammatory diseases of the jaws, and the treatment of benign and malignant head and neck pathologic lesions. The anatomy of the trigeminal nerve system is unique because it carries, in some branches, both general sensory information and special (e.g., taste) sensation. Injury to a nerve may result in neuroma formation, which can manifest with a wide spectrum of objective clinical signs and subjective patient symptoms. Nerve injuries are classified by different classification schemes (Seddon, Sunderland, and Medical Research Council System (MRCS) [Table 45.2]). The Seddon and Sunderland classifications are based upon the degree of axonal injury at the histologic light microscopic level, but, more importantly, upon the likelihood that an injured nerve will recover spontaneously after injury. The MRCS scale is based upon clinical neurosensory testing and allows standardization between clinicians and consistency in serial patient examinations. A basic understanding of nerve terminology (see Appendix) and normal neural wound healing anatomy and physiology is essential to manage most appropriately actual clinical scenarios.

The initial clinical evaluation of patients with nerve injuries should proceed in a structured and orderly fashion, with the performance of several levels of objective, and subjective, neurosensory testing to determine most

accurately the degree and severity of an individual nerve injury. A standardized clinical neurosensory test (CNT) may be used for most patients; however, some advanced testing is also available for special circumstances (e.g., gustatory (taste) testing and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) imaging). It should be remembered that there are many nonsurgical, including pharmacologic, treatments available for the patient who sustains a nerve injury, and for the majority of patients with dysesthesia or painful neuropathies, drug therapy is considered the mainstay of treatment which may involve other medical professionals, including a neurologist, neurosurgeon, or clinical pain specialist.

Once the decision is determined that the patient is a surgical candidate to potentially improve sensation with microneurosurgery, an orderly sequence of microneurosurgical steps must be followed meticulously. Specific surgical techniques depend on which nerve is involved as well as the estimated extent of the injury. In general, microneurosurgical repair of a trigeminal nerve injury involves neurolysis (surgical manipulation of the nerve) and preparation of the nerve stumps to perform neurorrhaphy (nerve repair anastomosis). The deleterious effects of tension on a nerve repair site have been well documented, so the inability to perform a primary, tension-free, nerve repair warrants consideration for a nerve graft (autograft or allograft) or some other option for nerve gap management, such as entubulation (gap or conduit repair). Following microneurosurgery, postoperative sensory reeducation may play an important role in the neural regenerative process. The overall success rates of microneurosurgical repair of the trigeminal nerve vary considerably based upon individual surgeon variability in published case reports and case series, but also due to a general lack of consensus regarding what is considered "success criteria." However, one important factor that affects the success of microneurosurgery is the length of time from injury to repair, because this affects the degree of trigeminal ganglion cell death, Wallerian degeneration of the distal axonal segment, and cerebral cortical somatosensory reorganization of the information from the target site (lower lip and chin or tongue). The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) Clinical Interest Group on Maxillofacial Neurologic Disorders has promulgated treatment time recommendations for the patient who sustains a trigeminal nerve injury, and the basic premise of these guidelines is to allow sufficient time for spontaneous neurosensory recovery, while considering the impact of delayed treatment time on final functional neurosensory outcome [1]. The critical time period for which a nerve repair is best performed has still not been established, since there are many other variables that impact upon the final outcome of microneurosurgery (e.g. surgeon experience).

The field of microneurosurgery of the trigeminal nerve is progressing rapidly considering the current advances in microsurgical techniques, diagnostic imaging technologies, available nerve graft materials, and stem cell and growth factor research; and, as more surgeons become adept at the diagnosis and treatment of patients who sustain trigeminal nerve injuries, more clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information will become available to help guide the therapeutic decision-making process. Also, postgraduate training programs in oral and maxillofacial surgery will become more capable of training surgical residents in the principles and practice of microneurosurgery, and this will hopefully foster access to this aspect of specialty care throughout the country and abroad.

# 45.2 Demographics

Trigeminal nerve injuries result from a variety of routine oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures, such as third molar odontectomy, management of facial trauma, orthognathic surgery, endosseous dental implant placement, salivary duct and gland surgery, treatment of benign and malignant lesions of the head and neck, preprosthetic surgery, and endodontic and periradicular surgery. Complications of third molar removal are responsible for the majority of injuries to the terminal branches of the third division of the trigeminal nerve [2]. These specific third molar-related nerve injuries may occur during any phase of third molar surgery, including local anesthetic injection, incision and flap design, the use of a high-speed drill for bone removal and/or tooth sectioning, elevation of the tooth with stretching of the lingual soft tissues, socket curettage in the setting of an exposed inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle, removal of remnants of an assumed "dental follicle" that may contain neural or vascular tissue or be densely adherent to the lingual or inferior alveolar nerve, the use of medicaments in the extraction site to aid healing or prevent alveolar osteitis (e.g., tetracycline-containing compounds [3, 4]), and, finally the placement of sutures in proximity to the lingual nerve. Although not a routine practice, the efficacy of LN retraction during lower third molar surgery has shown that, although the incidence of temporary LN paresthesia is increased owing to induced stretching or manipulation from the sub-periosteal dissection and physical placement and use of the lingual nerve retractor instrument (e.g. periosteal elevator or another instrument) (6.4% temporary paresthesia with retraction vs. 0.6% without retraction), the difference in long-term neurosensory dysfunction is not significant (0.6% neurosensory deficit with retraction vs. 0.2% without retraction) [5]. Other studies have indicated a temporary paresthesia rate of approximately 10–15% with LN retraction and protection, with a perma

nent paresthesia rate of less than  $1\%$ , which is comparable to the incidence without the use of a lingual nerve retractor. The use of a lingual nerve retractor was popular in other countries (e.g. United Kingdom) since the "lingual split" technique was used for mandibular third molar removal through forcible propagation of the tooth through the lingual plate. If this technique is no longer used, then routine use of a lingual nerve retractor is not indicated. On occasion, the lingual soft tissues may require protection, for example, if the stretching of the lingual soft tissues mentioned above are deemed to be excessive during elevation of the tooth from the socket. In the majority of cases of lingual nerve injury from third molar removal, the exact etiology is generally unknown since most injuries are unwitnessed (or, "closed") injuries by the surgeon during the extraction procedure.

The overall occurrence of trigeminal nerve injury may be estimated based upon a review of the available literature. Overall, the incidence of IAN injury from third molar surgery is  $0.41 - 7.5\%$  and from sagittal split osteotomy is  $0.025 - 84.6\%$ , whereas the LN is affected  $0.06 - 11.5\%$  of the time after third molar removal. However, the more important clinical distinction is to differentiate temporary from permanent paresthesia rates. For sagittal split osteotomies, temporary IAN paresthesia may be as high as  $80 - 100\%$ , but permanent rates, which are age-dependent, are typically less than  $1 - 5\%$ , although long-term IAN paresthesia following sagittal split osteotomies has been estimated to be  $10 - 15\%$ . For third molar surgery, both IAN and LN temporary paresthesia range from  $2\%$  to  $6\%$  (although some studies report a higher incidence of  $10 - 20\%$ ), whereas permanent rates are approximately one-fourth of the temporary rates, or  $0.5 - 2\%$  overall. Many risk factors for nerve injury during third molar surgery have been identified, in addition to the well-known vulnerable positions of the IAN and LN, and include: advanced patient age, female gender, depth of impaction, mesiodistal angulation of the tooth (distoangular impactions increase the risk of LN injury), lingual angulation of the tooth, close proximity of the tooth or roots to the inferior alveolar canal (IAC), iatrogenic stretching or contusion of the LN during elevation of the tooth with lingual soft tissue contact, lack of anatomic integrity of the lingual cortical plate, the need for bone removal and tooth sectioning, removal of bone distal to the third molar, iatrogenic injury to the lingual plate, chronic pericoronitis that may result in scarring of the soft tissues increased LN risk, and suture compression of the LN, as well as surgeon experience and technique; these are and they are listed in  $\triangleright$  Box 45.1. It has been postulated that a righthanded surgeon standing on the right side of the patient during third molar removal would experience more injuries to the LN on the right side (associated with the mandibular right third molar) because visualization of the

LN is partially obstructed, and more IAN injuries on the left side (associated with the mandibular left third molar) owing to visual obstruction of the buccal aspect of the left posterior mandible. Certainly, the risk of an IAN injury may be influenced by the so-called Rood and Shehab [6] radiographic predictors of potential tooth proximity to the inferior alveolar canal (IAC), although these were described earlier by Howe and Poynton in 1960 [7]. These seven radiographic predictors on panoramic radiograph may indicate the potential for increased risk of injury to the IAN, and they are listed in  $\triangleright$  Box 45.2. Of the seven radiographic predictors, Rood and Shehab [6] noted that three of these were more significant: root darkening, root deflection, and interruption of the white line of the inferior alveolar canal. It has been suggested that the lack of any significant radiographic finding would correlate with a minimal risk of IAN injury ( $< 1\%$ ), whereas a finding of one or more predictors would increase the risk of IAN injury up to  $10\%$ . With the current increased use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanning, the assessment of the proximity of the third molar to the IAN has improved significantly (Fig. 45.1). In cases with a high index of suspicion of nerve injury (e.g., deep impaction, advanced age, IAN traversing between the roots), intentional cornectomy with close observation may be considered [8]. As opposed to the relatively consistent course of the IAN and its visualization on panoramic and CBCT imaging, the LN position is variable; and it is injured less often than the IAN after third molar surgery [9-13]. The position of the LN has been documented clinically [13], in cadaveric dissections [15, 16], and radiologically [17]. On average, in the third molar region, the LN lies  $2.5\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the lingual plate of the mandible and  $2.5\mathrm{mm}$  inferior to the lingual crest. The LN may be in direct contact with the lingual plate in  $25\%$  of cases (Kisselbach and Chamberlain reported  $62\%$  [14]) and may lie above the lingual crest in  $10 - 15\%$  of cases (Kisselbach and Chamberlain reported  $17.6\%$  [14]) based on an undisturbed radiographic assessment of the nerve.

Mandibular block local anesthetic injections may result in IAN and LN injuries; however, the incidence is unknown owing to a significant number of unreported cases. An estimated 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 500,000 mandibular blocks result in nerve paresthesia. Harn and Durham's study of 9587 mandibular blocks [18] showed a  $3.62\%$  incidence of temporary paresthesia and a  $1.8\%$  incidence of long-term paresthesia. Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of injury, due

to either chemical toxicity or mechanical injury. Direct neural trauma is unlikely owing to abundant interfascicular neural components resulting in separation of the fascicles by a needle or suture without direct neural disruption [19]. Following a mechanical needlestick injury to the nerve, the resultant perineurial edema may be responsible for the transient paresthesia that typically resolves spontaneously. Local anesthetic chemical toxicity may be responsible for prolonged paresthesia after a mandibular block, especially if the solution is deposited within the confines of the epineurium. Several reports indicate that higher concentration local anesthetics such as prilocaine and  $4\%$  articaine may be associated with an increased risk of long-term paresthesia, especially with mandibular block anesthesia, compared with other local anesthetic solutions owing to a concentration gradient effect, and the use of higher concentration local anesthetics has been discouraged for regional block anesthesia [20-22]. The third potential mechanism of injury in local anesthetic injections involves the formation of an epineurial hematoma on the nerve itself. The epineurium and perineurium contain a vast plexus of blood vessels that nurture the neural elements, and a needle may cause disruption of one or more vessels. The localized bleeding most certainly tamponades itself owing to the surrounding epineurium, and the ensuing pressure may impinge upon "select" groups of fascicles contained within the nerve. The resultant clinical signs and symptoms of "localized" paresthesia, not involving the "entire" distribution of the IAN/mental nerve, nicely match the expected histologic situation, making this theory quite plausible. Also, lymphatic drainage of the localized hematoma over the next few days to weeks after surgery coincides with the spontaneous clinical resolution of symptoms in most cases. The final theory is that of the needle-barb mechanism of injury [23]. During a mandibular block injection, the needle may be advanced to contact the medial ramus bone where a small barb may form at the needle tip from contact with the hard bone. Upon withdrawal, if the needle has passed through, or in the vicinity of, the LN or IAN, fascicular disruption may occur with potentially longstanding clinical consequences. Recent trends in our clinical understanding of injection-related nerve injuries include the following:

1. Injection nerve injuries are difficult to predict and prevent.  
2. The classic electric shock sensation upon injection is reported uncommonly by patients who sustain these injuries.  
3. Injection injuries are more likely to result in dysesthesia than are other causes of nerve injuries.  
4. There may be a non-anatomic distribution of nerve involvement (including the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve) due to progressive proximal demyelination along the nerve.

5. Persistent symptoms after injection injuries occur more commonly in female patients.  
6. The LN, which is stretched more upon mouth opening than the IAN during a mandibular block injection, is more commonly affected.  
7. The majority of cases resolve within 8 weeks, and if paresthesia persists for longer than 8 weeks, then only one-third of those injuries resolve spontaneously.

Microneurosurgery is a poor option for patients with injection-related nerve injuries not only because most of these patients have a component of dysesthesia but also because surgical access is extremely difficult and the ability to visualize a discreet area of injured nerve may be difficult; therefore, most cases are managed with pharmacologic therapy. One of the clinical dilemmas is to differentiate a mandibular block injury to the IAN from a third molar injury to the IAN. On rare occasions, the third molar site of the IAN has been explored after third molar removal and resultant lower lip and chin paresthesia and the IAN is found to be normal at the third molar site, with the assumption at that point that the injury occurred as a result of an injection-related nerve injury rather than due to the extraction itself [24]. However, again, it is difficult to estimate the incidence of mandibular block injuries to the IAN and LN or to precisely define the etiology.

It is well known, and expected, that orthognathic surgery may result in nerve injury. The IAN is affected more often than the LN, and rarely, the facial nerve may be affected (0.67% with sagittal split osteotomy in one study [25]). Of course there is generally transient infraorbital nerve paresthesia with maxillary orthognathic surgery that typically resolves spontaneously. Certainly, a great deal is known about the risks of IAN injury associated with sagittal split osteotomy as well as screw overpenetration injury or manipulation injury to the LN [26, 27]. Unfortunately, the reported incidence of immediate and long-term neurosensory deficit varies considerably (from  $< 5\%$  to  $>90\%$ ) owing to poorly controlled factors inherent in the study designs or case reports, such as individual surgeon experience, technical variability in the surgery, lack of standardization of neurosensory testing, lack of control sites for normal cutaneous facial sensibility (in bilateral sagittal split osteotomy cases), and variation in the time periods when neurosensory testing is performed. Several studies have examined the specific parameters for neurosensory recovery after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy by using objective and subjective assessment criteria [28]. One study found a 39% incidence of neurosensory dysfunction after sagittal ramus surgery [29], and others have shown less than 15% dysfunction at 6 months [30]. In general, we can estimate the incidence of objective neurosensory deficit

at one year following sagittal split osteotomy to be approximately  $10 - 15\%$ . Although the incidence of nerve dysfunction varies, there are well-known risk factors for nerve injury [31], including patient age [32]; increased length of the surgical procedure; proximal or distal segment fractures ("bad splits"); concomitant third molar removal; concomitant genioplasty procedures; compression during fixation (e.g., bicortical screw or lag screw fixation techniques); inadvertent use of chisels in the osteotomy site; nerve entrapment in the proximal segment; nerve manipulation and iatrogenic stretching or trauma in the area of the osteotomy, as well as the region of the lingula during the medial dissection (based on intraoperative recordings of IAN somatosensory evoked potentials) [33]; the location of the inferior alveolar canal close to the inferior border; low mandibular body corpus height and retrognathism in class II deformities (the IAN tends to be closer to buccal cortex and more vulnerable to injury) [34]; and frank nerve transection during surgery, especially with a large mandibular advancements. Unfortunately, long-term neurosensory dysfunction after orthognathic surgery is not generally amenable to microneurosurgical correction, and most patients tolerate mild paresthesia well after correction of a significant dentofacial deformity. Three caveats to remember regarding orthognathic surgery-related nerve injuries are as follows: (1) the older the patient the more severe and long-lasting the potential nerve paresthesia; (2) patients tolerate "mild" paresthesia after "major" surgery well (with appropriate informed consent); and (3) the magnitude of neurosensory dysfunction decreases as the time from injury increases.

Craniomaxillofacial trauma may result in injury to any of the terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve. Orbitozygomatic and zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures may involve the infraorbital canal and the second division of the trigeminal nerve. The small fibers of the infraorbital nerve as it exits the infraorbital foramen are less than ideal for surgical manipulation and repair; therefore, typically, "repair" of an infraorbital nerve injury is to perform a "decompression" of the nerve via reduction and fixation of the fracture. Mandible fractures that violate the IAN canal result in temporary or permanent paresthesia, depending upon the degree of fracture displacement and surgical manipulation (e.g. skeletonization of the mental nerve) or trauma from the use of rigid fixation. Treatment of mandible fractures with inadvertent placement of screws that traverse the inferior alveolar canal may cause iatrogenic transient or permanent paresthesia. In general, reduction and stabilization of the fracture segments aid in realigning the natural bony conduit (i.e., the IAN canal or the infraorbital canal) that will help to guide spontaneous neurosensory recovery, even in cases of partial or complete transection injuries.

Also, the presence and/or biopsy and treatment of head and neck pathologic lesions may result in nerve injury. The use of Carnoy's solution (ferric chloride  $0.1\mathrm{g / mL}$ , absolute alcohol  $6\mathrm{mL}$ , chloroform  $3\mathrm{mL}$ , glacial acetic acid  $1\mathrm{mL}$ ) or modified Carnoy's solution after treatment of pathology to prevent recurrence has been shown to have a critical exposure time of 5 minutes, after which time there may be long-term irreversible neural injury [35, 36]. After a mandibular resection procedure, consideration should be given to immediate or delayed neural reconstruction using autogenous or allogeneic nerve grafts or conduits. This is discussed further in the treatment section of this chapter.

Although preprosthetic surgery is performed less frequently at present than in the past, procedures such as torus mandibularis reduction and maxillary or mandibular vestibuloplasty place the terminal branches of the mental nerve and infraorbital nerve at risk for injury. As mentioned, surgical repair of the small terminal nerve fibers of the infraorbital and mental nerves is difficult and often results in scarring of the nerve and adjacent soft tissues and a poor chance of neurosensory recovery. The maxilla and mandible are excellent sources of autogenous bone grafts; however, they are not performed without potential morbidity. The majority of patients who undergo genial (chin) bone graft harvest complain of desensitization of the mandibular anterior teeth, when present. Depending upon the specific technique used for posterior mandibular ramus bone graft harvesting, the IAN may be at risk of iatrogenic injury; the anatomic position of the IAN laterally within the ascending ramus contributes to its vulnerability during ramus graft harvest.

Mandibular endodontic therapy and periapical surgery may result in an injury to the IAN, depending on the proximity of the root apex to the canal (Fig. 45.2). These injuries may be mechanical or chemical in nature. Physical trauma to the IAN may occur from overpenetration of endodontic drills or files beyond the root

![](images/4be18763cdb019386fa74982f5c6a893881f25ba83ef4fa10bbd37f17d7bc4f9.jpg)

apex, or overpenetration of root canal filling materials (e.g. sealers, gutta percha) that cause mechanical injury to the nerve. The chemical injury may be more severe since some endodontic filling materials may be directly neurotoxic (paraformaldehyde-containing pastes [Sargenti paste, N2, AH26], or eugenol-containing cements [ZOE, PCS], or sodium hypochorite). In order to prevent irreversible paresthesia that in many cases results in dysesthesia and neuropathic pain, consideration should be given to prompt exploration  $(12 - 24\mathrm{h})$  and debridement of medicaments that have permeated through the root apex and are in direct contact with the nerve. Even if this prompt treatment occurs, paresthesia/dysesthesia may persist and warrant drug therapy. In general, root canal-related nerve injuries are more severe and more persistent and more likely to result in neuropathic pain than other etiologies, and these are not amenable to microneurosurgery and are managed with drug therapy.

Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible has been shown to induce transient changes in neuronal conduction without significant long-term nerve dysfunction [37, 38]. Since age is a factor in spontaneous neurosensory recovery after any nerve injury, a younger patient would certainly tolerate a "stretch-type" of injury to the nerve better than an adult patient. Some data indicate that with a true distraction corticotomy (vs. osteotomy) and distraction rates of  $1\mathrm{mm/day}$ , permanent neural changes are unlikely, but that a complete osteotomy violating the inferior alveolar canal or distraction rates greater than  $1\mathrm{mm/day}$  in the adult may be deleterious to nerve function. However, more studies are necessary [39, 40].

Inflammatory and infectious conditions, such as periapical disease, facial cellulitis or abscess formation, osteomyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) may involve the branches of the trigeminal nerve and these may be irreversible depending upon the degree of inflammation or infection. In general prompt treatment of the inflammatory or infectious process will hasten neurosensory recovery.

Finally, dental implant-related injuries to the IAN are common  $(30 - 40\%)$  (Fig. 45.3) and difficult to manage appropriately; however, with current techniques of advanced imaging and virtual surgical planning (VSP) and computer treatment planning with fabrication of surgical implant guides, the incidence of iatrogenic nerve injury may decline. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data regarding appropriate patient assessment and management, with a lack of consensus on specific treatment protocols. In the posterior mandible, the likely cause of nerve damage may be mechanical trauma from the initial pilot drill that penetrates the superior cortex of the canal and violates the IAN vein (or artery, which is less likely). This results in some localized bleeding

![](images/24be1f41325e6d33af0dd2bcb539e15e8a539d12e28b85724bc7e097ded0649e.jpg)

that, upon placement of the implant, will tamponade itself. However, the resultant increased pressure in the closed environment of the inferior alveolar canal creates a "compartment syndrome," with harmful effects on neurosensory function. This type of compression injury commonly results in long-term unpleasant altered sensation (dysesthesia) rather than simple decreased sensation (hypoesthesia). Another potential cause of implant-related injury is thermal injury that may occur from the use of dull burs or incorrect drill speed. The recognition postoperatively that the patient has paresthesia and that the implant is within the confines of the canal warrants the clinician to consider removal of the implant, with or without immediate replacement with a shorter (and wider) implant. If, however, the nerve injury was due to a compartment syndrome effect, implant removal without replacement may be the more prudent option, to allow for "decompression" and resolution of edema. For patients with persistent paresthesia, referral to a microneurosurgeon or neurologist may be warranted for consideration for pharmacotherapy. In general, similar to root canal-related nerve injuries, dental implant-related injuries are more severe and more persistent and more likely to result in neuropathic pain than other etiologies, and these are not amenable to microneurosurgery and are managed with drug therapy. The procedure of IAN repositioning (nerve lateralization and nerve transpositioning) is an option that theoretically would induce a "controlled" stretch-type injury to the IAN and protect it during implant site preparation and implant placement. With lateral decortication of the mandible and nerve exposure, a compartment syndrome is less likely to occur. Despite the potential advantages of nerve repositioning, there is a high incidence of long-term paresthesia ranging from  $0\%$  to  $77\%$ , with a mean of approximately  $30 - 40\%$  [39]. With appropriate surgeon experience, proper patient selection, the presence of a strong indication for the procedure (e.g., lack of interocclusal clearance in the posterior mandible), and an adequate and informed consent discussion, this procedure remains an option for posterior mandibular implant reconstruction.

# Key Points for Nerve Injury Demographics

1. Branches of the trigeminal nerve are at risk for injury during routine oral and maxillofacial surgery.  
2. Specific etiologies of nerve injury impact upon the ability of the nerve to recover spontaneously.  
3. There are risk factors that increase the likelihood of nerve injury, especially during third molar removal.  
4. Dental implant and endodontic-related nerve injuries tend to be more severe and persistent with neuropathic pain, not amenable to microneurosurgery.  
5. Immediate reconstruction of trigeminal nerve defects following ablative mandibular resection should be considered.

# 45.3 Trigeminal Nerve Anatomy and Physiology

A brief review of trigeminal nerve anatomy and physiology is necessary in order to understand the clinical patient presentation as well as diagnosis, treatment planning, management, and prognosis for recovery. Of course the IAN provides sensation to the lower lip and chin as well as the intraoral mucosa and gingiva via the mental nerve branch on each side; and, the LN provides sensation and taste (via the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve) to the anterior two-thirds of each side of the tongue individually. The trigeminal nerve (Fig. 45.4) is composed of a mesoneurium that suspends the nerve within the surrounding tissues and is continuous with the outer epineurium that defines and surrounds the nerve trunk. This epineurium contains a vast plexus of blood vessels called the vasa nervorum as well as lymphatic channels. The epineurium is divided into both outer and inner components; the inner layer is composed of a loose connective tissue sheath with longitudinal collagen bundles that protect against compressive and stretching forces imposed on the nerve. Individual fascicles are defined by the perineurium, which is a continuation of the pia-arachnoid layer of the central nervous system. This perineurium functions to provide structural support and act as a diffusion barrier, similar to the blood-brain barrier that prevents the transport of certain molecules. The individual nerve fibers and Schwann cells are surrounded by the endoneurium, which is composed of collagen, fibroblasts, and capillaries. In the peripheral nervous system, there are three types of neural fascicular patterns: monofascicular (one large fascicle), oligofascicular (2-10 fascicles), and polyfascicular ( $>10$  fascicles) (Fig. 45.5).

Fig. 45.4 Trigeminal nerve anatomy

The IAN and LN are, for the most part, polyfascicular in nature, although there is some evidence that there may be fewer fascicles in the lingual nerve in the third molar region, thereby making it more vulnerable to poor recovery from even a minor injury, such as a stretch from elevation of the third molar from its socket. Polyfascicular nerves have abundant interfascicular connective tissue; the importance of this fact is twofold: first, trauma to a nerve (e.g. from a local anesthetic needle or suture penetration) rarely causes direct neural trauma to the fascicles themselves because of the amount of interfascicular spaces between the nerve axons, and second, nerve repair with realignment of the fascicles (coaptation) is challenging to perform on polyfascicular nerves, and that is why an epineurial repair is preferred for the trigeminal nerve.

The trigeminal nerve is composed of a functional unit with differing fiber types that transmit a variety of information (Table 45.1). The A-alpha fibers are the largest myelinated fibers with the fastest conduction velocity; they mediate position and fine touch through muscle spindle afferents and skeletal muscle efferents. The A-beta fibers mediate proprioception sensation. The smallest myelinated fibers are the A-delta fibers that carry pain ("first" or "fast" pain) and temperature information. The smaller-diameter and slower-conducting unmyelinated C fibers mediate "second" or "slow" pain and temperature sensations. The Schwann cells surround both myelinated (one Schwann cell per nerve

fiber) and unmyelinated (one Schwann cell per several nerve fibers) nerves, and they play a major role in nerve survival and regeneration after injury. Although the myelin sheath may not survive a nerve injury, the Schwann cells do, and they provide a supportive role in the production of neurotrophic and neurotropic factors (such as nerve growth factor and basement membrane laminin) that enhance and support neural recovery. In a myelinated axon, the nodes of Ranvier are the 0.3- to  $2.0\text{-}\mu \mathrm{m}$  unmyelinated segments between the myelin sheaths that are responsible for the diffusion of certain ions that cause nerve depolarization and repolarization as well as the rapid saltatory conduction of a nerve impulse along the nerve fiber. In addition to the lingual nerve, the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) joins the LN and carries taste sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

Following a nerve injury, many neural changes occur, but the basic process of nerve healing involves both degeneration and regeneration (Fig. 45.6) [41, 42]. The nerve cell body responds with an increased metabolic phase and a heightened production of RNA (protein synthesis in the rough endoplastic reticulum) and breakdown of Nissl's substance for export from the cell body. At the site of injury, there is edema and accumula

tion of particulate cellular debris. In addition, there is a proliferation of phagocytes and macrophages that begin to clean the area of this debris from the injury site. Within days, axonal sprouts begin to bud and extend from the proximal nerve stump in the area of injury. Each axon may have as many as 50 collateral sprouts from the proximal nerve stump with random orientation toward the distal nerve stump. There is proliferation and a high level of activity of Schwann cells as well. These Schwann cells begin to form new myelin "conduits" in anticipation of the arrival of the new axonal sprouts. In addition, nerve growth factors are produced that influence the direction of sprouting and guide the new axons into the newly formed myelin sheath conduits, known as the bands of Bungner. In the event that all of these interrelated processes occur appropriately, spontaneous neural regeneration will occur. If one or more of the reparative processes fail to occur at the appropriate time and location, there may formation of a neuroma and lack of spontaneous neurosensory recovery. This failure may be due to a variety of reasons including advanced local tissue scarring, insufficient neurotrophic and neurotropic factor production, or malaligned nerve stumps separated beyond the critical size defect to allow for spontaneous reconnection. A neuroma is defined simply

a disorganized mass of collagen fibers and randomly oriented small nerve fascicles (axonal sprouts that could not find the distal target site). Neuromas are classified by gross morphology into the following types (Fig. 45.7): amputation (stump) neuroma, neuromain-continuity (central or fusiform neuroma), and lateral neuromas that are either lateral exophytic neuromas or lateral adhesive neuromas. From a surgical perspective, the neuroma must be excised completely both proximally and distally to allow the nerve repair (neurorrhaphy) to have a chance for success rather than leaving some neuroma and suturing a neuromatous proximal segment to a neuromatous distal stump with no chance of improvement in functional neurosensory recovery.

# Key Points for Trigeminal Nerve Anatomy and Physiology

1. Trigeminal nerve anatomy and physiology is well-known.  
2. While the trigeminal nerve is sensory in nature, the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve carries the special sensation of taste to the tongue.  
3. Individual variations in neural anatomy and physiology may impact upon nerve recovery.  
4. Most nerve injuries recover spontaneously.  
5. An orderly sequence of events must occur for spontaneous neurosensory recovery, or a neuroma may form and limit the likelihood of recovery without the need for microneurosurgery.

# 45.4 Nerve Injury Classification

Two classification schemes are used to describe the anatomic and histologic changes that occur after nerve injury (Seddon and Sunderland), while one grading scale is more clinical in nature (Medical Research Council Scale (MRCS)). Seddon described a three-stage classification system in 1943 [43], and Sunderland revised and further subclassified nerve injuries into five grades in 1951 (Fig. 45.8 and Table 45.2) [44]. A neurapraxia (Seddon) or first-degree (Sunderland) injury is characterized as a conduction block from transient anoxia due to acute epineurial/endoneurial vascular interruption resulting from mild nerve manipulation (stretch, traction, or compression), with rapid and complete recovery of sensation and no axonal degeneration. Damage is confined to within the endoneurium. Sunderland [44] further subdivides first-degree injuries into types I, II, and III. Type I results from mild nerve manipulation with rapid (within hours) return of sensation when neural blood flow is restored. Type II is due to moderate traction or compression with the formation of

transudate or exudate fluid and intrafascicular edema, with return of sensation after resolution of edema (within days). Type III injuries result from more severe nerve manipulation that may cause segmental demyelination, with recovery within days to weeks. An axonotmesis (Seddon) corresponds to second-, third-, and fourth-degree (Sunderland) injuries, with the difference being the degree of axonal damage. Second-degree injuries are due again to traction or compression that results in ischemia, intrafascicular edema, or demyelination. This damage extends through and includes the endoneurium with no significant axonal disorganization. Recovery is slow and may take weeks to months, and it may not be complete. Third-degree injuries continue the spectrum of more advanced neural injury due to more significant neural trauma with variable degrees of intra-fascicular architectural disruption and damage extending to the perineurium. Recovery is variable; it may take months, and be incomplete. Fourth-degree injuries result in damage to the fascicle that extends through the perineurium to the epineurium, but the epineurium remains intact as a near-complete transection injury. There is

axonal, endoneurial, and perineurial damage with disorganization of the fascicles. Spontaneous recovery is unlikely, but minimal improvement may occur in 6-12 months. Finally, neurotmesis (Seddon) and fifth-degree (Sunderland) injuries result from complete transection of the nerve (traverses the entire width of the fascicle) with epineurial discontinuity and likely subsequent neuroma formation during attempted spontaneous regeneration of the nerve, making spontaneous neurosensory recovery unlikely. For completeness, in 1988, Dellon and Mackinnon [45] described a sixth-degree injury, which recognizes that many nerve injuries exhibit features of different degrees of injury according to Sunderland (Table 45.3). The Seddon and Sunderland classification schemes attempt to correlate histologic changes of nerve injury with expected clinical outcomes (see Table 45.2).

The Medical Research Council Scale is more clinical in nature, with a motor component as well as a sensory component to the MRCS; of course we use the sensory component of the MRCS for assessment of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 45.8).

# 45.4.1 Clinical Neurosensory Testing

The patient who sustains an injury to the trigeminal nerve may present with a variety of signs and symptoms. These may be divided into nonpainful anesthesia, hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia or painful anesthesia (anesthesia dolorosa), hypoesthesia, or hyperesthesia (allodynia, pain from a nonpainful stimulus, or hyperpathia, increased pain due to a painful or nonpainful stimulus), or neuropathic pain, or complex regional pain syndrome. The history usually indicates the etiologic event, and the chief complaint may include the following: numbness, itching, crawling, stretching, drooling, pain, tingling, tickling, pulling, burning, stinging, pins and needles, hot sensation, cold sensation, inability to feel food on lip, inability to taste, inability to shave, inability to smile, and loss of consortium. The history of present illness should be explored in depth with a comprehensive description of the onset and progression of symptoms, change in symptoms, treatment received and response to that treatment, any aggravating and alleviating factors, and current symptoms.

The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) may be used to assess pain and altered sensation, and it is a useful tool for monitoring progression of neurosensory recovery. The MPQ uses three classes to assess the level of dysfunction and interference with activity: sensory class (temporal, spatial, thermal, punctate, incisive, constrictive, traction pressure), affective class (tension, fear, autonomic properties, punishment), and evaluative class (patient perception). Perhaps the simplest and most reliable measure of subjective patient assessment is the use of a visual analogue scale. Typically, this is a 10-cm five

<table><tr><td>Right</td><td>1 Complete absence of sensation</td><td>2 Almost no sensation</td><td>3 Reduced sensation</td><td>4 Almost normal sensation</td><td>5 Fully normal sensation</td></tr><tr><td>Left</td><td>1 Complete absence of sensation</td><td>2 Almost no sensation</td><td>3 Reduced sensation</td><td>4 Almost normal sensation</td><td>5 Fully normal sensation</td></tr></table>

degree scale, with a degree marked every  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$  (Fig. 45.9). This is a useful tool for monitoring subjective improvement. It must be remembered that subjective and objective nerve test results are rarely at the same level. For example, in one study of nerve testing after sagittal split osteotomy, the subjective neurosensory deficit was  $26.0\%$ , whereas objective testing revealed an  $89.5\%$  deficit [46]. Treatment planning decisions must be based on a thorough assessment of both the subjective and the objective testing results. Also, a radiographic assessment (panoramic and CBCT) may reveal the presence of radiographic predictors of root proximity to the inferior alveolar canal, retained root fragments, evidence of distal bone removal, or the presence of foreign bodies in the extraction sites, which should be ruled out in the initial assessment of the patient's nerve injury. The CNT begins with inspection of the oral cavity, which may show signs of self-induced trauma to the tongue or lower lip and chin, a lingually positioned third molar incision scar, or atrophic changes of the tongue fungiform papillae [47]. Palpation in the area of the suspected nerve injury (e.g., lingual aspect of the third molar extraction site) may induce Tinel's sign, which is a provocative test of regenerating nerve sprouts that is performed by light palpation over the area of suspected injury. This maneuver elicits a distal referred "tingling" sensation at the target site of the nerve (tongue or lower lip). This Tinel's sign is thought to indicate small-diameter nerve fiber recovery; however, it is poorly correlated with functional recovery and is often confused with neuroma formation. To perform the CNT appropriately, the patient should be seated comfortably in a quiet room, and the specific testing procedures should be explained clearly to the patient, with confirmation that there is an understanding of what the patient is being asked to do and what possible responses are acceptable. The specific tests are performed with the patient's eyes closed, and the contralateral uninjured side serves as the control, when appropriate, to establish a baseline for assessment of the injured side.

# Box 45.3 Clinical Neurosensory Testing

Subjective assessment: visual analogue scale Objective assessment

Level A: static two-point discrimination, brush-stroke directional discrimination  
Level B: contact detection  
Level C: pinprick nociception, thermal discrimination

The CNT is performed at three levels: levels A, B, and C (▶ Box 45.3) [48]. The CNT involves a dropout algorithm that attempts to correlate the results of the CNT with the level of nerve injury (Fig. 45.10). This clinical assessment of nerve injury may be correlated with the Sunderland classification system (Grades I-V) and expected outcomes. If the results of level A testing are normal, the CNT is terminated and the patient is considered normal; this would correspond to a Sunderland first-degree injury. The theory is that these fibers are most sensitive to injury, so that if the Level A testing is normal, then the other nerve fibers are less likely to be involved. An abnormal result at level A indicates the need to proceed to level B testing. If the results of level B testing are normal, the patient is considered mildly impaired (Sunderland second-degree injury). If level B results are abnormal, then level C testing is performed. If level C results are normal, the patient is considered to have a moderate impairment of the nerve (Sunderland third-degree injury). If level C results are abnormal, the patient is considered severely impaired (Sunderland fourth-degree injury). If the patient's test results are abnormal at levels A, B, and C and there is no response to any noxious stimulus at level C, the patient is considered completely impaired (Sunderland fifth-degree injury). Level A testing includes brushstroke directional and static two-point discrimination. These two tests assess function of the larger myelinated A-alpha and A-beta fibers. These fibers are the most sensitive to compression and traction inju

![](images/d776bfc0bd388cf5343b681125f364aed99b39bfc38a6fcada4c96fec76c7be0.jpg)  
Fig.45.10 Algorithm for objective clinical neurosensory test

ries; therefore, the CNT is terminated if level A is normal, indicating that these fibers are uninvolved in the injury. Brushstroke directional discrimination (BSD) is performed with a fine sable or camel hair brush. The brush is stroked gently across the area of involvement at a constant rate and pressure, and the patient is asked to indicate the direction of movement (i.e., to the left or to the right) and the correct number of patient responses out of 10 strokes is recorded (typically,  $>80\%$  correct response rate is considered normal, but the control side should be used for a more appropriate individual patient comparison). Two-point discrimination (2PD) is performed in a static fashion (vs. a moving two-point discrimination test) and with blunt tips to avoid A-delta and C fiber stimulation. This test can be performed with any device capable of allowing the distance between two points to be measured consistently (e.g., a Boley gauge). The closest distance (in millimeters) at which the patient can consistently discern the two points is recorded at the

control site for reference and then the affected area is tested (in general  $< 6\mathrm{mm}$  is considered a normal two-point discrimination level for the IAN and LN, but the control side should be used for a more appropriate individual patient comparison). At level B testing, contact detection is performed with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments or von Frey hairs, which also assess the A-beta fiber integrity and function. These devices are acrylic resin or plastic transparent/translucent rods with nylon filaments of varying diameters. The stiffness of each filament determines the force necessary to deflect or bend the filament. The narrowest diameter filament that requires the least amount of force to deflect that is detected consistently by the patient is recorded (in general, a fiber of 2.84 grams is considered normal, but the control side should be used for a more appropriate individual patient comparison). At level C testing, pin-prick nociception and thermal discrimination assess the smaller A-delta and C fibers, which are most resistant to

injury. Pinprick nociception may be performed simply with a dental explorer tip or a 30-gauge needle; however, a pressure-sensitive device is more appropriate in order to quantify the test result rather than achieving an all-ornone response, which would vary depending upon depth of penetration of the needle. Thermal discrimination is usually performed with supra-threshold temperature devices such as an ice cube or ethyl chloride spray or hot water placed on a cotton swab, but other options are available, such as Minnesota thermal disks made of copper, stainless steel, glass, and polyvinyl chloride.

Although these five tests employed in the CNT are considered "objective" tests, they are, in reality, "subjective" because they require a "subjective" patient response. Few purely objective tests of nerve function are available, and these include trigeminal somatosensory evoked potentials and magnetic source imaging [49]. Unfortunately, these tests are not readily available and are not considered a part of the routine assessment of a nerve-injured patient. Also, there are little data on the trigeminal nerve and the patterns of responses to these objective tests based on specific types of nerve injuries. More recently, the use of magnetic resonance imaging [50] and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has shown promise as an objective diagnostic tool to assess the degree of IAN and LN injury (Fig. 45.11). Further refinements in the technique and resolution of individual nerve fibers will improve the diagnostic accuracy.

Finally, taste may be assessed by a variety of methods, but, it is performed as either whole-mouth or localized taste testing. Solutions such as 1 M sodium chloride

![](images/f15613c4e5c34209c535ca52ed07655cc54f3a3e6413fd15a6706265017dd56f.jpg)  
Fig. 45.11 MRN showing signal hyperintensity of the left LN (two arrows) when compared to the normal uninjured right LN (one arrow)

(salt), 1 M sucrose (sweet),  $0.4\mathrm{M}$  acetic acid (sour), and  $0.1\mathrm{M}$  quinine (bitter) are used. There are many difficulties and limitations with gustatory assessment in the patient with an LN injury. The perception of taste alteration (cranial nerve VII) is extremely variable and has little correlation with the degree of LN (cranial nerve V) injury. For example, a patient with a fourth- or fifth-degree LN injury may not report any taste alteration subjectively but may test abnormally upon formal taste testing. The complex sense of taste is mediated not only by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve but also through feedback mechanisms in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx as well as the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem [51]. Taste buds are located throughout the oral cavity, not solely on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue surface but also the palate, buccal mucosa, and floor of mouth. Also, after microneurosurgical LN repair, the objective and subjective neurosensory recovery of tongue sensation and taste perception also are inconsistent [52].

Diagnostic nerve blocks can be a useful component of the patient evaluation when dysesthesia or unpleasant sensations predominate the clinical scenario. The goals of the diagnostic nerve block is to localize the source of nerve injury, determine whether delivery of peripheral anesthesia resolves the painful symptoms, and estimate the prognosis for recovery after either pharmacologic or surgical therapy. If surgical management includes consideration for a nerve transection procedure for pain relief, the nerve block may use a long-acting local anesthetic solution to allow the patient several hours to determine whether permanent anesthesia is tolerable. The preferred local anesthetic solution for a routine nerve block, however, is of a low concentration (e.g.,  $0.25\%$  lidocaine) to selectively block the smaller A-delta and C fibers while not affecting the larger myelinated fibers. If the low concentration fails to relieve the pain, a higher concentration is used in the same location. Diagnostic blocks begin in the most central location and proceed with progressively more peripheral injections along the course of the nerve with constant reassessment of the area of involvement both objectively and subjectively. If the patient presents with symptoms consistent with sympathetically mediated pain or causalgia, a stellate ganglion block may be performed as well, but these symptoms usually indicate a problem not amenable to peripheral microneurosurgery. Other painful syndromes that generally are not relieved with diagnostic nerve blocks include anesthesia dolorosa and deafferentation pain, and similar to other neuropathies with predominating symptoms of dysesthesia, these syndromes are used managed with pharmacotherapy.

# Key Points for Neurosensory Testing

1. Clinical neurosensory testing is used to document the degree or severity of nerve injury.  
2. Both subjective and objective assessments are documented and monitored periodically to assess for spontaneous neurosensory recovery or the need for surgical intervention.  
3. Several classification systems exist to quantify the nerve injury, including the Medical Research Council Scale (MRCS).  
4. The use of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) shows promise in the objective assessment of nerve injury.

# 45.5 Nonsurgical Treatment

Pharmacologic management of peripheral nerve injuries is reserved for patients who present with unpleasant abnormal sensations or dysesthesia or neuropathic pain. In the majority of these cases, pharmacologic treatment should be managed with a consultation from an experienced individual such as a neurologist or facial pain specialist. Many systemic (▶ Box 45.4) and topical (□ Table 45.4) medications are available [52]. Whereas the systemic drugs may have significant side effects, topical agents offer the advantages of little systemic absorption, possibly only minor irritation (which can be relieved with a period of abstinence), and over-the-counter availability in many cases. There are also many combinations of topical agents that can be used, such as a eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) that contains  $2.5\%$  lidocaine and  $2.5\%$  prilocaine. Many of the topical agents are prepared in a pleuronic lecithin organogel base. For most oral and maxillofacial surgeons, long-term pharmacologic management with drug dosage adjustments based upon clinical response is not part of their routine practice, so the prompt referral to a microneurosurgeon or neurologist may offer the best chance for long-term successful patient management. Pharmacotherapy for dysesthesia includes the use of membrane-stabilizing agents, such as antidepressants

and anticonvulsants, and many neurologists and surgeons consider gabapentin (neurontin) as a first-line therapeutic agent. There are also dorsal horn inhibitors or  $\gamma$ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, including muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines. Consideration may be given to a trial of a topical agent such as capsaicin cream  $0.025\%$  or  $0.075\%$  three times a day and/or a systemic medication with few side effects, such as baclofen (lioresal)  $10\mathrm{mg}$  orally three times a day, pregabalin (lyrica)  $50\mathrm{mg}$  orally three times a day, or gabapentin (neurontin)  $100 - 300\mathrm{mg}$  orally three times a day. The most common side effect of these medications is sedation or drowsiness that may require frequent daily dose adjustments. Again, surgeons unfamiliar with the drugs, as well as the spectrum of pharmacologic options, should consider obtaining a neurology consultation.

It may be appropriate to manage perioperative paresthesia after third molar removal or implant placement with a short course of systemic corticosteroid therapy (Medrol dose-pak (methylprednisolone)) in an attempt to decrease perineural edema caused by the local response to the nerve injury, as long as there are no contraindications. Although there is little evidence to suggest that systemic steroids actually provide any effect, the use of steroids when a nerve injury occurs indicates that the surgeon has recognized the problem and has taken some steps to potentially improve outcome based upon a knowledge of neural anatomy and injury physiology, which is advantageous when considering medicolegal involvement issues. As an alternative,

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be prescribed as well. Also, vitamin B12 should be considered to augment spontaneous neurosensory recovery, as well as biofeedback exercises. These can be self-directed twice daily sessions by patients (am/pm) and involve the use of two-point discrimination and brush stroke directional discrimination exercises comparing the involved side to the uninvolved side while looking at a mirror in an attempt to "retrain the brain" (Table 45.5).

Perhaps the most important initial consideration in patient management should be prompt referral, when indicated, to a specialist for pharmacologic or surgical management.

In the past, before considering surgical management, a variety of neuroablative techniques had been used to ameliorate painful neuropathies. Some of these included radiofrequency thermal neurolysis, cryoneurolysis, and alcohol and glycerol injections at the site of injury as well as at the gasserian (tri- geminal) ganglion. Based on the published complications of these types of procedures as well as the recurrence rates of the symptoms of dysesthesia, caution should be employed when considering these options [53, 54]. Although radiofrequency ablation (gamma-knife therapy) does show some promise in a select group of patients with neuropathic pain. The use of a low-level ("soft") laser (gallium-aluminum-arsenide, wavelength of approximately  $820~\mathrm{nm}$ ) holds promise in the area of neural healing. Several studies have shown improvement in objective and subjective neurosensory function with the use of laser therapy in some of the more difficult clinical scenarios, such as longstanding nerve injuries, orthognathic-related IAN paresthesia, and prolonged dysesthesia unresponsive to pharmacologic or surgical therapy [55-57], while other studies have shown no effect of the laser in neurosensory recovery. However, the current limited availability of the low-level laser and the lack of approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) preclude its routine use for patients with nerve injuries. Lastly, acupuncture, especially with electrical stimulation shows promise in the management of neuropathic pain.

# Key Points for Nonsurgical Treatment

1. Pharmacologic management of nerve injuries is useful in the immediate post-injury phase, and for persistent unpleasant sensations.  
2. Consideration should be given towards the use of a corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication and vitamin B12 in the peri-injury phase, if not contraindicated.  
3. A variety of topical and systemic medications are useful in cases of dysesthesia or neuropathic pain, including gabapentin, with some side effects.  
4. Other nonsurgical options exist, including acupuncture, radiofrequency, laser, and other treatment methods, with variable efficacies and outcomes.  
5. Chronic neuropathic pain is best managed in a multidisciplinary setting (e.g. neurologist, pain specialist).

# 45.6 Trigeminal Neuralgia

Whereas it is not the intention of this chapter to cover the various facial pain syndromes, it is appropriate to discuss briefly the subject of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which is typically not amenable to microneurosurgery but should be ruled out in the assessment of patients who present with complaints related to the trigeminal nerve system. The reported incidence of TN is 4/100,000 as a spontaneous occurrence. Female patients older than 50 years are more commonly affected by TN symptoms, and the right side of the face is involved more often than the left. The typical symptoms are lancinating or stabbing ("electric shock"-like) paroxysms of facial pain involving the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve (V2 and V3). Although various theories have been proposed, including arterial compression of the trigeminal nerve in the pons region (Janetta), the etiology of TN is unknown in most cases and, therefore, has been designated idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (ITN). The diagnosis of TN is made based upon the Sweet diagnostic criteria, 1969, which includes paroxysmal pain, pain provoked by light touch (with trigger zones), pain confined to the trigeminal distribution, unilateral pain, and a normal clinical neurosensory test. The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) has established criteria to differentiate two forms of TN, classic TN and symptomatic TN. Classic TN is the most common form with paroxysmal attacks lasting from 1 second to 2 minutes affecting the trigeminal nerve. The pain has at least one of the following features: intense, sharp, superficial or

stabbing, or precipitated by a trigger point or area. The attacks in classic TN are stereotyped in each individual patient occurring at the same time and location each day. There is no clinical neurologic deficit on examination. Finally, the symptoms of classic TN cannot be attributed to another disorder. The second form, symptomatic  $TN$ , has all of the features of classic TN with the additional finding of a causative lesion, other than vascular compression, identified by special studies (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], lumbar puncture, evoked potentials, hematologic studies) or exploration of the posterior cranial fossa. Another form of TN is known as atypical  $TN$  because it may meet most, but not all, of the Sweet diagnostic criteria of classic TN. TN is managed with pharmacologic therapy, and usually multidrug regimens are used. A variety of medications have been used, including antiepileptic drugs, gabapentin, baclofen, clonezepam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, toprimate, and carbamezepine. For acute exacerbations of TN symptoms, several treatment options include peripheral local anesthetic nerve block, intravenous lidocaine (100 mg over 20 minutes), intravenous antiepileptic drugs (dilantin, fosphenytoin, or valproic acid), and analgesics (opioid and non-opioid) that may have little clinical effect. Surgical options for TN are limited to a few specialized procedures, with minimal morbidity, that may provide some form of symptomatic relief in 80–85% of patients. These include percutaneous stereotactic radiofrequency thermal lesioning of the trigeminal ganglion, posterior fossa exploration and microvascular decompression of the trigeminal root, and gamma knife radiation to the trigeminal nerve root entry zone, which has shown promising results.

# 45.7 Treatment Algorithms

The decision to proceed with microneurosurgery must be made after a careful patient assessment over a defined period of time. The dilemma for clinicians is that sufficient time must be provided to allow for spontaneous neurosensory recovery, but that prompt surgical intervention may afford the best chance for recovery. Time is a critical issue in the management of nerve injuries for three main reasons. First, at the site of injury, distal nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration—named for Augustus Waller, 1892) occurs owing to an interruption of anterograde and retrograde axonal transport across the site of injury. This results in a progressive loss of neural tissue due to lack of stimulation that may compromise future repair attempts by causing a greater length of neuromatous nerve segment requiring resection at the time of nerve repair. Second, at the nerve cell bodies, there is ganglion cell death that occurs early after

injury [58]. This may result in a large percentage  $(>50\%)$  of cell body death in a short period of time after the injury (weeks to months), so that any "peripheral" attempt at microneurosurgical repair would have, at best, a  $50\%$  functional neurosensory recovery. Third, as the time from the nerve injury increases, there is a higher likelihood that central intracranial somatosensory cortical changes may occur, and these would make peripheral repair ineffective [59]. The central nervous system remains "plastic" in that longstanding peripheral painful neuropathies become "expected" in the area of the brain devoted to that region and, despite peripheral nerve transection as an attempt at painful symptom resolution, the brain will continue to interpret the information not as "anesthesia," but as "dysesthesia" (similar to "phantom-limb" pain syndromes).

Microneurosurgery is indicated for persistent paresthesia that fails to improve over successive examinations, including both subjective and objective interval assessments. Microneurosurgery is not indicated if there is continued improvement at each interval assessment. The currently accepted recommendations are to consider micro-neurosurgery, when indicated, for the LN within 1-3 months after the injury and for the IAN within 3-6 months after the injury (Fig. 45.12). The rationale for the difference in time is that the IAN lies within a bony canal or "physiologic conduit" that can guide spontaneous regeneration, so more time is allotted for that process to occur, whereas an LN injured within soft tissue does not have a "conduit" to guide spontaneous regeneration. In general, the oral and maxillofacial surgeon should schedule weekly follow-up examinations with the patient over a period of approximately 1 month. If there is persistent paresthesia or a worsening of symptoms at the four week time point, referral should be made to a microneurosurgical specialist for prompt definitive evaluation and management.

The indications for microneurosurgery include the complete  $(100\%)$  postoperative anesthesia, or less than  $50\%$  residual sensation in an injury classified as a Sunderland grade III, IV, or V. Some surgeons consider another indication to be the level of sensation, which is unacceptable to the patient, even if the objective tests show greater than  $50\%$  residual sensation of a Sunderland I or II injury. In these cases, the patient must be informed of the reasonable expectation for recovery after microneurosurgery, which, according to the literature, may be at or below their current level of sensibility. Also, whereas as a general rule unpleasant sensations are managed pharmacologically and decreased sensations are managed surgically, some cases of early dysesthesia or hyperpathic pain may indicate the early formation of a neuroma at the site of nerve injury, and consideration should be given toward early microneurosurgical intervention.

For an unobserved nerve injury, the plan should be to continue neurosensory testing for 1 month and then to refer for surgery in the 1- to 3-month (LN) or 3- to 6-month (IAN) time periods. For an observed nerve injury, treatment should focus on the specific etiology. For a suspected traction injury (Sunderland first-, second-, and third-degree injuries), the patient should be tested for 1 month for signs of expected spontaneous recovery. In the case of nerve compression, immediate decompression should be considered. This includes removal of a root displaced into the IAN canal, removal or replacement when there is evidence of implant impingement within the confines of the IAN canal, or reduction and alignment of a displaced posterior mandible fracture including the IAN canal. Neurosensory testing should be performed after decompression, and microneurosurgery should be considered as indicated. Chemical injuries should be debridged promptly. For observed transection injuries (Sunderland fourth- or fifth-degree injuries), an immediate primary repair may be performed for a clean transection injury (e.g., scalpel

transection). For an avulsive injury (e.g., LN entangled in a bur), consideration is given to a "delayed primary repair" performed at 3 weeks after the injury. This allows time for the proximal and distal nerve stumps to define the extent of fascicular injury and to determine whether the immediate surrounding environment is conducive to nerve repair surgery, at a time when there are very high levels of neurotropic and neurotrophic factors (at 21 days after injury). After microneurosurgery, patients should be examined with repeat neurosensory testing following the first signs or symptoms of return of sensation. Sensory reeducation exercises (2PD, BSD) should be considered early in the postoperative period to potentially augment neurosensory recovery.

The reported success rates of microneurosurgical reconstruction after nerve injury are highly variable in the literature. This is due to many factors including the lack of standardization in the diagnosis and management process and also with wide variations of the following [60]: patient age, etiology of the nerve injury, time of delay from injury to repair, the skill, experience,

and training of the microneurosurgeon, the specific surgical techniques used, the length of the nerve gap, the methods of clinical neurosensory testing, the use of normative values for control sites, the length of the follow-up period, and importantly, the criteria used by the surgeon to define "success" (Table 45.6). A global review of the literature might indicate a success rate of  $30 - 50\%$  after microneurosurgery, including direct and indirect (gap or graft) repair techniques. These studies generally use subjective patient assessments to quantify the results into a scale used by the patient to define the sensation after microneurosurgery as worse, no change, some improvement, or good improvement. In general, direct repair (neurorrhaphy) had historically and theoretically been preferred over nerve graft repair (e.g., using an autogenous or allogeneic cadaveric nerve graft) and has had reasonable reported success rates [61], but more recent data indicate that the use of a nerve allograft may improve neurosensory recovery over direct repair for two reasons: (1) the nerve graft can ensure that there is no tension on the repair site, and (2) the nerve graft brings neurotropic and neurotrophic factors with it to the site of injury to potentially augment nerve recovery. Perhaps the largest study on nerve repair for the trigeminal nerve to date indicates an overall "success" rate of  $76.2\%$  in 521 patients [62]. The success criteria were defined as light touch detected more than  $80\%$  of the time and a  $30\%$  decrease in postoperative pain level.

Although the success criteria are less than ideal, the study results suggested some important trends in outcome after microneurosurgery: hypoesthetic (decreased sensation) injuries improved more after microneurosurgery than did hyperesthetic (unpleasant sensation) injuries; the LN recovered more than did the IAN overall after microneurosurgery; and there was a decrease in success associated with a delay from injury to repair of longer than 6 months. Another report of 51 microneurosurgical reconstructions (direct and gap repairs) found that 10 patients subjectively reported good improvement, 18 patients some improvement, 22 patients no improvement, and 1 patient reported feeling worse after surgery [63]. This indicates that  $55\%$  of patients (28/51) showed some improvement, or "success." In another study of 53 surgical patients, with a mean follow-up of 13 months, light touch improved from  $0\%$  to  $51\%$  and pinprick nociception improved from  $34\%$  to  $77\%$ . Patients in this study also experienced improved taste and an increased number of fungiform papillae, and there was a decrease in incidence of accidental tongue biting. Interestingly, there was no correlation of success with delay from time of injury to repair. No patient became completely normal, and there was no reduction in dysesthesia; however, most patients considered the surgery worthwhile. In order to most appropriately interpret the literature and allow proper assessment and management of patients who sustain nerve injuries based upon a critical review of evidence-based medicine, there is certainly a need for standardization in all aspects of evaluation and management of the nerve-injured patient.

# 45.8 Surgical Treatment

Microneurosurgical reconstruction surgery involves an orderly sequence of surgical procedures including nerve identification and exposure (either via access through soft tissues for the LN (Fig. 45.13) or via an osteotomy for the IAN (Fig. 45.14)), dissection of the nerve from the surrounding tissues, assessment of the degree of injury, manipulation of the nerve (neurolysis), which may include neuroma resection, debridement of the nerve stumps as required, and repair with a direct anastomosis (or more recently, a connector-assisted repair technique) or the use of a nerve graft or conduit (although the use of a conduit is not commonly performed). Many of the techniques of trigeminal nerve repair closely mimic those of hand surgery (although surgical access to the IAN and LN is more limited) and use similar standard microneurosurgical instrumentation. In general, surgical loupe magnification  $(3.5\times$  magnification) is adequate for most trigeminal nerve

microneurosurgeries. An operating microscope  $(12\times$  magnification) provides a higher magnification, but it is cumbersome and difficult to use effectively with a transoral exposure in the posterior oral cavity, although it may be more useful with a transfacial approach to the IAN. Most experienced microneurosurgeons have had some form of advanced training in the technical aspects of this specific type of surgery, including the use of microinstruments and an operating microscope for both vascular and neural tissue handling and repair, although, as mentioned previously, these techniques are becoming more widespread with dissemination of the principles and practice of microneurosurgery, as well as microvascular surgery, in oral and maxillofacial surgery residency training programs in the United States and abroad.

# 45.8.1 Exposure

Surgical access to the LN or IAN may be accomplished transfacially or transorally. The transfacial approach to the IAN in the posterior mandible affords wide surgical exposure and access; however, it necessitates a facial incision with subsequent scar formation. The intraoral approach provides a more difficult surgical access and requires more diligence during the procedure involving the posterior regions of the oral cavity, but it avoids a

facial scar. The decision regarding surgical access depends on an individual patient's anatomy; the site of nerve injury; planned surgical procedures; patient preference; and surgeon's preference, skill, and experience.

The IAN may be exposed surgically via a variety of methods (Fig. 45.15). The buccal window or corticotomy approach provides limited access, and also carries the risk of iatrogenic injury to the nerve during exposure, even if a piezosurgery unit is used for the corticotomy procedure. In fact, in most cases of posterior mandibular IAN injuries, the preferred approach is a unilateral sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) approach to provide wide surgical access for repair and possible grafting of the IAN. Monocortical plate and screw fixation without postoperative maxillomandibular fixation minimizes the risk of compression of the nerve repair once it has been completed. The LN is exposed via a lingual gingival sulcus approach (Fig. 45.16), and while the distal segment of the nerve is typically accessible in the floor of the mouth, the proximal aspect of the nerve in the pterygomandibular space may present a challenge for access and surgical repair. In addition to standard microsurgical instrumentation, vessel loops can be useful to isolate the proximal and distal nerve stumps once they have been identified, and a surgical sponge or colored background material can be used to better visualize the nerve during repair.

# 45.8.2 External Neurolysis

Microdissection of the nerve once exposed involves liberation of the nerve from the surrounding tissues to facilitate inspection. For the LN, this procedure may commonly involve the release of the nerve from a lateral adhesive neuroma in the area of the lingual plate in the third molar region or from within the healing third molar extraction site itself; whereas for the IAN, a lateral corticotomy or SSO is generally required in order to perform an external neurolysis and mobilization of the IAN from within the inferior alveolar canal. Several techniques have been described for lateral decortication (using piezosurgery) in the area of the third molar for IAN exposure, ranging from a simple nerve transpositioning procedure to a modified buccal corticotomy or a unilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (Fig. 45.15)

[64]. The specific location of the injury as well as the surgeon's preference frequently dictate the specific approach used. The LN is usually exposed via a modified incision used for third molar surgery with a gingival sulcular lingual extension (Fig. 45.16). As another example, external neurolysis of the infraorbital nerve (V2) may be performed via reduction and fixation of a displaced orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex fracture impinging on the neurovascular bundle as it exits through the infraorbital foramen. It has been suggested that external neurolysis may provide definitive treatment for a nerve injury if the nerve compression is less than  $25\%$  of the normal diameter, if the paresthesia is of short duration  $(< 6$  months), and if there is no evidence of neuroma formation [65]. Typically, external neurolysis is followed by techniques of "internal" neurolysis that will address the specific fascicular injury by internal nerve manipulation.

# 45.8.3 Internal Neurolysis

The term internal neurolysis refers to surgical manipulation within the confines of the epineurium that is performed in order to prepare the nerve for subsequent repair. Sophisticated maneuvers that involve attempts to dissect the individual fascicles of the nerve (especially in

a polyfascicular nerve) may compromise repair by unnecessary removal of tissue and/or induction of scar formation owing to excessive manipulation in the interfascicular space. Several methods of internal neurolysis have been described, including epifascicular epineurotomy, epifascicular epineurectomy, and interfascicular epineurectomy (Fig. 45.17). The first two techniques

![](images/60f0109bdb7e2b89ebb65f4aa09b4e9291abde45fcdd9bda10185f5a667f8ab8.jpg)

prepare the epineurium for repair, and the third technique involving interfascicular dissection may cause further fascicular disruption and tissue scarring. Extensive internal neurolysis procedures should be used with caution, with the goal of doing no further harm to the uninvolved segments of the proximal and distal nerve stumps.

Internal neurolysis techniques are generally not applied to the IAN and LN.

# 45.8.4 Nerve Stump Preparation

Perhaps the most critical portion of the microneurosurgical procedure involves thorough inspection of the proximal and distal nerve stumps via magnification. It should be noted that there may already be an existing discontinuity from a transection or partial transection injury to the nerve, or from the surgical exposure, manipulation, external neurolysis, and microneurosurgical attempts to identify the nerve stumps, and identification of the proximal and distal stumps may be difficult owing to scar tissue forma- tion. When a neuroma of any type is present, meticulous attention to detail is required in order to remove all neuromatous tissue (Fig. 45.18). It must be recognized that with any neuroma, the clinical appearance of neuronal edema or atrophy may be less apparent than the actual, more severe internal fascicular disruption (Fig. 45.18a). The failure by the microneurosurgeon to resect enough nerve tissue to encounter normal nerve fascicular tissue will inevitably result in failure of neurosensory recovery. Once the nerve is divided, when necessary, into proximal and distal stumps, care must be taken to sequentially resect small (1-mm) portions of the nerve trunk in both directions (Fig. 45.18b) until healthy glistening white "mushrooming" fascicles are seen to herniate through the edges of the epineurium (Fig. 45.18c). In addition, interfascicular bleeding should be seen also to indi

cate that the stumps have been resected back to health vascular tissue within the nerve vascular plexus (Fig. 45.19). The microneurosurgeon should be confident that the repair will be performed in order to anastomose healthy nerve tissues, rather than neuromatous tissue, and this requires an aggressive approach at this point and may result in a greater need for consideration of indirect (nerve graft) repair over direct, or connector-assisted neurorrhaphy. The informed consent process for all microneurosurgical procedures should include a discussion of options for nerve graft repair in the event that this becomes necessary during the surgical procedure due to excessive tension on the nerve repair site.

# 45.8.5 Approximation

The trigeminal nerve is similar to other peripheral nerves in that it does not tolerate tension well; therefore, tension-free closure after microneurosurgical repair is mandatory [66]. The deleterious effects of tension on a repair site result from vascular compromise and subsequent fibrosis at the nerve repair site, essentially resulting in the formation of a surgically induced neuroma. Approximation is the act of bringing the nerve stumps into direct contact and assessing the degree of tension that may be present. At the time of approximation, a decision must be made regarding whether to use an interpositional nerve graft. In general, mobilization with primary epineurial repair (more commonly now with a connector-assisted repair) is usually possible when the LN gap is less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  and when the IAN gap is less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$ . The difference in acceptable gap length is due to the relative immobility of the IAN within the confines of the inferior alveolar canal, whereas there is usually more mobility of the LN stumps with dissection into the pterygomandibular space in a posterior direction and the floor of the mouth in an anterior direction.

# 45.8.6 Coaptation

Coaptation is the process of aligning the proximal and distal nerve stumps into the correct premorbid cross-sectional fascicular orientation. This is a very difficult maneuver to accomplish with a polyfascicular nerve that has undergone any degree of proximal or distal nerve structural alteration in diameter or fascicular pattern. This surgical step of coaptation of the LN or IAN is usually not performed with diligence in because of the complex polyfascicular pattern of the nerve as well as the limited visualization in the posterior oral cavity. It is

for this very reason that a connector-assisted epineurial repair is used rather than a direct epineurial repair technique (Fig. 45.20).

Fig. 45.21 Direct epineurial neurorrhaphy

$(< 0.5 \mathrm{~mm})$  between the nerve stumps to accomplish two very important goals: (1) eliminate tension at the repair site and shift the tension to the epineurium remote from the actual repair site, and (2) prevent fascicular malalignment between the nerve stumps.

# 45.8.7 Neurorrhaphy

Neurorrhaphy is the act of bringing the nerve ends together and maintaining this position with sutures. A direct neurorrhaphy is performed with the proximal and distal nerve stumps, and an indirect neurorrhaphy is performed when using an interpositional nerve graft between the nerve stumps. The polyfascicular trigeminal nerve is repaired using epineurial sutures, not perineurial sutures (Fig. 45.21), because any attempt to suture the individual fascicles would be technically difficult as well as prone to induce excessive scar tissue in the area of nerve repair. Generally, 8-0 to 10-0 monofilament nonresorbable nylon suture is preferred with a spatula needle, because a resorbable suture material would tend to invoke an inflammatory response and disturb the area of anticipated neural healing. At least two sutures should be used per anastomosis site to prevent rotation of the nerve stumps, but no more than three or four sutures should be used per anastomosis. In the classic direct epineurial repair technique, the first suture is usually placed on the medial side of the anastomosis

because it is the more difficult site of repair to access. The epineurium is pierced with the needle approximately  $0.5 - 1.0\mathrm{mm}$  from the edge of the nerve stump. The second suture is placed 180 degrees from the first suture row on the lateral aspect of the repair site, and then an assessment is made regarding the necessity for the placement of one or two additional sutures. As mentioned, a connector-assisted epineurial technique is used more commonly now and, if a graft is needed, the nerve allograft construct with connectors is prepared on the back table in preparation for grafting, if necessary. The suture is passed through the edge of the connector and through the epineurium such that each end of the nerve stumps will enter the connector near the middle with a micro-gap  $(0.5\mathrm{mm})$  between the edges of the nerve within the connector. Following the connector-assisted neurorrhaphy, a nerve protector (same material as the nerve connectors, extracellular matrix from porcine small intestine submucosa, AxoGen, Inc, Alachua, FL, USA) is used to prevent fibrous ingrowth and scar contracture at the nerve repair site.

# 45.8.8 Nerve Grafts

When neurorrhaphy is not possible without tension, and a nerve gap exists, an interpositional nerve graft must be considered for indirect neurorrhaphy [67]. The options for autogenous nerve grafting include, but are not limited to, the sural nerve, the greater auricular nerve, and possibly the medial ante-brachial cutaneous nerve [68]. The sural nerve is preferred for grafting because it most appropriately matches the nerve diameter and the fascicular number and pattern of the trigeminal nerve (Table 45.7) [69]. The area of the sural nerve superior to the lateral malleolus exhibits less branching than at or below the lateral malleolus. The sural nerve (medial sural cutaneous nerve), is a branch of the sacral plexus (S1, S2) and supplies sensory information to the poste

rior lower extremity and the dorsolateral foot. Sural grafts up to  $20~\mathrm{cm}$  in length are possible, and patients tolerate the donor site deficit well [70]. The greater auricular nerve is a poor choice for trigeminal repair. As a branch of the cervical plexus (C1, C2), the greater auricular nerve supplies sensation to the pre- and postauricular regions, the lower third of the ear, and the skin overlying the posteroinferior border at the angle of the mandible. Patients are generally not amenable to sacrificing sensation of one facial region to regain sensation in another neighboring location. In addition, the small diameter of the greater auricular nerve makes it useful only when used as a cable graft (Fig. 45.22). The sole advantage of a greater auricular graft over a sural graft is in situations when it can be harvested via the same incision for another procedure, such as the repair of an extraoral mandibular fracture or management of pathology. The basic premise with graft repair is that the nerve graft will supply the Schwann cell conduit sheaths and the growth factors necessary to support and encourage axonal sprouting through the graft toward the target site. In addition, there is an FDA-approved human cadaveric allogeneic nerve graft that may be used for repair of IAN and LN discontinuities; many studies show promising results with this Avance nerve allograft (AxoGen, Inc, Alachua, FL, USA). This allograft is available in various lengths and diameters that can be used to match the trigeminal system. Although the allograft is decellularized via an enzymatic process, it maintains certain neurotrophic and neurotropic factors such as basement membrane laminin that can augment nerve recovery. The current standard of practice involves the use of the nerve allograft over a nerve autograft due to the lack of donor site morbidity as well as comparable clinical outcomes.

# 45.8.9 Entubulation Techniques

In an attempt to avoid donor site morbidity, a variety of entubation techniques have been proposed to create conduits to support nerve regeneration (Fig. 45.23). These conduits include both autogenous and alloplastic materials. The autogenous options include vein [71-73], collagen [74, 75], and muscle grafts [76]. Alloplastic materials include polyglycolic acid [77], polymeric silicone [78], and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [79-82]. It appears that the use of these alloplastic materials has a high success in the animal model, but poor human clinical outcomes. Perhaps this is due to the fact that these materials have no inherent strength to prevent compression during the postoperative period. Therefore, these conduits are not excellent options for trigeminal nerve repairs, especially those nerve defects  $>5\mathrm{mm}$

# 45.8.10 Immediate IAN Reconstruction with Mandibular Resection

Evidence shows that the IAN is amenable to immediate reconstruction at the time of ablative mandibular resection, and that clinical outcomes are excellent (Fig. 45.24). Virtual surgical planning (VSP) can be used to plan the exact length, diameter, and location for the nerve graft to decrease additional operative time. The technique depends upon the extent of mandibular resection, but it involves surgical division of the IAN at the mental foramen and at the mandibular foramen, and reconstruction of the nerve with a  $70\mathrm{mm}$  length  $\times 3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  diameter cadaveric nerve allograft using a connector-assisted repair and then lateralization of the graft to avoid the planned bone graft or fibula flap and simultaneous or subsequent dental implant and prosthetic reconstruction. Most experienced surgeons can document a  $90\%$  success in the recovery of functional or useful sensory recovery according to the MRCS (Fig. 45.25).

# Key Points for Surgical Treatment

1. Microneurosurgery may be indicated for nonresolving paresthesia.  
2. Standard methods and sequencing for microneurosurgical reconstruction are used.  
3. A connector-assisted epineurial repair is preferred over the classic direct repair technique.  
4. When nerve repair cannot be performed without tension, a nerve allograft is preferred over a nerve autograft due to lack of donor site morbidity.  
5. Immediate IAN reconstruction during ablative mandibular resection should be considered.

# 45.9 Postsurgical Management

In the majority of cases, patients experience a variable period of complete anesthesia after nerve repair. In general, the nerve regeneration process progresses at approximately  $1\mathrm{mm/day}$  ( $\sim 3\mathrm{cm / mo}$ ) from the cell body to the target site. For example, with a direct IAN repair, the approximate distance from the trigeminal ganglion to the lower lip and chin is nearly  $10\mathrm{cm}$ ; therefore, complete nerve regeneration of an IAN repair would take about 100 days, or 12 weeks, after microneurosurgical repair. With nerve graft repair, the time frame may be the same or lengthened owing to the need for regeneration through the increased distance of the graft itself. As mentioned, the use of sensory reeducation "biofeedback" exercises in the postoperative period may improve or accelerate neurosensory recovery. For the LN or IAN, this may simply involve self-performance of a two-point discrimination or brushstroke directional discrimination test while looking in a mirror, using the uninvolved side of the tongue or lower lip and chin as the control site in order to quantify normalcy. It should be remembered that a poor outcome after attempted microneurosurgery may preclude future surgical options; therefore, the best chance for microneurosurgical success occurs at the first (and most likely, last) surgical intervention. It should also be noted that patients who have signs and symptoms of neuropathic pain before an attempt at microneurosurgical repair are likely to have persistence or recurrence of their pain after surgery, so strong consideration should be given towards pharmacologic therapy as the mainstay of treatment in a multidisciplinary setting with experienced clinicians.

# 45.10 Medicolegal Issues

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons recognize the potential medicolegal issues related to nerve injuries that occur due to third molar removal, and these adverse outcomes account for a large proportion of the medical liability claims in this country and abroad [83]. Based upon the information contained in this chapter and recent trends in liability defense, all oral and maxillofacial surgeons should have a minimum understanding of the diagnosis and management of nerve injuries according to the so-called legal parameters of care, with which the legal profession is familiar [84]. These basic principles are summarized as follows:

Spontaneous sensory recovery occurs in most, but not all patients. It is difficult to predict early, it may not be "complete," and it may not be to the patient's satisfaction. Nerves in soft tissue (LN) have a lower rate of spontaneous regeneration than do those in bony canals (IAN).  
- All nerve injuries should be documented and evaluated with a history, examination, and neurosensory testing (objective and subjective). The injury should be classified (Seddon or Sunderland). In cases of observed or known nerve injury, prompt referral for microsurgery provides the best opportunity for sensory recovery.  
- Repeat examinations at frequent intervals may be necessary. Patients should be followed up for at least 1 month. Complete recovery in 1 month indicates neurapraxia, and no further treatment is indicated. Neurosensory dysfunction that lasts longer than

1 month indicates a higher-grade injury with uncertain spontaneous neurosensory recovery. Microneurosurgical consultation should be considered.

Nerve injuries that show improvement (objective and/ or subjective) may be followed up expectantly.

Once improvement stops for a period of time, it usually does not begin again.  
- Most nerve injuries resolve within 3–9 months, but only if improvement begins before 3 months. Patients who are anesthetic at 3 months usually do not achieve significant neurosensory recovery. Prompt microsurgery is usually indicated.  
Patients with partial sensory loss and/or painful sensations that they find unacceptable should be considered for microsurgery if objective and subjective findings have not improved or returned to normal by 4 months. Microsurgical delay decreases the chance of success because progressive distal nerve degeneration and/or the development of a central pain syndrome occur.  
Some painful neuropathies may be managed nonsurgically under the supervision of a microneurosurgeon or other experienced individual (e.g., neurologist).  
Angry uninformed patients with nerve injuries are less likely to improve with any treatment, surgical or nonsurgical. A discussion regarding options and the risk of nerve injury should be provided so that the patient can give informed consent. Local anesthetic injections carry a risk of nerve injury.  
- Early surgical intervention (i.e., at 3–4 months) is more likely to produce neurosensory improvement than late intervention. Surgery delayed beyond 12 months is seriously compromised by distal nerve degeneration and the development of chronic pain syndromes.  
- Surgery is more likely to improve responses to objective sensory testing and/or to reduce functional impairment than to reduce pain or subjective feelings of numbness.

# Conclusions

Since nerve injuries occur commonly, prompt referral for evaluation by an experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeon, neurologist, and/or microneurosurgeon may improve outcomes following these injuries. Proper clinical neurosensory testing must be performed to classify the degree of the injury, establish the severity of the injury, and determine the prognosis for recovery. Nonsurgical treatment options can be used, with or without consultation with a neurology specialist. Microneurosurgical repair should be performed by an experienced surgeon in order to ensure the greatest chance of neurosensory recovery. Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of nerve injuries continues.
