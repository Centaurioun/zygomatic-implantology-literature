# Learning Aims

1. Implants placed into a partially dentate site behave somewhat differently than do natural teeth.  
2. Although predictable, osseointegrated dental implants have certain biologic requirements to maintain healthy peri-implant tissues.  
3. When using dental implants to replace teeth, the distribution of the edentulous span is one of the most critical predictors of biomechanical success.  
4. The use of immediate load prostheses is beneficial to stabilizing the implants and stabilizing the occlusal plane and assists in making patients comfortable through their time of osseointegration and healing.  
5. The use of osseointegrated implants in microvascular osseous flaps assists well with occlusal rehabilitation of patients afflicted with orofacial defects from tumor ablative surgery.

# 10.1 Introduction

# - Implant Components

A wide array of dental implant components is available for impression procedures, laboratory fabrication, and direct restorative dentistry. A new array of digital components allows transferring information to the laboratory virtually. Scan bodies are the digital version of

impression posts used to transfer this information. The various types of osseointegrated implants were discussed previously.

Abutments are simply transmucosal extensions for the attachment of prostheses. Abutments can be used to provide a restorative connection above soft tissues and to provide for the biologic width. Abutments can be used for attachment of screw-retained or cemented connections and can be made of metal or ceramic. The most commonly used abutment material is machined titanium, which has been shown to be strong and resistant to plaque retention and to react favorably to soft tissues. Titanium abutments have been used historically for the attachment of screw-retained connections. Two of these types of abutments are shown in Fig. 10.1. Titanium abutments are also used in many cases in which a cemented prosthetic connection is desired. With thin gingiva, the gray hue of these abutments can be problematic in aesthetic areas. Cast gold has been used for abutment connections owing to its blend with translucent gingival tissues. Other alternatives are to anodize the abutment with a variety of anodization colors such as gold or pink, making this less conspicuous through thin tissues [1]. Although no hemidesmosomal attachment is found with cast alloys or dental porcelain [2], yellow gold creates a warm appearance in aesthetically critical areas. In aesthetic areas, ceramic abutments have also been used in cemented designs for single- and

multiple-unit crowns (Fig. 10.2). Similar to titanium, these abutments manifest a biologic attachment. The material used in these products has been mainly aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide. Generally, when soft tissues are less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness in the aesthetic zone, the use of ceramic abutments are indicated [3].

The decision to use an abutment for screw-retained restorations can be made based on the depth of tissue. Generally,  $3\mathrm{mm}$  or more of tissue depth necessitates the use of an abutment. As with any restorative procedure, biologic width is the driving force between the alveolar bone and the prosthetic margin. If the tissue depth is less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , biologic width is probably created from

a portion of the implant; therefore, the prosthesis may be connected directly to the implant, bypassing the need for an abutment. If the restorative dentist is unsure of which abutment to use, a fixture-level impression can be recorded and the selection process completed as a consideration in the laboratory.

Impression procedures used for dental implants are based on transferring either the abutment position or the implant position to the laboratory. If abutments are to be used for a screw-retained restoration, an impression coping is placed on the abutment, and either a closed- or an open-tray technique can be used (Fig. 10.3). The open-tray technique is considerably

more accurate and is indicated for multiple splinted units. At this point, an abutment analogue or replica is attached in the impression, and a cast is poured in the laboratory to simulate the oral situation.

If no abutment is to be used or if a cemented design is to be employed, a fixture-level impression with an impression post can be made in a similar open- or closed-tray technique. Subsequently, an implant analogue or replica is attached to the impression post in the impression, and simulated gingival material is placed; then, a cast is poured to create a soft tissue master model (Fig. 10.4). The simulated gingival material allows the dentist or technician to select an appropriate abutment and/or design the prosthesis while preserving the actual position of the gingiva.

Impressions captured digitally have also been shown to be quite helpful as specific impression posts (also known as scan bodies) are used. This "impression" is actually a three-dimensional file created by a scanning device captured by confocal photography and assembled into a three-dimensional file called STL (Standard Tessellation Language). From this file, creation of restoration, abutment connection, and even models can be produced from digital workflows by selected predesignated dental laboratories. The production of single-unit restorations has been demonstrated to be proficient (Fig. 10.5). Some difficulties remain with fabrication of multiple-unit restorations as the fidelity of data for these cases attenuates with increasing numbers of implants. Some of this difficulty is related to producing accurate models which can be either milled or printed.

# 10.2 Biomechanical Considerations

# Peri-Implant Biology

Considerations for tooth replacement with osseointegrated dental implants include the biologic principles of soft and hard tissues of adjacent teeth to the implant site. The placement of an implant between two periodontally healthy teeth is a unique situation, whereby the bone and soft tissue are maintained in part by the teeth. Original studies by Waerhaug [4] and Gargiulo and colleagues [5] showed the width of the dentogingival complex surrounding natural teeth approaching  $3\mathrm{mm}$ . Although the peri-implant tissues are fundamentally different, a study by Cochran and coworkers [6] assimilated the peri-implant tissues to a similar dimension. Based on these principles, the suggested depth of placement of an implant below the free margin of soft tissue is approximately  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 10.6). This distance provides room for biologic width, proper emergence of restoration, and aesthetics and also should allow for remodeling of the soft tissue and bone, which occurs between 6 months and 1 year [7]. It has been postulated by some that the type of periodontium influences how extensive this remodeling process is. In other words, thin, scalloped gingiva recedes more extensively than does thick, nonscalloped gingiva [8, 9]. Restorative interfaces with metal should be kept below the free margin of tissues in anticipation of this remodeling. Tarnow and associates [10] have shown that there is a relationship of the underlying bone to soft tissue in the interdental spaces between natural teeth. A relationship from

Fig. 10.6 Osseointegrated implant placed at a depth of  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  for biologic width and emergence profile

both implant to natural tooth and implant to implant has been demonstrated [11]. Therefore, the distance suggested from the side of the implant to the adjacent tooth should be about  $2\mathrm{mm}$  to avoid horizontal bone loss affecting the adjacent tooth. Similarly, Tarnow and colleagues [11] showed the critical distance between implant surfaces approached about  $3\mathrm{mm}$  before the mutually destructive process of lateral bone resorption accelerated each other's processes (Fig. 10.7). Typically, each implant loses peri-implant bone within the first year and

$\square$  Fig. 10.7 Suggested minimum distances of implant to natural tooth and implant to implant

then stabilizes—one criterion of success as outlined by Albrektsson and coworkers [12]. Whereas this pattern of bone loss is typically followed by Branemark-type implants, other types of implant systems demonstrate a different pattern of bone loss that can emulate one of four different patterns [13]. These four patterns include Albrektsson's previously described low-rate marginal bone loss over the years, low-rate marginal bone loss in the first few years followed by rapid bone loss after

abutment connection, high-rate marginal bone loss in the first few years followed by almost no bone loss, and continuous high-rate bone loss followed by complete loss of bone support.

# Patient Factors

Soft tissue evaluation before implant placement is critical for long-term success and maintenance. A sufficient volume of keratinized and fixed tissue is needed to properly maintain hygiene around an implant, just as it is needed around a natural tooth. Occasionally, it may be necessary to incorporate subepithelial connective tissue or full-thickness soft tissue grafts to prospective implant sites. When restoring single missing teeth, the interproximal bone between the remaining teeth is a good prognostic indicator of the likelihood of creating and preserving interdental papilla. Generally, the distance from the residual alveolar bone to the contact area of the restoration can be assessed on a periapical film. The likelihood of having a papilla is depicted in Table 10.1.

Bone volume is best assessed by radiographic techniques, although a rudimentary estimate can be made clinically by palpation and inspection. Assessing a patient for mandibular implant reconstruction may include intraoral/extraoral palpation as well as panoramic, occlusal, lateral cephalometric, and cone beam radiographs. Single-tooth replacement in the aesthetic zone also can be assessed by comparison of the bony topography of the adjacent teeth as well as periapical/panoramic radiographs. Even these sites can be best topographically analyzed by cone beam CT radiographs [14]. Bone is a scaffold for soft tissue, and it is typical for bone loss to occur on a scale of  $0.2\mathrm{mm / yr}$  after stabilization of initial bone loss pattern. Therefore, it is not unusual that soft tissue recession occurs in this period of time. This recession should be anticipated, especially when considering placing implants in the aesthetic zone and elsewhere.

It is well documented that local and systemic factors, such as cigarette smoking, have a deleterious effect on

Table 10.1 Potential of creating/preserving papilla  

<table><tr><td>Distance from bone to contact area (mm)</td><td>Chance of creating papilla (%)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>6.0</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>7.0</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Adapted from Tarnow et al. [10]</td></tr></table>

the long-term success of dental implants [15-17]. In one study, failure rates of implants placed in type 4 bone approached  $35\%$  in smokers; placement of implants into types 1, 2, and 3 bone of smokers resulted in a failure rate approaching  $3\%$  [18]. It is important to note, however, that these older publications had cited these effects specifically to turned surface implants. Even though smoking detracts from the long-term success of osseointegration with micro-roughened surfaced implants, recent publications on surveying the success of moderately roughened surfaces disclose a more favorable outcome in smokers and also in type 4 bone [19].

Although osteoporosis can be a negating factor to bone density, this disease seems to affect the hip and spine of those afflicted. No clear correlation can be demonstrated that osteoporosis is a contraindication to the placement of dental implants [20].

Periodontal disease is a local factor that should be under control to avoid adverse effects of a unique population of microbiota affecting these diseased sites. Patients treated over a 10-year course with implants that were severely periodontally compromised seem to require advanced surgical intervention with antibiotics and suggest that regular follow-up care is needed to prevent the need for advanced care [21].

Bruxism is another local factor that can compromise long-term success. Generally, bruxism promotes micromovement of the implant bone interface. In bone types 3 and 4, bruxism may have a more pronounced effect on the long-term osseointegration. Off-axis and lateral loading of dental implants by bruxism or other parafunctional forces can be deleterious in the long term with respect to accelerated bone loss and prosthetic failure. Self-awareness and occlusal splint therapy may provide appropriate protection. If these factors cannot be controlled preoperatively, alternative treatment should be considered.

Radiation to the head and neck in excess of  $50\mathrm{Gy}$  is considered a relative contraindication to dental implant placement in most cases. There are instances in which the radiation has created a significant degree of xerostomia, which is incompatible with retaining natural teeth or stabilizing maxillofacial prostheses. Given the risks of osteoradionecrosis, hyperbaric oxygen should be considered if placement of implants would significantly improve the oral health and quality of life in these individuals [22-24]. However, several studies refute the benefit of hyperbaric oxygen to the long-term survival of dental implants [25, 26]. Standard protocol suggested by Marx and Ames [27] is 20 preoperative dives and 10 postoperative dives. Osseous healing from extractions/alveolar remodeling and the cascade of osseointegration events are probably different physiologic processes.

The survival rate of implants placed within radiated tissues approaches 60-70th percentile. In tissues where dosages exceed  $6500\mathrm{cGy}$ , there is substantial risk in performing implant placement. Reflection of periosteal tissues in these cases can lead to a chronic wound healing problem and poses a risk also from osteoradionecrosis [28].

Systemic factors such as diabetes, connective tissue diseases, autoimmune diseases, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are considered relative contraindications to treatment with osseointegrated implants. Patients afflicted with dermal manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to have advanced periimplant bone loss over time [29]. If these disease processes are well controlled, it may be advisable to treat the patient to improve the overall quality of life. Chemotherapy given to patients during osseointegration critical times has not been shown to be subtractive in success [30-33].

# 10.3 Radiographic Evaluation

Periapical radiographs are an excellent way to evaluate single missing teeth because they depict a minimally magnified amount of bone and root topography. Adjacent root angulation, pulp chamber size, periodontal defects, interproximal bone, and residual pathology are some of the factors critical to the treatment planning of single-tooth implant restorations (  $\square$  Fig. 10.8).

Occlusal radiographs for mandibular arch assessment also can give an appreciation of the size of the buccal and lingual cortices as well as the position of the mental foramina (Fig. 10.9). It may be also feasible to incorporate a radiographic marker on the patient's denture to give a perspective of the relationship of the mental foramina to the overlying prosthesis. This can be done with either lead foil from a film packet adhered to the underside of the patient's denture or a stainless steel wire attached to the buccal or occlusal portion of the mandibular denture.

Panoramic radiographs are excellent screening examinations that give a broad perspective on the inferior alveolar canal, maxillary sinuses, mental foramina, and nasal floor; they are used for treatment planning of single and multiple missing teeth. The panoramic film generally has a magnification factor of about  $25\%$ , which should be anticipated on the workup to gain a better appreciation of the actual position of vital structures and the size of implant to be selected. This varies from patient to patient, by location, and also with the machine used. Panoramic radiographs are also useful for verifying complete seating of impression and restorative components. The use of this film over a standard

Fig. 10.9 Occlusal radiograph gives the relative position of mental foramina and the taper of mandible

periapical radiograph is preferable because the incident beam of the tube is more likely to be perpendicular to the long axis of the implant. Also, many edentulous patients have a shallow floor of mouth and flat palatal vault owing to resorption. It is far easier to obtain a perpendicular view of the implant platform in these circumstances, which is critical to the accurate performance in the treatment stages.

![](images/d989dfc7d04be4a99823c0b91b06e575a86443a61a577fd6b843daf4a834034e.jpg)  
Fig. 10.10 Lateral cephalograms may assist in the workup for determining maxillomandibular relationships and occlusal schemes

Lateral cephalometric radiographs assess the maxillomandibular relationship as well as that of the maxilla and mandible to the cranial base. A lateral cephalogram may give an appreciation of the concavity of the lingual surface of the anterior mandible vitally important to surgical consideration of implants in the anterior mandibular area. Development of anticipated implant occlusion is well assessed with lateral radiographic cephalography, which becomes especially useful when recreating anterior guidance and posterior occlusal schemes (Fig. 10.10).

Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a more contemporary technique that gives a reasonable three-dimensional perspective to the interpretation of the adjacent anatomy of a proposed implant site. This technique may be indicated in an implant placement scenario, in which the volume of bone is compromised or diminished, such as an extensively resorbed jaw or prominent maxillary sinus or inferior alveolar canal (Fig. 10.11). The advantage of using the cone beam technique is a markedly reduced radiation dose, increased survey volume, and a reduced scan time in comparison with conventional single-plane CT. Additional factors that acquire a better perspective of osseous pathology can be appreciated by three-dimensional films more so than two-dimensional radiography [34].

CT can be helpful when considering maxillary rehabilitation with a full complement of implants or when other craniofacial landmarks are planned for use. CT may be used in conjunction with computerized technology to aid implant placement. These images may be reformatted to construct a three-dimensional image of the selected part of the craniofacial skeleton. CT scans are useful in assessing the health of the maxillary sinus before augmentive procedures.

$\square$  Fig. 10.11 Cone beam imaging technique to show hard tissue deficit related to proposed positions of teeth

A radiographic or imaging stent can be used when there is a need to join the prosthetic information to the bony topographic information. In creating these stents, acrylic resin can be mixed with  $30\%$  or less barium sulfate as a radiographic marker to create the contour of the intended restoration. Some denture teeth are true to anatomic form and create a radiopaque appearance when included in the stent. As an alternative, access channels can be filled with guttapercha as a radiographic marker. If verified radiographically, this imaging stent may double as a surgical stent.

Additionally, CT scans can also be of benefit where the use of osseous flaps is planned for reconstruction of maxillofacial defects along with simultaneous implant planning. Because of the complex nature of reconstruction, the use of computerized planning is essential to properly manage these demanding operations where bone spatial location and implant placement are critical [35]. Imaging of the donor site also becomes imperative to assess vascular supply and bony anatomy characteristics.

# 10.4 Implant Surgical Guides

Fabrication of surgical guides for implant placement should be part of every case because the placement is permanent and irrevocable after integration. Planning of each case includes the collection of all diagnostic data, as previously mentioned. Once this data has helped

![](images/eb0a16a1e5d1e6440d650aa7fd12da96a3c8240070ca6f23efe48c568637939a.jpg)

Fig. 10.13 Surgical guide showing proposed gingival margin and incisal/occlusal plane. (Surgery performed by Michael S. Block, DMD)

create a thorough treatment plan, fabrication of a surgical guide can begin from the diagnostic models and other information from the workup.

Construction of prostheses begins with a confirmation of occlusal relationships and the need to direct occlusal forces over the long axes of the implants. This becomes exceptionally critical when a fixed restoration is to be used. On this basis, a site is selected and a guide made to assist the surgeon at placement (Fig. 10.12). This information may also be translated from radiographic findings to a surgical guide in the position of the mental foramina (previously described). This information can be used to place implants far away enough from the foramina and each other to be mechanically advantageous. Again, parallelism is of paramount importance if a stud-retained overdenture is used. This guide can be as simple as a vacuum-adapted thermoplastic sheet over an edentulous cast or a clear processed duplicated denture.

Implant-supported overdenture construction may incorporate the use of the surgical guide to keep the implant fixtures away from the peripheral confines of the prosthesis. This may be beneficial to avoid encroaching on the peripheral seal in either aesthetic or functional areas. Also, occlusal forces may be better directed over the long axes of the implants. The device can be either a duplicate of a diagnostic wax-up in clear resin or simply a duplicate of the patient's denture, if acceptable. A guide may be critical in this situation because it will be supported with a splinted structure in which cantilevering may be used. More sophisticated guide design can incorporate the use of the cone beam CT planning to positionally coordinate implant placement within the anatomic confines of the jaw. These stents contain a series of placement guides that telescope to the final placement drill guide, making precision placement attainable in compromised host sites.

Fixed-implant-supported complete dentures mandate the use of a surgical stent because the occlusal access channels are desired to be through the posterior teeth and the lingual aspects of the anterior teeth. In these situations, a slot can be created through these areas to provide the surgeon with latitude in site selection. A clear processed duplicate of the patient's denture may be the best technique in surgical guide design. If immediate loading protocols are to be used, the patient's complete denture can be used for this purpose and modified to fit to the placed implants for immediate load use.

Implant surgical guide design for fixed prostheses is mandated, in which selection of a specific prosthetic design may be entirely dependent on implant position and orientation. In the aesthetic zone, the cemented design may be the preferred method of prosthesis, and placement of an implant in an orientation just palatal through the incisal edge is optimal. Also, the implant platform should be approximately  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  below the free edge of the gingival margin. Two vital pieces of information contained on a surgical guide are the occlusal/incisal plane and gingival margin of the proposed restoration (Fig. 10.13). To obtain this information, a wax-up is performed in the desired occlusal position. Once completed, this model should be duplicated into another cast. A vacuum-adapted guide can be made on this duplicate cast. The matrix can be trimmed with a hot knife and rotary instrument. Guide channels can be created with previous surgical drills or laboratory burs. The constant access diameter of these stents is based on the concentric enlargement of each succeeding drill diameter. These guides are usually easily made, are cost effective, are self-retaining, and do not require pre-fitting. Because they usually fit well, it is only necessary to extend the guide two to three teeth

on either side of the edentulous spaces for partially dentate cases.

Printed implant surgical guides are considerably more accurate and allow proper execution of implant position and orientation. They require scanned models and access to CBCT data that can be manipulated in a software program that allows printing of an STL file that contains the surgical guide sleeves specific to that implant system. Additionally small windows can be built into the guide to insure that it is completely seated, adding to the accuracy of placement.

# 10.5 Implant Site Selection

The use of implants in each jaw can be best approached by evaluation of the three-dimensional volume of bone and proximity to adjacent teeth. If the remaining teeth are salvageable, it is then determined if the existing vertical dimension and occlusal scheme will be made conformative or reorganized [36]. In other words, does the existing occlusal vertical dimension work at this level, or will the natural teeth and new implant prostheses be built to new requirements? Based on the proposed prosthesis support, the number and distribution of implants relative to the proposed occlusal table is attributed to the best long-term result of the implant prosthesis survival [37]. It is through this plan where oral and maxillofacial surgery and prosthodontic first dialogue are most critical. Each discipline has the understanding of the other, whereby the final result is based upon mutual agreement to meet the expectations of the patient.

# Dialogue Between Surgeon and Restorative Dentist

Collaborative dialogue between surgeon and restorative dentist to plan treatment with prosthesis design based on surgical planning should be undertaken.  
Patient understands and agrees to treatment and is understanding of approach used with simultaneous understanding of timing.  
- Advanced understanding of complication management between disciplines.

# 10.6 Crown-to-Implant Ratio

Ideally, a crown-to-implant ratio of 1:1 or less is desired (Fig. 10.14). For this reason, the minimum length needed approaches  $10 - 12\mathrm{mm}$  because the clinical crown length frequently approaches this measurement. Often, replacement of teeth in a compromised site gives rise to single- or multi-unit restorations that have poor or unfa

![](images/dd1f2a56628e46d4708ec1a5c0e1f427eefd5d614a18eaf67de452b534a60650.jpg)  
Fig. 10.14 Ideal crown-to-implant ratio occurs when  $\mathrm{X} \leq \mathrm{Y}$

vorable crown-to-implant ratios. If the restoration participates in anterior guidance, it should be splinted to other implants. If the restoration participates in posterior occlusion, it should be protected by natural canine teeth to limit lateral loads in excursions. If it is placed in conjunction with other implants in the posterior, it may be splinted for mutual support. Although this is often assimilated as with natural teeth, osseointegrated implant restorations need not necessarily follow this construct since many decade-old restorations have been quite successful without compromise. This is merely meant as a guideline to approaching biomechanical distribution as well as prosthesis design.

# 10.7 Occlusion

# Several Axioms in Implant Dentistry Relate to the Development of Occlusal Scheme

Efforts should be made to match implant distribution to the extent of the occlusal table.  
- When restoring occlusion of maxillary and mandibular arches, favor the weaker of the two arches in occlusal design. (In other words, an implant-borne restoration opposing a complete denture should be restored with bilateral balanced occlusion.)

- Avoid fixed maxillary reconstructions against partial or complete mucosal-borne mandibular prostheses.  
- Lateral component forces can be destructive and should be avoided, if possible. In other words, steep anterior guidance placed upon single implants should be avoided. If disclusion is needed, it should be shared with natural teeth.

One additional consideration is that, unlike natural teeth, implants have no proprioception. In fact, many patients restored with dental implants have a significantly increased bite force within the first year [38-40]. In partially dentate cases, the implant restoration should have equal or slightly less occlusal loading than the natural tooth (Fig. 10.15). Also, the occlusal contacts should preferably be placed within the platform of the implant to minimize the possibility of screw loosening. Although this often may not be possible, it should be striven for to minimize complications.

# 10.8 Full-Arch Restorations

Although generally recommended, complete arch reconstructions of the maxilla has been based on placement of 6-10 implants splinted for cross-arch stability [41, 42]. Reasonable length implants  $(>10\mathrm{mm})$  should be considered, especially in the posterior maxilla, because shorter implants into this relatively soft bone have been shown to do poorly in the long term [18]. Again, the literature from years past that incorporate the use of turned surface implants is quite different in outcome than textured surface implants. The maxillary sinuses may preclude placement of a desired distribution of implants, and sinus augmentation or perhaps the use of extended-length implants into the zygomatic bones bilaterally may allow an optimum force distribution for full-arch prostheses (Fig. 10.16). Additional publications have explored the use of four implants placed anterior to the maxillary sinuses by incorporating a tilt to the posterior implants, thereby increasing the anteroposterior spread [43, 44]. This technique has been further augmented by the use of immediate load and splinting with a provisional prosthesis. The use of cortical stabilization of all implants, the use of implants greater than  $13\mathrm{mm}$  in length, and risk profiling to avoid smokers, bruxers, and those with poor bone quality seemed to be favorable with initial success.

Full-arch reconstruction of the mandible can involve different considerations because the mandible is a dynamic bone that flexes and rebounds as it opens and closes. In addition, treating edentulous patients by the use of the approach of four to six implants between the mental foramina with a minimal cantilever to the posterior was used in the pilot studies of osseointegration [45, 46]. The greater the anteroposterior spread or distribution, the greater the amount of cantilever possible. The use of cantilevered restorations is not necessarily met with a high risk for complications and is a plausible

prosthesis design [47]. On average, a 16-mm distal cantilever is permitted (Fig. 10.17). Although successful for edentulous patients, this model is not universally applicable to all configurations of an edentulous mandible and may be limited by the amount of anteroposterior spread of the implants. To avoid using a cantilever, it may be necessary to place implants distal to the mental foramen if supra-canal height permits placement. In such a case, division of the prosthesis into two components prevents unfavorable stress transfer. Another option is to use the distal fixtures for vertical support and not engage the abutment-implant junction with an abutment-coping screw. This allows some flexure of the mandible without transferring stress to the prosthesis and/or implants.

# 10.9 Implant Selection

Historically, osseointegrated dental implants were introduced in their original configuration as a machined parallel-walled screw. The implant possessed a platform with a 4.1-mm diameter, an external hex implant platform (originally used to drive the implant into position), and a 3.75-mm-diameter body; this has been the most common implant type placed worldwide (Fig. 10.18) and has been successfully duplicated in a variety of world populations [48-51]. The original applications were piloted for the edentulous patient, and limited restorative options were available in the first years of its introduction. In later years, the use of surface-textured press-fit-type implants also became popular because their surgical installation was simplistic and achieved earlier integration (because of hydroxylapatite coating) into softer types of bone (Fig. 10.19). At this time, the connection of abutments or prostheses to the surface of the implant was characterized as a butt-joint connection. Abutment stability with single- and multiple-tooth replacement using standard externally hexed implants has a history of cyclic fatigue with abutment screw loosening. As extended applications developed for

![](images/e106f280894d0473a2c1bab8d871bf788197e6626c82549ceda76ace596d5fb1.jpg)

the use of replacements for single and multiple teeth and with immediate loading, an increased need for secure abutment connections, aesthetic versatility, and improved surgical stability in trabecular bone became more apparent. Significant mechanical improvement in abutment and screw-retained components occurred in the early 1990s and markedly decreased complications [52]. Since the early 2000s, industrial trends are toward the use of tapered macroretentive implant configurations, based on the fact that tapered screw-type implants have increased surgical stability in soft bone. An example of these types of implants is shown in  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Fig. 10.20. Implant surfaces have also changed in the early 2000s to incorporate the use of moderately rough implant surfaces. The roughness values are often denoted by two variables: the first is a three-dimensional measurement of the peak-to-valley arithmetic mean (Sa value); the second is a measure of the randomness of surface rough

ness called "isotropism." In animal studies, it has been demonstrated that isotropic (regularly irregular) surfaces with Sa values of  $1 - 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  elicit the more robust bone response [53].

Certain factors that exist in choosing implants also allow favorable biologic responses by the host. For instance, the use of platform switching has had some

element of interest in the fact that several studies have shown that there may be some difference in bone levels around restorations that have a smaller abutment or direct to implant connection in comparison to those that are matched circumference [54, 55]. This term is known as platform switching and has been variably interpreted outcomes in patient-specific circumstances. From a soft tissue coverage, this seems to allow a more coronal position of soft tissues, making a favorable impression in aesthetically critical areas.

Platform switching is a concept of using a dental implant abutment of smaller diameter than the dental implant; longitudinal radiographic observation has demonstrated decreased vertical bone resorption [56].

Implants that possess a flat surfaced platform to where abutment and prosthesis components are affixed clearly have an advantage to resist deformation over time when a preload for screw torque is applied. Although the trend may be changing, certain implant platforms appear to be more favorable choices than others where off-centered loading, cantilevering, or angle correction is employed. When these connections are compared, there is loss of the preload originally applied after cycling to 100,000 repetitions [57]. In fact, residual torque value is significantly higher in externally hexed implants in comparison to internally connected implants [58]. If the goal of prosthesis design is to make screw retained direct to implant connection, making analogue impressions of flat-surface implant platforms is more simplistic than that of multiple internal connections. If multiple internally connected implants are used in these cases, the use of abutments often becomes necessary to make this mechanically feasible.

The Morse taper, a cone within a cone attachment mechanism, is a feature of some implant systems that allow the abutment-prosthetic connection to facilitate installation and to maintain stability (Fig. 10.21). This taper creates a seating effect of the connection to the internal aspects of the implant; therefore, fewer lateral stresses are transferred to the abutment screw, resulting in a less frequent incidence of screw loosening and fracture. Morse tapers are measured in percentage units that reflect the shaft length relative to the radius of the shaft. Thus, if for every centimeter of shaft the radius increases  $0.01\mathrm{cm}$ , this would by definition be a  $1\%$  Morse taper. Most Morse tapers are anywhere from  $1\%$  to  $7\%$ , and dentistry most commonly employs the  $4 - 7\%$  series. The use of specific implants resistant to the problems of abutment screw loosening and immediate

stability is probably more critical in cases of single missing teeth or in which a cemented implant crown and bridge are planned. The traditional parallel-walled screw continues to enjoy success in the general population of edentulous patients restored with implants. The vast majority of prospective and retrospective studies have concluded that this specific implant is highly successful for restorations in edentulous patients. Long-term development has resulted in an increased number of components for edentulous and partially dentate applications. It is advisable for the surgeon to become familiar with the restorative components available when treatment planning for implant cases.

# 10.10 Single-Tooth Replacement

# The Non-Restorable Tooth

Replacement of a single missing tooth should start with an evaluation of the periodontium and structural support. Periodontal defects, periapical pathology, bone loss, mobility, and pain are indications for periodontal/ endodontic treatment or extraction. Other factors that require assessment before consideration for either restoration or extraction are the remaining coronal tooth structure, root fracture, and restorative space. The decimated tooth may have only one wall of the coronal structure remaining. Structural deficits of this type can be restored by using intracoronal anchorage methods (i.e., elective endodontics or post and core). However, vertical deficits that encroach upon the biologic width may necessitate crown elongation to provide enough tooth structure necessary for a ferrule or external bevel, which provides encasement of remaining tooth struc

ture. A 2-mm amount of coronal tooth structure has been shown to improve long-term structural resistance to failure [59-61]; in total, biologic width plus a 2-mm ferruled tooth structure necessitates about  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  of suprabony tooth structure. If this is not available, it may be created by either orthodontic extrusion or crown elongation, which may sometimes create unfavorable crown-to-root ratios or furcation exposure. In this scenario, it may be prudent to consider extraction and either replacement with a fixed partial denture (FPD) or a single-tooth implant-supported restoration. Much of the literature indicates standard FPD survival to be in the high 80th percentile at 10 years and the 60th percentile at 15 years [62]. However, typical complications occurring at different time points are related to endodontics, recurrent caries, periodontal factors, and failures in retention. Single-tooth implant studies reveal complications as well [63]. However, in comparison with other implant restorations, the single crown implant is the most successful. If sufficient bone, soft tissue, and restorative dimension exist, replacement with an implant-supported single-tooth restoration is considered the standard of care and should be offered to the patient [64, 65].

The decision to remove a tooth based on restorability and additional procedures needed may better direct resources so that implant replacement is a more predictable outcome.

# The Aesthetic Zone

Aesthetic considerations encompass additional complex concerns, such as gingival display, proportion of teeth in the aesthetic zone, and bone density support. The aesthetic zone is generally considered to be the maxillary anterior area. When considering replacement of a single tooth in the aesthetic zone, the adjacent dentition should also be evaluated for proportionality and position. From a frontal plane, the lateral incisor should be about two-thirds the width of the central incisor. Likewise, the width of the canine when viewed from the same vantage point should be about two-thirds the width of the lateral incisor and so on. The width-to-length ratio of aesthetically pleasing central incisors should be approximately  $66 - 80\%$  [66]. The axioms are ranges found in nature and are considered pleasing to the human eye. If these proportions are not present, they may be augmented by surgical periodontics, restorative dentistry, orthodontics, and, if appropriate, osseointegrated implants.

Occasionally, replacement of maxillary or mandibular canines may present a compromise in either occlusion or aesthetics for the functional goal of eliminating lateral forces on the restoration/implant. Aesthetic and/

or functional correction may dictate the need for pretreatment orthodontics, endodontics, periodontics, and concurrent restorative dentistry. A complete examination that includes diagnostic models, radiographs, and clinical photographs can be invaluable.

Aesthetic considerations for removable prosthodontics may be a concern for maxillary edentulous arches when restoring the facial contours typically lost when missing teeth. The demarcation between the residual alveolar ridge and the use of a flange may be necessary to eliminate the interface usually apparent in these cases. Occasionally, surgical reduction of bone further is needed to make this less conspicuous. The use of a flange in the edentulous maxillary arch may be beneficial to restore upper lip support as well as the aesthetic integrity so critical to this area. A functional lingual maxillary alveolar seal is essential for correct labiodental consonant production; in cases of advanced resorption of the maxilla, an overdenture may be the appropriate treatment.

# Cemented Single Units

Cemented prostheses may be preferable to screw-retained designs for single-unit crowns in the anterior areas. They tend to provide minimized bulk of the restoration. Overcontoured bulky restorations are not hygienic and are detrimental to the maintenance of periimplant tissues. The axis of implant placement should be aimed through the incisal edge for standard-diameter implants (Fig. 10.22). This results in predictable aesthetics and manageable soft tissues. If a comparably wider implant is placed (4.3, 5.0, or  $6.0\mathrm{mm}$ ) in an aesthetic site, the long axis should traverse just palatal through the incisal edge. Errors in placement to the facial of the incisal edge produce not only difficulties with angulation correction but also a soft tissue problem because the bone support in this area is lost owing to the osteotomy (Fig. 10.23). Errors in placement too far palatally create ridge-lapping and hygiene difficulties. The superior/inferior placement of the implant platform should be  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  below the anticipated free gingival margin. The use of a surgical guide in placement aids in creating an optimal site for implant restoration. The choice of cemented restorations for a posterior tooth is plausible and becomes especially useful when angulation in placement is less than ideal. Most posterior restorations are feasibly designed as screw retained to better permit retrieval and servicing.

The resistance and retention form of an abutment should be sufficient to resist dislodgment. The choice of specific abutments can be planned in advance if placement is based on an ideal scenario. Anatomy should not dictate placement of the implant position, but rather the placement should be based on restorative parameters. This information can be obtained by the use of surgical stents, which may provide critical information about where to develop the occlusion and where to recreate the emergent path as the restoration exits the gingival sulcus. It is critical to ensure removal of all luting cement

by the use of retraction cord, vent holes, and radiographic verification because this can lead to soft tissue recession/irritation and bone loss.

# Screw-Retained Single Units

The treatment plan for replacement of a single tooth with screw retention may be the professional preference of the restorative dentist. There are advantages and disadvantages to using this design for single and multiple missing teeth (Table 10.2). Screw-retained prostheses are simplistic to retrieve, are easy to trial fit, and can be shaped to the desired emergence with either porcelain, ceramics, or metal. This design also eliminates the uncertainties of loosening and incomplete debris removal associated with

cemented prostheses. However, using screw-retained prostheses requires strict attention to placement and confines the axis of the implant through the desired area of emergence within the restoration. Some newer implant designs permit screw retention for the angulation difference so inherent to this area. Up to 25-degree angulation differences can be accommodated when using this type of implant (Fig. 10.24). This can be especially useful in the anterior maxilla where trajectory of bone frequently is different than long axes of teeth. Screw-retained prostheses are especially useful in the anterior dentition because retrievability is much easier than with the cemented prosthetic design and a controlled degree of retention is afforded as well (Fig. 10.25).

# 10.11 Restorations for the Partially Edentulous Patient: Fixed Partial Dentures (FPDs)

FPDs require the first assessment of site planning as with other types of restorations. It is of prime importance to understand that the implant bridge should be supported entirely by dental implants. Combining the support with natural teeth has been shown to involve prosthetic complications and intrusion of the abutment teeth for a number of reasons. Although these studies may use the specific scenario of a three-unit FPD supported by a natural tooth and implant, other studies have advocated strategic teeth in combination with implants for full-arch prostheses. For the use in short-span FPDs, it is prudent to keep the restoration supported entirely by dental implants to avoid problems concerning abutment fracture, screw loosening, tooth intrusion, malocclusion, and other complications [67]. Designing the FPD to be screw-retained as opposed to cement-retained is largely based on personal preference but may be tailored to what can be serviced and maintained most easily. Acquiring

implant position accurately is critical especially when several implants are being connected together. The use of a verification index has been shown to reliably transfer this information to the laboratory [68] (Fig. 10.26).

# FPDs in the Aesthetic Zone

$\Theta$  Placement of multi-unit restorations in the anterior maxilla should bring to mind several anatomic considerations for surgical planning:

- Adequate depth of the residual alveolar ridge to the nasal floor  
- Buccolingual width of the bony ridge to provide for implant placement  
- Assessment of the lip when relaxed and upon activation of a smile  
- Participation of the restoration in anterior guidance in conjunction with the adjacent teeth

Anterior FPDs or any restoration in the aesthetic zone should first begin with a diagnostic wax-up or template (Fig. 10.27). This should be tried in place to assess

![](images/ae110c4671e9cc40d18d8b8d8090636567365c26f90102daa57f41c7ed92ac2f.jpg)

the dynamics of the patient's lips in relaxed and smiling actions.

This will give an idea as to the incisal edge position as well as the available restorative dimension and should be verified in the patient's mouth to correspond with facial landmarks, such as the center of the face and interpupillary line. Also, a proportional relationship should exist from the central incisor to the canine from an anterior perspective. This proportionality becomes critical in aesthetically prominent areas. The wax-up may also indicate how much tissue has been lost as a result of the missing teeth, soft tissue, and associated alveolar process. In these cases, it may be necessary to consider horizontal or vertical bone augmentive procedures as a first phase, followed by placement of implants in a second phase. In some cases, it may not be feasible to perform bone grafting owing to local or systemic factors. Making precision detachable bridgework that replaces teeth, soft tissues, and alveolar bone may be

more predictable in these circumstances. If the surgical workup determines implant placement will be done concomitantly with or without a bone graft, the diagnostic wax-up should be used to fabricate a surgical guide or stent for implant placement. If a bone graft is necessary, the surgical guide references the incisal edge and gingival aspect of the future restoration to aid in establishing the proper amount and positioning of the bone graft (Fig. 10.28). Superior/inferior positioning of implants is virtually the same as for single units, described previously. However, the mesiodistal assessment of restorative space should be done first to determine the appropriate implant number and dimension to be placed. Using a  $2\mathrm{-mm}$  rule from each adjacent tooth and a  $3\mathrm{-mm}$  rule from implant to implant, the appropriate implant number and dimension can be calculated. If the available space does not allow an appropriate number of implants or encroachment upon the implant-implant proximity, either restorative dentistry or orthodontics

![](images/5561525ad20ea62589bfb482c7f445b4c95dda24676069515d935b33ab0c1d5a.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 10.28 Computerized navigation reveals the amount of soft/ hard tissue loss

may be indicated. Occasionally, the use of a cantilever bridge design can be advantageous, where space constraints or insufficient bone prohibits placement. If it becomes necessary to cantilever the FPD either mesially or distally, a screw-retained design permits a framework that better withstands the cyclic loading of occlusion and subsequent problems of dislodgement. Screw-retained prostheses require an accurate transfer of implant or abutment positioning. This is best done by the use of verification indices made from splinting the impression components with rigid material prior to removing from the mouth with open-tray impression. This assembly can also be used later as a base for making a provisional restoration described below.

It is considerably more difficult to create a properly fitting screw-retained framework than a cemented framework that has intimate fit with the supporting

![](images/019dd41bf484e6a803c4fb7125d34314f567567b46e6bb9aa5a0efeb75b3ff8d.jpg)

abutments. Conversely, it occasionally becomes necessary to perform angle correction because there is frequent disparity between the long axes of tooth and the long axis of bone available in the anterior maxilla. An intimate fit of FPDs is far easier to achieve with a cemented prosthetic design than with a screw-retained restoration. The subtle inaccuracies of impression-making, alloy casting, and porcelain application make the simultaneous and coincident fit of screw-retained FPDs difficult; thus, a cemented prosthetic design is a more appropriate choice. Creation of a surgical guide is critical for accurate placement and aesthetic success of the implant restoration. After placing and uncovering the implants, it is prudent to create provisional restorations to develop soft tissues.

As with other techniques in restorative dentistry, the provisional restoration allows creation of an occlusal scheme, verifies accurate occlusal position, is available for a backup during repair sessions needed for the definitive restoration, and serves to assess speech and esthetics. Only in this way can an acceptable aesthetic outcome become predictable in the aesthetic zone.

# FPDs in the Anterior Mandible

Placement of multiple-unit restorations in the anterior mandible requires similar forethought as with the anterior maxilla. Placement of multiple implants in the anterior mandibular area presents a unique challenge in that one-to-one replacement of teeth with implants can create implant to implant or implant to tooth proximity concerns (Fig. 10.29). Tarnow and colleagues [11] have outlined the pattern of bone loss to be about  $3\mathrm{mm}$  from the edge of the implant to an adjacent implant. Therefore, placement of implants closer than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  to each other can create accelerated bone loss patterns in these areas. This pattern seems to be somewhat less  $(\sim 2\mathrm{mm})$  when the implant abuts a natural tooth.

![](images/fdd2611bae8426c70e3ee76c73118c3b0f169ee38cd93dc11f369f268fc88d7e.jpg)

Because the anterior mandible is mostly composed of dense compact bone, an implant-to-tooth replacement ratio of 1:2 may be acceptable as long as the crown-to-implant length ratio is 1:1. Gingival prosthetic seal/ adaptation in the anterior mandible is not as critical as it is in the anterior maxilla because consonant production is primarily made in relation to the maxilla. Screw-retained designs for FPDs in the anterior mandible seem to work well (Fig. 10.30). Implant proximity should also be assessed before placement for hygiene procedures because the placement of even an appropriate number of small-diameter implants in this area can create hygiene difficulties.

# FPDs in the Posterior Maxilla

Placement of implants in the posterior maxilla requires sufficient bone buccally and lingually as well as inferior to the maxillary sinus. Although short implant lengths have been used,  $12\mathrm{mm}$  of bone in actual height is the minimum required for a macrotentive screw-type implant to adequately support occlusal forces. After the loss of a tooth in the posterior maxilla, this required dimension might not be available (Fig. 10.31). Progressive enlargement of the maxillary sinus as well as residual ridge resorption is often seen after tooth loss. Diagnosis of either of these problems helps one determine the appropriate treatment. If pneumatization has taken place, sinus augmentation procedures can be indicated with either concomitant or delayed implant placement. Residual ridge resorption or traumatic destruction of alveolar bone by trauma or periodontal disease may also have taken place. In these cases, onlay bone grafting may be a more appropriate treatment (Fig. 10.32). The decision to replace a posterior maxillary quadrant

with individual crowns versus fewer splinted implants acting as an FPD may be related to the length of implant or the presence of natural canine teeth with canine-protected occlusion (Fig. 10.33). Other strategies place the implants in a slightly staggered configuration from buccal to lingual and then splint them together. Screw-retained designs seem to allow retrieval and offer advantages for modifying hygiene and performing reparative metal ceramic procedures.

# FPDs in the Posterior Mandible

As with the posterior maxilla, tooth loss for an extended time can result in residual ridge resorption. In such cases, onlay bone grafting may provide an appropriate bone volume for implant installation. A limiting factor for implant placement in the posterior mandible is not only residual ridge resorption but also relative position of the inferior alveolar canal. Panoramic radiographs may give a full appreciation of the position of the inferior alveolar canal. In some patients, this may assume a relatively high position, making placement of implants of reasonable length impossible. In these cases, lateral repositioning of the inferior alveolar nerve with implant placement may be the only option for treatment other than a removable partial denture. Nerve repositioning is an effective adjunct in implant placement, but the technique can have significant adverse nerve injury (Fig. 10.34). There is also some risk of mandibular fracture by the use of this technique. In some cases, it may be preferable to sacrifice teeth anterior to the edentulous area to permit placement of sufficient length implants anterior to the mental foramen with extension to the posterior.

# Cantilevered FPDs

Cantilevered FPDs may be used in implant dentistry provided there is adequate length to the supporting implants and limited distance to the cantilever. This may

be especially useful when there is an insufficient amount of bone or when significant site morbidity may result. Posterior cantilevering probably is a more common scenario, typically owing to a greater availability of bone in the anterior area of the jaws. Anterior cantilevering may be used in areas where posterior anchorage is superior to anterior anchorage (Fig. 10.35). Cantilevering requires that a framework be connected at a maximum clamp force; such stability is best achieved with screw-retained frameworks. A further strategy is to use direct to implant connections owing to a comparably robust screw joint connection. Occlusal contact created on the pontic should be very light to coincident as with adjacent teeth.

# 10.12 Restorations for the Edentulous Patient

# The Edentulous Arch

The success of removable prostheses relies on the combination of retention, support, and stability, which can be deficient. A conventional mandibular prosthesis should be evaluated for retention, support, and stability. Difficulty with speech, swallowing, and mastication should be considered when evaluating prostheses. Patient acceptance of conventional prostheses may be contingent on stability and comfort when masticating. A patient's chief complaint should be closely scrutinized and correlated with the clinical examination to help formulate the proper treatment; the complaint is the foundation for a wide array of considerations that determine avenues possible for a candidate considering treatment with osseointegrated implants. Patient factors of prosthetic satisfaction can be quantified and evaluated before proposing initiation of further treatment [69]. Many of these considerations help to determine which imaging studies, preparatory treatment, and number of ancillary procedures are needed, if the treatment goals are feasible, and what time and cost commitment is involved. Treatment should be targeted at specific goals to achieve a predictable outcome that addresses the patient's functional and/or aesthetic problem. The treatment may encompass several different routes paying attention to time, cost, longevity, and levels of invasiveness.

The amount of keratinized/fixed tissue, vestibular depth, available bone, and opposing occlusion are all important factors to consider before implant treatment (i.e., natural dentition, edentulous arch, and implant-borne occlusion). It may be appropriate to recommend only an implant-retained overdenture for a favorable mandibular arch. However, mandibular arches with limited support, vestibular extension, and extensive bone resorption may require an implant-borne prosthesis.

# - Implant-Retained Overdentures

Patients older than 65 years are said to represent a significant proportion of the US population, and the average life expectancy has risen by 30 years since 1900. A sizable portion of this group is edentulous or partially dentate in at least one arch [70]. Many in this age group have difficulty wearing mandibular complete dentures owing to poor support and retention precipitated by advanced bone resorption, xerostomia, loss of attached keratinized tissue, and neuromuscular degeneration. The use of implants for these edentulous patients has been shown to actually preserve existing bone as opposed to results with conventional dentures [71]. Increased support and anchorage can be improved with the use of at least two osseointegrated implants in the anterior man

![](images/41364878d6a0a98aa5fb49e0ec739d06c58cd747306e93ac17acb0022056df3d.jpg)

dible. Although the use of stud attachments connected to the implants can be a cost-effective measure to improve retention, stability, and support (Fig. 10.36), there is an increasing need for aftercare and servicing for these patients. If a stud-retained denture is planned, the implants should be as parallel as possible to avoid premature wear of the attachment mechanism. Alternative cylindrical attachment mechanisms have been introduced to allow for an easier rate of servicing in the aftercare period (Fig. 10.37). The vertical height of the attachment should be considered because some edentulous mandibular arches do not provide more than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of restorative dimension for the mandibular denture. Preoperative planning calls for the evaluation of the patient's present difficulty. Reasonable aesthetics, occlusion, and extension should be evaluated first. If these factors seem to be appropriate, panoramic radiographs and possibly an occlusal radiograph are helpful in determining the position of the mental foramina. A prime objective is to place at least two implants as far apart as possible within this area. The anterior loop of the inferior alveolar nerve can extend as far forward as  $7\mathrm{mm}$  before exiting the mental foramen; thus, consideration should be given to proper site selection [72]. A radiographic marker such as a standardized stainless steel shot can be secured to the patient's denture and placed in the mouth before panoramic and/or occlusal radiography. This will give an indication of the correct site selection for implants in the anterior mandible. After the site has been selected, an open channel can be created in the stent to allow surgical latitude. Either duplication of the patient's denture or a wax trial tooth arrangement subsequently processed in clear acrylic resin can be helpful in determining the position. In general, tapered arch forms with extensive resorption may direct placement of implants in close proximity to each other. In other words, implants placed less than  $20\mathrm{mm}$  apart may not be mechanically advantageous for use independently as

![](images/c04b8d326881de05e2a6053bbe0bc1b5ee93127e8f804b3d861b032c87906627.jpg)

stud attachments. In these cases, it may be desirable to connect the implants with a bar attachment to create a wider base of anchorage. There are several reasons to plan the implant-retained denture for a bar attachment. First, short  $(\leq 10~\mathrm{mm})$  implants or implants placed in cancellous bone or types 3 and 4 bone, not typically seen in the anterior mandibular area, may be better supported by the splinting effect of a bar attachment. Second, nonparallel implants create different paths of insertion, which subsequently serve to wear and disable the stud attachment prematurely. In these cases, the bar attachment can correct this problem by providing a single path of insertion. Third, implants placed in close proximity to each other may provide better anchorage to the overdenture if a bar attachment is incorporated that places the attachment mechanism at a wider base than the interimplant distance. The fourth reason is to provide indirect retention of the denture base where mal-related arches would tend to tip the denture base.

There are some spatial considerations of using a bar attachment that should be evaluated before treatment planning. The vertical height needed for a bar attachment can approach  $11\mathrm{mm}$ . This measurement is taken from the occlusal plane to the highest point of the alveolar process. This distance will provide for the height of the bar  $(2 - 4\mathrm{mm})$ ,  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  under the bar for maintenance of hygiene, and at least  $7 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  of restorative material in the overdenture (usually acrylic resin) (Fig. 10.38). Some early evidence points to the added benefit of using metal reinforcing frameworks in mandibular overdentures to decrease the risk of fracture of these restorations [73].

Implant-retained overdentures for the maxilla can incorporate the use of bar attachments. A minimum of four implants in the anterior maxilla splinted with a bar seems to be appropriate treatment. Whenever possible, cross-arch stabilization is preferred for maxillary

![](images/fef6d5db25b564cd1e5fafe7f29945b6661662bd4ec06e2a8e462b122ab2575d.jpg)

implant-retained or implant-supported overdentures. Depending on the implant site distribution, it may be prudent to also incorporate full palatal coverage to assist with some residual load transfer to the hard palate. The prosthetic treatment of these implant cases is assimilated to the Kennedy class I partially edentulous arch in that stress-breaking attachments and stress distribution to the soft tissue support posteriorly are important considerations. Also shown to be successful is the use of abutment retention for maxillary overdentures. Discretion should be made for distribution of the abutment relative to rotational force requirements as many abutment systems are resilient.

# - Implant-Supported Overdentures

Implant-supported overdentures may be indicated when a patient has significant difficulty in all factors of support, retention, and stability. Anatomically, there may be cause to suspect that extensive resorption has taken place that has resulted in the loss of alveolar structure. Consequently, implant anchorage can be used to aid in the support and retention of overdenture prostheses.

Historically, most of the literature available on implant-supported restorations in the mandible has been planned for four to six implants intraforaminally. More contemporary literature suggests the use of four widely spaced implants in this region opposing an edentulous arch with equally successful rates [74-76]. The strategy for using implants in the anterior mandibular area allows segments to be cantilevered posteriorly in accordance with the anteroposterior spread of the implants. On average, this equates to  $10 - 20\mathrm{mm}$  or the area of the lower first molar. The decision to extend the cantilever can be based on the arch form of the fixtures, fixture length, anterior cantilevering, natural maxillary dentition, and parafunctional habits. Favorable factors for extension of the cantilever are a tapered arch with long fixtures, no anterior cantilevering, edentulous maxillary arch, and no parafunctional activity. The most posterior implant supports a load typically of compression in comparison with the anterior implants, which are placed under tension. Also, the mandible may be viewed as a dynamic bony structure undergoing flexure. This can approximate  $2\mathrm{mm}$  at the mandibular angle upon maximum opening. For this reason, implants placed distal to the foramen should not be rigidly connected to the contralateral side.

Planning for implant support of a prosthesis in the edentulous maxilla has traditionally involved at least eight fixtures. This may require the use of sinus augmentation, or for consideration of fewer implants, extended-length implants into the zygomatic process have been successfully used. The use of zygoma implants has been favorable, approaching a success rate that surpasses those conventional implants to which they are attached [77, 78]. Additional approaches can be placement of four zygoma implants to allow sufficient anchorage into craniofacial bone. This has also shown success in recent years [79].

Attachment mechanisms for implant-supported overdentures can range from the simple to the sophisticated. Bar-clip attachments are a cost-effective and predictable means of connecting implants. More sophisticated milled bar and plunger attachments can be precision methods in telescopic placement of a removable prosthesis. The milled bar can be machined to a 2-degree taper, allowing a precise path of placement (Fig. 10.39). The underside of this overdenture has a cast metallic housing that acts as a guide over the milled

![](images/938a64a3da68801c871c7e4d0a25d9c3b496f8870969751d4bcfdfeb6edbfec2.jpg)

bar attachment (Fig. 10.40). Usually, this restoration contains either plunger or swivel attachments that lock the overdenture as it comes to complete placement over the bar attachment. This technique is very effective but over time can allow a small degree of micromovement.

An additional method of electrical discharge machining, also known as "spark erosion," can be used in these cases; it results in a precise fit between the superstructure and the bar. This technology, which results in an essentially detachable fixed bridgework, may be significant in costs and still require some long-term maintenance.

# Fixed Detachable Prostheses

One alternative treatment method for an edentulous mandible is the use of an implant-supported fixed complete denture also known as a fixed/removable restora

tion (hybrid denture). This restoration contains a screw-retained metal framework with a veneer of acrylic resin and denture teeth, thus coining the term hybrid. Such restorations are fixed and are not removable by the patient; however, they do allow adequate room for oral hygiene procedures (Fig. 10.41). As might be expected, no denture flange is present, and a minimum vertical restorative space of  $12 - 15\mathrm{mm}$  is necessary for structural integrity and hygiene access. Placement of implants for a hybrid denture should incorporate the use of a surgical stent because the exit sites for the access channels are critical. The surgeon may be cautioned on careful implant placement in those patients with a skeletal class III or severe class II relationship as revealed by cephalometric radiography. Recently, application of this immediate load technique has become popular.

Of course, a full-arch metal ceramic design could also be used in these circumstances in which a minimal restorative dimension exists. In this circumstance, screw

Fig. 10.41 Mandibular hybrid denture

retained prostheses offer stable occlusal support while allowing some degree of posterior cantilevering.

Treating patients with an edentulous maxilla is dependent upon a number of factors. The primary determining factor is one of available space. Generally, the more space available (13+ mm vertically), the more indication there is for an overdenture prosthesis. Incipient resorption or minimal space availability (9–12 mm vertically) may indicate the use of a metal ceramic design (Fig. 10.42). Implant-supported maxillary overdentures are frequently used in cases of moderate to severe resorption because they replace not only missing mastication and aesthetics but also facilitate phonetic physiology as well. Speech production may rely heavily on adaptation of the prosthesis to the palatal gingiva. If there is ample space, this is best accomplished with an overdenture prosthesis to seal this linguo-alveolar area phonetically while allowing for daily hygiene procedures. Attachment mechanisms for the maxillary implant-supported overdenture are the same for the mandibular overdenture with the exception of plunger or locking attachments placed palatally (Fig. 10.43).

# 10.13 Contemporary Techniques

# Immediate Placement

Immediate placement of implants into extraction sockets has been considered for some time. Although it has been performed successfully, inflammation and infection should be eradicated for predictable osseointegration to occur. Considerations for using immediate placement capitalize on the osteogenic potential of a recent extraction site and the chance to preserve what bone remains. The loss of bone after extraction has been documented and is based on the theory of bundle bone, that is, the loss of the most coronal  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  of facial bone plate after extraction [80]. This has been

![](images/a943f90f3dfcf277f7b0414536ba18aebcf854db96e31955f9c33c983c5b795c.jpg)

approached by the use of compensatory grafting in both width and height. The expansion of width can certainly be accomplished, but most attempts at increased height have not been predictably shown [81]. In either case, the delayed approach with implant placement is best deferred to obtain the most ideal and stable peri-implant tissues. The use of tapered implants in these sites has become popular to obliterate the socket defect while being firmly anchored in the majority of the bony walls. A word of caution is advised for those teeth that have drifted or are not in an ideal location because tooth position influences implant position. Indications for placement into a recent extraction socket are freedom from infection and intact nature of the remaining socket. Ways of facilitating this technique may incorporate orthodontic extrusion to create a smaller socket in the bone, facilitate extraction, and overcorrect bone apposition to recreate missing architecture (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 10.44). The extrusion should take place slowly, usually over 3-6 months [82].

# Early Placement

As an alternative, early placement (4-8 weeks after extraction) may afford an advantage in offering some bone formation into the socket, a surplus of soft tissue for closure, and more predictable soft tissue profiles long term [83]. This will often result in improved primary stability of the implant as well as an opportunity to place the implant platform where the prosthetic and biologic indication is strongest.

# Surgical Installation Stability

Installation of implants into bone usually is characterized by minimizing the inherent gap between the implant and the bone surface. If placed in perfect adaptation of the osteotomy, this results in primary implant stability that is often appreciated by a resistance to further torque applied. Depending on the type of bone that the implant is placed in, further assessment of the implant's secondary stability can be recorded by a radiofrequency device. However, during the period of osseointegration, the secondary stability changes in proportion to some bone remodeling. Although similarly high osseointegration rates have not been surpassed, some implant surfaces have been shown to reduce the time taken for this secondary stability to take place.

Although achieving this stability can be accomplished with both screw-type and press-fit implants, parallel- and tapered-walled screws are uniquely suited to providing firm stability at surgical placement. This becomes an important consideration when achieving osseointegration under placement either in an extraction site, where a provisional restoration will also be inserted or where other implants will be joined for an immediate load prosthesis. For immediate placement after extraction, the socket should be obliterated by the implant and/or grafting materials. Micromovement in excess of  $50 - 75\mu \mathrm{m}$  has been shown to inhibit osseointegration to a fibrous tissue deposition instead of bone apposition; therefore, occlusion placed on a provisional restoration during the critical period of osseointegration must be carefully controlled to reduce this scenario. If this modality is desired, a more controlled technique of protecting the occlusion with a centric relation device may be appropriate. Immediate loading for single teeth mandates more data before it can be recommended for routine use. However, controlled immediate loading of multiple connected implants in the anterior mandible has been favorably surveyed and can be recommended universally.

# Immediate Restoration

Immediate restoration of a single-tooth implant may be incorporated in the aesthetic zone (Fig. 10.45). The indications are freedom from occlusal overload and lateral forces. Sometimes, it is difficult to control occlusion,

and the creation of an occlusal splint may be a prudent way to protect the implant while osseointegration takes place (Fig. 10.46). The advantages of immediate restoration are the establishment and preservation of the peri-implant tissues. It is easier to preserve this tissue than to recreate it by using a staged approach. However, higher incidences of failures are associated with immediate loading of single-tooth restorations [84].

# Fixed or Overdenture Prostheses

The use of splinted implants immediately loaded in the mandible has been discussed by Schnitman and associates [85] and others [86]. The edentulous interforaminal mandible appears to be favorable for immediate loading of multiple endosseous implants (Fig. 10.47). This had been discussed initially to convert an interim complete denture prosthesis into a transitional fixed prosthe

![](images/ecfc89ff342c1f0dcfb7cc4e0246c86a0c1eb2bd850a32b88787fc3d6522b6f6.jpg)

sis known as a conversion prosthesis [87]. Clinical experience and literature reviews indicate that the results obtained are favorable for either fixed or overdenture alternatives [88]. Requisites of primary implant stability are suggested at or above  $30~\mathrm{N / cm}$ .

Immediate load prosthesis is employed when there is sufficient torque installation (above  $30\mathrm{Ncm}$ ), and an immediate removable prosthesis can be converted to a fixed prosthesis at the time of surgery or shortly thereafter.

# 10.14 Maxillofacial Prostheses

Patients treated for tumor ablative surgery of the oropharyngeal area may have a significant deficit of anatomic structures necessary for oral function. The incidence of oral cancer approaches about  $5\%$  of all new cancers diagnosed in the US general population [89]. Latest estimates of head and neck cancer attributes over 53,000 new cases each year in the United States [90]. A significant number of these patients are treated for malignant neoplasms of the lip, tongue, oropharynx, mandible, maxilla, soft palate, larynx, external ear, orbit, and external nose. Many of these are attributed to an epidemic of human papillomavirus (HPV) origin. HPV-positive tumor markers confirmed from neoplasms can occur anywhere in the head and neck. However, tonsillar tissue seems to be affected more so by these viruses as cells in these tissues are actively downregulated by the suppression of p53. The prognosis of these particular tumors is favorable and often can be transected orally as many exhibit exophytic growth.

To successfully eradicate disease, these tumors are treated with multimodal therapy of tumor ablative surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The highest incidence of this disease afflicts those individuals with significant risk factors of excessive use of alcohol and tobacco and other factors such as ultraviolet light exposure and infection with human papillomavirus. A common site of development of squamous cell carcinoma is seen in the lower lip and ventrolateral tongue. Occasionally, this disease recurs by direct extension to involve structures of the mandible and maxilla. Additionally, it can metastasize to the regional lymphatic drainage common to tumors originating from tonsillar fossa, nasopharynx, base of tongue, and pyriform sinus of the larynx.

# Mandible Defects

Resection of a portion of the mandible may be necessary to control disease and may create a discontinuity defect. Because the mandible is so integral to oral physiology, it is desirable to preserve function as much as possible. The classification system proposed by Brown and colleagues [91] makes this relevant to consider the most successful outcomes as the mandible is divided into four main pillars of structure, giving it consideration with functional and esthetic parameters.

If a marginal mandibulectomy is performed, the remaining mandible may be reconstructed with osseointegrated dental implants. Preservation of the inferior alveolar nerve may preclude placement if there is minimal bone available above the canal position to stabilize implants (Fig. 10.48). In these cases, either nerve transposition or onlay bone grafting may serve to provide osseointegrated rehabilitation.

If mandibular continuity is not preserved with resection, it may be desirable to reconstruct the area with an autologous or alloplastic graft. Autologous grafts offer a greater volume of viable bone with progenitor cells capable of creating a more favorable environment for osseointegration. Nonvascularized or vascularized osteomyocutaneous flaps can be used for reconstruction. In previously operated or radiated fields, it may be preferable to use a vascularized flap that may offer a secure opportunity for the graft to remain viable because the blood supply is preserved. The iliac crest has been used with some degree of success for mandibular defects and some maxillary defects as well. Introduced by Hidalgo [92, 93], the use of fibular grafts has also shown a promising degree of success in reconstruction of these complex mandibular defects. Being a non-weight-bearing bone, the fibula is of reasonable dimension to functionally and cosmetically reconstruct the mandible. Bicortical stability for concomitant or delayed implant placement can also be well obtained at surgical installa

Many mandibular defects that result from tumor ablative surgery, osteoradionecrotic lesions, osteomyelitis, or other etiology are extensive and encompass multi-planar topography that demand advanced planning to obtain optimal spatial location. This may include surgical design and simulation planning conceived by Rohner [94] along with placement of dental implants so as to approach ideal location for occlusal based rehabilita

tion. In these circumstances, the provisional prostheses can be placed at the time of reconstruction to better aid in two-plane fixation of the reconstruction along with reconstruction plates. The greater the number of osteotomy segments, the greater the risk for non-union exists. Challenges in attributing the shape of a long bone to the complex anatomy of the mandible become evident as scar contracture and other soft tissue difficulties seem to become of concern with long-term follow-up in these patients.

The choice of whether to use either a sectional overdenture design or a screw-retained fixed prosthesis may be based on the amount of tissue missing, the function of the tongue, perioral scarring, and adjacent/opposing occlusion. Frequently, the crown-to-implant ratio is seen to be greater than 1:1 (Fig. 10.50). But this does not seem to detract from long-term survival. Passive splinting of these implants is crucial to their long-term success, and close attention must be paid to the development of the occlusal scheme. Occasionally, it may be necessary to perform soft tissue revision procedures if the skin pedicle is thick or if a greater vestibular depth is needed. This ensures soft tissue health and visibility for hygiene procedures.

# Maxillary Defects

The maxilla may require resection for tumor control, which creates a host of problems related to speech and aesthetics. Traditional resection of the maxilla involves an infrastructure procedure or may involve the medial portion or a total removal of the maxilla. Infrastructure

maxillectomies are used to control incipient disease of the palate and have been classified by Aramany based on frequency of occurrence [95]. Obviously, the more teeth, bone, and soft tissue available, the easier conventional prosthetic rehabilitation can be employed with removable obturator prostheses. However, edentulous patients requiring this operation may have significant difficulty in obtaining stability with their prosthesis, and in these cases, a consideration for the use of implants is warranted. In some cases, the defects are so extensive that the use of an obturator may not address difficulties with speech and swallowing.

The use of sinus augmentation has been well documented and deemed to be successful with the incorporated use of implants. This technique may be used on a non-defect side where a unilateral or posterolateral defect of the opposite side is present. Splinting of approximately four or five implants with a stress-breaking bar is generally suggested and provides the patient with a retentive stable prosthesis that may offer improved support as well (Fig. 10.50). If the maxillary defect remains, the common shortfall is to resist displacement of the prosthesis into the defect [96]. The use

of zygomatic implants has been suggested as an alternative to sinus lifting in the early 1990s [97]. The implant protocol for zygomatic implants mandates bilateral placement, and preservation of the defect side of the infraorbital rim may improve surgical stability. This has proven successful in the use of treating oral defects and compromised maxillae (Fig. 10.51). The augmented use of zygoma implants in conjunction with endosseous implants can be of predictable support and retention so as to gain stability of prostheses made over the splinted segments of implants in these cases (Fig. 10.52). The results of either before adjuvant radiotherapy or placement after do not seem to make a difference in the survival of the zygoma implants [98].

In cases where palatal defects may necessitate palatal coverage that precludes patient tolerance, the use of microvascular grafting with soft tissue alone to close the defect and zygoma/root form implants that perforate the flap can allow a fixed prosthesis to be made [98, 99].

In some cases, the maxillary defect that has resulted from either tumor ablative surgery or other etiology can be so extensive that making a stable prosthesis is not attainable. Other approaches may involve a bone transfer along with soft tissue to effectively close off the defect and provide volume for installation of multiple implants. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to address the reconstruction of the maxilla. That proposed by Okay and colleagues [100] refer to initial evaluation for the choice of using either conventional prosthesis or that of microvascular grafting. More recent algorithms have been proposed that address midfacial reconstruction with composite microvascular flaps [101, 102]. These sources utilize osseointegrated implants for occlusal-based reconstruction of oral defects and have shown promise for increased quality of life for many of these patients.

Some defects created by bone necrosis can mandate treatment with microvascular flap and implant reconstruction. Avascular necrosis of the maxilla from

orthognathic surgery is not a common sequelae, but the referenced case illustrates resolution of infrastructure loss of the maxilla by microvascular reconstruction and endosseous implants (  $\square$  Fig. 10.53).

# Craniofacial Defects

Resection of portions of the craniofacial skeleton for disease control can result in both functional and aesthetic defects. These defects may not be suited to plastic surgical reconstruction owing to local or regional factors. Traditional roles for facial prostheses are to replace architecture with alloplastic materials that mimic the color and textures of adjacent skin. A method of retaining these prostheses can be attachment by medical-grade adhesives, which may be unpredictable in holding and irritate underlying soft tissues. In such instances, the use of osseointegrated technology can provide improved anchorage as that used intraorally. The rates of success in the craniofacial skeleton of implants are also well documented and should be planned out with specialized imaging. Three-dimensional reconstruction techniques may provide valuable information to maximize success of placement exclusively in the confines of intended site selection.

The temporal bone is the most predictable site for the placement of implants in comparison with frontal nasal areas or orbital areas [103]. This is true even if radiation has been used to treat malignant tumors in this area. The choice of a minimum of two splinted implants in the temporal bone can serve well to provide a bar-retained auricular prosthesis. Workup should include CT images with  $2\mathrm{-mm}$  axial cuts while a radiographic stent is worn (Fig. 10.54) [104]. This should affirm site selection as well as placement into sound bone. Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) can be used as well in treating patients with Treacher Collins syndrome or other forms of microtia.

Placement of implants into frontal nasal bone is possible with the use of specialized computer software to delineate the frontal sinus, anterior cranial fossa, orbit, and other vital structures adjacent to proposed site selection. Extraoral anchorage can, in some cases, assist with anchorage of an intraoral prosthesis as well (Fig. 10.55).

# Radiotherapy Concerns

Unlike elective implant placement, there are particular concerns when providing a patient with osseointegrated

given to the relative risks of complications after radiotherapy to the head and neck. The effects of radiotherapy upon teeth and supporting tissues have been well documented and shown to involve degeneration of pulpal and periodontal tissues. Spontaneous splitting between the cementum and dentin also occurs as a result of this therapy. Free radical formation promotes degeneration of organic components that weakens the interaction between enamel and dento-enamel junction. This promotes exfoliation of enamel that can lead to further susceptibility to caries formation, and long-term prognosis of teeth in the field of radiotherapy is questionable [105].

As with any oncologic case, radiation therapy may be incorporated to improve long-term survival. Because of microscopic absorptive changes in the osseous tissues, osteoblast populations are typically affected by dosages exceeding  $50\mathrm{Gy}$ . The possibility of creating osteoradionecrotic wounds increases with bone manipulation above this dosage. However, osseointegrated implants have been successfully employed in previously radiated fields without undue complications [106]. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been objectively shown to reduce the risk of osteoradionecrotic complications in both the craniofacial skeleton and the intraoral regions [107]. As with any hypoxic wound, increasing oxygen tension above  $40\mathrm{ON}_2$  (partial pressure of oxygen) in comparison with a non-radiated control site increases the likelihood of healing. With this increase of  $\mathrm{O}_2$  concentration comes angioneogenesis and the subsequent effect of pluripotent cell differentiation into osteoblasts. However, the effects seen with hyperbaric oxygen as a result of wound

healing and that of osseointegration appear somewhat different. In some reviews [28], HBO is not thought to be helpful to improve osseointegration.

# 10.15 Complications

# Soft Tissue Complications

Soft tissue complications with dental implants can be seen in areas where the quantity of keratinized soft tissue is minimal. As with natural teeth, implant restorations rely on attached and keratinized tissue for long-term maintenance. Soft tissues may also be compromised in sites where implant angulation is not ideal in an aesthetic area. Finally, soft tissue depths surrounding implants exceeding  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  may present problems with long-term maintenance. This can be especially true for areas grafted with soft tissues or in osteomyocutaneous flaps where dermis is quite thick. In these cases, it may be wise to reduce the soft tissue thickness surgically before making a restoration or even placing the implants.

Mobility of soft tissues is also of concern where there can be influence by lip or tongue movement or other physiologic processes that create tension to the peri-implant area. In these sites, it is common to observe hyperplastic tissue or significant tissue inflammation. In these cases, it is important to control peri-implant mucositis, which can lead to progression of peri-implantitis.

Peri-implant mucositis is a disease in which the presence of inflammation is confined to the mucosa surrounding a dental implant with no signs of loss of supporting bone [108].

Peri-implantitis is a term used to describe inflammation of the mucosa around a dental implant or the dental implant abutment. This is accompanied with a measurable amount of associated bone loss [108].

# Radiographic Bone Loss and Implant Failure

Bone loss is expected with the placement of any implant; however, this loss should not exceed  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the first 12-18 months. Bone loss in excess of this value exposes a significant portion of the implant surface, making hygiene procedures difficult. If the choice of implant is a machined titanium screw, this problem is less than with implants having a textured surface, but in either case, it is desirable to see bone loss of no more than  $0.2\mathrm{mm / yr}$  after the initial period of osseointegration and abut

ment/prosthetic connection (usually 18 months). Evaluation of implants in edentulous patients by panoramic radiography may be more formidable than when using periapical examinations. However, partially dentate patients may benefit from serial periapical radiographs made with a silicone putty standardized bite block. In this way, radiographs would be standardized at each exposure, allowing interpretation at a consistent exposure and incident beam angle. Cumulative survival rates of implant survival for patients treated with microroughened surfaced implants are significantly higher than for those treated with turned surface implants. The risk in implant loss in the maxilla is significantly higher than the mandible, but using micro-roughened implants, this risk is reduced significantly. Patient treated with turned implants having early dental implant failures exhibited a high mortality rate. This was especially true for younger implant patients [109].

# Screw Loosening

Abutment and prosthetic screw loosening can be a recurrent problem seen often with single-tooth restorations. The incidence of screw loosening was significant before modern developments in screw mechanics. A further method of reducing screw loosening is to use a new lubricated abutment or prosthetic screw, torqued once to the recommended torque application, waiting  $5\mathrm{min}$  and then torquing again [110]. In these circumstances, screw loosening is minimized. Repeated loosening of screws should bring to mind occlusal overload, excessive contact in lateral excursions, or maladapted implant connection.

# Abutment Fracture

Abutment fracture is a relatively uncommon occurrence but can be problematic, particularly for cemented restorations. Material choices for implants subjected to heavy occlusion or unavoidable lateral loads should be carefully selected. Although strong, ceramic materials are used with caution in areas of high stress application, significant angle correction. Premachined abutments used for screw-retained restorations can usually be replaced if they deform or fracture.

# - Implant Fracture

Although relatively uncommon, implant fractures have been reported in only a few studies which account to less than  $0.6\%$ . These seem to be associated with commercially pure titanium implants of  $3.75 \mathrm{~mm}$  diameter [111, 112]. Further, the incidence appears to be higher in partially dentate patients than edentulous patients, perhaps owing to a rectilinear implant arrangement more so than a curvilinear arrangement seen in edentulous patients. The trend toward the use of internally con

nected implants continues, although few studies to date have surveyed the incidence of fracture. Pathognomonic precursors to implant fracture are repeated screw loosening and peri-implant bone loss.

It is important to be judicious in torque application to implant during installation. Placement of implants into dense bone can frequently bring about distortion or fracture of the coronal portion of the implant. Recognizing this at the time of implant placement can be difficult and is often masked by the ease of gingival abutment or cover screw placement without engagement of anti-rotational feature.

# 10.16 Maintenance

Patients restored with osseointegrated implants should receive regular and frequent follow-ups in the first year after implant placement. Factors to evaluate include bone loss, mobility, and pain.

Occlusal stability and overdenture base adaptation are all vital elements of prosthesis stability. Clinical examination should include light percussion and gentle evaluation of soft tissue. Radiographic evaluation includes both periapical and panoramic radiographs. If the restoration is screw-retained, it can be removed every 2 years, cleaned, and resecured or cleaned in position. It was thought cleaning of implant and titanium abutment surfaces can be performed with either gold or polyethylene (Teflon) instruments so as not to scratch these biologically critical surfaces and make them prone to plaque accumulation [113]. After some reviews on this, it appears that using conventional instrumentation should not make a significant difference in implant survival. Further, it appears that regular follow care with clinical observation, radiographic evaluation, and hygiene procedures promote implant health with these interventions [114]. After cleaning, polishing with either toothpaste or a light prophylaxis paste is recommended. Because a perimucosal seal exists between the implant and the abutment and tissue, it is not suggested that cemented restorations be removed routinely because this may jeopardize the integrity of the restoration and surrounding tissues. If abutment or coping screws have been torqued more than three times previously, it is generally suggested that they be replaced to avoid future fatigue fracture.

Patients treated with dental implants for edentulism require regular follow-up care to address ongoing maintenance of soft tissue health and monitoring of bone response with annual radiographs for the first 5 years. After this time, patients should still be seen annually for hygiene with periodic radiographic assessment at protracted intervals. Patients losing

their dentition to severe periodontal disease are prone to increased bone loss and should be carefully monitored by this regular care scenario.

# 10.17 Success Criteria

Historically, the criteria of success have involved one of quantification of pain, mobility, and peri-implant radiolucency. These criteria were established by Albrektsson and coworkers [9] and remain one of the standards in long-term evaluation of Branemark-style dental implants. More recently, attaching a functionally aesthetic restoration to the implants was added as a criteria, and removal of the original success rate of  $85\%$  at 5 and  $80\%$  at 10 years was updated at a 1998 Toronto Conference [115]. Even though the Albrektsson criteria have been established and validated in these types of implants in multiple populations in different areas of the mouth, they do not lend themselves well as guidelines for other types of implants. It will be necessary to create success criteria for these other implant systems as they develop.

Removing the prosthesis (especially if it is splinted with other implants) and gently percuting with either a blunt instrument or a standardized torque instrument will give an indication of mobility. Other methods involve the use of Periotest instruments or nanodevices that promote radiofrequency response from the osseointegrated implant to give an indication of mobility.

# Conclusion

The use of dental implants to support prosthetics has been more commonplace in general dental practice and has significant global growth in the last decade. Single-tooth replacement is the most common indication, and more than half of these cases require some form of bone augmentive procedure. Many of the protocols now center around reduced healing and treatment times and approach the use of CAD CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) for expediting case management. Selection of implant type and appropriate sequences are largely preferences to the surgery/restorative team commensurate with the patient desire. Treatment planning can be better facilitated with new software development between collaboration by surgeon, restorative dentist, and laboratory technician. Material selection guidelines have demonstrated that while novel approaches are appealing, they may not meet expectations of survival and servicing needs of the practice. Maintenance, of course, plays the larger part of this treatment timeline and, like other care, requires ongoing commitment of both the patient and the team to regular primary care.
