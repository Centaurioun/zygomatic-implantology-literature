# Learning Aims

1. Protruding ears can be a source of ridicule by peers.  
2. In otoplastic surgery, it is of paramount importance to understand the complex anatomy of the external ear.  
3. Otoplastic surgery can be predictably performed at a young age, prior to grade school.  
4. There are a variety of surgical options to correct the protruding ear.

Auricular deformities, in particular prominent or protruding ears, are a common congenital anomaly, affecting nearly  $5\%$  of the white population [1]. Congenital in nature, children are most likely to suffer the consequences of the deformity in the form of ridicule by their peers. Protruding ears, commonly referred to as prominauris, can be predictably treated for children before they enter grade school and, thus, help them avoid the emotional trauma caused by the ridicule. Otolastic surgery is primarily performed on children and can be a valuable service for the patient and satisfying for the surgeon.

It is important for the surgeon to understand the history of various surgical techniques to develop a predictable and successful technique to address the problem of protruding ears. Dieffenbach, in 1845, is credited with the first otoplastic technique to correct a prominent auricle [2]. Ely, in 1881 [3], authored the first case report describing correction of prominent ears in a 12-year-old boy who was being teased at school. Since that report, over 180 surgical techniques have been described in the literature for the correction of protruding ears.

When clinically evaluating the facial complex, the ears are often overlooked. If protruding ears are present, reduction otoplasty as an adjunctive or isolated procedure can be performed predictably and often with

satisfying results. A thorough understanding of the embryology and development of the human auricle along with the resultant external anatomy of the ear is of paramount importance in developing a predictable and stable technique to deal with the common auricular deformities.

# 76.1 Embryology of the Auricle

Malformations of the auricle are common, occurring in 1 out of 12,500 births [4]. They can occur alone or in combination with a syndrome affecting the head and neck structures. The embryogenesis of the auricle exemplifies in miniature the precise and logical progression so characteristic of the developing human forms. The external ear development during the third to 12th weeks of embryonic life is complex. The precursors to the auricle present in days 36-38 of intrauterine life, developing first from the first branchial groove where the first (mandibular) and second (hyoid) branchial arches are present (Fig. 76.1). Both arches give rise to the auricular hillocks, often referred to as the auricular tubercles of His [4]. Numbers 1, 2, and 3 arise from the caudal border of the mandibular arch, and numbers 4, 5, and 6 are formed from the cephalic border of the hyoid arch. The auricular hillocks present in their most prominent and characteristic form by intrauterine day 41. During this same stage, the groove between the mandibular and the hyoid arches (hyomandibular groove) widens and deepens by the increased growth of the hillocks. This groove eventually forms the external auditory canal and concha. By days 43-45, the hillocks have migrated and coalesced to form the auricle [4]. During this union, the mesenchyme of the hyoid arch increases substantially relative to the

mandibular arch to contribute  $85\%$  of the external adult ear. Hillocks 2 and 3 from the mandibular arch lose their individuality and fuse to form the helical crus. Later, hillocks 4 and 5 from the hyoid arch merge and alter their configuration as they give rise to the helix and antihelical fold. Hillock 1 remains prominent and becomes the tragus, and hillock 6 becomes the antitragus [4].

# 76.2 Surgical Anatomy

The majority of the growth of the pinna is completed by an early age. The average child has  $85\%$  ear development by 3 years of age. The ear is nearly fully grown by the age of 7-8 years. The ear height continues to grow into adulthood, but the width and distance of the ear from the scalp change little after 10 years of age. It is important to note that each individual's ears often vary in size and shape [5, 6]. The average adult ear is approximately  $6.5\mathrm{cm}$  in length and  $3.5\mathrm{cm}$  in width. In the normal ear, the auricle lies between horizontal lines drawn from the upper rim of the orbit and the nasal spine. The normal posterior wall of the conchal bowl is set at an angle of approximately  $90^{\circ}$  to the mastoid [7]. A second  $90^{\circ}$  angle is formed as the antihelical fold and is called the scaphaconchal angle. These two angles in combination with the curvature of the helix set the auricle adjacent to the scalp at approximately  $25 - 35^{\circ}$  and is called the auriculosephalic angle (Fig. 76.2) [8]. In otoplastic surgery, when correcting prominent ears, three important anatomic pearls can be used intraoperatively to assess the final result. The helical rim should be seen just lateral to the most lateral presence of the antihelix from the frontal view. The distance measured between the helical rim and the mastoid area is slightly less than  $2\mathrm{cm}$ . Finally, the distance between the skull and the uppermost aspect of the helix is approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  (Fig. 76.3).

The auricular cartilage is a unique and delicate structure that is intricately shaped with multiple elevations and depressions providing both skeletal support and form to the adult ear. The cartilage of the auricle is a single piece of yellow (elastic) fibrocartilage with a complicated relief on the anterior, concave side and a smooth, posterior convex side. Cartilage thickness is fairly uniform throughout. The cartilage is covered on both surfaces by a thin, firm, adherent layer of perichondrium. The anterior lateral surface of the cartilage is covered with a fine, thin skin, closely adherent to the cartilaginous framework. Subcutaneous fat is practically nonexistent, but a diffuse subdermal vascular plane exists that supports flap viability [9]. The posterior surface of the cartilage framework is draped with a less adherent skin that contains two layers of fat and a larger subdermal plexus of arteries, veins, and nerves.

A helical border terminates anteriorly in a crus, commonly called the radix, which lies almost horizontally above the external auditory meatus. The antihelix crowning the posterior conchal wall separates and diverges into both a superior and an anterior crus enclosing the triangularis fossa. Between the helix and the antihelix lies a long, deep furrow called the scaphoid fossa. The conchal cavity, composed of the cymba (superior) and cavum (inferior) concha, arises from the floor, which is approximately  $8\mathrm{mm}$  deeper than the overlying tragus and antitragus. The inferior tip of the helical cartilage is referred to as the cauda or tail. Extending from this inferiorly is the lobule, hanging devoid of skeleton (Fig. 76.4).

# 76.3 Blood Supply

The arterial blood supply to the ear is derived principally from two main branches of the external carotid artery: superficial temporal artery and posterior auricular artery. The superficial temporal artery emerges from the parotid capsule,  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in front of the ear deep to the veins and below the anterior auricular muscle. It gives off the superior, medial, and inferior branches supplying the anterior and anterolateral surface of the auricle

(76.5a). The posterior surface is dominantly supplied by the posterior auricular artery, which travels parallel to the postauricular crease upward crossing below the great auricular nerve and under the posterior auricular muscle. Awareness of this relationship is important to avoid damage to the artery or nerve during surgery. The posterior auricular artery gives off three branches—superior, medial, and inferior—providing a greater volume of blood to the postauricular ear than its anterior counterparts. These same vessels perforate the auricular cartilage over a large surface of the anterior ear and anastomose with the branches of the superficial temporal artery. The external ears have a tremendous blood supply, allowing multiple surgical approaches or salvage of the ear after traumatic avulsion.

Venous drainage of the ear via the complementary veins is into the external jugular vein. Lymphatic drain

age is into three surrounding areas via the complex and extensive fine network of lymphatic vessels.

# 76.4 Nerve Supply

The sensory nerve supply is primarily from the anterior and posterior branches of the great auricular nerve. The nerve is an important surgical landmark traveling  $8\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the postauricular crease. When dissecting in this area, care must be taken to avoid damage to the nerve that can result in near-complete anesthesia to the ear. Less important contributions of sensation are made by the auriculotemporal and lesser occipital nerves to the conchal cavity and external auditory meatus (see

$\bullet$  Fig. 76.5b). Regional anesthesia of the auricle is readily accomplished by instilling anesthetic solution

along its base anteriorly and posteriorly. Supplemental anesthesia may be needed at the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus supplied by the auricular branches of the vagus nerve (Arnold's nerve).

# 76.5 Deformities

Ear deformities are common and variable owing to the complex embryologic engineering that takes place in the development of the auricle, as described previously. Many classification systems of ear deformities have been attempted. Tanzer [12] classifies congenital ear defects, correlating embryologic development with a surgical approach for correction of the deformity. Marx [13] has a well-accepted classification system subdividing microtia into three groups according to severity. Rogers [7] simplifies classification of congenital ear defects, dividing them into four groups according to various stages of arrested development: microtia, lop ear, cup ear, and protruding ear. In this chapter, addressing the prominent ear, the term protruding is used as a general term to refer to any ear that is more prominent than is considered "normal." It is beyond the scope of this chapter to classify other congenital abnormalities and their correction.

# 76.6 Protruding Ear

In patients with protruding ears, there are two major deformities that individually or in combination account for the majority of the abnormalities. Several lesser deformities are seen that can accentuate the abnormality as well. The most common is a poorly developed antihelical fold that can involve both the superior and the anterior crura. This eliminates a definition between the conchal cavity and the scapha, resulting in the lateral projection of the upper portion of the helix. The second abnormality is the formation of excessive conchal cartilage, in particular the posterior conchal wall. This causes significant protrusion of the auricle. It is not uncommon to recognize some degree of both abnormalities present producing the protruding auricle.

Other potential deformities are a protruding earlobe, irregularities along the helix including an unrolled margin of the helical rim, and more recently described, an anteriomedially displaced insertion of the postauricular muscle. Of importance, this deformity is often bilateral and can be associated with ossicular deformities and a hearing deficit [14].

Obviously, precise recognition of the cause or causes of the protruding ear is crucial in formulating the surgical technique to be employed in correction of the abnormality.

# 76.7 Surgical Correction

Perhaps the most important indication for surgical correction of prominent ears is to eliminate the psychosocial effects that the ear defect produces. Macgregor [15] and others have well documented the irreversible social and psychological consequences that facial anomalies, especially of the ears, can inflict. The ridicule by peers begins as early as age 4-5 years during development, described as the body image concept. This leads to problems with social adjustment, self-image deficit, and ultimately, behavioral disorders. Therefore, most patients present at an early age for surgical correction. Most surgeons agree that surgical correction of the ear can be performed safely between 4 years of age and the beginning of school attendance to avoid the ridicule, becoming one of the most common elective procedures performed in young children. Adults also present to correct a life-long cosmetic defect.

# 76.8 Surgical Techniques

Many otoplasty techniques described in the surgical literature are similar and have evolved over an 80-year experience. Many techniques address only the conchal hypertrophy without mention of the antihelical fold. The described techniques generally can be subdivided into a "suture-only" technique, a cartilage splitting or weakening technique, or a combination of the two.

Furnas, in 1968 [16], described his suture-only technique for the correction of the prominent ear deformity. This technique consisted of a postauricular approach, removing the skin, connective tissue, and vestigial posterior auricular muscle and its ligament down to the underlying mastoid fascia. A total of two or three nonresorbable sutures are placed through conchal cartilage and mastoid fascia and tightened to the new desired retracted position of the ears. This remains a commonly used technique to set back the ears in patients with conchal hypertrophy alone. Problems associated with this technique have been relapsed secondary to the cartilaginous memory, a shallow conchal bowl, and irregularities created in folding the conchal floor. Another difficult problem is displacing the conchal bowl anteriorly, creating narrowing of the external auditory canal.

The Converse-Wood-Smith technique [17] is used to correct and create an antihelical fold using a cartilage cutting and suture method. Several full-thickness cuts through cartilage are placed in the scaphoid fossa. The cartilage is then folded on itself, described as "tubing," and permanent horizontal mattress sutures are placed, forming the new antihelical fold. In addition, if excessive conchal cartilage is present, it can be addressed with

a cartilage incision added at the rim of the bowl to reduce the bowl and retract the ear. A new antihelical fold is formed, however, typically with sharp cartilaginous ridges seen through the thin anterior auricular skin.

This chapter describes two techniques that address the two fundamental abnormalities in protruding ears and have produced consistent, satisfying cosmetic results, essentially eliminating the fear of relapse. The Davis method addresses the protruding ear caused by a hypertrophic posterior wall of the conchal bowl [18]. The Mustarde method is used to create a new antihelical fold [19] (Fig. 76.6).

The refinement of other abnormalities such as the prominent earlobe is also discussed.

# 76.9 Davis Method

The Davis method, for the correction of conchal hypertrophy, is a cartilage excision technique performed in a step-wise fashion [9, 18].

1. Marking the cartilage excision: Initially, the area of cartilage to be removed is marked on the skin of the anterior surface of the conchal bowl. Methylene blue transfixion tattoos are preferred to mark the posterior surface of the conchal cavity. The line lies just below the lower crus border, carries forward into the cymbal fossa, and continues around as an "arrowhead" to preserve a well-defined helical radix. The tracing should continue forward against the posterior edge of the external auditory canal. From that location, it curves posteriorly into the cavum concha, continuing onto the posterior conchal wall, leaving  $8\mathrm{mm}$  of posterior conchal wall height measured from the conchal scaphal junction. This should complete the circle, which should appear "kidney bean" shaped including the entire conchal bowl. The exact height of the posterior wall is important and must be measured for each case individually (Fig. 76.7a-c).

2. Removal of skin and cartilage: Before beginning the actual surgical procedure, local anesthesia is used for hydrodissection of the tightly adhered anterior auricular skin along the conchal bowl. This simplifies the dissection of cartilage from the overlying skin. The concha is exposed through a postauricular elliptical skin excision. The width of the ellipse is only to remove the predicted excess skin that is produced with ear retropositioning. The closure of the incision should be passive. This area is predisposed to hypertrophic or keloidal scarring when closed under tension. Once having removed the postauricular skin, the conchal cartilage is visualized along with the previously placed tattoo marks. The marks are used as a guide for incising through the cartilage,

taking care to avoid perforation of the anterior skin. The dissection is then carried onto the anterior conchal cartilage surface subperichondrially. The hydrodissection along with a small, sharp Freer elevator allows separation between the skin and the cartilage. The cartilage is then removed, which includes the entire conchal bowl with the exception of the  $8\mathrm{mm}$  left along the posterior conchal wall. The ear is then placed passively onto the mastoid surface, and the new projection of the helical rim is observed and carefully measured. Any defective prominence can be revised with further cartilage removal. The postauricular muscle and underlying connective tissue are removed down to the underlying mastoid fascia to allow for passive skin draping of the conchal floor, producing a natural-appearing, deepened conchal bowl. Any excessive postauricular skin can be removed at this time (see Fig. 76.7d-f).

3. Ear fixation: The ear is fixed in its new position with three or four mattress transfixion sutures of 3-0 silk that perforate the skin anteriorly, anchor deeply into the postauricular muscle stump, and pass back through the anterior skin. The mattress sutures are then gently tied over a dental cotton roll, moistened with a triple antibiotic ointment, which has been placed into the cymbal and caval fossa, making sure to place one end of the cotton roll into the external auditory canal to avoid postoperative stenosis. The sutures and cotton roll hold the ear in place during healing, stretch and flatten the skin uniformly over the conchal floor, and give depth to the conchal bowl. The postauricular incision is then closed in a running fashion with a resorbable suture, leaving a small opening inferiorly for drainage. The cotton roll dressing is left in place for a minimum of 1 week for optimal healing (see Fig. 76.7g-i)

# 76.10 Mustarde Method

The Mustarde method, first described in 1959, is indicated for the prominent ear with a poorly formed or lack of an antihelical fold [19]. This cartilage weakening technique relies on precisely placed horizontal mattress sutures, creating a new antihelical fold. It is rarely performed alone and used commonly in combination with the Davis method described previously.

1. Antihelical fold markings: The scapha is folded back against the underlying scalp by applying digital pressure on the superior helical rim, which creates an antihelical fold. The crest of the fold is marked with a surgical marker. To prepare for placement of the mattress sutures, marks are placed parallel to the crest at least  $7\mathrm{mm}$  apart to avoid creating too narrow a fold. The lateral marks placed on

the skin are transferred to the underlying cartilage with a hypodermic needle dipped in methylene blue (Fig. 76.8a and b).

2. Dissection and cartilage weakening: Local anesthetic solution is infiltrated along the scaphal fossa beneath the anterior auricular skin, hydrodissecting the skin from the underlying cartilage. This is to facilitate the anterior dissection and mattress suture placement. The postauricular skin is then removed in an identical fashion as that described with the Davis method. Once having identified the marks placed on the posterior surface of the scaphoid cartilage, a Freer elevator is passed through a small horizontal incision created through the cartilage at the most inferior aspect of the new antihelical fold. The anterior auricular skin is then dissected from the underlying cartilage corresponding to the crest of the new antihelical fold. Through the tunnel dissected along the anterior surface of the cartilage, the body of the new antihelical fold is weakened to facilitate folding and remove the inherent memory. Many methods have been described; however, cartilage weakening can be performed adequately using a Brown-Adson forceps, a nasal rasp, or a dermabrader with a small diamond raisse (see Fig. 76.8c-e).  
3. Suture placement: Nonresorbable, horizontal mattress sutures (4-0 Mersilene) are placed. The sutures are all placed through the medial perichondrium, cartilage, and lateral perichondrium, being careful not to include the anterior skin. The sutures should be placed perpendicularly across the antihelical fold, so that upon tightening, a well-rounded, antihelical fold will be created. The sutures are tightened under direct observation and adjusted accordingly to form the new antihelical fold (see Fig. 76.8f and g).  
4. Dressing: The dressing is important and is placed to provide adequate pressure to obliterate dead space and avoid a postoperative hematoma formation. A carefully layered dressing is placed over the anterior and opposing posterior surfaces of the scaphoid region with a  $[1]_{4}$ -inch petrolatum gauze, followed by  $4 \times 4$ -inch fluffs, held secure with a pressure-type facial dressing (see Fig. 76.8h and i).

# 76.11 Correction of the Protruding Earlobe

A protruding earlobe often accompanies a protruding ear. If so, it must be identified and corrected simultaneously. If the lobule of the ear protrudes, an extension of the posterior auricular incision is drawn with a surgical marker in the shape of a V onto the earlobe. Finger pressure on the freshly marked lobe, compressing it to the mastoid skin, produces a mirror image imprint forming a W-shaped (fish-tail) portion of skin to be excised. After this portion is excised and hemo

stasis achieved, closure is accomplished with a 4-0 plain gut suture. The two V-shaped incisions are brought together, reducing the protruded state of the lobule (Fig. 76.9) [17].

# 76.12 Complications

The incidence of complications after reduction otoplasty is quite low [20]. The major complications to be avoided are infection and keloid formation. Immediate complications include pressure necrosis from an overly tight dressing and hematoma formation. Delayed or long-term complications include hypertrophic or keloid scar formation, recurrence of the ear deformity, neurosensory deficits, and unaesthetic results.

# 76.13 Hematoma

Postoperative hematoma formation, with an incidence of  $2 - 4\%$ , is the most common problem that requires immediate and aggressive intervention [20]. It is most often related to inadequate hemostasis achieved at the time of surgery. Other factors in hematoma formation include an overly tight wound closure without drainage at the base of the wound, postoperative trauma, hypertension, and a preexisting bleeding dyscrasia. Persistent pain beneath the dressing or significant bleeding through and around the dressing suggests hematoma formation and demands prompt inspection. The presence of a hematoma is indicated by a tense and bluish swelling beneath the auricular skin, most often in the retroauricular space. Management includes suture removal, blood clot evacuation, hemostasis, and reclosure of the wound with a large pressure dressing reapplied. Large doses of antibiotics are advisable to prevent perichondritis. If this problem remains untreated, it can result in fibrosis, perichondritis, and cauliflower ear deformity.

# 76.14 Perichondritis

Wound infection in otoplasty occurs in the early postoperative period and is usually a sequela to an undetected or inadequately treated hematoma. Symptoms include pain, erythema, fever, and discharge that may or may not be present. Treatment includes high doses of antibiotics after appropriate wound cultures. Common bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adequate drainage is achieved by opening all sutures and carefully irrigating necrotic debris from the wound. All correction sutures must be removed and the cosmetic deformity addressed at a later date. The complication can be devastating, causing

massive cartilage destruction with a severe deformity resulting, even with aggressive therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics have not been scientifically proved to be beneficial but are often used in the preoperative and postoperative period to avoid this devastating complication.

# 76.15 Keloid and Hypertrophic Scar Formation

The closure line of the skin incision in the postauricular region is susceptible to scar formation, especially closed under tension. It is most commonly seen in younger patients and patients with deeply pigmented skin. Keloid formation, one of the most frustrating of all postoperative complications, requires aggressive therapy. In the early stages of keloid formation, intralesional triamcinolone acetonide is injected weekly until regression or significant improvement is evident. Most hypertrophic scars improve with steroid infiltration, but some keloids can progress into significant unaesthetic lesions. Low-dose radiation, although potentially dangerous, may provide the only effective means of control of some keloids. The more advanced lesions require surgical excision combined with radiation and delayed skin grafting of the irradiated area, with final aid from intralesional triamcinolone. The risk can be minimized by ensuring that the skin incision is closed passively.

# 76.16 Aesthetic Complications

Inadequate correction of the ear deformity is the most common untoward result of otoplasty, often more obvious to the surgeon than to the patient. Calder and Nissan [21] described at least one complication or residual deformity in  $16.6\%$  of all the patients who underwent otoplasty using all techniques. Recurrence of the ear deformity is a more common complication of reduction otoplasty but is less likely to happen after excising a portion of the cartilage and a segment of the skin, as described in the Davis method. Depending on sutures alone for achieving correction carries a greater risk of recurrence.

# 76.17 Telephone Ear Deformity

Telephone ear deformity occurs when the root of the helix and the ear lobule remain protruded while the middle half or third of the ear is set back against the head. This is more common in a large ear with a wide scapha. The incidence has been reported to be  $3\%$  [22]. Reverse telephone ear reveals a pronounced conchal bowl with respect to the lower and upper poles. These deformities can be avoided by carefully checking the position of the helical root, the upper helical rim, and the lobule at the completion of surgery.

# 76.18 Scapha Buckling

Scapha buckling or a transverse fold can develop in the Mustarde technique. This deformity can be avoided by placing the horizontal mattress sutures closer together where the scapha is widest, combined with adequate anterior scoring or weakening.

# 76.19 Narrowed Meatus

A constricted external auditory meatus can occur if the conchal bowl is rotated anteriorly in setting the ear back in any technique in which the conchal bowl is not excised. This problem is eliminated in the Davis method in which the floor of the conchal bowl is excised. Care must also be taken in placing the inferior end of the cotton roll bolster dressing into the external auditory canal to avoid stenosis.

# 76.20 Summary

Reduction otoplasty carries few complications and can provide satisfying results for both the patient and the surgeon in the majority of cases. As in all cosmetic procedures, proper patient selection is imperative. Accurate preoperative assessment of the individual deformities

and the appropriate choice of a surgical correction will minimize unfavorable aesthetic results. The single greatest cause of an unfavorable result in this procedure is inaccurate diagnosis.

The surgeon must understand the normal external anatomy of the ear and learn to recognize the pathologic characteristics of the abnormal ear. Having accurately assessed the deformity, the surgeon needs to be familiar with the various surgical approaches available to correct them. Finally, it is important to have a working knowledge of the potential complications of otoplasty and their prevention and treatment.
