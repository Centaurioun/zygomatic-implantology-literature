# 35.1 Introduction

Lip cancer, one of the most common cancers of the head and neck region, is one of the most easily diagnosed, with generally a good prognosis. In the United States, currently approximately 1680 new cases resulting in nearly 65 deaths are diagnosed annually [1]. In some individuals, lip cancer may behave aggressively, manifested by recurrence or mortality in up to  $15\%$  of patients [2-5]. The most common malignancy of the lip is squamous cell carcinoma (90% of reported cases) [6], whereas basal cell carcinoma accounts for only  $1\%$  of all lip carcinomas [5, 7, 8]. Other malignancies of the lip, such as minor salivary gland cancers, melanoma, lymphoma, and soft tissues sarcomas, have been reported but are less common [9-11]. Generally, the behavior of lip cancer resembles skin cancer more than carcinoma of mucosal origin in the oral cavity proper. The lower lip is the most common site for lip cancer  $(88 - 98\%)$ , with only  $2 - 7\%$  arising from the upper lip and  $2 - 4\%$  at the oral commissures [2, 5, 7, 8, 12-14].

# Important/Key Points

# Epidemiology and Etiology:

- Lip cancer is one of the most common cancers of the head and neck region.  
The overall incidence of lip cancer in the United States and globally has been on a decline over the past 10 years.  
Etiology of lip cancer is incompletely understood. Common etiologic factors strongly associated with lip cancer include sun exposure, alcohol and tobacco use, and immunosuppression. Hydrochlor

rothiazide has recently been implicated as a possible etiologic factor for lip cancer in certain populations.

# Anatomic Considerations:

- Lips have very unique anatomic boundaries, and these have implications in cancer origin and management.  
The formal definition of lip has changed for staging purposes; the mucosal lip is defined as beginning at the junction of wet and dry mucosa of the lip and extending into the oral cavity to the mucogingival junction.  
- Lip cancer is now staged as oral cavity cancer.  
Cancers that originate on the dermis side of the lip are grouped and staged with skin cancer.  
- Metastasis from the lower lip is primarily found in the submental, submandibular, and perifacial nodes, while metastasis from the upper lip is generally found in ipsilateral submandibular and parotid nodes.  
It is important to understand the origin and insertion of the orbicularis oris muscle and blood supply to the lips, as this will aid in surgical resection and treatment planning the reconstruction of post-ablative defects.

# Management:

Primary cancers of the lip may have variable presentation, and suspicious lesions should be biopsied appropriately to establish a definitive diagnosis.  
- Based on clinical presentation of the tumor, appropriate evaluation modalities should be utilized, and tumor should be staged based on the AJCC oral cavity cancer staging guidelines.  
Management of lip cancer is primarily surgical, although external beam irradiation and rarely systemic therapy can be utilized for specific cases and indications.  
- An 8-10-mm surgical margin is recommended for most lesions.  
- Lip shave procedure is contraindicated in cases of invasive disease.  
A “V,” “W,” or shield shape is the most common form of deformity after excision and is generally reconstructed primarily with local tissue advancement.  
- Lip reconstruction after surgical excision should reestablish integrity of the oral cavity, function, form, and have pleasing cosmesis.  
Reconstructive options include primary closure, local flaps, regional flaps, or distant-free tissue transfer.

Elective neck dissection is indicated in patients with T3 and T4 tumors, and in smaller tumors with clinical evidence of cervical lymph node metastasis.  
- For patients with clinically negative neck and T2 lesions with presence of negative prognostic features such as increased depth of invasion, high-grade features, perineural invasion, and/or lymphovascular invasion, elective neck dissection should be strongly considered and offered to rule out occult cervical lymph node metastasis.

# Treatment Results:

- With appropriate management of lip cancer, it has a combined 5-year survival and cure rate of over  $90\%$ .  
- Resection margin status, cervical lymph node metastasis, and commissure involvement are the three most important factors affecting survival from lip cancer.  
It is a highly treatable disease when diagnosed and managed appropriately at an early stage.

# 35.2 Epidemiology and Etiology

The incidence of lip cancer varies throughout the world, resulting in up to  $30\%$  of all malignant tumors of the oral cavity in certain regions [15]. In the sunbelt region of the United States, the incidence of lip cancer reaches over 10 per 100,000, making lip cancer the most common cancer of the oral cavity, and its incidence is second only to skin malignancy of the head and neck. Although lip cancer remains relatively uncommon in parts of Asia, historically continental Europe and Australia have reported an annual incidence of up to 12.0 and 13.5 cases per 100,000 population in the past, respectively. Recent trends have shown global reduction in incidence rate of lip cancer, with Europe and Australia having reduction to 2.0 and 5.0 cases per 100,000 population, respectively [16, 17].

In the United States, the overall incidence of lip cancer is 0.51 per 100,000 population which is about  $50\%$  improvement in overall incidence over the past 10 years, as published in the National Cancer Institute SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program data [1]. However, unlike changing trends associated with other head and neck cancer sites, men continue to be affected at rates significantly higher than those in women. The incidence for males is 0.8 per 100,000 compared with 0.30 per 100,000 females [1, 18]. Nearly  $70\%$  of newly diagnosed cases are adults 60 years of age or older. Furthermore, although the condition is most commonly associated with late middle age, lip cancer occasionally occurs in patients younger than age 30 years [18].

The etiology of lip cancer is incompletely understood at present. Several factors have been associated with lip cancer development, but direct cause and effect has not been proved. Approximately one third of patients with lip cancer have outdoor occupations, suggesting that sun exposure may be an etiologic factor. Because of its prominence, the lower lip is at a higher risk for exposure to the sun than the upper lip. Hence, this results in the discrepancy in the distribution between upper and lower lip cancers [19, 20]. Carcinoma of the lip principally affects those individuals with fair skin complexions. The prevalence of lip cancer is at least 10 times higher in whites than in those with darker skin and is extremely rare among blacks [17, 21]. Although it has never been proved, darker skinned individuals are believed to have a protective pigment in the vermilion of the lips that provides protection from solar injury [22].

Multiple factors have been linked to lip cancer, including tobacco use, pipe smoking, thermal injury, lip trauma, poor oral hygiene, exposure to chemicals, mechanical irritants, immunosuppression, and chronic infections [12-14, 23-28]. Immunosuppression significantly increases the risk of skin carcinoma development, especially on exposed surfaces. Immunosuppressed individuals may develop lip carcinomas at a younger age and remain at risk for the development of multiple and recurrent lip cancers [29]. Chronic infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been reported in  $60\%$  of cutaneous squamous carcinoma cases in patients with renal transplant history and immunosuppression; however, a matched control group in which patients did not develop squamous carcinomas demonstrated a lower incidence of HPV infection [30]. Recently, interest has developed in the association between head and neck cancers and HPV-16 infection. Although HPV-16 is clearly associated with oropharyngeal carcinomas, its role in oral cavity and potentially lip squamous carcinomas remains controversial [31, 32]. A study of non-immunosuppressed, healthy individuals demonstrates chronic HPV presence in  $30\%$  of normal lip samples [33]. In the same cohort, patients with squamous carcinoma of the lip exhibited HPV infection at a rate of  $18\%$ , suggesting no relationship between HPV infection and carcinoma development. However, pharmacologic immunosuppression after organ transplant has been demonstrated to contribute to an increase in incidence of cutaneous squamous carcinoma as patient survival times after transplant are extended [34, 35]. Renal transplant patients have been reported to have a 30-fold increased risk of developing lip cancer over time [23]. Several case series have reported that a large proportion of lip cancer patients regularly use tobacco, indicating that tobacco use is etiologically associated with lip cancer development [7, 12, 19, 24, 36-40]. In 1984, Douglass

and Gammon [22] reassessed the epidemiology of oral cancer and declared that there was insufficient proof for declaring tobacco as an etiologic factor in the development of lip cancer. Additional case-controlled studies concluded that no statistically significant relation exists between tobacco exposure and lip carcinoma [41, 42]. The smoking of cigars and pipes is often considered an important etiologic factor; however, no convincing evidence exists that supports a causal relationship between tobacco use and developing lip carcinoma. Cigar and pipe smoking today, at best, are likely responsible for only a small fraction of lip cancers. Although alcohol and tobacco exposure remain the two factors most strongly associated with the development of oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas, these risk factors have proved to exhibit a limited influence on the developing lip carcinoma. Much of the evidence that consistently associates prolonged and cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight with the development of lip cancer has been derived from numerous case series and epidemiologic studies [5, 23-25, 36, 41, 43]. Recently HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide) use, the commonly and widely used diuretic antihypertensive drug, due to its photosensitizing properties has been looked at as a possible etiology for lip cancer. Several studies have shown that its use in the non-Hispanic white population is strongly associated with increased risk of lip cancer [44-49].

# 35.3 Anatomic Considerations

Embryologically, the upper lip forms by fusing the two maxillary processes with a central median nasal process (Fig. 35.1). As a result, a central midline mass with two larger lateral segments is formed. The separation of the lateral segments by this central midline mass makes metastasis from upper lip cancers to the contralateral neck exceedingly rare. Conversely, the lower lip, formed by fusion in the midline of two mandibular processes, is at an increased risk for contralateral neck metastasis, particularly with lesions near the midline. The lateral and superior borders of the upper lip are well defined at the nasolabial creases bilaterally and at the nasal base superiorly. The inferior border of the lower lip is defined along the transversely oriented labiomental crease.

The formal definition of lip cancer, established by the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) for the purpose of staging lip cancer, describes the mucosal lip as beginning at the "junction of the wet and dry mucosa of the lip (the anterior border of the portion of the lip that comes into contact with the opposed lip) and extends posteriorly into the oral cavity to the attached gingiva of the alveolar ridge. The dry vermilion lip and vermilion border is staged using the chapter on cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck." [50] This definition focuses on the unique mucosal surface of the lip and excludes cancers that arise from the adjacent skin. This is a change from previous AJCC versions where the dry lip vermilion was included with the lip and oral cavity staging. In statistical reporting, cancers of the lip are commonly grouped with those of the oral cavity, because the lip is defined as part of the oral cavity by the American Joint Committee on Cancer [50, 51].

Lymphatic drainage of the lower lip originates as an interconnecting network of lymph vessels beneath the submucosa of the vermilion [52, 53]. It subsequently gives rise to five or six lymphatic collecting trunks that eventually terminate into regional lymph nodes. The lymphatic trunks of the central one third of the lower lip typically drain into the submental lymph nodes via perivascular and superficial facial nodes overlying the mandibular symphysis. The trunks that arise from each lateral one third of the lower lip typically drain into the ipsilateral submandibular lymph nodes. In certain individuals, the lymphatic trunks from the central one third of the lip may drain to the submandibular lymph nodes on either side.

Other than resection margins, one of the most important prognostic factors for survival from lip cancer is cervical lymph node metastasis [3, 5, 54-57]. Cervical metastasis from lip cancer occurs in fewer than  $10\%$  of patients with early stage cancer of the lower lip and ranges from  $20\%$  to  $50\%$  in cancer of the upper lip and commissure [7, 51, 58]. In the upper lip, crossover of lymphatic drainage between the right and the left halves typically does not occur, but because of the high rate of regional metastasis, consideration of therapeutic strategies for ipsilateral occult disease must be undertaken [52, 53]. The upper lip also possesses five or six collecting trunks on each side of the midline that originate as delicate lymphatic vessels in the submucosa of the vermilion (Fig. 35.2). The trunks ultimately terminate in the submandibular lymph nodes but occasionally also drain to the ipsilateral preauricular or infra-auricular parotid lymph nodes. Metastasis that results from cancer of the lip most commonly involves the submandibular and submental lymph nodes (level 1) [59-61]. Metastasis to level II of the jugular chain rarely occurs. Cancer involving the upper lip may occasionally metastasize to the parotid lymph nodes, but contralateral metastasis is unusual for cancers of the upper lip that do not cross the midline and for lower lip cancers that do not involve the central one third of the lower lip.

Fig. 35.2 Patterns of lymphatic drainage from various portions of the upper lip

Metastasis from the lower lip is primarily to the submental, submandibular, and perifacial nodes (Fig. 35.3). Metastasis is found in the submandibular lymph nodes in approximately  $80 - 90\%$  of patients with metastasis from cancer of the lower lip [7, 62]. Although the upper lip is responsible for fewer than  $10\%$  of lip cancer cases, its pattern of metastasis is fairly predictable, with the submandibular and parotid lymph node groups being most commonly involved [63]. Carcinoma of the commissure and upper lip spreads to the preauricular, peri-parotid, and submandibular nodes. Bilateral metastasis may develop if the lesion is near or has crossed the midline of the lip. Crossover between the lymphatics of the right and left sides of the upper lip rarely occurs [5].

Cervical metastasis occurs late in the course of lip cancer in fewer than  $10\%$  of patients with early stage cancer of the lower lip and, up to  $20\%$  in cancer of the upper lip and commissure [7]. For advanced stage lower lip cancers and early lower lip squamous cell carcinoma (specifically T2 lesions) with poor prognostic features such as increased depth of invasion, high-grade features, perineural invasion (PNI), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), the lymph node metastasis rate reaches up to  $35\%$  [5, 7, 51, 54-58, 64-68]. Lymph node metastasis to the upper jugular digastric chain is seen in only approximately  $15\%$  of all patients who have lymph node metastasis and is almost always seen in conjunction with ipsilateral submandibular metastasis [7, 62].

Blood supply to the upper and lower lips arises from the labial arteries, which are terminal branches from the external carotid system. The terminal blood supply forms an arterial arcade such that lesions of the lateral lip receive blood from both medial and lateral sources. Consideration of the blood supply is critical when ablative procedures require local tissue transfers to reconstruct form and function. Failure to recognize the anatomic relationship of the labial blood supply in association with the resection defect may result in the surgeon's inability to develop a well-perfused flap for rotational tissue transfer and may ultimately result in partial or complete reconstruction necrosis and failure.

# 35.4 Management

# 35.4.1 Evaluation

Because carcinomas of the lip occur on a highly visible and constantly exposed region of the body, a relatively early diagnosis is often feasible. The clinical presentation of lip carcinomas is quite characteristic, generally presenting as an exophytic or ulcerated lesion on the vermilion border, along with variable degrees of infiltration of the underlying musculature or invasion of the overlying skin or labial mucosa (Fig. 35.4). Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas are often associated with hyperkeratosis and leukoplakia of the vermilion border of the lip. Primary carcinomas have a variable clinical presentation. Tumors may be ulcerative, exophytic, or endophytic on presentation. Regardless of the presenting morphologic type, any lip lesion that the clinician views as a possible malignancy should, without delay, undergo an incisional biopsy that includes both a portion of the lip lesion and a small portion of normal-appearing tissue at the margin. Evaluation of regional lymph nodes should be done clinically, and a dedicated contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck should be ordered for advanced disease. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the involved areas and PET/CT (positron

emission tomography) can be obtained if clinically indicated. Based on the extent of disease and areas involved, multidisciplinary consultation with nutrition, speech pathologists, and social workers should be considered. Furthermore, detailed studies of the mandible, including panoramic radiographs and cone beam computed tomography scans, may be necessary to delineate the extent of the bony invasion as well as any involvement of the inferior alveolar canal. Melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas are known to be neurotropic and may spread along the inferior alveolar nerve via the mental foramen [69-71]. Patients who complain of numbness or paresthesia warrant further radiologic evaluation.

The factors that should be considered in planning surgical resection and reconstruction of the lips include the tumor grade and stage, lip subsite of origin, reconstructive options available, plan for adjuvant therapy, and patient preference [72].

Staging of lip carcinoma is similar to that employed for tumors of the oral cavity (Table 35.1) [50]. Recent changes made by the AJCC to the lip and oral cavity tumor staging are reflected in the table below. In the eighth edition of AJCC Staging Manual (third edition of Updates and Corrections), important changes from previous staging system have been made. These include addition of depth of invasion (DOI) in the tumor size staging and inclusion of extranodal extension (ENE) into clinical and pathological regional nodal staging [AJCC] (Table 35.2). Radiographic evaluation of tumors detected at an early stage that involve the lip is generally unnecessary. Conversely, advanced tumors that adhere to or invade the adjacent mandible require further radiologic evaluation.

# 35.4.2 Surgical Treatment

The ultimate goal of lip cancer management is long-term control of the carcinoma with limiting morbidity of treatment, maintenance of quality of life, preservation of the competency, and aesthetics of the perioral region. Although external beam interstitial irradiation or surgical excision can control small primary tumors of the lip equally well, surgery is quicker, maintains blood supply and soft tissue integrity, and leaves little aesthetic or functional impairment. Locally advanced lip cancers require planned surgical resection, with reconstruction in most cases. In the past 100 years, clinicians have employed many methods to manage lip cancer. Some of the less effective methods have included direct applications of caustic agents, such as hydrochloric acid, arsenic paste, or nitric acid. In addition, laser surgery, electrocoagulation, cryotherapy, and intra-arterial chemotherapy have been advocated by some. However, the two modalities that have been the most thoroughly evaluated and that have undergone the test of time are surgery and radiation therapy. These two techniques yield excellent results for very early lip cancers, and surgery is the most common treatment selected for managing lip carcinoma of any size, particularly the larger T3 and T4 tumors. Surgeon and patient limitations dictate treatment modalities. The surgeon's experience may limit the extent of the required resection for cure based on the tumor size at presentation. Prolonged general anesthesia and advanced reconstruction modalities such as microvascular free tissue transfer or complex local tissue transfer may not be reasonable given factors such as medical comorbidities, patient compliance, and anticipated aesthetic and functional outcomes of the reconstructive efforts.

The determination of an adequate surgical margin around a lip cancer is somewhat nebulous, and few objective data have been gathered to substantiate any recommendations for adequate excision margins. The size of the primary lesion is the most common factor that we use to determine the extent of the marginal excision. Larger cancers have typically mandated wider margins than have smaller cancers. Based on these general guidelines, a minimum of  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  of normal tissue around a lip cancer is recommended to facilitate its complete removal [3, 12, 37, 73-76]. Smaller lip cancers, less than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in greatest dimension, can often be managed with slightly smaller margins of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  [75]. The lip shave, or vermilionectomy procedure, is ideal

for those situations wherein areas of leukoplakia, actinic cheilitis, or carcinoma in situ involve the vermilion of the lips (Fig. 35.5) [77-86]. These premalignant conditions require treatment but not complete full-thickness excision of the lip. This operation involves partial or entire excision of the lip vermilion. The vermilionectomy may also be used, in conjunction with a full-thickness lip excision, in individuals possessing invasive lip carcinoma and premalignant vermilion changes. Following the vermilionectomy, the residual defect is primarily closed with labial mucosal advancement flaps. Minimization of the mucosal elevation to only the required surface area required for vermilion reconstruction will preserve oral mucosal surface sensory innervation.

Fig. 35.6 The proposed incisions for a shield excision of lower lip are delineated

In situations with invasive lesions, the lip shave procedure is contraindicated, and full-thickness excision of the involved portion of the lip is the traditional procedure for management. The most commonly selected configuration of lip excision is a V, a W, or a shield (Fig. 35.6). The defects resulting from the V and W excisions can easily be closed primarily with no additional mobilization of adjacent tissues (Fig. 35.7). The rectangular form of excision, however, requires advancement of laterally based lip flaps to achieve a satisfactory closure. The choice of local excisional geometry and primary closure should be based on design features that maintain the aesthetic subunit morphology.

Invasion of the mandible, involvement of the mental or inferior alveolar nerve, tumor sizes of T3 or greater, or associated regional lymph node metastasis generally necessitates a more aggressive resection. Aggressive

Fig. 35.7 Primary closure of a W excision of the lower lip

treatment requires an excision and reconstruction that is more complex than the standard full-thickness V or W excision and is discussed in detail in the following section on "Lip Reconstruction," including a marginal mandibulectomy with the resection of lip cancers that approximate the alveolar ridge or outer labial cortex of the mandible. Likewise, for rare lesions that actually demonstrate radiographic invasion of the mandible, a segmental mandibulectomy should be included in the treatment plan.

# 35.4.3 Lip Reconstruction

Lip reconstruction after surgical excision of cancer should reestablish the function and appearance of the lip. The key to functional restoration is the reconstitution of the orbicularis oris muscle. Primary surgical restoration of the orbicularis muscle after resections that exceed two thirds to three quarters of the lip length will create microstomia.

Defects of the vermilion resulting from a lip shave procedure are generally restored with labial mucosal advancement flaps [87-89]. The labial mucosal flap develops by creating a plane between the minor salivary glands and the inner surface of the orbicularis oris muscle. This flap may be mobilized into the buccal vestibule if necessary. The flap is secured to the anterior cutaneous margin of the excision to create a new vermilion cutaneous border (Fig. 35.8). Other less commonly used flaps for vermilion reconstruction after a lip shave include cross-lip buccal mucosa flaps and tongue flaps [89-91].

Fig. 35.9 Good aesthetic results after shield excision and primary closure of a right lower lip defect involving one third the total length of the lower lip

Closure may be achieved primarily when a full-thickness excision of the upper or lower lip results in a defect of up to one third of the lip length (Fig. 35.9). The V-shaped excision design credited to Louis [92] is most commonly used when a primary closure is anticipated. Typically, the apex of the V is placed at or slightly above the nasolabial fold or labiomental crease and should be planned to parallel the relaxed skin tension lines [87-90, 93-95]. The mucocutaneous margin can be marked before beginning the full-thickness excision to facilitate precise alignment followed by a minimum of a three-layered closure comprising mucosa, muscle, and skin as necessary to avoid unaesthetic notching of the lip as the scar matures.

Lip cancers that extend more deeply into the lip substructure but still involve a superficial length of vermilion that would otherwise produce a defect may be closed primarily via the W-shaped modification of the V configuration (Fig. 35.10). This excision uses an M-plasty in place of the single apex of the V. A three-layered closure of the defect, with careful attention to detail in the reconstruction of the orbicularis oris muscle layer, is achieved.

The need to reconstruct lip defects greater than one third of the horizontal dimension mandates the use of adjacent tissue for reconstruction and has led to the development of various circumoral advancement flap techniques [88-90, 93, 95-97]. The most popular of these techniques includes the Karapandzic reconstruc

tion flap (Fig. 35.11). This flap consists of a transfer of the remaining lip tissue to reconstitute the lips and mouth opening, thereby maintaining a functional oral sphincter. The Karapandzic flap uses release incisions within the labiomental crease, extending around the region of the oral commissures and continuing superiorly within the nasolabial creases bilaterally. Combining sharp and blunt dissection separates the orbicularis muscles from the surrounding facial expression muscles. Neurovascular structures are preserved and transposed medially, along with the flap, and intraoral buccal mucosal release incisions are often necessary.

For this reason, the Karapandzic flap is ideally suited in situations in which two thirds to three quarters, or more, of the lower lip is resected, particularly when the resection is centrally located and leaves the lateral ends near the commissures intact. The incisions for elevation of the Karapandzic flap require mobilization of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that are superficial to the orbicularis oris muscle and mucosa and deep to the orbicularis oris muscle. At the same time, the muscle itself must be kept intact, with its nerve and blood supply preserved as tissues are rotated and sutured medially.

Among other reconstructive options for the lip, the cross-lip or opposing flaps are particularly useful in repairing moderate lip defects of one third the length of one lip [93, 98-100]. These techniques transfer a full-thickness segment of lip tissue into a defect on the opposite lip. Estlander and Abbé developed the most commonly used cross-lip flap repair techniques [99, 100]. Although the Estlander and the Abbé nomenclatures are used interchangeably and incorrectly at times, both techniques illustrate the important principle of tissue sharing from a normal lip to reconstruct the resected opposing lip. Variations on either technique are limited only by the imagination and creativity of the reconstructive surgeon. The Abbé flap, as originally described, transfers tissue from the lower lip to a defect in the central component of the upper lip. It is, however, most often used to reconstruct lower lip defects by transferring tissue from the upper lip (Fig. 35.12). The Estlander flap was used to reconstruct defects of the upper or lower lip in a single stage by transferring lip tissue around the oral commissure (Fig. 35.13). All cross-lip flaps are generally referred to as Abbé-Estlander type flaps.

The principle of the Abbé-Estlander flap repair is that the width of the base of the triangular flap is one half that of the width of the base of the triangular surgical defect. The vertical length of the flap should match that of the defect. The cross-lip flap includes and depends on a small pedicle that carries the labial artery from the donor lip.

Generally, mark out the flap on the upper lip on the same side as the planned excision (Fig. 35.14). Make a skin incision at the previously marked outline of the Abbé-Estlander flap on the lateral aspect of the upper lip. The lateral incision is deepened through both the musculature and the mucosa, extending from the vermilion border up to the apex of the flap. With extreme caution,

perform an incision along the medial margin of the flap, beginning at the apex of the flap and working toward the vermilion border to avoid injury to the labial artery. As mobilization of the flap toward the vermilion border proceeds, separate the musculature of the upper lip bluntly with a hemostat and divide small segments of the muscle fibers a little at a time with scissors. Once the labial artery is identified, under direct vision, divide the other attachments of the musculature of the upper lip around the labial artery while keeping the mucosa of the vermilion border intact. In addition, to allow flap rotation, divide the intraoral labial mucosa on the medial aspect of the flap from the apex of the flap toward the lip. Rotate the flap 180 degrees to fill the surgical defect in the lower lip.

Fig. 35.15 Typical appearance of the cross-lip transfer flap at the time of suture removal, demonstrated in this lower to upper lip transfer

Inset of the flap begins by accurate approximation of the vermilion edges of the flap and the lower lip, followed by careful multilayered closure. Bring the vascular pedicle across the open mouth and perform the second-stage release 3 weeks later (Fig. 35.15). Preoperatively, instruct the patient to avoid trauma to this intervening pedicle during the immediate postoperative period.

When one commissure of the lip must be sacrificed along with the excision of the lip cancer, employ a non-bridged Estlander flap (Fig. 35.16). This flap is created as a single-stage procedure without the need for secondary pedicle division. The downside of this type of flap is the development of a somewhat unnatural, rounded commissure. The Abbé-Estlander flap can be used in reverse when a lesion of the upper lip is excised by elevating the flap from the lower lip. Alternatively, a cheek advancement flap with Burow's triangle is often useful for repairing lateral defects of the upper lip (Fig. 35.17).

![](images/2b806f00adbddffb85bd3cd064686f8e5460ff3f165b535b6a1a2b7b0d6f2ac3.jpg)

Fig. 35.17 In situations that do not require reconstruction of the vermilion surface of the lip, a cutaneous advancement flap may be appropriate, as in this case with Burow's triangles to aid in advancement

Several techniques designed for lip defects are too extensive for reconstruction using the Karapandzic or Abbé-Estlander techniques [101-103]. These techniques use adjacent cheek tissue in the form of laterally based advancement flaps. In the Bernard flap, the lower lip may be excised in its entirety, along with soft tissues of the mental region, and the resulting defect is closed by lateral cheek flaps to form a new lower lip (Fig. 35.18). Webster and coworkers' [101] modification of Bernard's original description incorporates Schuchardt flaps to facilitate cheek advancement, allowing for setback of the commissure and to reduce the incidence of a "fishmouth" deformity. This is accomplished by excising triangles of the skin from both sides of the upper lip. Preserve the mucous membrane to help form a new vermilion border. Excise the triangular wedges of skin from the nasolabial crease on both sides, subsequent to excision of the primary tumor. The base of this triangular excision extends from the commissure of the mouth, up to the nasolabial crease, depending on the width of the cheek flap to be mobilized (Fig. 35.19a). After excising the triangular wedges, incise the mucosa from their inner aspect, except for the base, and shift the triangular flaps of the upper lip mucosa medially, along with the flaps (see Fig. 35.19b). Make a counter-incision in the lower mucogingival sulcus bilaterally, and mobilize both cheek flaps medially. Perform a closure of the lip musculature on both sides with interrupted sutures. The triangular wedges of the mucosa from the upper lip are everted and rolled inferiorly to provide a new vermilion surface. Mucosal closure is completed inferiorly in the mucogingival sulcus (see Fig. 35.19c, d).

![](images/0c33703dfa127cad0a079106333818af4564eed30ddc40b82280825a8453e83c.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 35.18 In situations requiring complete excision of the lower lip, the Bernard flap may provide a means for reconstruction with circumoral tissues, depicted in this schematic drawing

The main advantage of the modified Bernard flap is its ability to reconstruct almost the whole lower lip in a single-stage procedure. The main disadvantages are potential notching at the lower lip midline closure resulting in diminished competency and saliva control as well as reduction of the size of the orifice and creating a so-called permanent smile deformity of the lips, most often produced in edentulous individuals.

The reconstruction of more massive defects that include total lip excision, as well as excising the adjacent floor of the mouth, skin, or mandible, requires the use of distant flaps, such as the deltopectoral or pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. Alternatively, use free vascularized composite flaps to reconstruct these large defects. A free flap that has been shown to be particularly useful is the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap [104-109]. (Fig. 35.20).

# 35.4.4 Cervical Lymphadenectomy

Previously it has been established that in patients with early cancer of the lip (stages I and II) do not gener

ally need elective treatment of the cervical lymph nodes because the rate of occult metastasis is low. Given the infrequency with which stage I and stage II lip cancers spread to regional lymph nodes, the current NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines recommend against elective neck dissection for T1 and T2 lip cancers with clinically N0 necks [76, 110]. That being said, there is significant recent data which suggest that in a clinically N0 neck, squamous cell carcinoma of the lip with size greater than  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$ , increased DOI, high-grade features, PNI, LVI, and location of the lesion at the commissure are negative prognostic features, which may put the patient at higher risk for occult cervical lymph node metastasis and these patients should be considered for elective neck dissection [5, 7, 51, 54-58, 64-68]. One report indicated that there was delayed cervical metastasis between  $35\%$  and  $40\%$  from lip cancer tumors  $2 - 4\mathrm{cm}$  in size [5]. This report confirms a much larger rate of metastasis than that usually seen in clinical practice. Nodal disease is the single most important prognostic factors for survival in patients with lip squamous cell carcinoma [3, 5, 54-57]. Given this fact, for early stage lip squamous cell carcinoma (specifically T2 lesions), performing elective neck dissections to rule out occult metastasis should be considered on an individual basis and should be recommended to patients based on above-mentioned negative prognostic features.

With advanced disease (stages III and IV), elective neck dissection of levels I through III is recommended (Fig. 35.21). Thus, even if the patient has no palpable adenopathy (N0 neck), the clinician should still use elective radiation therapy or elective neck node dissection in managing patients, owing to the high rate of microscopic lymph node metastasis in these patients. Metastasis from carcinoma of the lower lip to lymphatic basins at levels IV and V is exceedingly rare. In patients with lesions of the upper lip, commissure, or both, include a superficial parotidectomy. Clinically apparent lymph nodes require either radiation therapy or neck dissection for N1 nodes and combined therapy (neck dissection and radiation) for N2 and N3 nodes involvement [111]. For patients with advanced stage disease and adverse features such as ENE, positive or close margins, PNI, LVI, or heavy regional nodal burden, concurrent systemic therapy with radiation should be considered in an adjuvant setting [110].

# 35.5 Treatment Results

The cure rate for T1 and T2 lip cancers without regional metastasis is greater than  $90\%$  with surgery or radiation [5, 80]. In the United States, the combined 5-year relative survival is  $92\%$  [1]. The cure rates for cancer of the lips suggest a better prognosis than for other cancers of the oral cavity. Cancer involving the oral commissure is more aggressive, with a 5-year cure rate ranging between  $34\%$  and  $50\%$ . Cancers that include areas larger than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  have cure rates of less than  $80\%$ , and those that invade deep enough to involve the mandible have a cure rate of less than  $50\%$  [5, 112]. The primary cause of failure is local recurrence rather than regional node metastasis. Other adverse prognostic factors include poor histologic grade, tumor thickness greater than  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , desmoplasia, stromal sclerosis, muscular invasion, and perineural invasion [113-115]. Angiogenesis has not

been shown to have prognostic significance [116]. While TP53 mutations are seen in  $50\%$  of lip cancers, the clinical significance of this observation is unknown [117].

Generally, elective lymph node dissection in the N0 neck is reserved for advanced stage disease (stage III and stage IV) [112, 118]. Approximately  $5 - 10\%$  of patients with lip cancer will develop evidence of nodal involvement [2, 19, 119]. Without question, the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis affects survival. The average 5-year survival for patients with cervical metastasis of lip carcinoma is approximately  $50\%$ , with a range of  $29 - 68\%$ . In the United States the 5-year relative survival for patients with regional disease is  $65.5\%$  and  $32.3\%$  for patient with distant metastatic disease [1]. Recurrence rates in the neck after treatment of regional metastasis are  $40\%$  for N1 disease and up to  $100\%$  for N3 disease [2]. The risk of developing a metachronous lip cancer is estimated at about  $20\%$  by 10 years follow-up [120].

# Conclusions

Lip cancer accounts for a significant percentage of all head and neck malignancies in the United States. Lip cancer arises from the lower lip in nearly  $90\%$  of cases. Etiologic factors associated with lip cancer include sun exposure, alcohol, and tobacco abuse. The propensity of hydrochlorothiazide use and its strong association with higher risk of lip cancer in specific populations is quite intriguing, but remains to be validated with further studies. Nodal disease, positive margins, and commissure involvement are adverse prognostic factors. Regional cervical lymph node metastasis is directly related to a poor prognosis. With overall cure rates of greater than  $80 - 90\%$ , lip cancers have a more favorable prognosis than most other head and neck cancers.
