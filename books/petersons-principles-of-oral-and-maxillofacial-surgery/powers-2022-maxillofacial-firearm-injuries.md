# 27.1 Introduction

The introduction of Chinese gunpowder to Europe around the thirteenth century was quickly followed by the development of projectile weapons based on its explosive properties. The first recorded use of a cannon was by Edward III against the Scots in 1327, and small arms carried by one or two soldiers began appearing in the fourteenth century [1]. Early weapons that used modified arrows were replaced with more efficient stone and, ultimately, metallic projectiles. Improvements in projectiles and firearms led to increasing numbers of more devastating wounds. Surgeons accustomed to dealing with a variety of wounds from blunt, bladed, and pointed weapons were faced with blast and projectile injuries of a completely different nature. Contamination and devitalized tissues led to increasing numbers of infections, which surgeons of the day incorrectly attributed to the gunpowder itself, and the anticipation of "laudable pus." Subsequent advances in surgical knowledge went on to closely parallel the evolution of firearms. Knowledge gained on the battlefield by famed military surgeons such as Ambroise Paré (1510-1590) elevated the art of surgery to a learned profession [1]. Lessons learned in the management of injuries sustained in combat continue to improve our understanding and management techniques, leading to improved care for the increasing number of civilian gunshot injuries [2, 3].

# 27.2 Epidemiology

The epidemiology of ballistic injuries to the maxillofacial region remains constant in the civilian community due to the historical and overriding presence of firearms within the USA. While the presentation of catastrophic ballistic injuries classically is associated as being under the purview of the military surgeon during times of armed conflict, large metropolitan trauma centers, and

many community and rural hospitals in the USA, will routinely encounter patients injured during criminal acts, attempted suicide, or accidental shootings associated with recreational or hunting activities. By understanding the etiology of these injuries, craniomaxillofacial surgeons are better prepared to serve as educators and advocates in the community for the elimination of these injuries.

# 27.2.1 Fatal and Nonfatal Firearm Injuries

The most current comprehensive analyses of fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries in the USA were accomplished by Fowler et al. in 2015 and Kegler et al. in 2018 [4, 5]. Approximately 100,000 firearm-related injuries occur annually in the USA, with firearms involved in over  $74\%$  of homicides and  $57\%$  of suicides (Fig. 27.1a, b) [4-6]. Over 38,000 of these individuals sustained fatal wounds from these incidents, but more than twice this amount survived their injury, many with significant injuries and permanent disabilities [4-6]. Cohen in 2003 reported the average hospital length of stay for a firearm-related wound was 6 days, with  $7\%$  of hospitalized firearm wound patients expiring from their injuries, and currently estimated hospital costs to be near $1 billion (Fig. 27.1c) [7-13]. As  $29\%$  of these patients were uninsured, and the estimated cost of firearm-related injuries per incident in the USA is in excess of $17,000, or over $2.3 billion aggregate lifetime medical costs for firearm injury survivors, the societal impact and payment implications for hospitals, local government, and the American taxpayer are immense [7-10]. The homicide rate for males was nearly four times the rate for females (7.9 and 2.0 per 100,000 population, respectively) and approximately five times the rate for females among those aged 20-29 years. When the relationship of the victim to suspect was known, among male decedents, the suspect was most frequently an acquaintance/ friend  $(35.2\%)$ , and among female decedents, the suspect was most frequently a current or former spouse/ intimate partner  $(51.4\%)$ . Non-Hispanic blacks accounted for more than half  $(54.2\%)$  of homicides and had the highest rate (19.1 per 100,000 population), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (9.8 per 100,000 population) and Hispanics (4.7 per 100,000 population). Non-Hispanic black males had the highest rate of homicide deaths of any racial/ethnic group (35.0 per 100,000 population). This rate was 12.5 times the homicide rate for non-Hispanic white males (2.8 per 100,000), approximately two times the homicide rate for American Indian/Alaska Native males (14.6 per 100,000 population) and four times the homicide rate for Hispanic males (7.4 per 100,000 population). Age

specific homicide rates were highest among persons aged 20-24 years (12.1 per 100,000 population), followed by persons aged 25-29 years (11.1 per 100,000 population). The rate for infants aged  $< 1$  year was more than 2.5 times the rate for children aged 1-4 years (7.7 and 2.6 per 100,000 population, respectively). Rates were lowest among persons aged 5-14 years and  $\geq 65$  years. Among male homicide decedents, the majority (65.3%) were aged 20-44 years; the rate was highest among those aged 20-24 years (20.6 per 100,000 population). Among female homicide decedents, nearly half (48.0%) were aged 20-44 years; the homicide rate was highest among infants aged  $< 1$  year (6.8 per 100,000 population). Among male infants aged  $< 1$  year, the homicide rate was 8.6 per 100,000 population (Fig. 27.2a-d).

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2016 that firearms were used in  $74\%$  of homicides in the USA. The logical conclusion would be that the acute management of these conditions in the American healthcare system would be an expected event [7, 8]. In 2017, homicide was the 7th leading cause of death for African Americans regardless of age, while it ranked as the 16th leading cause of death when all races were included [8]. A 2017 National Vital Statistics Report indicating over 39,000 deaths resulted from firearm injuries in 2017, making it the second leading cause of accidental death after motor vehicle accidents, highlights the current issues with firearm-related injuries as recent trends of reduction in

firearm fatalities were reversed in 2017, with the age-adjusted death rate for firearm-related injuries for the total population increased significantly, by  $1.7\%$  from 11.8 in 2016 to 12.0 in 2017 (Fig. 27.3a, b) [1, 15, 16].

# 27.2.2 Risk Factors for Firearm Injuries

# 27.2.2.1 Unintended Firearm Injuries

Unintentional firearm injuries and deaths represent a very small proportion of the total number of firearm injuries and have steadily declined since the 1930s (Fig. 27.4a) [17, 18]. Ismach evaluated unintended shootings in the Atlanta area from May 1996 through June 2000 to determine the proportion of accidental injuries that might be prevented by safer storage, handling, or firearm design [19]. Of the 216 unintentional firearm injuries recorded during this period, the majority of victims were 15-34 years of age. One-fourth of the shootings involved victims under the age of 18 years. Handguns were involved in  $87\%$  of the incidents. Of the 122 cases for which details of causation could be established,  $74\%$  of the incidents were associated with mishandling of the firearm,  $14\%$  were associated with child access to the firearm, and  $32\%$  were associated with perceived deficiencies in firearm design [19]. Ismach concluded the incidence of unintended shootings could be decreased by improving the safety of firearm storage and limiting access, improving available firearm safety

mechanisms, and educating owners about the safe handling of firearms, policies confirmed by additional studies conducted by Kochanek and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [14, 19, 20].

# 27.2.2.2 Pediatric Firearm Injuries

As noted previously by Kochanek, the pediatric population is at a disproportionately higher risk of firearm-related injuries (Fig. 27.4b) [20]. Paris evaluated risk factors associated with nonfatal firearm injuries among inner-city adolescents in the USA and found children living with less than two parents, those with frequent school absences, children with a previous arrest history, and being African American were factors placing adolescents at an increased risk of being the victim of firearm injury [21]. Nance evaluated demographics and contrasting urban versus rural firearm injury trends for the state of Pennsylvania, with findings indicating the rate of serious firearm injury in children was 10 times higher in urban areas than in rural areas [22]. Urban firearm injuries tended to be assaults, whereas rural injuries tended to be non-intentional [22]. Of these injuries,  $90.7\%$  were in males with an average age of 16  $\frac{1}{2}$  years. Unintended injuries predominated in children

5-9 years of age  $(61.4\%)$ , with  $56.7\%$  of these injuries occurring in rural areas. Handguns were the most commonly involved firearms regardless of geographic region, age, or injury circumstances. Nance appropriately concluded prevention strategies must be region- and situation-specific, taking these demographic variations into account [22]. Heninger reported similar results in 2008 with firearms being used in  $88\%$  of homicides and  $61\%$  of suicides in adolescents and teenagers in the Atlanta Metropolitan area [23].

# 27.2.2.3 Alcohol and Drug Abuse

An intuitive, and well-demonstrated risk factor for firearm-related injury, is the use or abuse of alcohol or other recreational or prescription drugs. Madan reported on the blood and urine analysis of 126 traumatically injured patients, regardless of the cause of injury, under the age of 21 years with  $42\%$  of these individuals testing positive for alcohol or drugs [24]. When the grouping was narrowed to gunshot wounds in patients under the age of 18 years,  $72\%$  of victims demonstrated evidence of substance use, with the 14- to-15-year-old age group showing the highest association.

and others have demonstrated an association between drug or alcohol use and risk of firearm injury [25-27].

# 27.2.2.4 Other Risk Factors

While not a complete listing of all factors associated with increased risk of firearm injury, a multitude of known influences includes the following [25-33]:

(a) Previous or current involvement in the justice system  
(b) History of incarceration  
(c) Depression  
(d) Suicidal ideation or active psychiatric disease  
(e) Presence of firearms in the home  
(f) Ethnic minority status—particularly African American  
(g) Poverty or financial crisis  
(h) Presence of alcohol or recreation drugs

# 27.3 Characteristics of Maxillofacial Ballistic and Missile Injuries

The management of ballistic injuries to the craniomaxillofacial zone is predicated on a basic understanding of the two mechanisms by which projectiles cause tissue damage: crushing and stretching. As the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted, missile injuries to the maxillofacial region may not only be caused by conventional weaponry with a bullet fired from a cylindrical chamber, but devastating projectile collisions with the facial skeleton may result from massive bomb blasts and shock wave impacts from improvised explosive devices [34]. While a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the physics of energy transfer and ballistic theory are beyond the scope of this chapter, a brief review of the basic concepts of ballistics and kinetic energy is warranted.

# 27.3.1 Categorizations of Gunshot Injuries

Gunshot injuries have previously been categorized in the literature as penetrating, perforating, or avulsive [16]. Penetrating wounds are caused by the projectile striking the victim but not exiting the body. Perforating injuries have entrance and exit wounds, and are classically described as being without appreciable tissue loss [16]. Avulsive injuries have entrance and exit wounds, generally presenting with an acute loss of tissue associated with the passage of the projectile out of the victim [16]. Rifles, handguns, and submachine guns have rifled barrels—essentially spiral grooves cut into the length of the interior of the bore of the barrel [29]. The grooves are separated by segments of metal, called lands, which

project into the middle of the barrel. The diameter of the barrel measured between the lands represents the caliber of the projectile. Caliber specifications based on nomenclature used in the USA can be difficult to comprehend. The 0.30-0.06 and the Winchester 0.308 cartridges are both loaded with bullets that have a diameter of 0.308 inches [35]. The "06" in this term describes the year, 1906, when the cartridge was introduced to the market. The term "grains" originally was applied to black powder charges and refers to the weight of the powder in the cartridge, not the number of granules contained in the cartridge case. A 0.30-0.30 cartridge has a 0.308-inch diameter bullet propelled by 30 grains of smokeless powder [35]. As newer forms of gunpowder were developed, this powder charge was no longer used, but the terminology persists to this day. Additional confusion regarding caliber exists because North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and US military projectiles are described using the metric system  $(5.56\mathrm{mm},7.62\mathrm{mm}$  or  $9\mathrm{mm}$  rounds), while US civilian firearm munitions are generally referred to in measurements relating to inches (0.357 or 0.38) [35]. Although the question regarding caliber is commonly asked by medical personnel in the management of ballistic injury, the reality is caliber has minimal practical impact in the care of the patient [36-38].

The terms "high velocity" and "low velocity" as they relate to projectiles can be somewhat misleading. Consensus between US and European research does not occur in the literature, with varying definitions correlating to where the study was performed. The US literature designates high velocity as being between 2000 and 3000 feet/second (610-914 meters/second), whereas studies from the United Kingdom designate the line between low- and high-velocity projectiles as being 1100 feet/second (335 meters/second), which is the speed of sound in air [39]. The earliest recognized entry of high-velocity projectiles having an association with increased wounding potential occurred during the Vietnam War. In 1967, Rich reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association bullets fired from the M16 rifle inflicted tremendous tissue destruction and injuries upon enemy combatants [40]. The muzzle velocity of the projectile shot from the M16 was 3100 feet/second. When coupled with erroneous information published by Rybeck in 1974 in the 1975 edition of the Emergency War Surgery manual regarding the size of the temporary cavity caused by the missile, this information led to the common misperception that high-velocity projectiles caused more significant injuries [39, 41]. Part of the confusion regarding the wounding potential of high-velocity projectiles is caused by misinterpretation of ballistic gelatin model studies. Ballistic gelatin is  $10 - 20\%$  gelatin refrigerated to  $4 - 10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and is used as the

tissue model for ballistic studies [36, 42]. The wound profile diagrams included in this chapter, and others represent the findings of these studies. The validity of the ballistic gelatin model has been confirmed by comparison with human autopsies, although there is confusion in correlating these studies to living patients, because the human body is much more resistant to deformation than gelatin. The effects of skin resistance, clothing, and opposition to separation of the fascial planes cannot be replicated in gelatin [43, 44]. Harvey evaluated the two types of pressure waves produced by penetrating objects in 1947: the sonic pressure wave and the temporary cavity [39, 45]. The first wave is the sonic pressure wave, sometimes referred to as the "shock wave," and it relates to the sound of the projectile striking the target. This wave transmits at the speed of sound (i.e., approximately 4750 feet/second [1450 meters/second]) and is traveling considerably faster than the projectile entering the target [39]. No temporary cavity is formed with the sonic pressure wave, and in that regard, it is analogous to the lithotripsy devices used for renal calculi destruction, with corresponding minimal risks for tissue injury [37]. Although American and Swedish researchers have tried to disprove Harvey's conclusions, no definitive evidence suggests that his findings are in error, and additional studies by French and American researchers support the original findings of 1947 [38, 43, 46-50].

The secondary pressure wave, referred to as the temporary cavity, is formed when the penetrating projectile strikes tissue and the wave radiates away laterally away from the permanent cavity of the projectile path. After being struck by the projectile, the ballistic gelatin/tissue displays an obvious temporary cavity, which potentially injures tissues such as muscle, vessels, and organs. The clinical significance of this cavity is variable with no real consensus in the literature, and the temporary cavity caused by the M16 in animal laboratory models is much smaller than the approximate 18-cm temporary cavity seen in ballistic gelatin [36]. Dog models indicated that acute tissue injury secondary to temporary cavity formation sustained with high-velocity projectile strikes was no more than  $5\mathrm{cm}$  and was able to resolve within 72 hours [36, 51, 52]. The US military conducted extensive research into the wounding patterns of projectiles, and the results are summarized in  $\square$  Fig. 27.5a–c. The unique anatomic differences in the craniomaxillofacial skeleton, a relatively thin soft tissue layer overlying a dense foundation of bone, mitigate some of the expected responses of the temporary tissue stretch as the overall thickness of the soft tissue envelope is generally less than the required total distance needing to be traveled before exhibiting secondary cavitation. While sequential soft tissue necrosis and small-vessel damage can occur, it is much more likely to be in response to the exaggerated

permanent cavity of the projectile, which is greatly enhanced after striking the underlying facial skeleton [37-39, 53]. The key point of understanding in the management of ballistic injuries is the permanent cavity, which involves all of the tissues that are pushed aside or destroyed during the flight of the projectile, and is the location of the extent of the initial, or immediate, damage. The size and shape of the permanent cavity are determined by the density and anatomic characteristics of the tissue lying in the projectile's path, the velocity of the projectile, the shape/characteristics of the projectile, and likely most importantly the degree of deformation of the missile as it travels through the tissues [36, 39, 42-44].

The type of firearm used has implications in the wounding potential of the projectile. Generalized discussions of craniomaxillofacial wounding patterns center on the following forms of firearms: handgun, rifles, and shotguns. The wounding patterns of these weapons are unique and do not fall under the classic description of firearm-based injuries [34]. The actual projectiles expelled by firearms are limited in type only by time and the imagination for description: hollow point, round nose, full metal jacket, alloy jacketed, Teflon-tipped, etc. (Fig. 27.6a). The components of a bullet provide a basic understanding of the principles of firearm injury (Fig. 27.6b). The projectile is the portion of the bullet that is expelled and strikes the victim [48]. The compositional makeup of the projectile (soft lead, hollow point, full copper covering) has a direct correlation on the wounding potential of the weapon. As a projectile deforms after striking the victim, either as a result of metallurgic composition during manufacturing or as a result of direct consequence of striking the underlying bone, the energy transfer to the patient, and potential injury to associated tissues, is increased [54]. The case is the container packaging the projectile, propellant (gunpowder), and primer as a single unit for placement into the firing mechanism of the weapon [54]. Wads are generally plastic frameworks with a paper or felt insert that holds the various pellets (projectiles) together with the propellant to allow for accurate and safe release of all the projectiles simultaneously from the barrel [54]. The propellant, or gunpowder, is the accelerant that allows for expulsion of the projectile from the weapon. The more the propellant in a cartridge, as is seen in magnum and rifle rounds, the greater the velocity the projectile exhibits [54]. The primer is the only portion of the bullet with an explosive charge. As the primer is struck by the firing pin of the weapon, the explosive charge is activated, igniting the propellant and sending the projectile on its flight [54]. Although traditional concepts of ballistics teach that impact kinetic energy is equal to one half the mass of the projectile times velocity-squared

$(\mathrm{KE} = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{MV}^2)$ , the increased energy transmitted from a high-velocity projectile does not necessarily translate to increased wounding capacity. Cunningham and others suggest modifications need to be used to correct the kinetic energy estimate of wounding potential for the type of tissue being struck by the projectile [16, 39, 44, 56]. Cunningham's belief was softer tissues, such as brain and muscle, should be associated with a lower exponent of injury (0.5) than harder tissues, such as bone, which would have a higher exponent (2.5) and therefore higher likelihood of permanent injury. The corrected formula for estimating wounding capacity by kinetic energy should be  $\mathrm{KE} = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{MV}^{0.5}$  to  $\mathrm{KE} = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{MV}^{2.5}$ . Handguns are handheld firearms, with a barrel length generally  $10\frac{1}{2}$  inches or less, which usually fire projectiles of a lower velocity and caliber [16, 54]. The characteristic low-velocity wound has a small rounded, or slightly ragged entrance wound, causing fragmentation of teeth and bone comminution, often exhibiting no exit wound [32, 54, 55] (Fig. 27.7a, b). If an exit wound does occur, it is generally slit-shaped or stellate (Fig. 27.8).

Handgun injuries generally tend to "push-away," or stretch soft tissues, including vessels or nerves as opposed to avulsive loss [16]. Rifles are long guns with barrel lengths of more than 26 inches [16, 54]. At distance, rifle wounds create a low-energy transfer similar to those seen with handguns. At close range, the wounding characteristics are different due to the increased potential injury associated with velocity and high-energy transfer [16, 54] (Fig. 27.9). The presence of an exit wound is usually found, which may be stellate and larger than the entry wound. The presence of avulsive soft/ hard tissue wounds and significant fragmentation of the bone can be characteristic findings of rifle wounds [16, 54]. A shotgun is a long gun that may fire a single pellet, or numerous pellets, at a relatively low velocity [16, 54]. The gauge of the shotgun is classified as the number of

lead balls/pellets placed together equaling the interior diameter of the barrel, which would weigh one pound [16, 54]. For contact for close-range injuries, the effect of the gas that is discharged under pressure into the wound also needs to be considered. This scenario is extremely important in shotgun and improvised explosive blast wounds due to the higher degree of contamination and presence of propelled gas and shock waves [34, 54]. Powder gases are expelled from the muzzle of the weapon after combustion of the gunpowder and follow the projectile out of the barrel. When the muzzle of the weapon is in contact with the target, this can be an additional source of tissue displacement, injury, and thermal burning [43]. Shotgun pellet injuries essentially depend completely on the distance the weapon is from the target at the time of discharge. Sherman and Parrish devised a classification system to describe shotgun wounds concerning the distance from the target. Type I injury occurs from a distance longer than 7 yards; type II injury is sustained when the discharge is within 3-7 yards; and type III injury is within 3 yards [57]. Type III injuries usually sustain dramatic soft and hard tissue injuries and avulsion of tissue, whereas type I injuries may be minimal (Figs. 27.6, 27.7, and 27.8). Because victims often have difficulty in determining how far away the shotgun was at the time of discharge, Glezer and colleagues revised this classification system and directed their attention to the size of the pellet scatter. Type I injuries occur when pellet scatter is within an area of  $25\mathrm{cm}^2$ ; type II injuries are within  $10\mathrm{cm}^2$  to  $25\mathrm{cm}^2$ ; and type III injuries have pellet scatter less than  $10\mathrm{cm}^2$  [58] (Fig. 27.10a-c). Although the Glezer classification originally was developed for abdominal injuries, the information is transferable to other areas of the body, and determinations of tissue injury can be correlated directly with the size of the pellet scatter. Intuitively, the closer the shotgun is to the patient, the more dramatic the hard and soft tissue damage is. For rifles and hand

Observe the relatively consistent permanent cavity and laterally radiating temporary cavity, which begins to develop at approximately  $20~\mathrm{cm}$  into the tissue as the projectile begins to tumble. This chart represents the projectile not striking any hard structures causing deformation or alteration in trajectory. The anatomic characteristics of the head and neck do not have over  $20~\mathrm{cm}$  of soft tissue present before encountering the bony skeleton, which would have a clinical significance in regards to the temporary cavity should the projectile be of a trajectory to only encounter soft tissue and miss the underlying facial bones. (From: Emergency War Surgery. 5th edition, Washington DC, United States Government Printing Office, 2018). b Ballistic representation of a  $7.62\mathrm{mm}$  soft point (SP) round striking muscle and bone. Note as the projectile strikes the underlying structures, there is a tremendous increase in the permanent cavity, as well as the temporary cavity, as the projec

tile deforms and fragments due to the soft tip construction. This deformation in the structural characteristic of the projectile, and associated increase in the permanent and temporary cavities, greatly enhances the wounding potential of this round. (From: Emergency War Surgery. 5th edition, Washington DC, United States Government Printing Office, 2018). c Ballistic representation of a 22-caliber  $(5.6\mathrm{mm})$  full metal case (FMC) round striking bone and muscle. Note as the relatively small caliber projectile strikes the underlying structures, there is a tremendous increase in the permanent cavity and associated temporary cavity as the projectile deforms and continues on a new trajectory. This representation illustrates the wounding potential of a smaller caliber weapon should the projectile strike the target and engage in energy transfer to the tissues.

one could argue that at the outer limit of a projectile range it is less likely to penetrate a target, rarely does a shooting occur outside the effective range of a weapon [54]. Recently, Sarani et al. noted that handguns were more often associated with fatal wounds in civilian mass

As previously noted in this chapter, the current conflicts in the Middle East have interjected a "new" mechanism for delivery of maxillofacial missile projectiles resulting in gruesome and avulsive craniomaxillofacial injuries, the improvised explosive device (IED) [34] (Fig. 27.11). While not a new entity, as the concept of IEDs has been deployed by guerilla forces since World War II, the description and media interest in the IED warrant a brief discussion of its characteristic properties. An IED is a bomb fabricated in an "improvised" manner designed to destroy or incapacitate military personnel or civilians. The bomb itself may be a conventional military-grade weapon, or an assortment of explosive components such as gasoline, or agricultural fertilizer as seen in the Oklahoma City Bombing of 1995. An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). Antipersonnel IEDs typically contain shrapnel generating components such as nails, ball bearings, metal fragments, wood, or glass [34]. The victim may first sustain a burn injury from ignited explosives [34]. Blunt and penetrating injury from contact by exploded fragments will further injure the patient. These fragments will be propelled at high- or ultra-high velocity and therefore cause ultra-high kinetic energy injuries. Direct shrapnel injury is only a single element to be considered, as detonation of any powerful explosive generates a blast wave of high pressure that spreads out from the point of explosion and travels hundreds of yards in all directions. The relative proximity the victim is to the site of the explosion, the greater the exposure to the shock wave energy. The initial shock wave of very high pressure is followed closely by a "secondary wind," which is a huge volume of displaced air flooding back into the area, again under high pressure. It is these sudden and extreme differences in pressures, and associated dispersal of secondary projectiles, which can lead to significant neurological, skeletal, or soft tissue injury. While a comprehensive review of IEDs and their increasing utilization in armed conflict, beginning with the Belarusian Rail War in World War II extending through their current use by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan, are beyond the intent of this section, its inclusion as a wounding source for modern craniomaxillofacial injuries is warranted.

# 27.3.2 Injury Patterns and Associated Injuries

Hollier retrospectively evaluated 84 patients with facial gunshot injuries [32]. Sixty-seven percent of these patients suffered facial fractures, of which  $75\%$  received surgical treatment of these injuries. Twenty-one percent

of these patients required emergent tracheostomy for airway control, all of which had injury in the lower one-third of the face. Fourteen percent of patients had great vessel injury that was diagnosed with angiography, of which  $50\%$  required surgical treatment (1 in 12 was managed by embolization in the radiology suite). Other associated injuries included eye  $(31\%)$ , brain  $(18\%)$ , and tongue  $(13\%)$ . Facial fracture distribution included zygoma  $(35\%)$ , mandible  $(30\%)$ , orbit  $(26\%)$ , skull  $(21\%)$ , and nasoethmoid  $(11.9\%)$  [32]. An evaluation of 54 gunshot wound patients by Kihtir revealed central nervous system injuries in  $22\%$ , orbital involvement in  $40\%$ , and midfacial involvement in  $38\%$  of the patients in their dataset. The most common fractures were the maxilla  $(41\%)$  and the mandible  $(28\%)$ . Vascular injury was present in 5 of 54  $(9\%)$  as determined by angiography for these individuals [60]. Lew reported the incidence of penetrating soft tissue injuries and fractures for American military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan was  $58\%$  and  $27\%$ , respectively, with  $76\%$  of the fractures being open [61]. The location of the facial fractures in descending order of incidence was mandible  $(36\%)$ , maxilla/zygoma  $(19\%)$ , nasal  $(14\%)$ , and orbit  $(11\%)$ . The remaining  $20\%$  were not otherwise specified, with the primary mechanism of injury involving missile injuries from improvised explosive devices  $(84\%)$  [61]. As previously noted, Tan completed an experimental study in dogs in which simulated gunshot injuries were induced and vascular tissue subsequently was studied using angiography, high-speed X-ray photography, and light and electron microscopy following injury. Tan found microthrombus formation, vascular endothelial loss, and necrosis as far as  $3\mathrm{cm}$  from the wound margin

[53]. Despite the extent of soft tissue injuries sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the ongoing civilian gunshot wound experience in the USA, Loos recently lamented the lack of standardized, controlled clinical studies highlighting the complexity of evaluating the progression of soft tissue injury for traumatically injured tissues in the "zone of injury," and the impact on proposed microvascular and/or pedicled tissue transfer [62].

# Important Points

The permanent cavity is the site of initial permanent tissue destruction  
- Deformation of the projectile after impacting hard tissues causes an increase in the size of the permanent cavity  
After striking bone, fragmentation of the projectile and/or bone can result in the formation of numerous secondary projectiles each producing additional wounding potential, enlarging the size of the permanent cavity  
The ultimate fate and compositional makeup of the projectile is more important than its velocity or caliber  
- Soft tissue injuries inherent in ballistic trauma may exhibit avulsive loss, sequential necrosis over days to weeks, and compromised vascularity negating/ delaying potential microvascular or pedicled soft tissue reconstruction

# 27.4 Acute Care Considerations

As evidenced by the absolute priority highlighted in the Emergency War Surgery manual and the American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course, the primary focus in the immediate posttrauma period is securing the airway [37, 63]. The rapid assessment for signs of airway obstruction in the trauma patient should focus on evaluation for potential foreign bodies, and facial, mandibular, or tracheal/laryngeal fractures, which may result in airway obstruction. Ballistic injuries to the face, head, and neck have direct bearing on ATLS protocols involving initial assessment and primary management of the airway as bony instability and substantial bleeding from the abundant vasculature of the facial and great vessels of the neck often accompany these injuries. The presence of catastrophic wounds to the craniomaxillofacial complex may also serve as a distraction to emergency medical service personnel, focusing their attention away from potentially life-threatening injuries and wasting valuable time, which could be better used for treatment of potentially lethal injuries, stabilization, and preparation for transport.

# 27.4.1 Airway Management

As previously mentioned, Hollier found  $21\%$  of facial gunshot injury patients required emergent tracheostomy for airway control, all of which involved injuries to the lower one-third of the face [32]. Kihtir's review of 54 civilian gunshot wounds found  $33\%$  (18 of 54) requiring urgent airway control with the following distribution: orotracheal intubation  $(24\%)$  of total patients [13 of 54] and  $72\%$  [13 of 18] of patients requiring airway management), cricothyroidotomy  $(4\%)$  of total patients [2 of 54] and  $11\%$  of airway control patients), tracheostomy  $(4\%)$  of total patients [2 of 54] and  $11\%$  of airway control patients), and nasotracheal intubation  $(2\%)$  of total patients [1 of 54] and  $6\%$  of airway control patients) [60]. Airway compromise is usually secondary to edema in close approximation to the airway, but may also be due to loss of structural integrity to the anterior region of the mandible (Fig 27.12a, b). On an urgent basis, manually supporting collapsed segments of the mandible and base of tongue attachments may quickly resolve posterior airway collapse, as can patient repositioning. Forward traction on the tongue and/or anterior collapsed mandible can be accomplished by the use of a

towel clip or large-gauge suture material passed through the tongue or tissue in the symphysis region. Mask ventilation is unlikely to be very successful for patients with injuries to the lower third of the face and may introduce air emphysema into tissue. The use of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways may provide some temporary benefit; however, endotracheal intubation is still the emergency airway of choice when partial or complete obstruction is present and the patient displays a diminished level of consciousness or obvious evidence of respiratory distress/impending respiratory failure. The challenges encountered intubating a patient with a ballistic injury to the lower third of the face should not be underestimated as edema, bleeding, and macerated soft tissues may completely obscure the airway. The use of surgical cricothyroidotomy should be considered, although this maneuver should be accomplished by the most experienced surgeon available, as by definition, an emergent cricothyroidotomy should be considered one of the final acts to secure an airway, not the first in the sequence of airway establishment. After successful tracheal intubation, the determination for a surgical tracheostomy to minimize interferences for the reconstruction of the dental occlusion will need to be

made. If prolonged intubation is expected based on the nature or severity of the craniomaxillofacial injuries, or concomitant intracranial injury, consideration should be given to early elective tracheostomy [32, 34, 60]. If multiple staged surgical procedures are anticipated, the lower third of the face has been injured, or the presence of extensive soft tissue injuries of the tongue, floor of mouth, submandibular triangles, and neck exist, serious consideration for elective tracheostomy should be given. Recent literature reports by Mahon and others advocate the use of either the submental or submandibular intubation techniques should the determination be made the patient will not require long-term ventilator support, and the indication for tracheostomy is primarily due to minimize occlusal interference [64].

# 27.4.2 Hemorrhage Management

Hemorrhage control, especially in close approximation to the airway, is a critical step to improve airway patency and to maintain normal hemodynamic status. Hemostasis can be accomplished by a variety of measures including the use of pressure to stop acute hemorrhage, suctioning to clear accumulated blood and enhance the surgeon's ability to identify and ligate, clamp, or cauterize bleeding vessels. In cases with difficulty in achieving primary hemostasis, application of pressure in conjunction with hemostatic dressings such as QuikClot™ or Combat-Gauze™, kaolin-impregnated gauze dressings used extensively by combat medics in Iraq and Afghanistan (Z-Medica Corporation, Wallingford CT), can establish a significant reduction, or elimination, of high-volume vascular bleeding without the risks of distal emboli previously encountered with other hemostatic agents [65–67]. Blind clamping is discouraged in the head and neck region due to the proximity of motor/sensory nerves or other specialized components such as salivary ducts, suspensory ligaments, and previously uninjured vascular structures, which may suffer iatrogenic injury. Active hemorrhage from the head/neck region may require image-guided embolization or surgical access for proximal vessel ligation to control bleeding not responsive to other more immediately available, and less invasive measures. If major vessel injury is suspected based on entrance and/or exit wounds or based on expanding mass effect in tissues of the face or neck, then radiographic evaluation of the vascular components of the neck via angiography is indicated. Hemodynamic status must be assessed and managed as necessary, with appropriate fluid resuscitation and blood component replacement. An important clinical point to remember is once the patient's hypovolemia has been corrected, and mean arterial pressure has

been stabilized, areas of head/neck hemorrhage previously controlled may begin to actively bleed again [38]. The importance of ongoing evaluation cannot be understated as reports of second or multiple gunshot injuries can be as high as  $36\%$ , and the patient could easily be undergoing an exploratory laparotomy or thoracic procedure with the head/neck region obscured from view, allowing the blood loss to continue unabated and unrecognized [32, 34]. The presence of a devastating craniomaxillofacial ballistic injury may often paralyze less experienced trauma care staff or emergency medical personnel, drawing attention from other potential life-threatening sites of injury.

# 27.5 Management of Gunshot Wounds to the Face

Life-threatening hemorrhage is unusual in civilian gunshot injuries to the head and neck. Low-velocity handgun injuries typically do not involve the great vessels. Demetriades and colleagues in Los Angeles reported only  $7.5\%$  of patients with isolated gunshot wounds to the face to be in shock upon admission (systolic blood pressure  $< 90 \, \mathrm{mmHg}$ ). In their report, 70 patients  $(28.3\%$  of the total) required angiography, and 10 of these required embolization [68]. Overall, the literature reports angiography in  $17 - 63\%$  of patients with a GSW to the face, with positive findings in  $15 - 51\%$ . Indications for angiography include expanding hematoma and bleeding that persists despite local measures [69-71]. The most commonly involved vessels in these cases were the maxillary and facial arteries. Gunshot injuries associated with high-velocity weapons or fractures, however, can result in significant blood loss. Initial attempts to control hemorrhage in the emergency department center on direct pressure and packing. Blind clamping should be avoided because of the attendant risk of damage to other structures. Standard methods for epistaxis control such as Foley catheters or specially designed balloon catheters will control most midface bleeding. In cases of mandible fractures, a temporary reduction in the fracture may be required. Penetrating injuries can require that the surgeon make difficult choices. Injuries at the skull base may benefit from angiography and embolization (see "Penetrating Neck Injuries," below). Unfortunately, the time necessary to mobilize the angiography suite often makes this an impossible choice for the unstable trauma patient in the middle of the night. For this reason, control of life-threatening hemorrhage is typically best performed in the operating room. Ligation of multiple vessels is required. "Tying off" the carotid is usually ineffectual and dangerous; an attempt should be made to control specific vessels. Lacerations

![](images/0575b9ab2dd42f930105985c5396ac3cf283e61206357315e9e59c1b142ada0a.jpg)  
Fig.27.13 Zones of the neck

of the internal jugular artery are best controlled with ligation or repair. Packing and reduction of fractures should be performed to control bleeding from the midface if possible. There is a possibility of late pseudoaneurysm formation and delayed hemorrhage, and selective angiography should be performed as indicated. Additionally, the possibility of bullet or fragment embolization should be considered.

Gunshot wounds involving the face may be associated with an entrance or exit wound in the neck, which is divided into three zones originally described by Monson and colleagues from Cook County Hospital

# ( Fig. 27.13) [72]:

Zone I is most commonly defined as the area from the clavicles to the cricoid cartilage. It contains the inferior aspect of the trachea and esophagus along with the major vessels of the thoracic inlet: the common carotid arteries, thyrocervical trunk, internal jugular veins, brachiocephalic trunk, subclavian arteries and veins, thoracic duct, thyroid gland, and spinal cord. Risk of injury to the great vessels is common in this area, and consequently, injuries to zone I carry a high mortality rate (approximately  $12\%$ ). Some authors place the junction of zones I and II at the cricoid cartilage, whereas others define it as being at the top of the clavicles.  
Zone II represents the area from the cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible. It contains the common carotid arteries, internal and external carotid arteries, internal jugular veins, larynx, hypopharynx, and cranial nerves X, XI, and XII. It is the largest area and therefore the most commonly involved zone in penetrating neck trauma.  
Zone III spans the region from the skull base to the angle of the mandible. It contains the carotid arteries, the internal jugular veins, and the pharynx along with multiple cranial nerves exiting the skull base. It

should be appreciated that gunshot wounds that involve mandibular fractures are accompanied by injuries to zone III.

Van As and colleagues reported on 116 patients shot in the neck in South Africa. Of these, 70 suffered a direct hit to the neck; in 46 patients, the bullet traversed the face or chest first. Of the 116 patients, 85 suffered some vascular injury, although most were minor branches, 61 had some injury to the airway, and 32 had an injury to the pharynx or esophagus [37]. Many patients had more than one injury. Management strategies for penetrating neck injuries are typically based on the zone(s) involved [73, 74]. Gunshot wounds to the head and neck frequently involve projectiles that traverse or involve more than one zone. For this reason, surgeons may have to modify management plans based on the situation at hand. Although a complete discussion of penetrating neck trauma is beyond the scope of this chapter, general principles should be understood by surgeons managing facial gunshot injuries.

Tremendous variation exists in the literature, and within the confines of this Nation's Trauma Centers, regarding the most appropriate management protocol for the treatment of ballistic injuries to the craniomaxillofacial complex. Single-stage versus multiple-stage procedures or complex extensive early reconstruction versus initial débridement and/or closed reduction with subsequent later revision surgeries are but several of the management philosophies supported. Numerous authors advocate a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of the more complex of these injuries [32, 34, 74-77]. Although not specifically mentioned by some authors, either due to egotism or institutional/specialty-derived pride, it is unlikely a single surgical specialty can appropriately manage the myriad of surgical subspecialty level injuries sustained in complex ballistic injuries to the craniomaxillofacial region. Multidisciplinary care within a tertiary care center is a must in all but the most simple gunshot injuries involving the head and neck. Plastic surgery, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, interventional radiology, neurosurgery, trauma surgery, general and/or maxillofacial prosthodontist, and subspecialty microsurgical care are often indicated for these individuals, as well as other evaluation and management based on an individual patient's injuries including occupational/physical therapy, nutritional medicine, and behavioral science/mental health. Adequate nutritional support is often delayed in the management of ballistic injuries to the face. Once interruption of normal oral feeding has been identified for any length of time secondary to lower face, floor of mouth, or neck involvement, consideration should also be given to early gastrostomy tube placement, generally

in conjunction with a planned anesthetic for debridement, early reconstructive treatment, or surgical tracheostomy. For all facial gunshot injuries, and any complex craniomaxillofacial trauma case regardless of etiology, consideration must be given to a comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation. Hollier found  $31\%$  of patients experienced some form of ocular injury, and  $54\%$  of those patients had ongoing residual visual problems [32]. Hollier's recommended protocol includes careful evaluation of ophthalmologic status before any surgical intervention to ensure injury-associated visual disturbance is properly documented. Cho reported  $32.7\%$  of patients with ballistic intracranial injuries sustained concomitant ocular injuries [78]. Both Cho and Hollier encourage ongoing ophthalmologic evaluation to monitor for traumatic optic neuropathy, specifically subtle decreases in visual acuity and loss of red color perception may indicate progressive swelling of the optic nerve that is attributable to the initial injury. Based on these findings, surgical repair of facial fractures is often delayed to minimize the progression of this optic nerve edema [32].

The concept of debridement is well established in the literature and a critical component in the management of these ballistic injuries [34, 60, 76, 77]. Serial washouts and débridement of tissue have become mainstays for craniomaxillofacial trauma surgeons in the treatment of these injuries. Unfortunately for many surgeons, the term débridement is synonymous with the absolute removal of tissue in the operating room. While devitalized necrotic tissue does require excision, a more accurate definition of the goal of serial washouts should be decontamination. Preservation of all viable tissues is a critical component in the management of gunshot wounds to the maxillofacial region. Once tissues are lost, the surgeon is faced with two choices: compromise anterior-posterior projection to allow for primary closure of native tissue, or transfer additional tissue to the region via pedicled or microvascular grafts. Avoidance of the need for tissue transfer should be the goal, and judicious use of the practice of decontamination will assist in achieving the desired results.

# 27.5.1 Soft and Hard Tissue Involvement

Before the initiation of surgical reconstruction of ballistic craniomaxillofacial injuries, an absolute understanding of the extent of the injuries, and any functional and physiologic deficits, is necessary. A critical mistake in the management of these disorders is the prevalent desire among the surgical team to provide definitive reconstructive care to the patient in an expedited manner. Rushing the patient to the operating room without

a goal-oriented sequential surgical plan, nor having accomplished the necessary preoperative treatment planning or required medical/surgical specialty consultations, will undoubtedly lead to a less than desirable surgical result. Evaluation of the soft tissues in the maxillofacial region is accomplished by direct observation and evaluation of the clinical response to serial decontamination/débridement. The accuracy of this appraisal is compromised by edema, which often distorts the remaining tissue, artificially increasing volume assessment, and masking the true tissue deficit present. Cellular soft tissue damage persists and progresses for several weeks, ultimately affecting the quantity, and quality, of soft tissue remaining after completion of healing [34, 77]. Before bony reconstruction occurs, appropriate imaging is necessary to clearly define the magnitude and nature of the fractured segments. Computed tomography with three-dimensional reformatting is essential for obtaining this information [34]. Axial and coronal tomography imaging also provides these data, but the three-dimensional reconstructions improve the conceptualization of the size and location of the fractured segments and their relationship with one another, which improves the ability to localize and reposition the segments intraoperatively. The accuracy, and clarity, of three-dimensional reconstruction has significantly increased during the past decade and should now be part of the standard workup for the management of complex ballistic craniomaxillofacial trauma. Stereolithographic models, extremely accurate acrylic resin representations of the computed tomography scans, can be used for presurgical planning and prefabrication of surgical reconstruction plates, increasing the accuracy of the reconstruction while decreasing time in the operative theater. The ultimate treatment goal for casualties with ballistic facial injuries is the restoration of function and cosmesis. Many patients injured by ballistic projectiles have significant avulsive defects of craniomaxillofacial structures. A vitally important aspect of treating avulsive defects is using appropriate imaging to develop a staged reconstruction plan with the final endpoint in mind before any reconstruction begins. Items for consideration when reviewing the soft tissues, radiographic studies, and stereolithography models are as follows [34, 77] (Fig. 27.14a, b):

# 27.5.2 Bone and Soft Tissue Reconstruction

The various bony and soft tissue reconstruction options for tissue replacement are covered in detail in other chapters within this book, and are beyond the scope of this discussion and will not be repeated within this section. Concepts consistent with the principles of bone and soft tissue reconstruction will be addressed, with representative citations included for further review. Controversy regarding the timing and extent of reconstruction exists largely because outcomes for catastrophic facial ballistic injuries are uniformly disappointing, regardless of the treatment chosen. At a minimum, at the time of the initial surgical treatment, the remaining bone segments should be reduced and stabilized with some form of fixation as guided by preoperative imaging and intraoperative evaluation. External fixation with closed reduction obviates the need for elevation of the periosteum, which is a necessary component for the application of rigid internal fixation. The elevation of periosteum, especially in the presence of comminution and multiple small bone fragments, compromises the vascular supply, which potentially may lead to resorption, volume loss, or necrosis [53, 61]. Maxillomandibular fixation is necessary when the tooth-bearing portion of the maxilla or mandible is involved and should be applied early to ensure that the occlusion is properly restored. Care should be taken in the application of arch bars in the presence of a comminuted mandible fracture as often encountered with ballistic injuries. Overtightening of the wires may lead to lateral displacement of the mandibular angles bilaterally, excessively widening the patient's facial profile and losing the angu

The use of dental impressions to fabricate surgical splints can likewise be complicated by the presence of complex maxillary and mandibular fractures, and loss of normal dental arch anatomy. A widened dental arch form, often produced in the laboratory by plaster models lacking definitive bony support and skeletal references, may result in inadequate anterior projection of the maxilla and zygomatic arches bilaterally, resulting in a patient profile potentially flattened and wide [34, 71]. Avulsion or loss of hard and soft tissue volume should always be identified before the initiation of reconstructive surgery, as a strategy must be in place for the early, or delayed, replacement of this tissue. Possibilities include immediate microvascular or pedicled tissue transfer to the area covering bone, obturation of a defect, or to provide a vascular bed for a projected bone graft to the site. The ideal time for identifying soft tissue, and potential hard tissue, volume loss is after stabilization of the bony skeleton. Residual continuity, or volume deficits, should be detectable at this stage, affording proper planning for potential tissue transfer procedures preoperatively. In this manner, you can obtain proper consent, prep, drape, and position the patient properly, and have present all of the instrumentation and personnel that will be necessary to complete the tissue transfer.

Multiple authors advocate immediate, or early reconstruction, with vascularized free or pedicled tissue transfers, believing these procedures minimize scar formation of soft tissue into bony defects, or the development of wound contracture, which is difficult to subsequently repair [32, 75, 77-88]. While clinical and research experience supports the potential for immediate tissue transfer if indicated by the presence of acute tissue loss, the appropriate utilization of this technique involves accurate determination of tissue transfer needs, and the viability of the recipient bed. Manson reported high-energy ballistic wounds to the craniomaxillofacial

region may exhibit progressive necrosis, similar to those injuries seen in electrical burns, compromising the small-vessel anastomosis required for microvascular transfer, as well as the margins of the recipient bed for a pedicled flap [76]. As previously referred to, Tan's study involved the completion of microvascular anastomoses for small vessels at the ballistic wound site bed [53]. The anastomoses were completed at various times following injury, and the short-term success of these anastomoses was evaluated. Tan found repairs completed 3 days or later following injury best maintained their patency, confirming the belief of Manson regarding the need for sequential decontamination/debridement procedures to effectively afford the recipient tissues to have achieved the desired state of healing to support the transfer of tissues to the site [34, 53, 76]. Other authors advocate less surgically aggressive approaches to ballistic injuries, opting for decontamination/débridement, closed or open reduction in fractures, and secondary reconstruction of residual defects using autogenous bone grafting with or without delayed tissue transfer [33, 60, 74]. This form of treatment is best applied to low-energy injuries, or injuries with minimal-to-no tissue loss as when used for midfacial or complex avulsive injuries, cosmetic and functional results may be suboptimal. Delayed reconstruction of these catastrophically injured patients is complicated by the scarring and wound contracture, which will undoubtedly occur in the aftermath of a gunshot injury. Although implied, but not specifically emphasized in the literature outlining complex tissue transfer reconstructions, an indispensable role for the thorough decontamination/débridement of foreign material from the wound site exists, coupled with proper anatomic reduction and stabilization of the fractured segments with salvage/preservation of the remaining native soft and hard tissues. Even the most ambitious reconstructions require these necessary initial steps for optimization of the recipient site upon which reconstruction is planned.

Additional authors have advocated the use of distraction osteogenesis or other tissue traction for replacement of hard and soft tissue loss to facial gunshot injuries [89, 90]. Shvyrkov reported on 33 males with 3-to 8-cm bone and soft tissue defects of the mandible initially managed by debridement and "collapsing" the residual mandibular segments into the defect, utilizing a transport disk distraction technique to generate bone and soft tissue across the osseous gap [89]. Twenty-eight of these patients had distraction completed immediately following injury, and five patients had their distraction completed after the initial gunshot injury had healed. According to the authors, all 33 patients had acceptable functional and esthetic outcomes within  $3 - 4\frac{1}{2}$  months of reconstruction [89]. The advantage to this procedure

is obvious, bone and soft tissue volume is restored without transferring tissue from a remote site, preventing the morbidity associated with harvest, and preventing the mismatch of tissue characteristics inherent with distant tissue transfer. While the rationale and results of this reported technique are exciting, it should be noted a comprehensive review of the English and non-English literature was unable to discover use of this technique for ballistic injuries by other authors. Herford, however, has successfully published on the regeneration of four mandibular body defects secondary to pathological ablations and isolated trauma defects with distraction osteogenesis, reporting effective hard and soft tissue generation across traumatically compromised/irradiated tissue beds [90–93]. Non-immediate reconstruction with vascularized pedicled or microvascular tissue transfer has also been described [94–104]. Because gunshot injuries frequently have tissue loss secondary to either avulsion and/or necrosis, the replacement of tissue is necessary. In areas where the soft tissue is adequate, free-bone grafting may be all that is necessary to restore facial form and function. Inadequate soft tissue volume can sometimes be expanded, using standard soft tissue expansion techniques [105, 106]. After adequate soft tissue expansion, progression to the bone grafting procedure to reconstruct missing osseous elements, or the placement of custom patient fabricated surgical implants can occur, depending on the location of the defect [107]. Pedicled and free microvascular composite grafts are other accepted, and generally highly successful, options of replacing moderate or large volumes of hard and soft tissue. A summary evaluation of the current literature indicates the trend is toward early definitive reconstruction of missing hard and soft tissue using vascularized tissue transfer techniques as composite grafts or in association with free-bone grafts. A key consideration of this method of treatment is to have re-established the bony projection and angular shape of the facial skeleton as soon as possible, but definitively within 10–14 days, before the development of intractable facial scarring and contracture, or the formation of soft/hard tissue infection [34, 76].

# 27.6 Postoperative Complications

As described independently by Manson, Powers, and others, the most common complication associated with ballistic injury management in the craniomaxillofacial region is delay in definitive soft/hard tissue reconstruction with the subsequent development of a flattened, wide face as the tremendous forces of facial scarring and wound contracture alter the facial composite [34, 76, 80, 88]. Once facial soft tissue scarring and wound contrac

ture have matured, and the underlying bony architecture has remodeled, the opportunity to recreate any semblance of normal facial form, contour, and projection is lost. As eloquently stated by Dr. Paul Manson on many occasions, the best opportunity to achieve a satisfactory reconstruction of a ballistic facial wound is the first opportunity [76]. Hollier reported the following postoperative complication rates: cranial nerve palsy (19%), blindness (17%), hemiparesis (12%), visual disturbance (12%), wound dehiscence (4.7%), generalized sepsis (2.4%), and epiphora (2.4%) [32].

Damage to the facial nerve is present in only  $3 - 6\%$  of civilian GSWs to the face [60, 68]. This is most likely because low-energy weapons are involved in most of these cases. However, such damage is not uncommon in injuries inflicted by higher-velocity firearms. Careful documentation at the earliest possible opportunity is important. If a functioning nerve becomes nonfunctional secondary to swelling, the surgeon can be reasonably confident that the function will return. An obvious transection of the nerve requires repair. In heavily contaminated wounds, repair should be delayed for 48-72 hours, given the possibility that grafts will be required to span damaged segments. Beyond 72 hours, distal branches of the facial nerve will not respond to a nerve stimulator, making their identification difficult. If possible, tagging the branches with suture at the initial surgery is invaluable. Extensive damage to the proximal nerve may require a temporal bone dissection to identify a viable proximal nerve for grafting. Injuries distal to a line dropped vertically from the lateral canthus (zone of arborization) do not typically require repair because of the multiple interconnections distal to this line and the reasonable expectation of return of function, even if the nerve is temporarily nonfunctioning. Any persistent facial nerve paresis beyond 60-90 days requires evaluation by a surgeon familiar with facial nerve grafting/ reanimation techniques.

As the majority of gunshot wounds affect otherwise healthy patients, generally males, nutritional status becomes an issue only in patients whose injuries preclude oral alimentation for an extended period (greater than 4 or 5 days). Feeding via nasogastric intubation allows bypass of the oral cavity and improved hygiene in the early days following injury. Consideration should be given to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy if long-term bypass of the oral cavity is necessary, the patient will be unable to eat, or the patient has a preexisting nutritional deficit. Other isolated complications reported were cerebral vascular accident, speech difficulty, cerebrospinal fluid leak, facial nerve palsy, seroma, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and ptosis of the upper eyelid [32]. Kassan reported a postoperative infection rate, or "sepsis" of  $19\%$ , which is

a higher figure than reported by other authors, primarily associated with comminuted low-energy handgun wounds [33]. Kassan also noted similar rates of neurologic and ocular complications as were described by Hollier and Cho, in addition to restricted mandibular range of motion [32, 33, 78]. Other authors describe similar rates of complications listed above, especially infection and ophthalmologic compromise [108, 109]. The higher incidence of ocular injuries is also seen in the presence of IEDs in modern military action and terrorist attacks, as Gataa reported a  $29\%$  ocular injury rate for civilian craniomaxillofacial wounds primarily caused by IED blasts [110]. Kihtir reported  $9.3\%$  (5/54) of ballistic injury patients experienced coincident palatal injuries acutely, and were treated by receiving only limited early surgical management at a large metropolitan hospital in New York City [60]. Oronasal fistulas developed in two of these patients after healing, for a complication rate of  $13\%$ . Eight of the 54 patients received closed reduction in their mandible fractures, one resulting in nonunion. One mandibular fracture patient was treated with open reduction and internal fixation, subsequently developing osteomyelitis, although the reported algorithm from this study encouraged delayed treatment and management of all maxillary, orbital, and zygomatic fractures without reduction, which may be a component of the elevated complication rates [60].

Sherman reported a case of carotid-cavernous sinus fistula developing after a severe midfacial gunshot injury [111]. Although a rare complication of craniomaxillofacial trauma, this trauma-induced pathologic entity, which matures between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, may result in retinopathy, optic atrophy, blindness, or fatal epistaxis. The characteristic findings associated with carotid-cavernous sinus fistula include chemosis, pulsatile exophthalmos, and supraorbital bruit. If suspected by physical examination or clinical response, computed tomography (CT) angiography is the accepted practice for confirmation of the presence of this condition, which is treated in coordination with vascular surgery or interventional radiology with ligation of the internal carotid, embolization, or, in some circumstances, observation [99].

Tattooing attributable to material incorporated into the wound at the time of injury can be minimized or eliminated with the use of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser [34]. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser should not be used to remove tattooing that is attributable to dermal inclusions of gunpowder, which is shot into the skin at close range. Fusade et al. found that laser use on these individuals induced bleeding transdermal pits, which subsequently scarred in a pox-like fashion with spreading of the pigment into the skin surrounding the initial areas of the tattoo [112]. The theory is laser energy was trans

ferred to the gunpowder causing "microexplosions," subsequently leading to the observed tissue damage. Early dermabrasion has been suggested as a mechanism for the prevention of gunpowder tattooing [34, 113]. Pallua suggests dermabrasion for the removal of embedded gunpowder should ideally be completed within the first 6 hours following gunshot injury and never later than 72 hours following injury (Fig. 27.15a, b) [114]. For later gunpowder tattoos or deeper penetration of powder, the recommended treatment is the use of a mini-punch excision technique for the removal of these remnants, as described by Kaufmann and Will [34, 115]. Although time-consuming, it is technically simple to do and yields superior esthetic results without excessive removal of uninvolved tissue. Many of the techniques used for immediate, early, and secondary reconstruction can also be used for the management of complications.

# Conclusion

Craniomaxillofacial ballistic injuries pose incredible challenges to the facial trauma surgeon, offering the opportunity for a tremendously rewarding, or emotionally draining, personal and operative experience. Technological advances in surgical hardware manufacture, radiological imaging capability, and improved

operative techniques have afforded the facial trauma surgeon the tools necessary to accomplish the primary goal of surgical treatment, returning these injured patients to a reasonable level of esthetics, form, and function, allowing them to integrate back into society. While the catastrophic nature of these injuries places obvious limits on what can be realistically achieved, continuously striving for surgical excellence should remain the focus of all surgical interventions. This is best accomplished by a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, identification of injured and noninjured tissues, an understanding of the functional and anatomic limitations imposed by the wounds, and a clarity of purpose and rationale for the proposed reconstructive procedures.
