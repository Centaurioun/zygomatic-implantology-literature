# Learning Aims

1. Patient evaluation and selection is critical to successful rhytidectomy procedures.  
2. There are many different surgical options, each with indications and special considerations.  
3. It is important to understand the potential complications of rhytidectomy procedures, both for patient education and for management and correction.

# 74.1 Introduction

Rhytidectomy, or face-lift surgery, has received significant attention over the past several decades owing to increasing patient demands for a more youthful appearance. Facial aesthetic surgery has become more commonplace and socially acceptable, with rhytidectomy as the foundation of these facial rejuvenation procedures. Consistent improvements in surgical outcomes have been the result of a greater understanding of the aging process, along with complex facial anatomy. The face undergoes harmonious changes in the facial skeleton, deep soft tissue elements, and skin texture during the aging process. Dissection of cadavers has identified facial ligaments, muscle expansions, and dissection planes that give us a better understanding of facial aging and rejuvenation. Perhaps more important, it has also been the catalyst for the evolution of a variety of face-lifting techniques. The goal of facial rejuvenation should be to address all components of aging, leaving the patient with a younger-appearing face and a long-lasting result. If this is accomplished, the patient's face and neck will continue to age harmoniously [1].

Critical evaluation of early techniques and a clear understanding of surgical anatomy have provided insight into the perils and pitfalls of surgical rejuvenation of the face and have resulted in the complexity of various rhytidectomy techniques. Today, rhytidectomy is one of the most frequently performed aesthetic surgical procedures in the United States.

Numerous techniques are currently used for performing face-lifts but no general agreement as to which of these techniques is most effective [2]; facial aesthetic surgeons have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of superficial and deep face-lifts for many years. A clear consensus is difficult because patient variables such as past medical history, anatomy, genetic background, social history (e.g., smoking and alcohol), motivation to have aesthetic surgery, and environment make it virtually impossible to perform a blinded long-term prospective clinical study. Evaluation of facial aesthetic surgery is also difficult because most procedures yield satisfactory results initially, often producing enough improvement to be accepted as a good result.

# 74.2 History

Although doubt still exists as to who performed the first face-lift, most authorities date the procedure to the early part of the twentieth century [3-13]. Historically, rhytidectomy procedures may be divided into three main categories: skin excision, subcutaneous undermining, and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) manipulation. Early rhytidectomy procedures were limited to skin excision and wound closure without any appreciable subcutaneous undermining [3, 4, 8-10, 14]. Beginning in the late 1920s, the conventional face-lift operation, consisting of skin dissection with subcutaneous undermining, was established [13].

The subcutaneous rhytidectomy was the preferred technique for many years. A small amount of subcutaneous tissue is elevated with the skin and is simply redraped, leaving the patient with less redundancy. However, this technique does not address underlying skeletal deformities, ptotic deep soft tissue structures, or changes in skin texture. Therefore, it usually results in a more unnatural look and increases the likelihood of complications, particularly skin slough.

In an attempt to improve the results obtained with the subcutaneous face-lift, several clinicians described techniques to correct platysmal banding and submental lipomatosis [15-18]. The third historic category came with the advent of SMAS manipulation. Multiple surgeons have described various techniques involving the SMAS and platysma to enhance cervicofacial rhytidectomy [1, 19-35]. In 1974, Skoog [19] described a procedure based on surgical anatomy. At that time, the subdermal plane was accepted by most to be the anatomic limit for face-lifting and rejuvenation. Skoog's technique redraped the skin and platysma together, leaving the patient with a more youthful jaw line.

Subsequently Mitz and Peyronie's description of the SMAS [21] provided an anatomic basis for restoration of the face. Rohrich provides detailed anatomic descriptions of the midface, which dictate differential treatment of the SMAS layer. The differential treatment includes SMAS-stacking (imbrication) versus SMAS-ectomy (plication). Selection of which technique to use, along with the vector of anchorage, should be a result of perioperative analysis and will have a direct influence on resultant facial symmetry and fullness [36-38].

Hamra [35] (initially with the deep-plane and later with the composite rhytidectomy) and, later, Owsley [39] (with the multiplanar/multivector approach) modified and improved Skoog's technique by performing a more complete release of the nasolabial fold. Ramirez [40] showed that after subperiosteal release, the soft tissues of the cheek, forehead, jowls, lateral canthus, and eyebrows can be restored to their youthful relationship with the underlying skeleton. Finally, Watson and colleagues

[41] described a technique similar to that of Owsley, but combined it with laser resurfacing. This technique involved a larger plane of subdermal or subcutaneous undermining than that described by Hamra.

Four generations of rhytidectomy techniques are recognized (▶ Box 74.1) [42]. More recent literature has popularized more complex procedures including the deep-plane and composite rhytidectomies [1, 34, 35, 43]. These methods have incorporated multiplanar dissections and craniofacial techniques in an attempt to gain better control of the midface soft tissues. Multiple authors have cautioned that the more complex deep-plane and composite rhytidectomies typically carry increased morbidity [1, 44, 45-51].

I Subcutaneous dissection only with variable skin undermining

II Subcutaneous dissection + SMAS plication or imbrication

III Subcutaneous dissection + SMAS plication or imbrication + deep midface section dissection

IV Composite dissection

SMAS superficial musculoaponeurotic system

As a counter movement to the more complex and invasive deep-plane and composite rhytidectomies, there has been interest and development of minimally invasive techniques. Such techniques can offer shorter operation times, less complications, and potential for procedures to be performed under local anesthesia. In the late 90s, Sulamanidze introduced the thread lift, which involved placement of subcutaneous barbed threads, which were subsequently pulled and secured to achieve a lifted appearance [52]. Although less invasive and time-consuming, this procedure has not shown to be as effective long term. One study resulted in only one-third of the patients maintaining  $70\%$  of the original surgical outcomes at 1-2 years post surgery [53].

Another minimally invasive technique—the S-Lift—was described by Saylan, and involved an S-shaped incision at the helical root, and vertical sutures in the SMAS secured to the periosteum in the zygomatic arch [54]. This technique was altered by Tonnard and Verpaele in 2002 and renamed the Minimal Access Cranial Suspension Lift (MACS Lift). Their modification was to make the incision to follow the border of the sideburn and place the sutures into the temporal fascia instead of the zygomatic arch [55]. This MACS lift technique has since been widely published and is commonly performed today as a less invasive, short-scar rhytidectomy technique.

# 74.3 Patient Evaluation

When a rhytidectomy is being contemplated, the treatment requirements of the surgeon must be balanced with the desires of the patient (Table 74.1) [56]. These requirements are critical for proper patient selection. The patient evaluation must include general medical and psychological considerations in addition to physical facial features. Neglect of any aspect of the patient evaluation can lead to future problems [57].

A thorough medical evaluation must be completed before surgery. Medical illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and asthma must be appropriately treated and controlled preoperatively. Medical evaluation is essential for detecting conditions that may adversely affect a patient's ability to tolerate an anesthetic or that may compromise the final surgical result. Appropriate consultations regarding cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, coagulopathies, and other active medical problems should be obtained preoperatively. Current medication profiles should be elicited, including aspirin and aspirin-containing compounds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and herbal drugs, as well as high doses of vitamin E. Examination of prior surgical incisions, such as those resulting from previous thyroidectomies or parotidectomies, is useful in evaluating the wound-healing capacity.

Tobacco and alcohol use, as well as the use of illicit substances, may increase the incidence of surgical complications. Cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and previous head and neck radiation therapy may also impede healing and should be recognized preoperatively. Patients should be told that cigarette smoking significantly increases the likelihood of skin flap necrosis, poor healing, and unsightly scars [58, 59]. Studies have

demonstrated a 12-fold greater risk of skin slough in smokers than in nonsmokers [60, 61]. Animal studies involving skin flap experiments have also supported this conclusion [62, 63].

A review of the patient's psychological history should focus on motivation for surgery and outcome expectations. Patients seeking surgery based on recent emotional events or with unrealistic expectations should be further counseled and the procedure postponed or cancelled [64, 65].

The goal of face-lifting is to correct anatomic changes to the face and neck that have occurred as a result of the normal aging process. Patients considered for rhytidectomy present with various degrees of age-related alterations to the facial soft tissues. Ideally, facelifl candidates are 45-55 years of age, are in good health, are of normal weight, possess a good bone structure, and possess a thin neck and a deep cervicometal angle. Physical examination of the patient includes a detailed regional evaluation of the face. A face-lift is capable of correcting specific anatomic regions, and a complete and detailed description of the patient's physical characteristics is important. A systematic evaluation allows the surgeon to assess the areas that can be improved with an isolated rhytidectomy and to determine whether other ancillary procedures will be beneficial. In addition, a detailed regional evaluation provides an opportunity for the surgeon and the patient to understand the limitations of the rhytidectomy; the surgeon can refer to the evaluation when explaining the expected outcome.

Evaluation of the upper facial one-third includes the forehead and upper and lower eyelids. In general, these areas are not affected by the standard rhytidectomy and are, therefore, not addressed in this review. Evaluation of the middle facial one-third includes the face and ears. The quality of the skin should be noted, including thickness, redundancy, previous scarring, fine or coarse rhytids, and the location of the hairline. Patients with significant elastosis or actinic damage do not obtain and retain the same quality of results as do patients possessing good skin quality. Assessment of the earlobe shape and position is critical, and any deviations from normality should be pointed out to the patient preoperatively. Documentation of the nasolabial folds, including length, depth, and symmetry, and an assessment of the degree of jowls should be noted. The presence of perioral rhytids is important because they are not corrected with rhytidectomy procedures.

The evaluation of the lower facial one-third includes the chin, jaw line, and neck. A useful preoperative classification of the neck for cervicofacial rhytidectomy divides the neck profile into six distinct classes (Table 74.2) [66]. Using this classification, the clinician can identify each patient's specific abnormality and choose the most appropriate procedure for optimal

results (Fig. 74.1). Skin redundancy, platysmal banding, cervicometal angle, and submental fat accumulation are important to note in this region. In addition, the degree of ptosis of the submandibular glands should be assessed and recorded at this time.

Preoperative photographs provide invaluable medicolegal documentation and an opportunity to review patient characteristics before and during surgery. The surgeon should obtain the photographs of the full face in repose and smiling, right and left profiles, and right and left three-quarter views. Close-ups of the forehead, eyebrows, and periorbital and perioral regions should be taken, depending on the particular deformity.

An essential component of the patient evaluation includes the preoperative visit. It is an excellent opportunity to educate the patient regarding various aspects of the procedure, postoperative care, and expectations. It is wise to review any and all patient instructions during the preoperative visit including medications, skin cleaning, and makeup. Patients must discontinue all aspirin-containing compounds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and vitamin E at least 2 weeks before surgery. Germicidal shampoo and skin cleaners are used several days before the scheduled date of the procedure to reduce bacterial counts. The patient should wash his or her hair and face and remove all makeup the night before surgery. A written copy of postoperative instructions should be given to and reviewed with the patient (see Appendix).

A description of the expected convalescence is appropriate during the preoperative visit. In general,

10-14 days is a reasonable time period to wait for ecchymosis to resolve sufficiently to allow camouflage with makeup. Patients should not expect to return to work or social activities before this time. They should be educated regarding expectations in the early postoperative period because those unaware of the slow evolution of results will quickly become frustrated. It should be clearly explained that appearance will continue to improve over a period of several months.

# 74.4 Surgical Technique

Once appropriate monitors are placed and the patient is adequately sedated, proposed incision lines and anticipated areas of undermining are marked with a skin marker while the patient is seated in an upright position. The face, neck, and hair are prepared with an appropriate antiseptic surgical scrub. Skin preparations should include the full length of the planned incision and all exposed skin within the surgical field.

Our preference is to perform rhytidectomies under general anesthesia with nasal intubation for convenience of manipulating patient's head from side to side without the need for adjusting the tube. Local anesthesia is provided along the incision line with a  $2\%$  lidocaine solution with 1:100,000 epinephrine via a dental syringe. Hydrodissection is performed within the planned plane of dissection with a tumescent anesthetic technique [67-72]. Mix  $20~\mathrm{mL}$  of a  $2\%$  lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine solution with  $180~\mathrm{mL}$  of normal saline, creating a solution of  $0.2\%$  lidocaine with a 1:1,000,000 epinephrine concentration. This mixture is administered via trocar sites into the subdermal fat plane, producing firmness—tumescence—in the target area (Fig. 74.2).

Hydrodissection should extend  $1\mathrm{cm}$  beyond the proposed undermining mark that delineates the anticipated extent of flap development. Approximately  $75~\mathrm{mL}$  of the tumescent anesthetic solution is deposited per side, with an additional  $50~\mathrm{mL}$  deposited in the submental region. The anesthetic is allowed to work for 8-10 minutes before proceeding.

Following deposition of the anesthetic solution, blunt cannula dissection of the cervicofacial and submental regions is performed. The submental dissection, using the blunt cannula, is accomplished before the initiation of the cervicofacial dissection. As previously mentioned, the planned incisions should be marked with the patient seated in an upright position and before administration of the local anesthetic, to prevent distortion of local anatomy. Numerous modifications of the standard face-lift incision are available, but several general principles should be followed closely [73-76].

Management of the cervical region, if indicated, has begun with the placement of a transverse incision in a submental skin crease as an extension of the submental trocar puncture. This incision should not be placed in the dominant crease of the "double-chinned" deformity, because scarring may result during the healing process and accentuate the crease. The incision should be approximately  $2\mathrm{cm}$  in length and placed just inferior to the dominant crease.

Dissection in the submental region proceeds in a subcutaneous plane and joins the lateral subcutaneous neck planes subsequent to the submental dissection. Excess subcutaneous fat may be reduced via liposuction, if indicated. Lipectomy in the submental region should be done cautiously. Overly enthusiastic removal of fat in this region can lead to an atrophic appearance of the cervical facial tissues or a "cobra" neck deformity [17] (Fig. 74.3).

Fig. 74.3 Submental dissection, prepared for platysmal plication

Next, the anterior borders of the platysma bands are identified, and excess subcutaneous tissue is removed. The medial borders should be released along their deep surface from the submental region inferiorly to the level of the thyroid cartilage. The medial borders are then repositioned in the midline, and any overlapping tissue is excised. Plication of the medial platysma borders proceeds from the submental region to the level of the thyroid cartilage with a 2-0 slow-resorbing suture (Fig. 74.4).

A horizontal myotomy of the inferior aspect of the platysma may be beneficial in accentuating the cervicometal angle and relieving tension along the anterior surface of the neck. Partial horizontal transection is frequently all that is required and can be performed with sharp scissors at the inferiormost aspect of the dissection of the medial borders. If complete transection is indicated, the lateral aspect of the platysma can be excised through the lateral neck face-lift flap [25, 28, 78, 79].

It is not necessary to shave the hair in the incision area. If necessary, the hair may be braided along the proposed incision, with the temporal extension placed no more than  $2\mathrm{cm}$  within the hair and parallel to the hairline. Some surgeons recommend a pretrichial incision to prevent the posterosuperior migration of the temporal line (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 74.5).

The incision should be extended inferiorly toward the root of the helix, anterior to the curve of the crus helicis, following the margin of the tragus, and proceed anteriorly just above the base of the incisure intertragica. Preservation of the incisure helps to prevent distortion of the tragus postoperatively, providing a more aesthetic scar. The incision curves inferiorly  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  below the junction of the lobule with the cheek, rising superiorly onto the back of the conchal bowl approximately  $3 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  and reaching the level of the postauricular sulcus or superior crus of the antihelix. The incision is then directed posteroinferiorly approximately  $4 - 5\mathrm{cm}$  into the scalp of the retromastoid region (  $\boxed{\mathbb{C}}$  Fig. 74.6).

Fig. 74.5 Temporal, preauricular, and infralobular components of the typical rhytidectomy incision

If significant cervical skin redundancy is noted, the incision may parallel the posterior hairline for several centimeters before being directed into the hair-bearing skin. This maneuver can prevent a step deformity in the posterior hairline when significant cervical skin is excised. Care must be taken to maintain approximately a  $90^{\circ}$  angle at the reflection of the posterior flap to prevent skin slough at the tip of the flap.

![](images/43cb313b21304a6c2d4a7328fcd2d98cc6d4c904f730854dd89ea4203ddf0191.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 74.6 Postauricular and mastoid components of the typical rhytidectomy incision

Several considerations for incision design are important in the male patient [18, 77]. In the temporal region, the planned incision is affected by the patient's hair pattern. Individuals with thick temporal hair can tolerate a standard incision. Those with thinning hair, temporal recession, or significant male pattern baldness require a modification of the incision design.

In the preauricular region, the male sideburn must be taken into consideration and the non-hair-bearing skin anterior to the ear must be left intact to prevent an unnatural appearance. Therefore, the incision should extend in a linear fashion, following a natural skin crease adjacent and parallel to the sideburn. This is in contrast to the curved incision used in female patients.

Last, the posterior extension of the incision is placed along the margin of the postauricular hairline. Although this placement has the potential to be slightly more noticeable, the importance of preventing posterior displacement or a step deformity to the hairline must be taken into account. A final consideration in the male patient is the inevitable transfer of hair-bearing skin into the postauricular region or into the ear canal itself.

# 74.4.1 Flap Development

Flap development is initiated by undermining 1 cm along the entire length of the face-lift incision. This is accomplished in a subdermal plane with a blade or sharp scissors, using skin hooks for retraction. On the underside of the flap, maintain approximately  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of subcutaneous fat to preserve the subdermal vasculature.

In the temporal region, the depth of the flap should be carried through the temporoparietal fascia (subgaleal) down to the loose areolar tissue overlying the deep temporal fascia. Dissection in this plane creates a thicker flap, providing increased protection from any ischemic injury that would damage hair follicles and create subsequent alopecia. The temporal dissection is extended in this plane using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.

![](images/3e91c24cd7a023545015125c90dc80be49888b1583a6704a782c42dc7fcc519c.jpg)  
Fig. 74.7 Temporofacial dissection in the supra-SMAS plane

Blunt-tipped scissors should be used in a push-cutting motion into the residual tunnels that were developed secondary to the previous blunt cannula dissection. T-clamps and skin hooks are used for countertraction and aid in the dissection. Undermining in this plane can be safely carried superiorly to the level of the lateral canthus (Fig. 74.7).

At this point, the dissection is carried inferiorly and medially across the cheek in the subcutaneous plane. This zone of transition from the sub-SMAS (deep to the temporoparietal fascia) to the subcutaneous plane of dissection corresponds to the mesotemporalis that contains the superficial temporal artery and the frontal branch of the facial nerve [80-83]. The facial nerve is located anterior and inferior to the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery, so preservation of this vessel during dissection helps to protect this important nerve.

The extent of undermining necessary depends on the patient. Younger patients without excessive laxity of the skin require only  $4 - 5\mathrm{cm}$  of undermining, but older patients with redundant tissue and severe jowling may require undermining to within  $1\mathrm{cm}$  of the oral commissure. When platysma banding is present, the cervical dissection is carried inferiorly to the level of the thyroid cartilage and should communicate with the dissection from the contralateral side.

In the postauricular region, the flap should be developed in the subcutaneous plane below the earlobe to protect the great auricular nerve. This nerve is the one most commonly injured during rhytidectomy procedures [84, 85]. The great auricular nerve runs just deep to the superficial fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle and supplies sensation below and behind the ear. With the head turned  $45^{\circ}$  toward the contralateral side, the great auricular nerve consistently crosses the middle of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at a level

![](images/45281fc6d97cea07881a0c6369db9a6f85096ff2ec08970563971ca285393101.jpg)  
Fig. 74.8 Plication versus imbrication

$6.5\mathrm{cm}$  below the caudal edge of the bony external auditory canal (Erb's point) [84]. Maintaining subcutaneous dissection below the earlobe helps protect the great auricular nerve, but above the level of the earlobe, the greater auricular is not at risk, and dissection may be carried deeper [85]. Meticulous hemostasis is then accomplished with bipolar cautery. Overzealous use of electrocautery should be avoided on the skin-flap side to reduce the risk of ischemic injury and flap necrosis.

Next, the underlying SMAS in the cheek region is manipulated. Many of the age-related changes in the facial region are due to ptosis of the underlying fat. Correction of these changes is best obtained by repositioning this tissue along direction lines (vectors) different from those used for the skin flap. Independent bidirectional suspension of the SMAS and the skin flap reposition the ptotic facial tissues, providing longer-lasting results and reducing an unnatural appearance.

SMAS manipulation can be by plication, imbrication, or a combination of these techniques; there are proponents of each method. Plication is a technique whereby the SMAS is folded upon itself to obtain the desired repositioning, and imbrication is a technique in which the SMAS is incised or excised so that the distal portion is repositioned to overlap the proximal tissue (Fig. 74.8).

SMAS plication is accomplished with a 2-0 slow-resorbing suture on a tapered needle. All knots are bur

![](images/28d5959ce56de93c1f4d66198ae93a581259668bd19ab94be991d377198feb26.jpg)  
Fig. 74.9 Dissection of SMAS layer

ied to prevent irritation to the skin flap or palpability. Two key sutures are placed initially, with the first extending from the fascia overlying the angle of the mandible to the fascia immediately inferior to the tragus. The second suture is placed from the fascia lateral to the oral commissure to the fascia immediately superior to the tragus. Several additional sutures may be placed, if needed, in the preauricular and postauricular areas. This suture placement provides a posterosuperior repositioning of the ptotic tissues.

Imbrication requires elevation of a sub-SMAS flap. An incision is made horizontally just inferior to the zygomatic arch and vertically posterior to the angle of the mandible. Landmarks for the incision include the zygomatic arch, tragus, platysma muscle, and mandible. The horizontal incision is made approximately  $1\mathrm{cm}$  below and parallel to the zygomatic arch to prevent damage to the frontal branch of the facial nerve. The middle portion of the tragus may be used as a reference for staying below the zygomatic arch.

The incision is carried forward  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$ . The vertical incision descends inferiorly along the posterior border of the platysma several centimeters below the angle of the mandible. It is important to keep the incision posterior to the angle of the mandible to prevent damage to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. The SMAS is then elevated for  $2 - 3\mathrm{cm}$  in a sub-SMAS plane (Fig. 74.9). The flap is redraped posterosuperiorly and sutured using the technique previously described for plication.

Redraping of the skin flap is performed with the patient's head in a neutral position. Extension or flexion of the neck influences the amount of skin excised and may adversely affect the outcome. Key suspension staples or sutures are placed before trimming the skin flap. In general, the skin flap is redraped in a posterosuperior

direction with an emphasis on the posterior direction. The majority of the needed superior suspension is accomplished by SMAS manipulation. Care should be taken to prevent a misdirection of facial rhytids and a distortion of the temporal hairline. Careful assessment of appearance should be made before suturing the flap in place [86].

The first key skin-suspension suture (or staple) is placed in the temporal region just above the ear. The flap is then grasped, and the appropriate vector is determined and held in place while the flap is trimmed and the staple placed. The second staple is placed in the postauricular region at the most posterior and superior aspect of the flap. Careful attention should be given to proper inset of the ear. In a nonoperated ear, the long axis of the ear lobe hangs  $10^{\circ} - 15^{\circ}$  posterior to the long axis of the ear proper. This relationship must be maintained to prevent obvious deformities of the ear.

# 74.4.2 Skin Closure

Trimming of excess skin is performed with a blade or Iris scissors. It is important to be aware of the amount of skin to be excised in the temporal region to prevent distortion of the hairline. The distance from the lateral canthus to the anterior margin of the temporal hairline should be recorded preoperatively to serve as a reference for skin excision. Skin closure in the hair-bearing scalp (i.e., temporal and mastoid regions) is performed with subdermal 3-0 resorbable sutures. Staples may be used to approximate skin margins of the temporal and mastoid scalp. Our preference is to provide a layered closure to minimize tension on the most superficial aspect of the skin.[89] Deep layers are closed with 4-0 Biosyn with the 3-bite interrupted technique. Skin is then closed with 5-0 fast gut running suture or (Figs. 74.10, 74.11, 74.12, and 74.13).

The decision of whether to place drains must be made on an individual basis, depending on how much oozing or edema is present. In our experience, drains are rarely needed. Antibacterial ointment and gauze dressings should be placed along the incision lines. Gauze is also placed preauricularly and postauricularly as well as in the submental region. The entire face should then be wrapped, taking care to prevent excessive tightness of the dressing because it can lead to ischemia of the flaps. In addition, the appropriate positioning of the ears under the dressing should be noted. Dressings should not be manipulated for evaluation until the first postoperative day. Most complications in rhytidectomy occur early in the postoperative period (i.e., 24-36 hours); close follow-up is, therefore, essential [87-91]. Some surgeons prefer to use no dressings postoperatively [92]. The degree of edema and ecchymosis postoperatively is

frequently underestimated and can be quite shocking to the patient, despite the surgeon's best attempts to educate her or him. The patient's hair should be gently cleansed and rinsed for additional comfort. Incision lines should be cleansed daily with a 1:1 solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. Antibacterial ointment should be used until all sutures are removed.

Patients should be instructed not to wash their hair until all sutures have been removed and then to wash only gently with baby shampoo. Written suggestions for the avoidance of ultraviolet light and high heat from hair dryers and for the use of sunblock and incision massage should be given to the patient and repeated orally in the early postoperative visits. The effects of the procedure are still striking for years after surgery (Fig. 74.14).

# 74.5 Complications

Based on the literature, complication rates tend to be lower for superficial rhytidectomy techniques than for the more complex composite and deep-plane techniques [1, 34, 35, 42, 48, 49, 51, 56]. Major types of surgical complications include hematoma, facial nerve injury, skin loss, scarring, alopecia, auricular deformities, and temporal hairline deformities.

Hematoma formation is the most common major complication that results from rhytidectomy. It occurs postoperatively in roughly  $2 - 4\%$  of patients within the first 48 hours; however, some literature has reported hematoma rates as high as  $9\%$  [93, 94]. Early recognition is essential because untreated hematomas are associated with an increased risk of skin slough. Typical signs and symptoms of hematoma include increased facial pain,

tightening of dressings, ecchymosis of the buccal mucosa and lips, and bulging of the lips. Hematomas are best treated with early exploration of the wound, with the most common finding being diffuse oozing under the skin flap. Removal of clots is indicated, followed rarely by bipolar cautery or suture ligation of larger vessels. Drains have been extensively studied and have not been shown to decrease hematoma formation [95]. Factors associated with increased risk of hematoma formation include preoperative hypertension, intraoperative hypotension, and postoperative hypertension.

A review of 500 face-lifts demonstrated a  $2.6\%$  incidence of hematoma formation; however, in this same population, patients with preoperative hypertension had a  $9.2\%$  incidence of hematoma formation [96]. Preoperative hypertension in this review was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of hematoma formation. Conversely, intraoperative hypotension was associated with increased hematoma formation, probably as a result of rebound hypertension. In a review of 806 face-lifts, Rees and Aston [97] reported 23 hematomas  $(2.8\%)$  with 20 of the 23 associated with controlled intraoperative hypotension. Maintenance of a normotensive state during surgery was associated with a decreased incidence of hematomas.

In another review of 1236 face-lifts by Rees and coworkers [98], a  $1.9\%$  incidence of hematoma formation was noted. The incidence drops to approximately  $1\%$  in normotensive general anesthetic states. Postoperative hypertension also has been associated with an increased risk of hematoma formation [99]. The average maximum blood pressure postoperatively in the preceding study was 152/98, a relatively minor elevation in blood pressure. Kamer and Kushnick [100] described an increase in hematoma formation when

After

using propofol as the intraoperative anesthetic agent. With propofol, the overall incidence of hematoma formation was  $4.2\%$ . A combination of valium, demerol, and brevital had only  $2\%$  incidence of hematoma formation, however. Finally, recent studies show a decrease in the incidence of hematoma formation with the use of fibrin glue sprayed under the flap before closure [101].

Patient cooperation is helpful in the prevention of hematomas. Instructions for the reduction of hematoma formation include eliminating aspirin, aspirin-containing compounds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamin E for at least 2 weeks preoperatively and avoiding exertion and bending for 2 weeks postoperatively. The importance of patient compliance should be stressed in the preoperative visits.

Recent research on the use of fibrin glue intraoperatively has shown promising results in reduction in hematoma formation. A recent meta-analysis showed that sides of faces treated with fibrin glue were four times less likely to develop hematoma when compared with sides treated without fibrin glue [102]. PRP has shown similar results when placed prior to closure [103]. Tranexamic acid has likewise recently shown to be a useful adjunct in preventing postoperative hematoma in both rhytidectomy and other facial cosmetic procedures such as liposuction. Although more studies are required, initial benefits have been seen with TXA-soaked pledgets or gauze placed within rhytidectomy flaps while the contralateral side is being worked on [104, 105]. Benefits have also been seen—and are consistent with research in other surgical specialties—with the use of IV TXA given intraoperatively and postoperatively [106].

The facial nerve branch injured most often varies with different reports in the literature [89, 107]. In the author's experience, the marginal mandibular and temporal (frontal) branches of the facial nerve are injured most often. These two branches are the most superficial and have less crossover anastomosis than other branches of the facial nerve. Injury to the marginal mandibular branch invariably occurs during extension of the subcutaneous dissection anteriorly to the lateral chin region, where the nerve courses superficial to the depressors of the mouth. Less commonly, it may be damaged during dissection in the region of the mandibular angle. Injury to the temporal branch frequently occurs during temporal dissection because the plane is in transition from subgaleal to subcutaneous levels. Damage to these structures may result in temporary or permanent motor deficits to the respective muscles of facial expression.

Compiled reviews of face-lifting have demonstrated a  $0.7\%$  (50 of 6500) incidence of temporary injury and a  $0.1\%$  (7 of 6500) incidence of permanent injury [80]. Facial nerve injury is less likely with SMAS placement techniques versus SMAS imbrication or more complex composite and deep-plane techniques [50, 86]. Rates of facial nerve injury with sub-SMAS dissections have been reported as high as  $16\%$  [108]. Prevention of facial nerve injury is achieved through a complete understanding of face-lift anatomy and the usual course and common variations of the facial nerve and meticulous attention to detail during the procedure. Most surgeons would agree that injury to the facial nerve is the most devastating complication associated with rhytidectomy; fortunately, permanent injury to the facial nerve is rare [1, 42, 46, 48-50, 80, 108].

Skin slough is the result of vascular compromise to the involved soft tissue flap. It most commonly occurs in the postauricular and mastoid regions because of the thinness of the skin and it being farthest from the blood

supply of the cervicofacial skin flap. Fortunately, small sloughs in this region are concealed by the hair and ear. The incidence of postoperative skin slough is approximately  $2 - 3\%$  [89].

Delay in the evacuation of hematomas is a major cause of skin slough and underlies the importance of early detection. Hematomas of significant size prevent the reestablishment of nutrient flow to the skin flap from the richly vascularized underlying tissues and cause tension within the flap, which creates further ischemia. When skin necrosis does occur, a black eschar forms that separates at approximately 1 week, and the wound then heals by secondary intention. Reassurance should be given to the patient because most areas of minor skin necrosis heal without major sequelae. A minimum of 3-6 months should elapse before any major surgical revision is undertaken.

Local ischemia may result from various factors including diabetes mellitus and tobacco use. Without a doubt, cigarette smoking increases the risk of skin slough [58-63]. Nicotine has been implicated as a factor that predisposes patients to skin necrosis by affecting several aspects of wound healing, including alteration of epithelialization, impairment of the inflammatory phase of healing, and compromise of small blood vessel flow [109]. In evaluating the effects of tobacco on face-lifts, Rees and associates [58] demonstrated a 12-fold greater risk of skin slough in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Webster and colleagues [59] advocated a more conservative undermining (short flap technique) in face-lift patients who smoke. It is the author's opinion that abstinence from smoking for at least 2 weeks—and preferably 1 month—is recommended before operating on a patient who has not stopped smoking. Improper tissue manipulation and flap design are easily preventable causes of skin slough that result from inexperience. Delicate handling of skin flaps is essential during elevation to prevent a compromised result. Skin flaps should be designed to maintain an adequate thickness of subcutaneous tissue on their deep surface  $(3 - 4\mathrm{mm})$  and, in the postauricular region, to maintain a  $90^{\circ}$  angle at the tip of the flap.

Neurosensory disturbances, particularly transient numbness or hypesthesia, are common in the early postoperative period as a result of elevation of the skin flap and interruption of small sensory nerves. As a result, a temporary, diffuse cutaneous numbness that lasts 4-6 weeks is not uncommon. During this time, patients should be warned about possible injury to numb skin from razors, curling irons, and hair dryers. The most common nerve injured during rhytidectomy is the great auricular nerve. Injury to this nerve is the result of an improper plane of dissection over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Studies have shown the great auricular nerve to cross the middle portion of the sternocleido

mastoid muscle approximately  $6.5\mathrm{cm}$  below the caudal edge of the bony external auditory canal, which courses cephalad just deep to the SMAS [84, 85]. Injury to the great auricular nerve occurs when the postauricular dissection is carried too deep, thereby violating the strict subcutaneous plane in this region.

The significance of a complication may vary according to the patient's ability to deal with the complication. A particular patient may be frantic over a mild postauricular skin slough, whereas another patient may demonstrate minimal to no anxiety associated with marginal mandibular nerve weakness. Although the authors do not discuss minor complications in detail, complications that occur after rhytidectomy may include widened scars, auricular deformities, edema or ecchymosis, loss of temporal hair tuft or temporal alopecia, and sialoceles [93, 107, 110]. When complications occur, the surgeon must acknowledge them to the patient and take appropriate measures to correct the problem. Availability of the surgeon in the postoperative period is the key to successful management of most postoperative complications.

# Conclusion

Since the early 1980s, numerous rhytidectomy techniques have been described to improve the results of facial rejuvenation. When contemplating facial rejuvenation surgery, the treatment requirements of the surgeon must be balanced with the desires of the patient. These requirements are critical in defining the advantages of one technique of face-lifting over another. As we prepare our patients for aesthetic surgery, we must consider all the variables discussed and individualize each treatment plan. Not all patients should undergo a deep-plane face-lift; however, many will benefit from release of the retaining ligaments and a repositioning of tissues in multiple vectors.

In the realm of oral and maxillofacial surgery, the rhytidectomy procedure finds great application as an adjunct to traditional skeletal surgery. It seeks to reverse the effects of gravity and relaxation of the facial skin and fascia by resuspending the facial units and eliminating excess skin and subcutaneous tissue. Although a wide variety of techniques are reported for face-lifting, this chapter has attempted to provide a broad overview of the superficial-plane rhytidectomy technique. By tailoring the approach to the specific needs of each patient, based on a thorough knowledge of surgical anatomy, the maxillofacial surgeon should achieve consistently good results with minimum morbidity.

# Appendix Postoperative Rhytidectomy Instructions

# Immediately upon Arriving Home

Head elevation Lie down with your head and back elevated on two pillows. You must sleep in this position for 1 week.

Dressings Do not remove bandages. These will be removed at the office on your first postsurgery visit.

Ice packs Place ice packs (ice in freezer bags or packages of frozen peas) over the cheek areas on and off over a period of 24 hours. Do not put ice on after 24 hours unless you are told to do so.

Swelling Ice packs will keep swelling and bruising to a minimum.

Bruising Bruising often lasts 7-14 days.

Medication Take pain medication only if needed and with food or crackers.

Diet Upon arriving home from surgery, begin with clear liquids until fully awake, and then begin regular food intake with soft foods.

Suture care Keep all sutures clean with a peroxide-water solution. Keep sutures covered with antibiotic ointment at all times. Clean three to five times per day.

# One Day or More After Surgery

Moist heat Ice packs are to be discontinued 24 hours after surgery. Wait 12 hours; then you may begin moist heat. Use a moist washcloth between an electric heating pad and your face. Do not use heat continuously; for example, use for 30 minutes and then off for 30 minutes. Do not set the heating pad higher than medium at any time, regardless of how cool it feels to you.

Activity Stay up as much as possible. Avoid bending over or lifting heavy objects for 1 week. Strenuous activities should be limited for 2-3 weeks.

Work Most people plan to return to work in 2 weeks. This depends on how you feel about being seen with bruising. Most of the bruising can be masked with makeup if you prefer to return earlier.

Makeup Cosmetics may be applied on the sixth day. Ask about special coverup products for bruising. Mint green coverstick followed by a flesh-tone foundation will cover most bruises.

Bathing You may bathe or shower, but keep the bandages dry. When bandages are removed, gently wash the facial areas.

Hair care You may wash your hair on the fifth day after surgery. Do not bend over to wash your hair; this may cause bleeding or swelling to occur. Use medium heat on your hair dryer. High heat or hot rollers should not be used for 7-10 days. You may use color on your hair in 3 weeks. Diet: Eat regular but soft meals. You will need to take vitamins and minerals to help with the healing. We will be glad to give you vitamin and mineral information.

Sun Protect your facial skin from excessive sun exposure for 1 month after surgery.
