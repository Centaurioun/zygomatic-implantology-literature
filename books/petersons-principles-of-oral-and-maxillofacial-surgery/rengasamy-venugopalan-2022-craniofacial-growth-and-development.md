# 58.1 Introduction

Craniofacial development is a highly coordinated process under tight genetic and epigenetic control. Human prenatal development can be divided simply into (i) the embryonic period, from fertilization through the 8th week of development, and (ii) the fetal period, continuing from the 9th to the 40th week at birth. The embryonic period is characterized by new tissue differentiation and organogenesis, whereas the fetal period is distinguished by growth and expansion of the basic structures already formed. Craniofacial embryogenesis begins dur

ing the third week of gestation, when gastrulation and neurulation occur. Gastrulation is the process whereby the bilaminar disk is converted into a trilaminar germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Neurulation, occurring at the same time as gastrulation during the third week and continuing through the fourth week, is a process that results in the formation of the neural tube, the primordium of the central nervous system (CNS).

During neural tube formation, a multipotential cell population, called neural crest cells, is derived from the lateral edges of the neural fold during the fourth week of embryonic life. Cell fate tracing experiments have revealed that neural crest cells originate from the dorsal surface of the neural tube by delamination from the epithelium and migrate extensively in a proper sequence over extensive distances through the embryo, developing into a wide variety of differentiated cell types at multiple distant sites (Figs. 58.1 and 58.2) [1]. Neural crest cells migrate ventrolaterally as they populate the pharyngeal (or branchial) arches. Each pharyngeal arch is delineated by discrete swellings that are produced by the proliferative activity of these crest cells. These ectodermally derived cells contribute extensively to the formation of mesenchymal structures in the head and neck as

they migrate. All of the skeletal and connective tissue of the face, with the exception of dental enamel, is derived from neural crest cells, whereas skeletal and connective tissue of the trunk is mesodermal in origin. Cell labeling studies have demonstrated that neuroectoderm cells of rhombomeres 1-3 in the forming posterior midbrain and anterior hindbrain transform into cranial neural crest cells that migrate into the first pharyngeal arch and thereafter reside within the maxillary and mandibular prominences [2, 5, 6]. The migration of these rhombencephalic crest cells may be regulated by growth factor signaling pathways and their downstream transcription factors before they become committed to several different phenotypes, including progenitor tooth mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts, chondroblasts, and cranial nerve ganglia of the first pharyngeal arch [3, 4, 7-9].

# 58.2 Prenatal Craniofacial Development

# 58.2.1 Facial Prominences and Formation of Face

Facial formation occurs between the fourth and the eighth week of gestation from five prominences (primordia or processes) derived from the first pair of pharyngeal arches. These prominences are the single median frontonasal, the paired maxillary, and the paired mandibular prominences that form the superior, inferior,

and lateral boundaries of the stomodeum (primitive oral cavity). These facial prominences, each of whose outgrowth is composed of different neural crest cells and regulated by different genes, are covered by a thin epithelium derived from the ectoderm [12]. The mesenchyme is composed primarily of the neural crest, whereas the core of the facial prominences contains some mesodermal cells [11].

The final shape of the embryonic face is believed to be defined by the differential proliferation of these facial prominences [13]. Following the development of appropriate form and size, the facial prominences merge with adjacent prominences when the epithelium between them breaks down, followed by invasion of the mesenchyme and coalescence of the adjoining prominences (Fig. 58.3) [14]. Shortly after neural crest cell migration, the paired mandibular prominences merge in the midline to form the chin and lower lip. At the same time, the ectoderm of the frontonasal prominences forms two thickened epithelial regions, the nasal placodes, which subsequently curl outward to give rise to the medial and lateral nasal prominences. The medial nasal prominences grow further, moving toward each other and eventually merge in the midline (globular prominence) early in the sixth week to form the central part of the upper lip and the primary palate. There still is some controversy regarding the origin of the central part of the upper lip, which some believe is of frontonasal prominence origin [10]. The maxillary prominences move medially as well, merging with the lateral and medial nasal prominences during the sixth week, to complete formation of the upper lip. At this same time, the maxillary and mandibular prominences merge laterally, determining the width of the mouth. Merging of facial prominences requires disintegration of surface epithelia in order to permit the underlying mesenchymal cells to unite (Fig. 58.4). The groove between the prominences is gradually filled out by proliferation of the mesenchyme so that the prominences appear to merge. From 5 weeks' gestation to the early part of the fetal period at 9 weeks, there is medial migration of the eyes, assisted by frontal and temporal lobe expansion and greater proliferation of the lateral facial regions relative to the central face, resulting in facial expansion and interocular reduction.

The nasal placodes that formed at about 5 weeks each are separated inferiorly by a nasal groove. With continued proliferation of mesenchyme, the placodes submerge to form the nasal pits, the precursors to the anterior nares. As the nasal pits continue to submerge with the proliferating mesenchyme, they are eventually separated from the stomatodeum by only a thin oronasal membrane. This membrane will rupture at the beginning of the seventh week, forming a continuous nasal and oral cavity. One of the last orofacial structures to

reach completion at the end of the embryonic period is the secondary palate, developing from the paired lateral palatine shelves of the maxilla. These shelves are oriented vertically with the tongue interposed, but the tongue and floor of the oral cavity descend as the nasal chambers expand laterally and inferiorly (Fig. 58.5). As this occurs, the palatal shelves become elongated and elevate medially toward each other, beginning fusion at the end of the eighth week and completing in the ninth week of gestation.

# 58.2.2 Formation of the Craniofacial Bones

Formation of the craniofacial bones begins with development of the cartilaginous and membranous precursors to the neurocranium (desmocranium and chondrocranium) and viscerocranium during the latter part of the fifth week of gestation (Fig. 58.6). The membranous neurocranium (desmocranium) that will

give rise to the flat bones of the calvaria is a connective tissue derived from the paraxial mesoderm and neural crest. The cartilaginous neurocranium (chondrocranium) that will form the cranial base is cartilage from neural crest origin. Cartilage maturation occurs in a caudal-rostral sequence. The membranous viscerocranium that will give rise to the maxilla, zygomatic bone, squamous temporal bone, and mandible is derived from the neural crest. The cartilaginous viscerocranium that will form the middle ear ossicles, styloid process of the temporal bone, hyoid bone, and laryngeal cartilages is from neural crest ectoderm. Endochondral ossification centers occur in the cartilaginous components, and intramembranous ossification sites form in the membranous components of the neurocranium and viscerocranium. Osteoblast differentiation with the onset of mineralization results from a rapid angiogenic process with vascular ingrowth closely surrounding the centers and sites of ossification. The earliest ossification of the craniofacial bones begins in the seventh and eighth

weeks of gestation. There are eventually 110 ossification centers, nearly all of which appear between 6 and 12 weeks' gestation, which develop in the embryo to form 45 bones at birth, which ultimately form 22 bones in the adult.

The onset of ossification generally follows the chronological sequence of mandible, maxilla, palatine, cranial base, and cranium, with intramembranous sites usually preceding endochondral centers [15]. Intramembranous ossification of the mandible begins in the mental foramen region at 6 weeks of gestation lateral to Meckel's cartilage. The secondary mandibular condylar cartilage forms at 10 weeks' gestation as a separate endochondral condensation, adjacent to but independent of Meckel's cartilage and separated from the intramembranously formed body of the mandible. Endochondral ossification of the mandibular condylar cartilage does not begin until 15 weeks. Maxillary intramembranous ossification begins in the area of the infraorbital foramen lateral to the nasal capsule. This ossification progresses anteriorly and posteriorly from this region. The vertical portion of the palatine bone then begins intramembranous ossification in the region of the palatine nerve, followed by ossification of the anterior, then the posterior borders of the incisive foramen, spreading through the hard palate from the canine area. Following ossification of the main

portion of the mandible and maxilla, during the sixth week of gestation, endochondral ossification of the cranial base occurs in the midline from the foramen magnum to the nasal bone, and intramembranous ossification occurs laterally. Finally, intramembranous ossification of the cranial bones follows.

# 58.2.3 The Growth of the Craniofacial Complex During Fetal Period

The fetal period begins during the ninth week, at 60 days gestation, lasting until birth at 40 weeks. The overall somatic growth follows a cephalocaudal gradient (Fig. 58.7). There is a prenatal growth spurt between 20 and 30 weeks' gestation with the peak growth velocity at 27-28 weeks being approximately  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$  per week. The prenatal spurt in weight is slightly later at 30-40 weeks' gestation with a peak at 34-36 weeks [16]. The rate steadily decreases during the last trimester and continues to decline after birth until adulthood, with two exceptions. The first is a small "midgrowth" spurt that occurs in many children at 6-8 years old that has been attributed to increased adrenal secretion of androgenic hormones. The second is a dramatic endocrine-mediated "pubertal growth" spurt during adolescence.

Fig. 58.7 Changes in fetal body proportions with all stages drawn to same total height. At the start of the fetal period, the head is half the length of the fetus, and by birth, it is one quarter the length. (Adapted from Moore and Persaud [184], p. 97)

Growth of the craniofacial complex during the fetal period is characterized by a constant rate during the second trimester. The craniofacial skeletal components increase more in the anteroposterior dimension than in the vertical or transverse, with the exception of the mandible, which increases more in the transverse dimension in order to maintain appropriate articulation [17].

During the fetal period, the neurocranium undergoes precocious development relative to the viscerocranium with earlier brain and neurocranial bone vault growth than facial and masticatory portions of the skull. This results in an early proportional predominance of the neurocranium over the face that only reduces to an 8:1 proportion by birth. The brain nearly doubles in size from 4 months' gestation to birth, achieving about  $25\%$  of its adult dimension. The formation and maintenance of cranial sutures are regulated by tissue interactions with the underlying dura mater as the brain develops [18]. A number of growth factors have been identified that regulate cranial bone growth and suture fusion, including TGF-  $\beta 1$ , TGF-  $\beta 2$ , TGF-  $\beta 3$ , BMP-2, BMP-7, FGF-4, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and SHH [19, 20]. Transcription factors MSX2 and TWIST also play a role in suture development,

binding to target effector genes to determine their expression [21]. The cranial vault elements are developed at the boundary between cranial neural crest- and mesoderm-derived tissues. The frontal bones are derived from neural crest, whereas the parietal and occipital bones are of mesoderm origin [10]. This results in the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures occurring at the neural crest-mesoderm interface. The metopic suture is the only human cranial suture not formed between neural crest and mesoderm, being entirely of neural crest origin. Mandibular morphogenesis is tightly controlled by BMP and FGF signaling in the ectoderm [22]. The eyeballs grow concurrently with the early brain growth, increasing facial expansion and separating the neural and facial skeletons to increase skull height. The cranial base growth parallels the rapid growth of the cranial vault during the fetal period. The anterior cranial base grows sevenfold, whereas the posterior cranial base increases fivefold. The intraethmoidal and intrasphenoidal synchondroses close before birth.

The ossification centers that begin the formation of the facial bones late in the embryonic period at 6-8 weeks enlarge during the early fetal period until most of the bones have developed into a definitive shape

by 14 weeks. At this time, they begin to remodel as they continue to grow by intramembranous and/or endochondral ossification. Mandibular condylar cartilage appears relatively late at 10 weeks, well after the embryonic period when a rudimentary mandible already is present [23]. This secondary cartilage may serve as an intrinsic center of growth at this stage, in contrast to its later growth that is predominantly extrinsically determined. The anterior aspects of the maxilla, mandible, and zygoma of the fetal and early postnatal face undergo osseous deposition at this time. This early anterior deposition is necessary to permit adequate osseous mass for the developing tooth buds of the primary and permanent dentitions. Although the tooth germs start to develop as early as 6 weeks' gestation, the onset of dental mineralization does not begin until ossification has occurred. The maxilla demonstrates a rapid height increase associated with dental development [24]. Once the primary teeth have erupted, the anterior aspect of the maxilla undergoes resorption rather than deposition to produce the descent of the maxilla with continued growth. Meanwhile, the posterior, infraorbital, and lingual surfaces of the maxilla are depository in both fetal and postnatal development. The fetal temporal bone grows faster in height than width, whereas the lateral and inferior margins of the zygomatic bone grow faster than its orbital margin [24].

The paranasal sinuses, including the maxillary, sphenoidal, frontal, and ethmoidal, start developing at the beginning of the fetal period. Pneumatization begins first with the maxillary sinus, starting at 5 months' gestation. It is proposed that a septomaxillary ligament, attached to the sides and anteroinferior border of the nasal septum and inserted in the nasal spine, transmits septal growth, pulling the maxilla downward. Between the 10th week of gestation and birth, the nasal septum increases its vertical height sevenfold. The nasal septum growth, together with neural growth and facial sutural growth, transposes the maxilla inferiorly and anteriorly. The frontomaxillary, frontonasal, frontozygomatic, frontoethmoidal, and ethmoidomaxillary sutures grow predominantly in a vertical direction. The temporozygomatic and nasomaxillary sutures contribute most of the anteroposterior change. The intermaxillary and zygomaticomaxillary sutures provide most of the transverse expansion of the face. Overall, the middle and lower thirds of the face develop primarily in a downward and slightly forward direction away from the cranial base owing to brain development, maxillary and palatine sutural growth, and possibly nasal septum growth.

Although the midsagittal part of the middle face consists entirely of nasal septal cartilage during the fetal period, ossification leaves only a small anterior part of this cartilage remaining postnatally. Currently, there is

controversy regarding the role of the nasal septum in postnatal facial growth. Some believe it is limited to a compensatory and biomechanical role, and others believe it serves a more extensive role, particularly in promoting vertical maxillary growth.

Although the mandible is larger than the maxilla during the embryonic period, the mandible approximates the size of the maxilla within the first month of the fetal period. The three secondary cartilages of the mandible do not appear until the 10th and 14th weeks of gestation, forming on the lateral and superior aspects of the condylar processes. This secondary type of cartilage differs morphologically from epiphyseal and synchronousal cartilage [25]. Two of these secondary cartilages forming at the mental protuberance and the coronoid process ossify before birth, leaving only the cartilage on the condylar head as a site of postnatal mandibular endochondral growth. This cartilage never undergoes complete ossification, providing a means for absorbing functional forces and retaining growth potential throughout life. Between the 13th and the 20th weeks of gestation, the mandible lags behind the maxilla again while there is a transition from Meckel's cartilage to condylar cartilage as the primary growth site. During the third trimester, there is a significant deepening of the corpus in association with the developing dentition. The mandibular ramus growth rate is greater than the growth rate of the mandibular body during this time [26]. At the time of birth, the mandible usually is equal in size again to the maxilla, although it often is in a retrognathic position relative to the maxilla.

Development of the permanent tooth germs begins at 16 weeks' gestation, with the first permanent molar germs developing posteriorly from the dental lamina followed by the permanent anterior tooth germs emerging from the lingual side of the primary enamel organs. At birth, the primary tooth crowns are still not completely calcified, as the first permanent molars begin to calcify.

# 58.3 Postnatal Craniofacial Development

An area of craniofacial growth can be differentiated as a growth center or growth site. A growth center is where there is primarily intrinsic genetic growth control with a minimal environmental or functional role. Although a growth site also is controlled to some extent by genetic programming, it is more vulnerable to extrinsic growth control, being dependent more on the functional influence of the surrounding tissues. Cranial base synchronidoses, where endochondral ossification of primary cartilage occurs, represent growth centers. The role of the cartilaginous nasal septum as a growth center or site

remains controversial. There is a clearer understanding that the endochondral growth of the secondary cartilage of the mandibular condyles acts as a growth site. Areas of membranous bone growth resulting from sutural or periosteal ossification are primarily growth sites and represent the bulk of the remaining craniofacial complex. There are exceptions, such as craniosynostosis, that can be due to an underlying genetic cause. Membranous ossification by sutural and periosteal remodeling is essentially the only type of craniofacial bone growth that occurs after adolescence and throughout adulthood.

Development and completion of craniofacial growth follow the overall somatic cephalocaudal growth gradient throughout prenatal and postnatal growth, with cranial vault growth completing before the cranial base, followed by the nasomaxilla and finishing with the mandible. During postnatal growth, the neurocranium continues to develop ahead of the viscerocranium (Fig. 58.8). It increases from about  $30\%$  of its ultimate adult size at the time of birth to  $50\%$  by 6 months of age,  $75\%$  by 2 years of age, and nearly  $90\%$  by 3 years of age. By 5 years of age, the orbits have reached nearly  $80\%$  of their adult size [27]. This is why a child of this age appears to have a disproportionately large cranium and eyes. After birth, the neurocranium increases about five times in size, whereas the viscerocranium increases about 10 times. There is also a difference in the amount of postnatal increase in the three dimensions, with the vertical increasing by about  $200\%$ , the anteroposterior by somewhat less, and the transverse by the least at approximately  $75\%$ . By 10 years of age, the neurocranial growth is nearly  $95\%$  complete, whereas facial growth is only about  $60\%$  complete.

The craniofacial complex can be divided conveniently into four primary units: the cranial vault, the cranial base, the nasomaxilla, and the mandible. Each of these units has its growth regulated to some extent by both intrinsic and extrinsic controls. Our understanding of postnatal craniofacial growth has developed in part from cross-sectional anatomic and histologic studies of human cadavers and skeletal material. What has been particularly helpful in supplementing this material is a number of North American longitudinal craniofacial growth records and longitudinal implant (used for stable reference points) studies that were gathered from the 1940s to the mid-1960s before radiation hygiene and human subject research standards became more stringent [28].

# 58.3.1 Cranial Vault

At birth, the cranial bones are separated by sutures with fontanelles where the corners of the bones meet, permitting compression of the skull during the birthing process (Fig. 58.9). Postnatal bone growth results in narrowing of the sutures with all of the fontanelles closing within the first 2 years. In the absence of any intrinsic growth potential in the sutures, the pressures exerted by the developing brain determine the size and shape of the cranium. As the brain expands, the internal pressure creates tension across the connective tissue of the sutures and compression against the cranial bones, resulting in intramembranous bone growth by suture and surface apposition. Modeling of the cranial bones to a flatter shape is necessary to adapt to the expanding surface of the brain. This occurs primarily from endocranial

resorption and ectocranial apposition. Although suture apposition plays a larger role than surface apposition in overall cranial vault capacity, the postnatal shape primarily is determined by extrinsic factors.

By 6-7 years of age, the inner table of the cranial bones becomes stable due to the cessation of cerebral growth. However, the outer table continues to model in response to extracranial muscular forces. The temporal muscles tend to laterally compress the cranium, forming temporal sulci and zygomatic arches. The lateral and posterior cervical muscles insert primarily on the squamous part of the temporal and occipital bones, influencing their shape. Even after attainment of the adult form, the cranial bones continue to thicken during adulthood.

# 58.3.2 Cranial Base

Compared with the other craniofacial units, the shape of the cranial base is relatively stable during growth, due likely to its greater intrinsic growth potential. Perhaps more than any other craniofacial area, growth of the cranial base is genetically predetermined in the midline by endochondral bone growth at the synchodroses and influenced the least by functional matrices [29, 30]. However, prenatal brain growth may provide a minor extrinsic influence, causing some flattening of the cranial base. In addition, there is evidence that chondral growth of the cranial base can be altered with mechani

cal forces [31]. Lateral to the cranial base midline, there is intramembranous bone growth from sutures and surface remodeling that are affected by extrinsic factors.

The cranial base is formed from primary cartilage that appears underneath the brain in the sixth week of embryonic life. Following initial osseous calcification during the eighth week, synchodroses are created by the residual cartilage and continue the endochondral bone formation, pushing the cranial base bones apart centrally while sutures more laterally produce intramembranous bone growth. The anterior cranial base matures earlier than the posterior cranial base, with the posterior intraoccipital synchondroses closing during the second and third years postnatally and the anterior intraoccipital synchondroses closing at 3-4 years of age (Fig. 58.10). The sphenoethmoidal synchondrosis closes at about 6 years of age. Although the sphenococcipital synchondrosis is not a main growth site before birth, it provides the greatest contribution to cranial base growth postnatally, delaying fusion until adolescence. The prolonged postnatal growth period of the sphenococcipital synchondrosis permits posterior growth of the maxilla to provide adequate bone for the developing posterior permanent teeth and adequate space for the nasopharynx. In addition to endochondral bone growth in the midline, intramembranous remodeling of the cranial base occurs, including apposition on the basioccipital bone and anterior margin of the foramen magnum, resulting in continued lengthening of the posterior cranial base even after adolescence. Enlargement of the

sella turcica continues postnatally, with the anterior wall stabilizing at about 6 years of age and the posterior wall continuing to resorb until late adolescence.

# 58.3.3 Nasomaxilla

The prenatal precocity of neurocranial growth relative to the face becomes less predominant postnatally. Nevertheless, considerable postnatal displacement of the nasomaxilla downward and forward occurs owing to continued growth of the brain and cranial base. This inferior and anterior maxillary transposition is augmented by the sutural growth between the cranial base and the maxilla and growth of the nasal septum. After birth, the vertical growth of the maxilla continues with contributions from the frontomaxillary, frontonasal, frontozygomatic, frontoethmoidal, ethmoidomaxillary sutures, and, possibly, the nasal septum (Fig. 58.11). The vertical descent of the maxilla is further increased by modeling with resorption on the nasal surfaces and the simultaneous apposition on the oral surfaces. The zygomas are repositioned down and forward with resorption on their internal surfaces and apposition on their external surfaces. Anteroposterior growth continues with temporozygomatic and nasomaxillary sutural growth and transverse growth from intermaxillary and zygomaticomaxillary sutures. The resulting downward and forward translation displaces adjacent bones and permits adequate space for the developing nasopharynx and appositional growth at the posterior aspect of the

maxilla and maxillary tuberosities to provide additional posterior alveolar space for the development and eruption of the maxillary molars. Following the postnatal growth of the facial sutures, they serve as sites of fibrous union where some remodeling still can take place. In fact, a number of cranial and facial sutures are interdigitated but still not fused even beyond 50 years of age.

Growth determinants for postnatal nasomaxillary growth are not well understood and include a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Passive displacement secondary to genetic intrinsic brain and cranial base growth and, perhaps, nasal septal growth guidance are the most significant influences on the downward and forward movements of the maxilla after birth until about the seventh postnatal year when most neural growth is complete. From that age through adolescence, these influences dramatically decrease, accounting for about one-third of forward maxillary movement, as intramembranous epigenetic extrinsic sutural growth and surface modeling predominate. Maxillary growth also depends to a great extent on various functional matrices. In addition to the effect of brain growth on the maxillary position, there is the influence of eyeball growth and their functional movement on the size and shape of the orbits, the influence of respiration on the nasal cavity, the influence of oral function in determining tuberosity, palatal and alveolar development, and the surrounding facial soft tissues, all of which contribute functional roles in determining the extent of sutural growth and modeling of the nasomaxilla [32].

Fig. 58.11 Nasomaxillary intramembranous growth at various sites, resulting in an overall downward and forward transposition of the maxilla relative to the cranial base. (Adapted from Sperber [182], p. 107)

Although the mode of nasomaxillary growth is predominantly intramembranous from sutural growth and surface remodeling, some endochondral bone growth takes place in the nasal septum, made up of secondary cartilage. As mentioned previously, the growth mechanism is mostly the nasomaxilla being pushed from behind by the brain and cranial base growth until about age 7, when a different mechanism begins to predominate whereby the nasomaxilla is pulled forward by soft tissue and probably to a small extent from nasal cartilage growth with concomitant growth of circummaxillary sutures. Significant modeling must occur in order to maintain the general shape of the maxilla as it is displaced downward. As mentioned previously, resorption of the nasal side of the maxilla, providing nasal cavity enlargement, occurs concomitantly with apposition on the oral side, resulting in descent of the maxilla. This descent, together with variable amounts of dental eruption, is reflected as external rotation of the maxilla. The maxilla undergoes a modest and variable amount of internal rotation as it remodels that can result in slight forward or backward rotation but usually is equal to the external rotation, resulting in a zero net rotational change. However, the cumulative rotation may be significant in individuals with short or long face types [33].

Although secondary pneumatization of the maxillary sinus begins prenatally, it does not occur for the other paranasal sinuses until after birth (first 2 postnatal years for ethmoidal and frontal sinuses and the 6-7 postnatal years for sphenoidal sinuses). The vertical growth of the maxillary alveolar process is rapid during dental eruption, surpassing the vertical descent of the palate threefold. This alveolar development provides a large contribution to the depth and width of the palate and vertical height of the face. Considerable resorption of the anterior surface of the maxilla minimizes the overall forward displacement of the maxilla by about  $25\%$  and creates a deeper supra-alveolar concavity while increasing the relative prominence of the anterior nasal spine. Transverse growth occurs by lateral displacement of the maxillary bodies by means of the midpalatal suture and bone resorption on the lateral borders of the nasal cavity. Transverse development of the maxillary alveolar process continues with buccal eruption of the posterior teeth. Growth of the midpalatal suture ends after the first 2 postnatal years, but the suture remains patent until late adolescence, with fusion usually not being complete until the third decade.

Preadolescent and adolescent nasal growth increases on average at a rate about  $25\%$  greater than maxillary growth. The mechanism of nasal growth is a combina

tion of an endochondral component from the nasal cartilage and an intramembranous component from sutural growth behind the nose. Although the nasal bone grows up until about age 10 with frontonasal sutural apposition and modeling, interstitial nasal cartilage growth continues increasing the overall size beyond adolescence and throughout adulthood.

# 58.3.4 Mandible

The mandible has the most delayed growth and the most postnatal growth of all the facial bones. Though mandible is in a retrognathic position relative to the maxilla at birth, rapid postnatal growth of the mandible corrects this discrepancy. The right and left bodies of the mandible are still separate at birth, uniting at the midline mental symphysis during the first year of life. There are no intrinsic centers of mandibular growth. The primary sites of mandibular postnatal growth are the endochondral apposition occurring at the condylar cartilages and extensive intramembranous surface modeling. This modeling includes, but is not limited to, apposition on the posterior and lateral aspects of the rami and the posterior alveolar ridges as well as resorption of the anterior surface of the condyles, the anterior contours of the rami, and the inner surface of the mandibular bodies (Fig. 58.12). The accentuation of chin prominence that typically occurs results primarily from facial resorption between the chin and the base of the mandibular

alveolus rather than apposition on the chin itself. The growth of the condylar cartilage contributes most of the total ramus height, whereas growth of alveolar bone contributes approximately  $60\%$  to the mandibular body height [34]. Proliferation of condylar cartilage, in response to growth and function of muscles and adjacent soft tissue, results in superior and posterior growth of the condylar heads, displacing the mandible downward and forward in concert with the maxilla.

At birth, the inclination of the mandibular condyles is more horizontal, resulting in a greater increase in length than height. During childhood, the inclination becomes more vertical so that condylar growth results in a greater increase in height than length. However, there is great variability in this inclination within the general population, influencing the degree to which the mandibular growth is expressed in a forward anteriorly rotating, as opposed to downward posteriorly rotating, direction. Simultaneous modeling of the inferior mandibular border with resorption at the gonial angle and minimal apposition of the anterior aspect of the lower border tends to reduce the effect of this rotation on facial morphology. The final rotational position of the mandible with growth is a result of the combined influences of external mandibular rotation from downward nasomaxillary growth and dental eruption and the internal mandibular rotation from compensatory modeling. Internal mandibular rotation is variable but is typically  $15^{\circ}$ , whereas external mandibular rotation averages  $11 - 12^{\circ}$ , producing an overall forward rotation of  $3 - 4^{\circ}$  [33, 35]. This overall rotation tends to decrease with greater internal rotation in individuals with short faces, resulting in a deep anterior overbite. With the long face individual, the internal rotation is decreased or even backward internal rotation may occur, often resulting in an anterior open bite and mandibular deficiency.

The mandible has its greatest postnatal growth velocity in the first 6 months after birth with the greatest change in mandibular length, followed by ramus height, then corpus length [36]. Although minimal maxillary growth occurs after approximately 10 years of age, mandibular growth continues longer, to the end of adolescent growth. This differential growth, typically characterized by a peak in the rate of mandibular growth at puberty, usually results in the final correction of the mandibular position relative to the maxilla. Longitudinal growth studies have demonstrated that there are a substantial number of individuals, more commonly females, who demonstrate an early acceleration in mandibular growth that can occur during preadolescence [37]. This "juvenile" acceleration may equal or even exceed the later acceleration during puberty.

If the cranial base is the craniofacial skeletal unit whose growth is least determined by extrinsic epigenetic or environmental factors, the mandible is the opposite

extreme with its growth highly dependent on the postnatal functional demands placed on it. It has a great capacity to adapt to mandibular displacement and accommodate to lingual and labial soft tissue, resting postural and active muscular function, and mastication. The condylar inclination, dictating the type of mandibular growth rotation, is determined by these pulling secondary functional influences. The relevant functional matrices include the lateral pterygoid attached to the condylar neck, the growth and function of the tongue, the masticatory muscles attached to the buccal and lingual aspects and to the coronoid process, and the facial soft tissue and musculature, all influencing the ultimate size and shape of the mandible. For this reason, the mandible,

more than any other part of the craniofacial complex, may have a low intrinsic growth potential that is significantly increased and regulated in response to extrinsic functional demand. This mandibular growth dependence on function is clearly reflected in clinical conditions in which mandibular growth has been restricted from persistent unilateral or bilateral limited mandibular function owing to a congenital disorder, postnatal trauma, or pathology. It is just as evident in clinical conditions in which mandibular growth is enhanced in the presence of a postnatal pathology in which persistent lingual soft tissue affects the size or resting position of the tongue or a pituitary adenoma increases skeletal and soft tissue growth (Figs. 58.13 and 58.14).

# 58.3.5 Dental Development

The alveolar processes contribute a great portion of the vertical height of the lower face. Their development is entirely dependent on the presence and eruption of the primary and permanent dentition. Just as vertical appositional alveolar growth accompanies vertical dental eruption, transverse apposition complements transverse dental eruption. This minor contribution to the transverse dimension of the alveolar processes continues until about 7 years of age, with eruption of the permanent incisors. Further transverse dentoalveolar growth

is minimal, occurring with eruption of the premolars and canines. Facial growth and the concomitant increase in the size of the jaws occur posteriorly, creating additional space for the dentition only in the molar region.

Eruption of the maxillary teeth enhances the vertical dimension of the maxilla with posterior development of the maxillary tuberosities to accommodate the development and eruption of the maxillary posterior teeth. In the mandible, progressive resorption of the anterior ramal surfaces and apposition of the posterior ramal surfaces provide alveolar space for the sequential development and eruption of the mandibular posterior teeth.

Eruption of the mandibular teeth enhances the vertical growth of the mandible and also contributes to the height of the face. However, compensatory condylar growth and internal mandibular rotational modeling must occur to prevent the mandible from rotating posteriorly as the maxilla grows downward and the dentition erupts. Dental emergence into the oral cavity begins at approximately the sixth postnatal month, and the primary dentition is established by 2.5 years of age. The primary incisors begin to exfoliate at 6-7 years of age, and the permanent dentition begins to emerge with eruption of the mandibular incisors and first molars. The permanent dentition is established by 12-14 years of age except for the eruption of the third molars, contributing to the vertical dimension of the lower face during adolescent growth.

The anteroposterior eruption of the permanent incisors is affected by the facial growth pattern [38]. Individuals with class III facial growth tend to have minimal anterior and some distal mandibular dental eruption, whereas class II facial growth results in greater anterior mandibular dental eruption to compensate for the underlying anteroposterior skeletal discrepancies. Short facial growth pattern tends to promote anterior mandibular rotation with increased incisor uprighting and deepening of the anterior overbite, whereas long facial growth pattern results in posterior mandibular rotation with increased incisor protrusion and opening of the anterior overbite [38].

# 58.3.6 Facial Development

The growth of the facial soft tissue follows the underlying facial bones but is not directly correlated with bone growth. Facial soft tissue is thicker relative to the underlying skeletal tissue in the young child owing to subcutaneous fat. This is one of the reasons it is more challenging to assess potential underlying skeletal discrepancies in the young child based only on a clinical appraisal. The thicker soft tissue envelope, together with the relative retrognathic position of the mandible, creates a more convex profile in infancy and early childhood. Lip thickness increases until it reaches a maximum at the end of the pubertal growth spurt and then decreases in late teens and adulthood [39, 40]. These later changes, combined with continued forward nasal growth as well as anterior mandibular and chin projection, leave the lips with a more retrusive appearance and the nose and chin with a more prominent appearance. These changes usually create a flatter facial profile in older adolescents and adults. This tendency is even greater on average in males than females, owing to less subcutaneous fat, combined

with more nasal cartilage growth and anterior mandibular and chin projection in males.

The facial soft tissue also follows the cephalocaudal growth gradient, with the soft tissue of the lower face growing more in magnitude and duration than the upper face. Before adolescence, vertical lip growth lags behind skeletal jaw growth, resulting in lack of resting lip apposition. During and after pubertal growth, vertical lip growth increases proportional to the underlying vertical skeletal growth, creating a more likely chance of resting lip apposition in adults [41].

There is significant growth in the length and prominence of the nose during adolescence, influencing the facial balance between the nose, the lips, and the chin [42]. In fact, the vertical nasal growth is much greater than anteroposterior or transverse nasal growth. Nasal growth during adolescence is primarily limited to cartilage and soft tissue because the nasal bone usually has completed growth before puberty. The nasal shape often changes before adolescence, with the upper nasal dorsum developing superiorly and anteriorly, and the lower nasal dorsum more often following the lower facial growth pattern. In other words, individuals who have a more anterior and superior rotational pattern of lower face growth will exhibit a similar rotation of the lower nasal dorsum. There is some evidence that skeletal class II jaw relationships usually demonstrate a more prominent nasal bridge and convex dorsum than balanced jaw relationships [43].

The upper third of the face grows the most rapidly early in life owing to brain growth and achieves its ultimate size earliest, finishing most growth by 12 years of age. Orbital height already reaches  $55\%$  of its adult height at birth and  $94\%$  by 7 years of age [44]. The middle and lower thirds of the face are less affected by brain growth, growing more slowly and for a longer time. Most of the middle third growth is completed later during puberty, with the lower third of the face continuing to grow beyond puberty into adulthood.

In addition to this vertical sequential growth gradient, craniofacial growth does not take place at an equal rate in the three planes of space. Facial growth follows a sequence in which transverse growth finishes first, followed by anteroposterior and finally vertical growth, although all three continue to some extent during adulthood [45]. The face reflects the early transverse neural expansion of the cranium, the early fusion of the mandibular symphysis, and the early growth cessation of the midpalatal suture during the first few years of life. The width of both jaws, including the dental arches, is largely completed before adolescent growth, with the exception of dental arches achieving greater width posteriorly owing to continued increase in jaw length. This presents

clinically as a disproportionately wide face relative to the height in the infant and young child. Both jaws continue to grow in length and height throughout pubertal growth. As the maxilla and mandible displace and grow downward and forward, the anteroposterior and vertical growth begin to take proportionately greater roles. The growth rate of the maxilla slows down after approximately 10 years of age and, together with anterior maxillary resorption, reduces the relative anterior projection of the midface. The maxillary length reaches maturity before the upper facial height, which is followed by mandibular length and finally ramus height [46]. The somewhat retrognathic position of the mandible at birth usually is corrected early in postnatal life. The mandible grows for a longer duration than the maxilla, typically undergoing a growth spurt at puberty. Anteroposterior growth is accompanied and then followed by vertical facial growth, primarily in the mandible, often continuing well beyond puberty, even into the third and fourth decades.

There are gender differences in facial growth, with males characteristically having volume changes of greater magnitude than females. Females have much less nasal growth on average, with many not even exhibiting a pubertal nasal growth spurt, in contrast to males who characteristically have a nasal growth spurt throughout puberty. Females have earlier soft tissue growth that follows their earlier puberty, and they have greater lip thickness at all ages. The flattening of the facial profile during adolescence is less dramatic in females, owing in part to their fuller lips and less prominent noses but also owing to females having less forward mandibular growth projection and chin growth. Females have on average more late vertical maxillary growth than males. If mandibular growth is not matching these late maxillary changes, the mandible translates downward and backward, resulting in a more convex profile. Not only are male facial volume changes on average greater in magnitude, but the duration of the changes is longer and there is more predominance of volume increase in the lower third of the face [47]. Males are on average more likely to have late mandibular growth that may be beneficial in improving a maxillary protrusion or mandibular retrusion but is disadvantageous when a mandibular prognathism or maxillary retrusion is present before late growth.

# 58.3.7 Growth and Facial Changes During Adulthood

There has been awareness since the late nineteenth century that human growth continues beyond adolescence, at least until the fourth or fifth decade of life [48].

Nevertheless, investigators in the mid-twentieth century were surprised to find that facial growth continues into the sixth decade of life [49]. Later, it was found that the craniofacial complex models throughout adulthood, with thickening of the frontal region of the cranium and a symmetrical modest increase in the size of the cranium, cranial base, maxilla, and mandible [50, 51].

In the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century, a number of longitudinal craniofacial growth studies have examined changes during adulthood [52-59]. Evaluation of the serial cephalometric radiographs in these studies revealed that craniofacial growth continues in all three dimensions, similar to the growth pattern and changes seen during adolescence, but of a much lesser magnitude and rate. Vertical increases are more prominent than anteroposterior changes with the least changes in width. The cephalocaudal gradient continues with more mandibular than maxillary changes. There is evidence of continued jaw rotation and dental eruption with the vertical changes. Females grow less and their craniofacial growth is expressed more vertically with posterior mandibular rotation and an increased mandibular plane angle, whereas males tend to grow with anterior mandibular rotation during adulthood, thereby straightening their profile and decreasing the mandibular plane angle (Fig. 58.15).

![](images/79b61cee7065e6133398a227174577b2189ad6ead532da2d0fff82fb65a03782.jpg)  
Fig. 58.15 Composite lateral cephalometric views of female and male show mean longitudinal growth changes from young adult (broken line at mean age 17) to middle age adult (solid line at mean age 47-51). Note continued downward and forward skeletal and soft tissue growth with relative flattening of the lips. (Adapted from Behrents [53])

It appears that there is a subtle growth acceleration in females during their 20s that may be attributable to the endocrine influence of their first pregnancy. Late mandibular incisor crowding usually develops as these incisors are positioned distally relative to the mandible owing to late mandibular growth. Accompanying the skeletal changes throughout adulthood, dental arches continue to change as well with decreasing arch width and depth, further increasing mandibular incisor irregularity [60].

Facial soft tissue changes during adulthood are much larger in magnitude than changes in hard tissue. Typical lip changes during adulthood include less prominence with decreased thickness, thinning of the vermilion and flattening of its contour (more so in the upper than the lower lip), increased upper lip vertical length, and less prominence of the philtral columns. Male lips continue to appear more retrusive with age, whereas female lips generally do not become as retrusive and their lower lip thickness tends to slightly increase. The lips become positioned more inferiorly, resulting in less vertical display of maxillary incisors, more vertical display of mandibular incisors, and less lip separation with age [61]. Glabella moves forward and downward. The nose and ears continue to increase in size in all dimensions, with the nasal tip and columella dropping inferiorly to create a more acute nasolabial angle, with all these features occurring to a greater extent in males. There is deepening of the nasolabial folds with jowling developing, and the oral commissures tend to sag inferiorly with the loss of elasticity [62]. Males tend to exhibit more chin prominence owing to continued soft tissue increase. The cervicomental angle usually becomes more obtuse from sagging soft tissue that is accentuated with submental fat deposition [63].

It is clear that while the great preponderance of craniofacial growth subsides after the completion of sexual maturity at the end of adolescence, growth continues on a small scale in all three planes throughout adulthood, following the adolescent pattern. Essentially, craniofacial growth must be viewed as an ongoing process throughout life with postadolescent transverse growth being minimal, followed by anteroposterior growth, with vertical growth being the greatest during adulthood [45]. Our improved understanding of the aging face should compel orthodontists and surgeons to carefully consider their treatment procedures in terms of their future cosmetic effects on the aging face. It is wise to attempt to increase dental and skeletal volume to tighten the facial soft tissue when possible. Any treatment that deepens nasolabial folds or decreases lower face height, lip projection, or vertical maxillary incisor display should be avoided. If any of these adverse changes are unavoidable in order to achieve an acceptable dental

occlusion, secondary soft tissue cosmetic procedures may ultimately be considered.

The biologic regulator mechanism for initiating and directing craniofacial growth and dental eruption timing, pattern, and rate remains a poorly understood phenomenon. It is clear that it is a complex mechanism, influenced by an intricate interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and local environmental factors.

# 58.4 Orthodontic, Orthopedic, and Orthognathic Clinical Considerations

# 58.4.1 Craniofacial Growth Assessment

An evaluation of physical development is needed when considering whether craniofacial orthopedic treatment or orthognathic surgery is indicated for an adolescent. One indicator for physical growth is skeletal maturation, which historically has been determined with a handwrist radiograph. This image provides a view of 30 bones with a predictable ossification sequence and still is considered the assessment standard for skeletal development. A somewhat less accurate, but acceptable, alternative, using standardized lateral cephalometric radiographs to assess cervical vertebral maturation, is being utilized more recently by orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons because it precludes the need for an additional radiograph [64, 65]. It is important that the orthodontist and surgeon not rely solely on this variable to predict the likelihood of adequate remaining jaw growth for successful orthopedic treatment or minimal jaw growth for successful orthognathic surgical treatment. Although it may provide some idea of growth potential, it certainly cannot accurately predict the magnitude, timing, or direction of remaining growth [66-68]. Superimposition of serial lateral cephalometric radiographs remains the most reliable current method for demonstrating minimal remaining adolescent craniofacial growth. Even with assurance from cephalometric radiographs that adolescent growth is complete, orthodontists and surgeons need to appreciate that the craniofacial growth pattern exhibited before and during adolescence will continue to some extent after orthognathic surgery long into adult life, leading to some return of previous jaw discrepancies in certain individuals, particularly those who have a growth pattern characterized by vertical excess, mandibular excess, or asymmetry. It is well recognized that orthognathic surgery will have a minimal effect on an individual's pattern of craniofacial growth, underscoring the importance of surgical correction of undesirable growth after it has occurred rather

than expecting growth to be redirected while it is occurring. Instability of orthopedic as well as orthognathic surgical treatment usually has much more to do with posttreatment growth than surgical relapse.

# 58.4.2 Orthopedic Treatment for Growth Modification

A harmonious aesthetic facial appearance and balanced dentoskeletal segments facilitating a functional occlusion are both goals that orthodontists and oral maxillofacial surgeons work to achieve by means of orthodontic treatment combined with orthognathic surgery. However, before a surgical correction is contemplated in a growing patient, a determination should be made as to whether the patient is a candidate for orthopedic treatment that may modify craniofacial growth to improve the skeletal imbalance to a favorable aesthetic and functional outcome without the need for orthognathic surgery. It is well known that craniofacial orthopedic devices can generate forces that cause stress in sutures capable of modifying suture growth [69]. As indicated earlier in the chapter, almost  $50\%$  of the total cumulative growth of the midface and mandible remains when a child is entering adolescence, making it possible to have an orthopedic treatment effect on the jaws before adolescent growth is completed.

In spite of over a century of clinical experience with orthopedic facial appliances, it remains controversial as to what extent craniofacial skeletal growth can be predictably and permanently modified by orthopedic treatment. Although consensus exists that there is an important genetic influence on the outcome of craniofacial growth, there is a wide range of views regarding the amount in which postnatal factors, particularly orthopedic treatment, influence this outcome. Views vary from the belief that orthopedic alteration of jaw relationships is predictable and stable to the contrasting opinion that skeletal growth is primarily determined genetically and cannot be significantly altered long term by orthopedic treatment. The current consensus based on our best basic and clinical data is that clinically significant craniofacial orthopedic treatment is possible, depending on the type of orthopedic treatment, the patient compliance, and the extent of skeletal growth during and after active treatment. The best outcome of craniofacial orthopedic treatment occurs when there is only mild to moderate skeletal discrepancies in patients with short or average face height and mild to moderate dental crowding. The poorest outcome is in individuals with more severe jaw discrepancies, a long lower face height, and moderate to severe dental crowding. It is essential that orthodontists and surgeons bear in mind

that dental compensation for the skeletal discrepancies is inevitable and some degree of facial aesthetic compromise may be a part of craniofacial orthopedic treatment.

The aim of craniofacial growth modification is to alter the growth pattern by changing the relationships of the jaws. If the skeletal unit is too large, the aim of the orthopedic treatment is to attenuate or redirect its growth to improve its relationship relative to the opposing smaller jaw. If the jaw is too small, the growth modification treatment is aimed at enhancing or redirecting its growth relative to the larger skeletal unit. Virtually all of the craniofacial growth modification appliances until the 1990s have been "toothborne" to some extent, so that the orthopedic forces applied to the skeletal units also create stress to the teeth that results in some dental movement. Although the goal of craniofacial growth modification is to limit the changes to the skeletal units while minimizing movement of the teeth, the reality is that most treatment is predominantly dentoalveolar with a possible minor skeletal component.

There is growing evidence that the long-term success of many forms of growth modification requires that the treatment be continued until facial growth is nearly complete, making early treatment a less efficient way to treat many jaw discrepancies. The following discussion summarizes the facial orthopedic options we have for clinical application of our present understanding of craniofacial growth in the three planes of space.

# 58.4.3 Transverse Orthopedic Treatment

Because transverse growth reaches completion earlier than anteroposterior or vertical craniofacial growth, it follows that transverse skeletal problems should be addressed early. The most common transverse skeletal problem is maxillary constriction, which can be treated in the preadolescent child even as early as during the primary dentition. The most recent federal epidemiologic study, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) conducted from 1989 through 1994, indicates that the prevalence of posterior crossbite is about  $5\%$  of the US population [70]. Significant facial or mandibular asymmetry represents approximately  $0.1\%$  of the total population [71]. Orthopedic expansion of the maxilla can be achieved with a variety of toothborne appliances (Fig. 58.16). These appliances apply moderate to high forces to the teeth that are transmitted as stresses to the maxilla, primarily distracting the midpalatal sutures but also producing less pronounced stresses to the sphenoid and zygomatic bones and other adjacent structures [72]. The midpalatal sutural expansion outcome is wider anteriorly due to the buttressing effect of more posterior max

illary structures. This anteroposterior differential in opening becomes more exaggerated when treating older children due to the greater posterior resistance with age. Within days after initial expansion, new bone forms,

eventually depositing both perpendicular and parallel to the edges of the expanded sutures [73]. Although a large amount of the skeletal expansion relapses during retention, overall stability is good if the extent of sutural patency and magnitude of expansion are great enough. A potential additional benefit to improvement in inter-arch transverse compatibility is an increase in dental arch perimeter made possible by the maxillary orthopedic expansion [74].

Although complete fusion of the midpalatal suture usually does not occur until the third postnatal decade, the process leading to fusion is a gradual one, characterized by progressive sutural interdigitation and ossification [75]. For this reason, more effective and parallel sutural separation, requiring less force and concomitant undesirable dental expansion, is possible in the younger child, especially before puberty, during a "phase 1" treatment in the mixed or early permanent dentition. Treatment before the peak pubertal growth velocity may result in greater long-term skeletal craniofacial transverse width [76]. Treatment may even be indicated as early as the primary dentition in the presence of a large transverse functional shift. This compensatory functional problem can result in asymmetrical condylar positioning that may lead to asymmetrical mandibular growth and uneven remodeling of the glenoid fossae, possibly resulting in permanent facial asymmetry, even if the constricted maxillary arch is corrected at a later date [77-79]. Maxillary constriction without a transverse functional shift does not carry the same urgency and is conveniently treated closer to the onset of puberty during the early permanent dentition [80].

Maxillary orthopedic expansion in late adolescent or postadolescent patients should be attempted with caution. Even if skeletal expansion is possible in these older patients, the extent of circum-maxillary and midpalatal sutural patency is limited enough to compromise stability of the treatment outcome. It is appropriate to confirm intermaxillary expansion with an occlusal radiograph in these patients, because the development of a midline diastema may only indicate bending of maxillary bones. If the expansion is limited to lateral tipping of maxillary posterior teeth, buccal alveolar bone height reduction and gingival recession may occur. It usually is more prudent to consider surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) for late adolescent or postadolescent patients to avoid periodontal compromises and instability. One should keep in mind that SARPE expansion will create much greater skeletal expansion across the canines as opposed to the more posterior expansion achieved by a conventional osteotomy.

The expansion appliance can be banded or bonded to the maxillary posterior teeth with a spring-loaded or non-spring-loaded palatal jackscrew that usually is acti

vated by the patient  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  /day, delivering from 2 to more than 10 pounds of force (this may increase to cumulative loads of 20 pounds or more with multiple activations in the absence of adequate sutural separation). The conventional description for the expansion induced with this appliance is "rapid palatal expansion." However, it is possible to affect slower expansion with less frequent activations  $(\leq 1\mathrm{mm} / \mathrm{wk})$ , requiring more active treatment time but less retention time to ensure stability [81]. It is feasible to achieve skeletal expansion with simpler appliances such as a W-arch or quad helix that deliver only a few hundred grams of force, provided that the patient is in the primary or very early mixed dentition when the maxillary sutures are more patent or when a cleft of the hard palate is present (Fig. 58.17).

Because all of these expansion appliances are toothborne, unwanted dentoalveolar expansion is an inevitable consequence [82, 83]. An additional undesirable outcome is the long-term loss of about  $30\%$  of the skeletal expansion achieved during active treatment due to

the rebound of stretched palatal tissues [84]. To compensate for these effects, maxillary expansion should be continued until adequate overexpansion is achieved, usually to the extent that the lingual cusps of the maxillary molars are opposing the buccal cusps of the mandibular molars (Fig. 58.18). Once adequate expansion has been accomplished, at least 3-6 months of retention is necessary to permit new bone to fill in the spaces created by maxillary separation and to permit time for dissipation of reaction forces stored in the facial bones that promote relapse. It is important to recognize that transverse maxillary skeletal expansion is notoriously unstable and prone to relapse, whether it is achieved orthopedically or surgically [85, 86]. Overexpansion accounts for some of the relapse and permits the orthodontist to transversely upright the posterior teeth in their alveolar housing without compromising the final transverse occlusal correction after retention. More recently developed osseointegrated attachments or temporary skeletal anchorage devices hold some promise

for a means of expanding the maxilla without buccally tipping posterior teeth and may improve the stability of the skeletal change (Fig. 58.19) [87]. However, there is preliminary evidence that skeletal anchorage for maxillary orthopedic expansion does not offer significant benefits over conventional toothborne appliances [88].

A less common transverse skeletal problem than maxillary constriction is asymmetrical mandibular deficiency, usually caused from a previous trauma associated with unilateral mandibular condylar fracture or hemifacial microsomia, a congenital facial asymmetry. In both of these conditions, the affected side exhibits growth deficiency relative to the unaffected or normal side, resulting in a mandibular deviation toward the affected side. If left untreated in a growing individual,

![](images/0d703b97a0008dcd07ff8fb855af758b3cb05062e4f9bc2977b80b8bae3ba5e0.jpg)

the alveolar processes compensate with limited eruption of the maxillary posterior teeth on the affected side and excessive eruption of the maxillary posterior teeth on the unaffected side, resulting in an occlusal cant that is higher on the affected side. It is best to start orthopedic treatment with these individuals before pubertal growth, as early as patient compliance will permit. The goal is to maximize the growth expression on the deficient side and minimize dentoalveolar compensation. The orthopedic appliance of choice is an asymmetrical "hybrid" functional appliance that is constructed to posture the mandible forward on the affected side, bringing the chin to the midline [89]. Posterior dental eruption is attenuated on the unaffected side with a bite block, and eruption is facilitated on the affected side with a buccal shield and the absence of interocclusal acrylic (  $\square$  Fig. 58.20). Because untreated mandibular asymmetries of this

nature invariably worsen with growth, orthopedic treatment is considered successful if the asymmetry remains stable or improves. Treatment should not continue if progressive asymmetry is apparent in spite of reliable appliance use by the patient.

# 58.4.4 Anteroposterior Orthopedic Treatment: Class II

A class II skeletal relationship can be the result of a retrusive and/or a deficient mandible, a protrusive or vertically excessive maxilla, or a combination of these skeletal problems. The prevalence of this type of malocclusion is approximately  $15 - 20\%$  of the US population, with approximately  $2\%$  severe enough to be considered as handicapping [70]. Prospective clinical studies have supported that early growth modification during the mixed dentition may lead to an improvement in the skeletal class II malocclusion [90-92]. It should be kept in mind that regardless of whether orthopedic treatment is attempted during active facial growth, approximately

$10\%$  of patients ultimately require orthognathic surgery to fully correct the class II malocclusion [92].

The headgear has been used as a means of class II orthopedic treatment in North America since the late nineteenth century (Fig. 58.21). An orthopedic force ranging from 16 to more than 32 ounces is delivered using elastic traction from the headgear to a cervical or cranial attachment for  $12 - 14\mathrm{h/day}$  usually for 9-12 months. A safety release for the retractive mechanism and parent/patient education are essential to prevent potential traumatic injuries. Theoretically, the force is transmitted in a posterior and superior direction via the teeth through the maxilla to compress the circummaxillary sutures, limiting or redirecting maxillary growth. Since the introduction of standardized cephalometric radiographs, many clinical studies have demonstrated that maxillary growth can be altered with the use of the headgear [93-95]. These clinical data have been supported by primate studies demonstrating that extraoral orthopedic force directed against the maxilla attenuates forward growth and alters bone apposition at the maxillary sutures [96-99]. Some retrospective studies

suggest that mandibular growth may be enhanced as well. Because the headgear is a toothborne appliance, some maxillary dental retraction accompanies the skeletal change. Another dentoalveolar effect is the attenuation of maxillary molar eruption, resulting in anterior and superior mandibular rotation. There is some support for this being the only clinically relevant skeletal effect [100]. A significant treatment effect usually requires that a headgear be worn 12–14 h/day. Human GH and other endocrine factors that promote growth and dental eruption are primarily released during the evening and night [101–103]. It is fortuitous that this is the only time of day that one can reliably expect an adolescent to wear a headgear. Because it is a removable appliance, few adolescents after the peak of pubertal growth will reliably wear the appliance.

The alternative orthopedic method for treating a class II skeletal relationship is the class II functional appliance, which has been used since the early twentieth century in Europe and since the 1960s in North America. These appliances include the removable toothborne activator, bionator, and twin block, the removable and primarily tissue-borne Fränkel (functional regulator) appliance, or the fixed toothborne Herbst appliance (Fig. 58.22). All of these appliances position the mandibular condyles downward and forward away from the glenoid fossae. Theoretically, the distracted condylar positions reduce the normal compressive joint pressure on the growing condylar cartilage and the forward mandibular posturing alters muscle tension on the condyles, stimulating or accelerating the endochondral condylar growth more than would normally occur. There is some support from animal studies that a histologic increase in condylar growth can be achieved [104-106]. Retrospective clinical studies have both supported [107-111] and refuted [112-115] that clinically significant lengthening of the mandible can be achieved with functional appliances. However, prospective, randomized clinical studies have more definitively confirmed that there is no greater absolute growth reflected by the long-term treatment outcome [116]. Much of the skeletal change demonstrated with a functional appliance may result from forces against the maxilla, similar to those applied with a headgear, which are created from the stretched facial muscles and soft tissues attempting to return the postured mandible back to its posterior and superior position [117, 118]. Because of the toothborne nature of this appliance, dentoalveolar changes accompany the skeletal changes, including maxillary dental retraction and mandibular dental protrusion.

Retrospective clinical studies have demonstrated few differences in treatment outcome when comparing the skeletal response between headgear and functional appliance treatment [111, 119, 120]. In the last decade of

the twentieth century, three prospective, randomized class II clinical trials conducted in the United States and Great Britain have all demonstrated that orthopedic treatment with either a headgear or a functional appliance in the mixed dentition results in an average improved short-term skeletal outcome. There is some evidence that there is more of a maxillary effect with headgears [92, 120] and more of a mandibular effect with functional appliances [91, 92, 120, 121]. Most functional appliances need to be worn for the same daily duration as the headgear (exceptions are the Frankel and Herbst appliances, which are worn full time) for a significant treatment effect. Much like the headgear, dependable wear is more realistic during the evening and at night when the most active facial growth and dental eruption usually occur. However, like the headgear, its removable nature prevents it from being reliably worn by most adolescents after the peak of their pubertal growth.

In the late 1960s, when European and American facial orthopedic philosophies were becoming more fully integrated, a method was introduced in Europe using a headgear in combination with a functional appliance (Fig. 58.23) [122]. This approach was intended to provide greater cumulative skeletal growth effects than use of either appliance alone, but this has yet to be demonstrated by clinical studies.

Although there is greater general acceptance that treatment with a headgear or functional appliance may achieve an improved long-term treatment outcome, there continues to be controversy over the optimum treatment time in the growing child. It has already been demonstrated that orthopedic class II treatment in the very young child, in the primary or early mixed dentition, results in substantial relapse and recurrence of the original facial skeletal pattern by late adolescence [123]. However, there is great debate regarding the long-term efficacy of orthopedic treatment during later mixed dentition as the first phase of a two-phase treatment versus delaying orthopedic treatment until definitive orthodontic treatment during puberty, after the eruption of the permanent dentition. Many orthodontists historically have preferred the earlier first phase because there is substantial potential growth remaining, compliance in wearing the orthopedic appliance often is greater, and the arch space for the remaining erupting dentition may be improved. The advocates for a delayed one-phase treatment have contended that comparable skeletal treatment effects can be achieved during definitive orthodontic treatment without putting the patient through an unnecessary initial phase [124, 125]. The three prospective, randomized class II clinical trials mentioned earlier have supported this position, demonstrating that early skeletal improvement achieved from these appliances seems to represent accelerated growth and can be

alternative is to utilize occlusal acrylic and bond the maxillary portion of the appliance with a removable acrylic splint for the mandibular arch. (a-e Reproduced with permission. a, c, and d from Bishara [189], p. 345. b from Graber and Vanarsdall [190]. e from McNamara and Brudon [188], p. 287)

used just as effectively later during pubertal growth [126-128]. They also showed that there was substantial individual growth variability with no reliable predictors for a favorable growth response identified and early

treatment did not reduce the need for dental extraction or orthognathic surgery during the definitive phase. These studies indicate that there is no adequate additional benefit in treatment outcome to justify the greater

burden to the patient, their parents, and the orthodontist, as represented by an early phase that precedes the definitive phase of orthodontic treatment [116].

It can be concluded from past retrospective and more recent prospective clinical trials that headgear treatment tends to have more of a maxillary-restrictive effect, whereas functional appliances have more of a mandibular-enhancing effect. Either approach can be satisfactory and should be selected on the basis of patient acceptance of the appliance and dentoalveolar side effects (there is more maxillary dental retrusion

with headgear and more mandibular protrusion with a functional appliance). The American and British prospective, randomized trials have clearly demonstrated that class II orthopedic treatment during the mixed dentition is justified only in selected cases in which there is short face height with impinging anterior overbite, predisposed to root resorption or trauma risk coupled with excessive overjet, sufficient aesthetic/psychosocial concern by the patient, or a precocious adolescent growth that substantially precedes dental development [129, 130]. Treatment at an earlier age has been further justified by the argument that there is lack of reliable means of predicting mandibular growth and that improved cooperation with a removable appliance usually is present with the younger patient [131].

In summary, the most ideal patient for class II orthopedic treatment would be pubertal with facially inclined and spaced maxillary incisors, lingually inclined mandibular incisors, a mild skeletal discrepancy, and a short or normal anterior face height. Although improvement in skeletal discrepancy is expected, the class II correction usually is due to a combined response of both the dentoalveolar and the skeletal components. Both head-gear and class II functional appliance use can be effective in limiting downward and forward eruption of the maxillary molars. However, the functional appliance tends to promote upward and forward eruption of mandibular molars, which may complement the correction in deep overbite cases but is counterproductive in patients with a long face. Because class II orthopedic appliances are toothborne, there may be some unwanted dentoalveolar change, including retraction of maxillary anterior teeth and protraction of mandibular anterior teeth. This compensatory change may be undesirable if the skeletal discrepancy ultimately requires orthognathic surgery for correction. With the advent of osseointegrated attachments or temporary skeletal anchorage devices, there may be the future possibility of preventing unwanted dentoalveolar change by attaching a force system directly to these attachments rather than using toothborne attachments. Orthodontic retention after class II orthopedic treatment as a part of definitive orthodontic treatment may require the use of a class II functional appliance at night for up to 24 months, particularly if they have significant adolescent growth remaining.

# 58.4.5 Anteroposterior Orthopedic Treatment: Class III

A class III skeletal relationship can be the result of a retrusive and/or deficient maxilla, a large and/or prognathic mandible, or, most often, a combination of these

skeletal problems. The prevalence of this type of malocclusion is approximately  $3 - 5\%$  of the US population, with approximately  $0.3\%$  severe enough to be considered as handicapping [70]. Since the late nineteenth century, when headgear was being used for class II skeletal problems, the chin cup was the appliance used for orthopedic treatment of skeletal class III problems (Fig. 58.24). Theoretically, an orthopedic force is transmitted to the mandibular condyles, compressing the condylar cartilage and limiting endochondral growth in order to decrease the ultimate length of the mandible [132]. Primate studies suggest that mandibular growth can be impeded with heavy full-time forces directed against the mandibular condyles [133]. Full-time wear with such excessive forces is unrealistic with humans. Most clinical studies, using tolerable forces (12-16 oz/side) and realistic daily wear  $(12 - 14\mathrm{h})$ , have demonstrated that mandibular growth is not restrained, but rather vertically redirected from chin cup wear, rotating the mandible down and back, resulting in decreased chin prominence while increasing face height [134-137]. Clinical studies also have suggested that the long-term stability of these changes is poor [138, 139]. The stability is dependent on favorable facial growth after active treatment, which is unpredictable but usually results in a resumption of the original facial growth pattern and relapse of the skeletal discrepancy during or after adolescent growth. An additional side effect from chin cup wear is more lingual inclination of lower incisors due to the force of the chin cup to the lower lip and base

![](images/29c44e2500199411a16a1c7d3f46be16f78e9bf6b219860b3ca839b084266f19.jpg)

of the mandibular anterior alveolar process [135]. Although this effect may help in the dentoalveolar compensation for the skeletal discrepancy, it usually does so at the expense of lower incisor crowding and increased relative chin prominence. Treatment with a chin cup may be an acceptable option for an individual with mild mandibular excess associated with decreased facial height (only one-third of the prognathic white population) but is contraindicated when there is a normal or excessive facial height, because the treatment outcome simply would be trading one deformity for another. East Asian populations may benefit more often from this treatment because they tend to have shorter face heights than whites. However, chin cup treatment for mandibular prognathism has very limited utility, with its benefits usually negated from subsequent growth and ultimately resulting in unnecessary additional treatment burden to the patient.

Class III functional appliances also have been developed, limiting eruption of mandibular posterior teeth and promoting eruption of maxillary posterior teeth and resulting in downward and backward mandibular rotation with increased facial height. These functional appliances have few advocates owing to their effectiveness, similar to chin cup treatment, being limited to dentoalveolar changes and their inability to promote forward maxillary growth or attenuate mandibular growth [140, 141]. Jean Delaire, a French dentist, was responsible for developing the protraction headgear or face mask, the most effective orthopedic appliance for skeletal class III prob

lems since its introduction in the early 1970s (Fig. 58.25) [142]. Delaire recognized that the offending jaw in many of the skeletal class III problems was the maxilla, so he departed from the historic focus on the mandible and directed treatment at the retrusive or deficient maxilla. The appliance creates tension in the circum-maxillary sutures with elastics from the maxillary dental arch to a frame that uses the forehead and chin to dissipate the force anteriorly. Primate studies have demonstrated adaptive responses of the sutures to the stress from the distraction forces produced by this appliance [73].

Depending on the developmental stage and size of the patient, a protractive force ranging from 2 to 4 pounds is applied to the face mask in an anterior and slightly inferior direction relative to the occlusal plane for  $12 - 16\mathrm{h / day}$  usually for 6-9 months. Clinical studies have demonstrated clinically relevant maxillary skeletal protraction downward and forward on average with this appliance, with some concomitant protraction of the maxillary teeth due to the toothborne nature of the intraoral part of the appliance [143-146]. However, as with other forms of craniofacial orthopedic treatment, there is substantial variability and an unpredictable patient response to the appliance, ranging from no appreciable skeletal change to about  $5\mathrm{mm}$  anterior maxillary movement [147]. It is important to achieve overcorrection of the anterior crossbite and anterior overbite because there is some relapse after discontinuation of treatment [148]. Additional effects of maxillary orthopedic protraction often include rotation of the maxilla downward in the posterior and upward in the anterior,

downward and backward rotation of the mandible, and retraction of the mandibular incisors due to the reactive posterior force dissipated on the chin. These additional orthopedic and dentoalveolar changes that accompany maxillary skeletal protraction would be contraindicated for a class III pattern with excessive vertical development (long anterior face height and obtuse gonial angle) or where mandibular excess is the underlying cause of the problem [149]. In summary, the most ideal patient for maxillary orthopedic protraction would be younger than 8 years old and would have a mild skeletal discrepancy without mandibular prognathism, a short anterior face height, and retrusive maxillary incisors.

Although some clinicians have promoted the orthopedic distraction of the midpalatal suture to enhance subsequent anterior protraction with the face mask [150], this has not demonstrated improved treatment efficacy [151]. The timing of face mask therapy often is recommended for patients in the primary to early mixed dentition (i.e., ages 4-8) owing to the increased patency of the maxillary sutures and compliance with appliance wear at this age [152, 153]. As the patient ages, there is more interdigitation and ossification of the circummaxillary sutures, resulting in less skeletal and more dental response to the protraction forces. However, the earliest practical time for starting treatment is after eruption of first permanent molars owing to the poor anchorage provided by the primary dentition alone for the intraoral portion of the appliance. Although some clinical studies have found few differences between early and late treatment up until puberty [153-156], more

controlled studies have shown that skeletal change diminishes after age 8 after which mostly tooth movement and backward mandibular rotation can be expected [152]. The limited skeletal change after this age is undoubtedly due to increased resistance from more mature sutures posterior and superior to the maxilla.

The stability of maxillary orthopedic protraction with a face mask is variable and dependent on whether mandibular growth ultimately overwhelms the skeletal improvement after active treatment. It should be expected that the original facial growth pattern will continue after treatment, often resulting in relapse of the skeletal discrepancy. Approximately  $30\%$  of patients end up in anterior crossbite in late adolescence, most of whom will ultimately require orthognathic surgery to fully correct the class III malocclusion [157, 158]. It should be kept in mind that long-term efficacy of face mask treatment has not been fully studied.

Toothborne class III orthopedic appliances, as with class II devices, result in dentoalveolar movements that accompany the skeletal changes. Treatment with the face mask causes protraction of maxillary anterior teeth and retraction of mandibular anterior teeth. The development of osseointegrated attachments or temporary skeletal anchorage devices may make it possible to transmit the orthopedic protraction force to intraoral skeletal attachments that prevent undesirable dentoalveolar changes [159, 160]. Orthodontic retention for class III orthopedic treatment may require the use of a class III functional appliance at night for up to 24 months after definitive orthodontic treatment, particularly if they have posttreatment adolescent growth remaining. However, it is wise to wait before initiating the definitive treatment as close as possible to the completion of adolescent growth to minimize overcompensation for a skeletal discrepancy that ultimately requires orthognathic surgery. A particularly challenging aspect of treating skeletal class III problems (as well as vertical skeletal excess problems) is that short-term successful treatment, whether it occurs during or at the completion of adolescent growth, may relapse due to the continued class III growth pattern during adulthood [161].

A recently developed novel method of class III orthopedic treatment, termed "bone-anchored maxillary protraction" (BAMP), has used maxillary posterior and mandibular anterior miniplates as skeletal anchorage in children 10–12 years of age (Fig. 58.26) [162]. Relatively light  $(150 - 250\mathrm{g / side})$  full-time use of class III maxillomandibular intraoral elastic traction used with this method has produced remarkable maxillary skeletal protraction within about 12 months without the concomitant maxillary dentoalveolar protraction seen in more conventional face mask treatment (Fig. 58.27). Preliminary data indicate that this treatment results in

anterior movement of the zygoma and maxilla and corresponding soft tissue with variable effects on the mandible in different individuals [163, 164]. There is evidence that treatment using this new method results in much larger maxillary advancement with better controlled vertical changes than the conventional orthopedic treatment with face mask. There may be a short window of treatment opportunity with this technique because mandibular miniplates cannot be placed before canine eruption and circum-maxillary sutural patency is more limited at older ages.

# 58.4.6 Vertical Orthopedic Treatment

Excessive vertical face height is characterized by a posterior maxilla that is inferiorly positioned, resulting in downward and backward rotation of the mandible, resulting in an increased mandibular plane angle and incompetent lips. Although most individuals with excess vertical face height exhibit anterior open bite, a minority will have excessive eruption of maxillary anterior teeth preventing open bite but worsening the excess vertical display of the maxillary gingiva and anterior teeth. The prevalence of excess vertical facial problems is less than  $5\%$  of the US population with approximately  $0.3\%$  considered as handicapping [70, 71].

The orthodontist has not historically had very effective nonsurgical options to manage vertical skeletal problems. Orthopedic treatment strategy has historically been directed at restraining vertical maxillary growth and posterior dental eruption in order to promote anterior and superior mandibular rotation because it is usually associated with a class II skeletal discrepancy. A high-pull headgear is used to apply a superior intrusive force of 2-4 pounds to inhibit eruption of maxillary posterior teeth and compress circum-maxillary sutures to limit the downward development of the maxilla. An alternative to the use of high-pull headgear is a removable orthopedic appliance that incorporates interocclusal acrylic bite blocks in order to stretch the facial musculature and soft tissue beyond the normal resting vertical dimension, creating a reactive intrusive force against the mandibular as well as the maxillary teeth [165, 166]. Neither of these methods has been very effective, perhaps owing to the extensive duration of wear required by the patient daily and throughout adolescent growth. Repelling magnets have been embedded in the opposing acrylic bite blocks to accentuate the intrusive force with no significant treatment benefit [167-170].

High-pull headgear and interocclusal acrylic have been combined into one appliance with the hope that this approach may provide greater cumulative skeletal growth effects than the use of either appliance alone

[171]. Unfortunately, this combined treatment demonstrates no appreciable additional benefit in controlling excess vertical growth [172].

In summary, neither the high-pull headgear nor interocclusal acrylic alone or in combination offers appreciable effective treatment for vertical skeletal excess. A final challenge in the use of either or both of these orthopedic appliances to treat vertical maxillary excess is the inability to direct the orthopedic force in a straight vertical manner. Both methods include some posteriorly directed force to the maxilla that is not appropriate unless the maxilla is protrusive as well as inferiorly positioned. It also is counterproductive in a patient with maxillary vertical excess combined with a class III skeletal relationship. Just as the protraction headgear should not be used with this individual to address the anteroposterior skeletal problem, the high-pull headgear and/or interocclusal bite block are contraindicated in this same clinical situation to address the vertical excess.

The clinical introduction of temporary anchorage devices in the form of miniplates [173] or miniscrews [174, 175] offers a new and potentially more successful way of orthopedically controlling mild to moderate vertical skeletal excess. Miniplates or miniscrews permit skeletal anchorage to intrude posterior teeth as a means of dentoalveolar compensation for the skeletal discrepancy. The posterior dental intrusion has shown short-term success in rotating the mandible upward and forward, closing mild to moderate anterior open bites. The extent to which posterior teeth can be orthodontically intruded by this means has not yet been determined. In addition, no substantial posttreatment data are yet available to confirm the long-term stability of this treatment approach. If this treatment takes place before the end of adolescent growth, it is likely that the continued vertical skeletal growth pattern will cause relapse. Even if this short-term successful treatment occurs after adolescent growth is complete, the continued vertical growth pattern during adulthood may lead

to some return of the malocclusion. No studies to date have been able to demonstrate long-term stability with any nonsurgical orthopedic methods for correcting vertical maxillary excess, with or without an anterior open bite [176]. Achieving stability is particularly difficult owing to the extended duration of vertical facial growth continuing well beyond adolescence [53]. The long duration of active orthopedic treatment as well as duration of vertical growth makes the excessive vertical plane of space the most difficult to successfully manage by the orthodontist attempting facial growth modification.

Deficient vertical face height usually is a result of more posterior than anterior mandibular vertical growth with deficient vertical eruption of posterior teeth and anterior mandibular rotation, resulting in deep anterior overbite with lingual inclination of incisors. It is common for deficient face height to be associated with a mandibular or maxillary anteroposterior deficiency resulting in a class II or class III malocclusion. Orthodontic treatment directed at encouraging posterior eruption or extruding posterior teeth to improve facial height may include a functional appliance or a cervical headgear, in combination with an anterior bite plane, to disocclude posterior teeth. This may be successful with a class II malocclusion if upper molar eruption is limited, lower molar eruption is encouraged, and there is adequate mandibular growth to compensate for the resulting downward and backward mandibular rotation. It also may be successful with a class III malocclusion if upper molar eruption is encouraged, lower molar eruption is limited, and there is minimal mandibular growth after active orthodontic treatment. In contrast to the treatment stability of excess face height, long-term stability of treated deficient vertical face height is quite good [177].

Facial orthopedic treatment may be effective in resolving mild to moderate skeletal discrepancies in some patients. The indication for craniofacial skeletal growth modification before adolescence is a maxillary deficiency in any plane of space or a progressive deformity, usually causing facial asymmetry. No growth modification can be justified for mandibular excess. Class II skeletal problems should not be addressed before adolescent growth except for a small number of selected cases involving trauma, root resorption risk, or psychosocial concerns. An orthopedic phase should be attempted with a specific treatment time frame established in order to assess treatment progress toward successful correction. This time frame must be honored in order to prevent protracted treatment with excessive dental compensations that need to be reversed for surgical correction. The orthodontist attempting growth modification must be mindful of the duration and extent of treatment to prevent excessive length and morbidity of the orthodontic treatment. If significant skeletal improvement is not being achieved within 6-8 months

of starting orthopedic treatment, the case needs to be reevaluated and the growth modification treatment likely abandoned as a treatment choice.

It has become clear that there is great variability in individual treatment response, even when factoring out wear compliance and duration of treatment. It has not been possible to identify the variables to explain why some patients respond well and some do not demonstrate any significant skeletal improvement with treatment regardless of their facial morphology or the severity of their skeletal discrepancy. It is anticipated that future research will reveal the variables that will enable the clinician to better predict treatment response.

It also is expected that research will provide a greater understanding of the nature and extent of facial growth modification possible in individual patients as well as the type of appliance and timing of treatment to achieve the best outcome. The development of intraoral skeletal anchorage attachments holds promise for a future means of dissipating orthopedic forces to prevent unwanted dentoalveolar changes that at present occur with our toothborne appliances. Analogous attachments are at present undergoing clinical testing for surgically assisted orthopedic movements associated with distraction osteogenesis [178, 179]. Recent and future advances in developmental biology and genomics hold great promise in increasing our understanding of the molecular and genetic mediators of craniofacial growth. This understanding will be crucial for us to make constructive modifications of our treatment methods to target these mediators in order to prevent or correct a craniofacial anomaly or developmental deformity.

# 58.4.7 Orthodontic Camouflage: Orthopedic Consequence Versus Surgical Preparation

Orthodontic camouflage, rather than orthognathic surgery, may indeed be an appropriate treatment choice for some mild and moderate skeletal malocclusions in patients who are beyond pubertal growth. Successful camouflage is predicated on a favorable dental occlusion that will not be overly unfavorable to the patient's facial aesthetic appearance. Because aesthetic appearance is subjective in nature, it is essential to have the patient's and parent's perceptions dictate whether camouflage is a reasonable option. Camouflage can be considered when there are normal vertical facial proportions and minimal crowding of teeth so that extractions can be used for

retraction of anterior teeth rather than to simply alleviate crowding.

Most mild and some moderate skeletal class II malocclusions can be effectively camouflaged with extraction of two maxillary premolars and retraction of maxillary anterior teeth, leaving the posterior teeth in a class II occlusion. However, these cases should mainly be limited to those that present without significant dental crowding, some protrusion of the maxillary incisors, and where there is not significant maxillary gingival display on smiling. If the maxillary incisors are normally or palatally inclined before treatment, orthodontic retraction of these teeth may result in an even poorer aesthetic result than the original problem even if the occlusion is acceptable. The unaesthetic appearance includes not just the incisor inclination but often an unattractive retrusive upper lip and increased maxillary gingival exposure during smiling as well. This is why the recent introduction of palatal implants, miniplates, and miniscrews as skeletal orthodontic anchorage, which provide the opportunity for the orthodontist to retract maxillary incisors even further than was previously possible, is a mixed blessing.

It is more challenging to camouflage class III than class II skeletal malocclusions because considerable natural dentoalveolar camouflage (proclined maxillary incisors, lingually inclined mandibular incisors) is often already present before treatment. Unlike camouflage class II treatment, successful class III camouflage treatment is only limited to mild skeletal discrepancies. Additional maxillary incisor proclination may be unaesthetic, and further lingual inclination of mandibular incisors usually accentuates an already prominent chin. For this reason, extraction of mandibular premolars to permit more retraction of mandibular incisors to obtain positive overjet often compromises the aesthetic outcome. If interarch tooth size compatibility can be maintained, extraction of one mandibular incisor rather than two premolars may provide an acceptable compromise. It is crucial not to begin class III camouflage as a definitive treatment until completion of adolescent growth to minimize posttreatment relapse. Camouflage of an anterior open bite that is due to maxillary vertical excess has been notoriously unsuccessful in the past. It remains to be seen whether the newly introduced skeletal anchorage devices for posterior orthodontic intrusion offer stable long-term treatment of mild to moderate skeletal anterior open bite problems. An orthodontic technique for stably extruding anterior teeth has been introduced [180]. Unfortunately, this only exacerbates the excessive vertical display of maxillary gingiva and anterior teeth.

# Conclusion

The surgeon's understanding of craniofacial growth has an important impact on clinical treatment decisions to alter craniofacial morphology. This understanding is relevant to the appreciation of the role of orthopedic treatment in the prepubertal and pubertal patient to limit or preclude the need for corrective surgery at a later age. Clinically relevant modification of craniofacial growth is possible, but substantial advances will be necessary to elucidate how growth modification can be accomplished in a controlled and predictable manner to achieve an efficacious outcome. Optimal timing and stability of craniofacial surgery are dependent on a thorough appreciation of the sequence, timing, magnitude, and differential expression of craniofacial growth. The recent dramatic advances in developmental genetics and molecular biology, highlighted by complete mapping of the human genome, familial genetic studies, and gene targeting in mice and humans, promises an explosive increase to our understanding of the complex interactions of the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences that determine human craniofacial morphogenesis, prenatal development, and postnatal growth. A more thorough understanding of these influences and their interactions will be necessary to determine the best timing and method of clinical intervention to achieve the optimum treatment outcome.
