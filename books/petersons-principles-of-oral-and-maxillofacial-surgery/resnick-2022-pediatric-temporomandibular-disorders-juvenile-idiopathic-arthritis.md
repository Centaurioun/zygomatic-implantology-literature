# 56.1 Introduction

Temporomandibular disorders differ considerably between children and adults. In adults, disc displacement and osteoarthritis are the most common causes. In the pediatric population, other etiologies of temporomandibular dysfunction including trauma, ankylosis, neoplasm, condylar hypertrophy, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), idiopathic condylar resorption, and congenital malformation are more prevalent. This chapter will focus on the effects of juvenile idiopathic arthritis on the temporomandibular joint and dentofacial development; some other diagnoses affecting the temporomandibular joint are covered in other chapters.

JIA is the most common chronic pediatric rheumatologic disease [1]. JIA can affect any synovial joint, and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is involved in up to  $90\%$  of patients [2]. JIA is a diagnosis of exclusion, considered in children age 16 years and younger with a history of joint pain, swelling, limited range of motion, and/or heat for at least 6 weeks. There are 7 disease subtypes, and the TMJ can be involved with any type.

Unique anatomic features of the TMJ may contribute to the greater difficulty in diagnosing arthritic involvement and the poorer response to systemic medication treatment in the TMJ compared to other joints. The primary growth site of the mandible is located within the condyle, separated from the intra-articular space by only a thin layer of cartilage. This protective layer consists of fibrocartilage, rather than the hyaline cartilage found in most joints [3]. Additionally, the TMJs are the only joints in the body that are connected across the midline and are among the most frequently used joints [2].

Comprehensive management of TMJ arthritis requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary team. The care team typically includes a pediatric rheumatologist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, orthodontist, and radiologist. Other providers such as physical therapists and pediatric dentists may also be needed.

# Definition

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune, noninfective, inflammatory joint disease of more than 6 weeks duration in children less than 16 years of age. Six subtypes of JIA:

1. Systemic  
2. Oligoarticular  
3. Polyarticular  
4. Juvenile psoriatic articular  
5. Enthesitis-related JIA  
6. Undifferentiated arthritis

# Learning Aims

1. The TMJ is difficult to assess both clinically and with imaging studies in children.  
2. MRI with contrast is the optimal imaging method for early diagnosis of JIA of the TMJ.  
3. Early clinical findings are seldom present and therefore early diagnosis is difficult.  
4. Medical therapy with DMARD is a proven benefit.  
5. Intra-articular steroids may have a short-term benefit but may induce heterotopic bone formation.  
6. Treatment options for young patients with JIA of TMJ are much different than adults with internal derangement of the TMJ meniscus.

# 56.2 Diagnosis

# Evaluation Tips and Tricks

1. Pain assessment and functional impairment.  
2. Measure range of motion (ROM).  
3. Evaluate facial growth asymmetry, occlusal canting, and retrognathia.  
4. Evaluate dental malocclusion, especially open bite.  
5. Document MRI inflammation and CT abnormality of TMJ.

Most children with TMJ involvement will be asymptomatic in the early stages, making diagnosis difficult [4, 5]. Unilateral or bilateral condylar erosion may go unnoticed until a skeletal deformity and/or malocclusion becomes apparent. Later in the disease course, pain, limitation of mouth opening, and mandibular deviation may occur [6, 7]. For bilateral involvement, the end-stage skeletal deformity may include mandibular retrognathia, long anterior and short posterior facial heights, and anterior open bite. Pain, disc dysfunction, impaired mastication and mouth opening, obstructive sleep apnea, and decreased quality of life are prominent [6, 8]. Unilateral TMJ involvement may cause mandibular deviation and facial asymmetry.

History and physical examination are poor predictors of TMJ involvement in JIA [9]. Despite this, standardized orofacial examination provides useful clues to the effect of TMJ disease and facilitates longitudinal evaluation [10, 11]. Imaging is the primary diagnostic modality for TMJ arthritis. Conventional radiographs such as plain films and panoramic radiographs may be useful in screening, but have poor sensitivity for condylar deformation and cannot detect inflammation [12, 13]. Ultrasonography also has poor predictive value [5]. Computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT

(CBCT) provide excellent visualization of the osseous structures of the TMJ and the dentofacial structures and are useful for longitudinal evaluation and surgical planning, but cannot identify active inflammation [14]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast infusion is considered the gold standard for diagnosis [15, 16]. MRI can both assess chronic joint degeneration and infer arthritic activity [17-19]. MRI can also be used to evaluate treatment outcomes [20, 21].

TMJ involvement from JIA must be differentiated from other similar conditions. Myofascial pain disorder (MPD) can cause facial pain, limited mandibular range of motion, and joint noise, similar to JIA. MPD is also more common in patients with JIA compared to the general population [22]. MRI may be useful in differentiating these two conditions, though synovitis can occur in MPD and other temporomandibular disorders and so is not diagnostic of JIA [23].

Idiopathic condylar resorption (ICR) is another condition that may mimic TMJ involvement from JIA. ICR is a condition of unknown etiology that causes progressive condylar resorption, similar to JIA. It predominates in females in the second and third decades of life, prompting a possible link to 17B-estradiol level [24]. ICR is typically bilateral and symmetric and is isolated to the TMJ with no extra-craniofacial effects. When a patient suspected to have TMJ arthritis has no signs of arthritis in other joints, a TMJ-only form of monoarticular JIA versus ICR must be considered [25]. Some believe that ICR does not represent a distinct condition, but rather is a subtype of JIA.

# 56.3 Management of Arthritis

Medical control of systemic inflammation is critical to successful management of TMJ arthritis. Aggressive use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is often necessary, and use of these medications may also be indicated in TMJ-only and TMJ-predominant variants of JIA [26, 27]. Intra-articular steroid injections (IASI) have been used to decrease local TMJ inflammation and improve symptoms. While IASI does decrease inflammation in the short term [21], this treatment has not been shown to alter the course of the disease [28]. Stoll reported heterotopic bone formation in 33 children out of 238 that received intra-articular steroid injections. Although there was obvious bone formation no child developed severe condylar resorption, most had good range of motion and few had ankylosis [29] (Fig. 56.1).

# 56.4 Management of TMJ Symptoms

Facial pain associated with TMJ involvement in JIA may be due to intra-articular arthritis, joint dysfunction, and/or myofascial inflammation. When synovitis is responsible, optimization of systemic medication treatment may relieve symptoms. Pain associated with joint dysfunction and myofascial pain may respond to orthodontic splint therapy [30] and/or physical therapy [31].

IASI has been shown to decrease pain and improve mouth opening in patients with TMJ synovitis and JIA [20, 28, 29, 32]. However, the effects of IASI are typically not sustained beyond 1 year [32]. Furthermore, as animal [33, 34] and human studies have raised concern for possible growth inhibition [35] and heterotopic bone formation [36] associated with IASI, the routine use of IASI for symptomatic management is no longer recommended in skeletally immature patients [37].

# 56.5 Development of Dentofacial Deformity

While the mechanism of development of the dentofacial deformity seen in patients with TMJ involvement from JIA is not fully understood, it likely involves a confluence of growth inhibition, joint degeneration, and skeletal and dental compensation [38]. The process is initiated by the direct effect of TMJ arthritis on the condylar cartilage, leading to growth inhabitation and condylar erosion. The condylar deformity that results causes an increase in joint friction and mechanical stress, thereby inducing chronic low-grade inflammation [39]. This chronic inflammation causes further growth impairment and joint degeneration, thereby perpetuating the cycle of dysfunction. This cycle may continue to worsen even after the initiating arthritis has become quiescent or been medically controlled [40]. Interestingly, the degree of condylar deformity is not directly correlated to the severity of the dentofacial deformity [41].

The timing and laterality of the TMJ arthritis dictates the type and extent of the dentofacial deformity it causes. In growing children, arthritis both decreases ongoing growth and erodes condylar mass, leading to impaired posterior vertical growth. The lack of adequate posterior mandibular enlargement induces a similar pattern in the maxilla, causing clockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex from its normal position. When this occurs bilaterally, the result is a steep occlusal plane with long anterior and short posterior facial heights and mandibular retrognathia [42]. An

often appears far worse than clinical function, but in this case, jaw range of motion was severe and required total joint reconstruction without orthognathic changes

anterior open bite is often not present when the skeletal change beings early and occurs slowly, as dentoalveolar compensation minimizes the malocclusion. Similarly, maintenance of normal overjet is typical. When the arthritis is unilateral, mandibular deviation toward the affected side occurs. Decreased freeway space on the shortened side inhibits adequate dentoalveolar growth, resulting in canting of the occlusal plane up on the affected side and a roll deformity of the maxilla. Acute arthritis from around the ages of 9-12 years, coinciding with the most rapid period of mandibular growth, likely has the largest impact on dentofacial development [42] (Fig. 56.2).

When TMJ arthritis occurs after skeletal maturity, the effect is TMJ deformation, but without the growth inhibition seen in children. Furthermore, skeletal com

pensation is less extensive than in the younger patient. The resulting deformity, therefore, is more likely to include an anterior open bite and excessive overjet. The maxilla may be normally positioned or may have a more minor deformity than typically seen in patients with early-onset disease (Fig. 56.3).

# 56.6 Management of Dentofacial Deformity

Management of the dentofacial deformity in JIA is dictated primarily by the stage of skeletal maturity, severity of the deformity, and level of disease control. Multidisciplinary management and optimal medical control of the systemic disease are paramount to successful treatment.

# 56.6.1 Interceptive Treatment in Growing Patients

The primary interceptive treatment in growing patients with minor-moderate deformities is an orthopedic splint. The goal of splint therapy is to improve posterior vertical mandibular height and symmetry and to provide mandibular advancement, as necessary. This approach will avoid the need for surgical treatment in some patients [43-45]. Functional loading with an orthopedic splint may reduce the catabolic effects of inflammatory mediators in the TMJ [46, 47] and may allow comparable vertical growth between the affected and unaffected sides in patients with unilateral disease [43, 44].

Orthopedic splint treatment may be in the form of a "distraction splint" or an "activator" appliance. The distraction splint, first introduced by Pedersen et al. in 1995 [48], is a hard acrylic appliance that covers the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular dentition and disoccludes the teeth. The splint is adjusted every 8 weeks with the gradual addition of acrylic material, leading to downward and forward distraction of the affected side(s). Early initiation of treatment and full-time, long-term wear until adolescence are necessary to achieve the best outcomes [45]. Splint treatment will result in creation of a posterior open bite on one side (if unilateral) or both sides (if bilateral), and this is closed after completion of splint therapy using an activator appliance or fixed orthodontic appliances.

An activator appliance may be used as an alternative to the distraction splint. This is a monobloc acrylic splint that covers both the maxillary and mandibular

dentition. It can be used for bilateral TMJ involvement resulting in clockwise mandibular rotation and retrognathia, as it creates mandibular advancement and controls dental eruption [49]. Unlike the distraction splint, the activator is used only during the period of rapid dentoalveolar growth and frequent adjustment is not necessary. As noted above, the activator may be used after a distraction splint to guide closure of the open bite that results from the distraction splint.

For patients with quiescent TMJ arthritis and severe deformity, or for those who did not have orthopedic treatment and/or were poor or incomplete responders to this treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) can be performed during growth. DO, which harnesses natural healing mechanisms to produce bone and soft tissues, can provide both vertical and sagittal repositioning of the mandible. DO can be used in patients with unilateral TMJ involvement to correct asymmetry [50] or in bilateral cases to provide counterclockwise rotation and advancement of the mandible [51, 52]. DO can be combined with orthopedic splint treatment to decrease joint loading and guide dental eruption [45].

Reconstruction of the severely deformed TMJ with autologous or alloplastic materials can be performed in growing patients but must be done with caution. Costochondral grafts (CCG), the most common autologous reconstruction, have the potential for future growth [53]. This growth, however, is unpredictable; overgrowth or undergrowth may occur [54-56]. As 20-year stability data has emerged [57], alloplastic total joint replacement (TJR), which has traditionally been avoided in skeletally immature individuals, has been expanded to pediatric patients in recent years [58].

# 56.6.2 Correction of the End-Stage Deformity

In a skeletally mature patient with dentofacial deformity resulting from JIA, the approach to reconstruction is largely dependent on disease activity and severity of the deformity. Surgical options can be broadly categorized as "joint sparing" and "joint reconstruction" [59]. Joint sparing approaches are those that modify the mandibular position and occlusion without directly accessing the joint space, thereby maintaining joint structures including the synovial lining and the articular disc. The primary joint sparing approaches are orthognathic surgery (i.e., bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) or inverted-L osteotomy) and DO. Joint reconstruction options involve direct access to the TMJ, with resection of the synovial tissue. The disc may be spared if intact or removed and replaced. The diseased condyle is resected and replaced with autologous tissue (i.e., CCG) or alloplastic material (TJR). The glenoid fossa may also be remodeled or replaced, particularly with TJR.

In patients with quiescent TMJ arthritis and minormoderate deformity, orthognathic surgery may be the best corrective option. Orthognathic surgery has the advantage of being performed using transoral access to avoid facial scarring and risk to the facial nerve and has a long track record of precise occlusal correction and stability. As with other joint sparing approaches, however, orthognathic surgery does not directly address the joint disease; additional condylar resorption may occur if the disease returns or flairs, resulting in recurrence of the dentofacial deformity. Additionally, achieving large

counterclockwise rotations of the mandible may be difficult with BSSO and inverted-L osteotomies given restrictions by the pterygomasseteric sling, suprahyoid muscles, and soft tissue envelope. Only small case series of patients with JIA who had orthognathic surgery exist, and these report an average relapse of  $2.1 - 2.3\mathrm{mm}$  which is significantly larger than that seen in subjects without JIA [60, 61] (Fig. 56.4).

Mandibular DO, which can be used during growth as noted above, can also be used in skeletally mature patients with moderate-severe deformity and quiescent disease. Mandibular advancement and counterclockwise rotation can be achieved using single-vector devices applied to the ramus at an oblique angle or with curvilinear or multi-vector appliances. As DO expands both hard and soft tissues, greater advancement and rotation may be achievable with this technique compared to other approaches. In a prospective study of 23 patients with unilateral JIA mandibular deformities that underwent DO combined with orthopedic splint treatment, Norholt et al. reported predictable correction of the asymmetry as well as improvement in pain and function [50].

In patients with TMJ arthritis that cannot be completely controlled, and/or in those with severe dentofacial deformities, a joint reconstruction approach may be preferred. Removal of the diseased synovial lining theoretically cures the arthritis within this joint. However, synovial regeneration and return of arthritis is possible [62, 63]. Additionally, joint reconstruction allows more mandibular advancement and rotation than orthognathic surgery, may improve function if the natural joint has been severely eroded, and may provide a more pre

![](images/c18727de5d287b7f558d5657154ad387f5174f926a80c8bb6c4e0930cad11c1c.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 56.4 Joint sparring reconstructive surgery in the adult JIA patient. This patient did not benefit from early diagnosis and medical therapy such as DMARDS and IAS. She presented with severe condylar resorption, but no TMJ pain and good range of motion. Condyle pathology remained stable for at least 1 yr. before surgery. Surgical correction by Le Fort advancement, counterclockwise rotation, bilateral sagittal split advancement, and genioplasty. Note the

dictable outcome if planning for a joint sparing approach is complicated by lack of a reproducible mandibular resting position [59].

CCG has been used successfully for condylar reconstruction in patients of all ages [64]. This reconstruction has been shown to have excellent long-term stability in subjects with ICR who have similar dentofacial deformity to that seen in patients with bilateral TMJ involvement from JIA [65]. Small series have shown similar success and stability in patients with JIA [64, 66, 67]. Use of autologous tissue, however, carries the theoretical risk of graft resorption if the arthritis returns, donor site morbidity, and a small risk for ankylosis [68]. In addition, when using CCG, the achievable magnitude of mandibular advancement and counterclockwise rotation may be limited by the length of the graft harvested

increase in posterior airway space, and improved facial profile. Postoperative occlusion is stable 5 years later without further condylar resorption. Most condylar resorption will reach a final state and can be treated without condylar reconstruction. Note, not all JIA TMJ resorption will require total joint reconstruction but depends on the surgeon's preference, predictability of the skeletal change, and goals of joint function

and the inability to osteotomized the CCG to provide multiple planes. Vascularized free tissue transfer, such as the free fibula flap, may overcome these latter obstacles, but has not been reported in patients with JIA.

TJR has the advantages of immunity to arthritic degeneration, lack of donor site morbidity, and the ability to customize the shape and fit of the prosthesis. Small case series have reported successful outcomes with TJR in patients with JIA [69-73]. This approach is particularly suited to complicated deformities and patients with continued arthritis that cannot be adequately controlled. TJR is also advantageous in patients requiring concomitant maxillary operations, as the reconstruction is precise and dimensionally stable and can be easily planned to fit with simultaneous procedures. Despite the promise of TJR, however, it must be remembered that complica

tions, such as erosion of surrounding bone, biofilm infections, and heterotopic bone formation, do occur [74] and that the very long-term outcome of these joints remains unknown.

Any of these mandibular operations can be combined with other procedures. Concomitant Le Fort I osteotomy, for example, is often necessary to complete correction of the JIA dentofacial deformity. Depending on the age of onset and severity of the disease, the degree of maxillary deformity is highly variable. In unilateral disease, both jaws are frequently canted and thus bimaxillary surgery is required for correction. In bilateral disease, posterior maxillary lengthening is often necessary to normalize the steep occlusal plane and to facilitate mandibular counterclockwise rotation. Additionally, because of the slow development of the dentofacial deformity in JIA over many years and resulting dentoalveolar compensation, there is often a mismatch between the degrees of dental and skeletal deformity. As such, minimal overjet may limit mandibular advancement to less than necessary for complete profile correction. Addition of a sliding advancement genioplasty may provide the appearance of further mandibular advancement in this scenario.

# Key Points

1. TMJ signs and symptoms in JIA are different than those in adults with intra-articular disease.  
2. Inflammation of the TMJ is common in young patients with JIA.  
3. Treatment is directed toward early to reducing inflammatory destruction, anti-inflammatory.  
4. Untreated end-stage JIA leads to facial deformity and TMJ dysfunction.  
5. End-stage treatment of TMJ disease in JIA is directed to reconstructive of both the TMJ and orthognathic deformity.

# Conclusion

The TMJs are frequently involved in patients with JIA, and pain, dysfunction, and dentofacial deformity may result. Diagnosis and treatment require a multidisciplinary team and longitudinal evaluation. Many options exist for correction of resulting dentofacial deformity, but no universally accepted algorithm exists.
