# Learning Aim

Optimizing outcome of all surgical procedures can only be accomplished when the surgeon has a thorough understanding of all concomitant systemic diseases and have a management plan to effectively deal with these conditions. The aim of this chapter is to familiarize the surgeon with the common systemic diseases and their management in the surgical patient.

# 2.1 Introduction

Patients who undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery are often young and relatively healthy. Medical complications are uncommon in this patient population. However, medical conditions may be present in any patient and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality unless these conditions are sought in those with a history of disease and recognized in those without such a history. A thorough medical and social history will elicit medical comorbidities when known and provide clear guidelines regarding management in most patients. A thorough physical examination will often confirm the presence of systemic disease or identify it in those without a prior history. A thorough knowledge of medical comorbidities before any surgical procedure will allow patients to be stratified according to surgical risk and managed in an optimal fashion. Preoperative patient assessment is best completed by the surgeon who has a vested interest in the patient's well-being. When medical conditions and comorbidities are recognized preoperatively, appropriate workup or referral is easily organized. The involvement of other medical and surgical subspecialties should be readily sought when indicated.

A systematic approach to preoperative patient assessment is required. This requires a didactic approach to a patient interview. This mandates obtaining a chief complaint; history of the chief complaint; other complaints; a medical history with review of all systems, allergies, medications, social history, family history, surgical history; and functional status. The sensitivity of a thorough history to identify a previously unrecognized medical condition should not be underestimated.

The physical examination should also be standardized to include all systems. The examination is, however, often focused based on the chief complaint and a thorough history. In addition to identifying the need for oral and maxillofacial surgery, the primary purpose of the physical examination is to identify pertinent positive and negative findings. The history and physical examination will then

enable the surgeon to request additional investigations and medical referrals that allow risk stratification.

The ultimate goal of the preoperative evaluation is to identify medical concerns and provide for the most efficacious perioperative treatment algorithm that minimizes patient morbidity. The risk assessment for each patient undergoing surgery requires an understanding of the surgical stress and the patient's medical condition. Head and neck surgery is considered to be intermediate in perioperative risk. Oral and maxillofacial procedures performed in an ambulatory setting would be considered low risk. The patient's medical conditions impart additional risk factors that are best evaluated using a combination of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (Table 2.1) and an assessment of functional status.

Additional classification systems may be appropriate for risk stratification for specific organ systems depending on the medical disease present. The Duke Activity Status Index is particularly useful to classify patients according to functional status [1] (Table 2.2). Age itself is a poor surrogate risk indicator but serves to further assess patients for surgical risk.

Frailty has also been shown to correlate with postoperative complications, increased length of stay, and discharge to other than home. There are a number of frailty indices. They are commonly based on weight loss, weakness and exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait [2]. Similarly, cognitive dysfunction, functional dependence, increased comorbidities, low albumin, and hemoglobin were correlated with an increase in postoperative mortality in a 6-month period following elective surgery [3].

# 2.2 Cardiovascular Assessment and Disease

Cardiovascular disease is a heterogeneous group of diseases that correlate with perioperative risk. It is crucial that the presence of cardiovascular disease be sought in the history and physical examination. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease may also provide insight into a patient's likelihood of cardiac complications. A multitude of cardiac indices have been put forward to help classify patients. The ACC/AHA released guidelines in 2002 stating that there are three satisfactory tools for evaluating perioperative cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery. These include the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)*, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Myocardial Infarction & Cardiac Arrest (NSQIP MICA)*, and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Risk Calculator (NSQIP RC)* [4]. The RCRI includes six clinical risk predictors. Patients with a score of 0 have a  $0.4\%$  risk of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), a score of 1 has  $0.9\%$  risk of MACE, a score of 2 has a  $6.6\%$  risk of MACE, and a score of 3 or more has an  $11\%$  risk of MACE [5, 6] (Table 2.3).

The NSQIP MICA model simply uses the type of surgery, ASA classification, functional status, creatinine  $>1.5\mathrm{mg / dL}$ , and increasing age. The NSQIP Risk Calculator is an online tool that calculates risk based

on the planned surgical procedure (CPT code) as well as 21 patient-specific variables. It has the advantage of calculating the risk of multiple system complications in addition to myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. The tool is easily accessed at  $\triangleright$  https://riskcalculator.facs.org/.

Noninvasive cardiac testing typically involves a stress test using specific exercise protocol with age-related heart rate requirement and real-time ECG monitoring. The sensitivity of the stress test is low depending in part on how many vessels are stenosed. More sensitive noncardiac testing is typically more appropriate in some patients. The tests include exercise echocardiography, dobutamine stress echocardiography, and dipyridamole thallium stress testing. Any patient identified as high risk through this testing should proceed to coronary angiography before any noncardiac surgery.

Myocardial work is primarily determined by four factors related to myocardial oxygen demand: heart rate, preload, afterload, and contractility. Heart rate is influenced by a number of factors including oxygen demand, physical activity, and hormonal and neurogenic mechanisms. Preload represents all factors that contribute to passive ventricular wall stress at the end of diastole. It approximates the end-diastolic ventricular pressure. Volume status significantly influences preload. An accurate determination of preload requires a central line to measure central venous pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Afterload represents all factors that contribute to the ventricular wall stress during systole. The total peripheral resistance has the most influence on afterload, although intrathoracic pressure may also influence afterload as is the case with mechanical ventilation. Contractility refers to the ability of the myocardium to contract. The opportunity to influence myocardial work and oxygen demand exists through modulation of any of these four factors.

# 2.2.1 Coronary Artery Disease

Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are often identified during the history and physical examination. When identified preoperatively, CAD should prompt risk stratification following the ACC/AHA algorithm. Patients with acute coronary syndromes should not undergo noncardiac surgery. Tests to consider include:

Chest radiograph to evaluate for cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.  
ECG to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy, ST segment changes, inverted T waves, Q waves, and arrhythmias.  
- Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography for wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, and chamber pressures.  
Stress test to assess for functional cardiac ischemia. This can be combined with echocardiography.  
Perfusion nuclear imaging to assess cardiac perfusion at rest and with function.  
Cardiac angiography.

Asymptomatic patients with CAD may, however, develop symptoms in the perioperative period. Risk factors for CAD are DM, HTN, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and a family history. CAD may result in stable angina or one of the acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). Stable angina often presents with precordial pain radiating to the left arm, neck, and jaw upon exertion. It is relieved by rest or the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. ACSs include unstable angina, non-ST-elevated MI, and ST-elevated MI. Symptoms are similar to stable angina but occur with less exertion than is usual, or at rest, and do not abate with further rest. The history surrounding the onset of chest pain has a diagnostic sensitivity of  $90\%$  when the symptoms are classic. An ECG may show ST segment depression or inverted T waves indicating ischemia. ST segment elevation indicates frank MI. The treatment of any patient suspected of having ACS begins with the correct diagnosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed with:

A 12-lead ECG (ST elevation, inverted T waves, Q waves)  
- Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB [MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase], troponins)

The initial treatment for suspected ACS or MI has traditionally been morphine, oxygen, nitrates, and aspirin (MONA). Current evidence supports the use of aspirin which has been shown to reduce mortality. Morphine remains the drug of choice for pain but it has not been shown to reduce mortality. Nitrates should be used in the presence of persistent ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension but it has not been shown to reduce

mortality. Oxygen should be used when oxygen saturation is less than  $90\%$  on room air as it has been shown to increase the infarct size [7]. The advent of anti-platelet drugs, fibrinolytics, and percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCA) has reduced the mortality from MI to  $3\%$ .

The use of perioperative beta blockers has been shown to reduce the likelihood of cardiac events including MI. Patients with a recent MI may be at risk for reinfarction following the initial infarct. The ACC recommends waiting a minimum period of 6 weeks after an MI before proceeding with elective surgery [8]. Furthermore, the longer the time period from the MI to the elective surgery, the greater the risk reduction.

Patients who have had PCA and are typically treated with dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT). This typically involves the use of aspirin and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (e.g., abciximab or eptifibatide) or an ADP antagonist (e.g., clopidogrel, etc.). It is recommended that in the event that a patient requires noncardiac surgery, the aspirin should be continued. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor or ADP antagonist should be continued for a minimum period of 14 days, 30 days, and 3 months for balloon angioplasty, bare metal stents, and drug eluting stents, respectively [9, 10].

# 2.2.2 Congestive Heart Failure

CHF is a result of inadequate cardiac output. Compensated CHF is considered an intermediate clinical predictor, whereas decompensated CHF is considered a major clinical predictor within the ACC/AHA algorithm and a contraindication to elective surgery. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification may also be used to help stratify surgical patients (Table 2.4).

The risk of surgical patients with CHF decompensating depends on their class, with NYHA class I patients having a  $3\%$  risk and class IV patients having a  $25\%$  risk [11]. Causes of CHF include MI, valvular heart disease, HTN, anemia, pulmonary embolism (PE),

Table 2.4 New York Heart Association Classification  

<table><tr><td>Class</td><td>Symptoms</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>Asymptomatic</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>Symptomatic with moderate activity, comfortable at rest</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>Symptomatic with minimal activity, comfortable at rest</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>Symptomatic at rest</td></tr></table>

cardiomyopathy, thyrotoxicosis, and endocarditis. Heart failure can be left-sided, right-sided, or both. Left-sided failure presents with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cardiomegaly, rales, and a third heart sound  $(\mathrm{S}_3)$  gallop. Right-sided heart failure results in elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema (especially lower extremities), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The diagnosis is best made with a transthoracic echocardiogram, although the measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to help diagnose and monitor CHF progression. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography will often reveal cardiomegaly and may show pulmonary edema and plural effusions if decompensated. Treatment is primarily aimed at reducing afterload and increasing the cardiac contractility. Treatment may include:

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI; e.g., captopril, lisinopril, ramipril)  
Diuretic (e.g., furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide)  
Beta blocker (metoprolol or carvedilol)  
Digoxin

Patients with CHF should have their regular medications maintained in the perioperative setting. Particular attention to fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial. Potassium should be monitored closely because hypokalemia may be present secondary to the use of nonpotassium-sparing diuretics or renal hypoperfusion. This may require correction with  $10 - 40\mathrm{mEq}$  of oral or parenteral potassium. Parenteral replacement should be done carefully with no more than a  $10\mathrm{mEq / h}$ . Digitalis is often used to increase contractility in patients with CHF. Patients taking digitalis are at risk for fluctuating digitalis blood levels secondary to interactions with other drugs. This can lead to digitalis toxicity. In addition, reducing the preload can reduce cardiac output just as much as excessive preload can precipitate decompensation. Fluid replacement must be judicious and is often assisted by a central line so that central venous pressure can be monitored.

# 2.2.3 Valvular Heart Disease

Valvular heart disease is recognized through a thorough history and physical examination. Although the requirements for antibiotic prophylaxis have changed, the potential for valvular abnormalities to affect cardiovascular parameters must be recognized. As with most systemic diseases, functional status serves as a wonderful barometer with which to evaluate the severity of the valvular abnormality. Perioperative changes in cardiac rate, rhythm, blood pressure, preload, afterload, and contrac

tility secondary to anesthesia and surgery may have profound influences on cardiovascular stability and morbidity.

Aortic stenosis (AS) may be congenital or secondary to rheumatic fever or dystrophic calcification. It may also be a result of obstructive hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. The classic presentation is syncope, angina, and exertional dyspnea. Patients are intolerant to changes in heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance. Auscultation of a high-pitched midsystolic crescendodecrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border is consistent with AS. Critical AS is an independent risk factor for perioperative morbidity and mortality [11]. Critical stenosis is defined as an aortic valve area of less than  $0.75\mathrm{cm}^2$  and/or a valvular pressure gradient of  $50\mathrm{mmHg}$ . A transthoracic echocardiogram is required to quantitate disease severity. As a result of the increased ventricular systolic pressures, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) develops with increased myocardial oxygen demand and a propensity for ischemia even without preexisting CAD. LVH may be identified on the ECG as well as with auscultation of the cardiac apex where a fourth heart sound  $(S_4)$  gallop may be appreciated. Patients with AS cannot tolerate heart rate increases or a reduction in peripheral resistance that further decreases coronary perfusion.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) may be secondary to rheumatic heart disease, bicuspid aortic valve, endocarditis, or aortic root disease. It may present with pulmonary edema, hypotension, and CHF. Auscultation of a diastolic decrescendo murmur, a high-pitched crescendo decrescendo murmur, and diastolic rumble are consistent with AR. The ECG will often reveal LVH, whereas a chest x-ray will reveal left ventricular and aortic root enlargement. Treatment of patients often aims to reduce total peripheral resistance with calcium channel blockers or ACEIs. Beta blockers are best avoided because they increase the regurgitation by prolonging diastole.

Mitral stenosis (MS) is often due to preexisting rheumatic heart disease. It may present with dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary edema, AF, and a right ventricular heave. Auscultation of an opening snap and a middiastolic low-pitched rumble at the apex are consistent with MS. An ECG may reveal notched or enlarged P waves when atrial enlargement has developed. AF may be the final outcome. As with AS, increases in heart rate are not well tolerated owing to the potential for acute increases in pulmonary pressures and reduced cardiac output. Mitral regurgitation (MR) may be secondary to MS, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), rheumatic heart disease, endocarditis, or MI. It may present with pulmonary edema, hypotension, dyspnea on exertion, and a holosystolic high-pitched murmur at the cardiac apex.

# 2.2.4 Prosthetic Valve Replacement

Prosthetic valves can be alloplastic or biologic. A biologic valve can be a heterograft or a xenograft. Valve function is best evaluated with an assessment of the functional capacity of the patient and a transthoracic echocardiograph. Mechanical valves always require anticoagulation, whereas biologic valves may not require anticoagulation after 3 months, although this depends on other risk factors. Patients with prosthetic valves are susceptible to endocarditis, valve failure, red cell destruction, and thromboemboli formation. Patients should have their warfarin discontinued before surgery if bleeding is likely to be a problem. The risk for thromboembolism and CVA is high if anticoagulation is discontinued and, accordingly, patients may need to be bridged with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an outpatient or unfractionated heparin (UFH) as an inpatient. The adequacy of the warfarin anticoagulation should be measured with the prothrombin time or international normalized ratio (INR). The therapeutic value of the INR is typically between 2.5 and 3.5. Adequacy of anticoagulation with UFH is measured with the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which should be between 50 and  $90\mathrm{s}$ . When LMWH is used to bridge the patient, the adequacy of anticoagulation is typically not measured, although an assay for Factor Xa can be used to measure anticoagulation for both UFH and LMWH. The half-life of UFH is  $1 - 2\mathrm{h}$ , which necessitates cessation  $6\mathrm{h}$  before a surgical procedure. LMWH has a longer half-life, which requires cessation the night before the procedure.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is required in patients with prosthetic heart valves or those with a history of endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, or repaired congenital heart disease during the first 6 postoperative months. The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin  $2\mathrm{g}$  or clindamycin  $600\mathrm{mg}$  (if penicillin allergic) orally  $1\mathrm{h}$  before the procedure. When antibiotics are to be given parenterally, ampicillin  $2\mathrm{g}$  or clindamycin  $600\mathrm{mg}$  (if penicillin allergic) should be administered within  $1\mathrm{h}$  of the procedure start time.

# 2.2.5 Arrhythmias

Patients with diagnosed or occult arrhythmia present a management challenge to the surgeon and anesthesiologist. Arrhythmias typically compromise cardiac output to some degree. The distinction between supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias must be made early. The latter requires prompt attention and due concern. Anesthesia and surgery are capable of unmasking occult arrhythmias through stress-mediated

physiologic change, proarrhythmic drugs, and hypoxia. The evaluation of patients with arrhythmias includes an ECG. When the arrhythmia is intermittent in nature, the ECG may fail to identify the rhythm. In this situation, it may be prudent to obtain a 24-h continuous monitoring record that can be analyzed to identify the abnormal rhythm.

Common supraventricular arrhythmias include supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (also known as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia), atrial flutter, and AF. SVT is benign but results in heart rates of 150 beats per minute (bpm) or greater in an adult. The net result may be a reduction in cardiac output and blood pressure. It is typically due to a reentrant conduction abnormality and may precipitate myocardial ischemia. SVT may be initiated by premature atrial contractions (PACs), which are otherwise considered very common. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are often used to reduce the frequency of SVT. Recalcitrant SVT may require electrophysiologic ablation of the reentrant pathway [12]. Cardiac stimulants such as alcohol and coffee should be limited. Exogenous and endogenous epinephrine may also precipitate this arrhythmia. When SVT develops in the perioperative setting, it demands treatment. Carotid massage may be used in patients without carotid bruits or stenosis. This results in stimulation of the carotid sinus with an increase in vagal tone. In addition, a Valsalva maneuver can be performed, which also acts through vagal stimulation. Failure to correct the SVT in a timely fashion or the development of angina or unstable vital signs demands more aggressive treatment with intravenous adenosine or electrical cardioversion in a monitored setting in which acute cardiac life support measures can be instigated.

Atrial flutter is characterized by an atrial rate approaching 300 bpm. There is often a rapid ventricular response (RVR) depending on how many of the atrial contractions are conducted through to the atrioventricular (AV) node. This often presents as a 2:1 or 3:1 block and a ventricular rate of 100-150 bpm. Mortality in patients with atrial flutter who undergo surgery is higher. Treatment often requires calcium channel blockers or amiodarone to control the RVR.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an exceedingly common arrhythmia. The ventricular rate varies and is irregular giving rise to the term "irregularly irregular" to describe the pulse. Cardiac output is reduced owing to the lack of an atrial "kick," which often produces fatigue in older patients. Atrial enlargement, thyrotoxicosis, CAD, and stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, and nicotine can precipitate AF. AF predisposes the myocardium to mural thrombi and embolic events. Paroxysmal or chronic AF usually requires long-term anticoagulation with warfarin to reduce this risk. The treatment of AF

usually requires chemical cardioversion with digitalis or amiodarone. The latter may also be used to prevent the recurrence of AF [13]. Calcium channel blockers or beta blockers may be used to help manage the RVR. Electrical cardioversion remains an effective treatment modality for acute-onset AF when chemical cardioversion is unsuccessful or vital signs dictate a more urgent restoration of sinus rhythm.

Ventricular arrhythmias are generally more concerning than atrial arrhythmias, given the potential for some to deteriorate into a nonperfusing rhythm. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are common in healthy patients but may also be associated with fever, hypoxia, inhalational anesthetics, Swan-Ganz catheters, electrolyte disturbances, or myocardial ischemia. Isolated PVCs are often not pathologic, but three or more consecutive PVCs are considered ventricular tachycardia. The discovery of excessive PVC activity on a preoperative ECG mandates referral to a cardiologist for workup. The onset of PVCs in the perioperative period is more worrisome and may reflect myocardial ischemia, MI, or electrolyte abnormalities [14, 15].

Ventricular tachycardia may be perfusing or nonperfusing. When nonperfusing, the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol is adopted. This requires basic life support and early electrical cardioversion. Additional drugs that may be of benefit are amiodarone and magnesium. Elective surgery should be deferred in all patients with ventricular dysrhythmias. Long-term therapy may involve the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, radiofrequency ablation, or implantable cardiac defibrillators.

Heart blocks arise from an abnormality in conduction from the sinoatrial node to the AV node. This slows cardiac conduction leading to PR intervals that are longer than 0.2 s. Heart blocks can be divided into four categories. First-degree blocks are associated with a prolonged PR interval, but all atrial impulses are conducted through to the AV node with a corresponding ventricular contraction. First-degree blocks are usually not symptomatic and require no treatment. When the heart rate is excessively slow, they may require atropine. Second-degree blocks are divided into Mobitz I and Mobitz II variants. The Mobitz I variant involves a progressive increase in the PR interval over several beats until one atrial impulse fails to be conducted through the AV node, resulting in the lack of a ventricular contraction. This type of heart block is generally asymptomatic and requires no treatment. An excessively slow heart rate may again require atropine. The Mobitz II variant involves a constant but prolonged PR interval with the loss of conduction through the AV node after several beats. This results in the loss of a ventricular contraction at a regular time period, usually every third or fourth beat. Third-degree heart block has no conduc

tion through the AV node with atria and ventricles contracting independently. The heart rate is often in the 30s and this produces symptoms due to a reduction in cardiac output and blood pressure. Treatment of a second-degree heart block Mobitz II or third-degree heart block often requires external or internal pacing to maintain a satisfactory heart rate. Long-term management involves implantation of a pacemaker. The occurrence of any heart block in the perioperative period requires further investigation to determine causes, particularly electrolyte abnormalities, drug toxicity, and myocardial ischemia. The development of second-degree Mobitz II and third-degree heart block will most often require perioperative pacing [16].

# 2.2.6 Hypertension

HTN is one of the most common diseases, and a large number of surgical patients will have HTN. HTN is defined as a systolic blood pressure in excess of  $140\mathrm{mmHg}$  or a diastolic blood pressure in excess of  $90\mathrm{mmHg}$  measured on two separate occasions (Table 2.5). It is one of the most common reasons for postponing elective surgery. Most HTN is of unknown etiology and is referred to as "essential hypertension." Secondary HTN is a result of known pathology including renal disease, Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, aortic regurgitation, and medication induced. Blood pressure can be classified based on the systolic and the diastolic blood pressures.

Hypertensive urgency requires referral to a primary care physician or internist as soon as possible and preferably within  $24\mathrm{h}$  to avoid the potential for hypertensive emergency and end-organ damage including CVA, acute renal failure, and myocardial ischemia. Hypertensive emergency is defined by any elevated blood pressure

[54] HTN hypertension</td></tr></table>

associated with end-organ damage including encephalopathy, heart failure, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. Hypertensive emergency requires immediate transport to an emergency room for blood pressure control. Elective surgery should be postponed for hypertensive urgency and emergency [17].

Major risk factors for HTN include smoking, hyperlipidemia, DM, age older than 60 years, gender, and family history. If untreated, it commonly causes CAD, cardiomegaly, left ventricular dysfunction, CHF, renal disease, retinopathy, and CVA.

The diagnosis of HTN should not be made for the first time in the postoperative setting because many perioperative factors, including pain, may elevate blood pressure in an otherwise nonhypertensive patient. All patients with a history of HTN should be maintained on their usual blood pressure medication in the perioperative period. However, several antihypertensive medications reduce the patient's ability to compensate for anesthesia-induced hypotension. It may be necessary in some patients to reduce the antihypertensive medication dose on the morning of surgery. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and clonidine should be continued in the perioperative period. Diuretics, ACEIs, and angiotensin-receptor blockers may be held the morning of surgery if anesthesia-induced hypotension is likely to be a problem. The choice of anesthetic agents for a general anesthesia may also be modified if there are concerns for blood pressure liability. Most of the inhalational anesthetics will reduce blood pressure to some degree. The intravenous agents such as propofol may also produce a similar blood pressure reduction. Induction with etomidate should be considered if there is a need to maintain blood pressure.

The signs and symptoms of HTN are subtle unless hypertensive emergency develops. An  $\mathrm{S}_4$  gallop is often present owing to the LVH that may also be evident on the ECG. The treatment of hypertensive emergency may include nonselective beta blockers such as labetalol which is an alpha 1, beta 1, and beta 2 receptor antagonist. It will reduce both the heart rate and peripheral resistance to decrease blood pressure. Esmolol is a selective beta 1 blocker that can also be used, but this requires a continuous intravenous infusion because the half-life of the drug is less than  $5\mathrm{min}$ . ACEIs can also be used to reduce peripheral resistance, although only enalaprilat is available for intravenous administration. Hydralazine is a selective alpha 1 antagonist that can reduce peripheral resistance and lower blood pressure very quickly, but caution should be exercised in the elderly because it produces a reflex tachycardia that can exacerbate myocardial ischemia.

The most recent guidelines from the Joint National Committee (JNC8) recommend initiating treatment for those greater than 60 years when systolic blood pressure (SBP)  $>150 \mathrm{mmHg}$  or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)  $>90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ . Individuals under age 60 and those with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus should begin antihypertensive medication when SBP  $>140 \mathrm{mmHg}$  or DBP  $>90 \mathrm{mmHg}$  [18]. The treatment of patients with stage I and stage II HTN includes numerous classes of medications. Medication is often added over time and titrated to effect. Many patients will require multiple medications to control blood pressure. Weight loss, exercise, and reduced dietary sodium consumption are also important to help manage blood pressure. Patients who develop HTN in the perioperative setting or those with a history of controlled HTN who are difficult to maintain in a normotensive range may benefit from treatment. Unless significantly elevated, it is generally not ideal to diagnose HTN in the immediate perioperative setting because many physical and emotional factors may influence the blood pressure. Inadequate pain control is often responsible for an elevated blood pressure and is best addressed by increasing analgesia. Simply asking patients to rate their pain on a visual analogue scale will often identify whether pain is a significant issue and a likely etiology of the HTN. When treatment is thought to be necessary, a stepwise approach is required and, although most patients will have essential HTN, consideration of secondary causes is warranted. A diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide is an excellent first-choice medication. It results in potassium wasting and elevated serum calcium so electrolytes should be monitored in the long term. A selective beta 1 blocker such as metoprolol is also a good initial or subsequent choice. This is particularly useful in patients with a history of MI. An ACEI such as captopril is a reasonable third choice. Once an appropriate dose is found, it can be changed to another longer-acting ACEI such as lisinopril or ramipril, which require only once-a-day dosing. ACEIs are ideal for patients with DM owing to the renal protection that these drugs provide. Angiotensin-receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers are additional choices for medications.

# 2.2.7 Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators and Pacemakers

A growing number of patients who present for surgery will have an automatic implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (AICD) or cardiac pacemaker. These devices are able to monitor cardiac rhythm, pace, and

defibrillate. Some devices have the ability to sense oxygen saturation, right ventricular pressures, temperature, and body movement. Patients with an AICD or pacemaker who require surgery will have a cardiac history that should be determined. An ECG will indicate whether the AICD or pacemaker is pacing the myocardium as evident by the pacing spike and subsequent QRS complex. The decision to reset the AICD or pacemaker immediately before the surgical procedure should be made only in consultation with the cardiologist and anesthesiologist. This requires a magnetic key and knowledge of exactly which device (brand and model number) has been implanted. Defibrillators should be turned off to prevent accidental discharge or damage to the device. The AICD can have the defibrillator turned off and the pacer left on for surgery. Monopolar electrocautery should be avoided in all patients with an AICD or pacemaker. The current generated can damage an AICD or pacemaker even when turned off and it will be sensed by the device if the device is left on, which could result in inappropriate activity. Bipolar electrocautery can also affect the AICD, although this is less likely. If electrocautery was used during surgery, the device should be assessed immediately upon completion of the procedure to ensure that the device is functioning normally. All patients with an AICD should have an external means of pacing and defibrillating available throughout the surgery in case a cardiac dysrhythmia develops.

# 2.3 Respiratory Disease

All patients require a thorough history and physical examination to identify respiratory disease. Furthermore, the very nature of oral and maxillofacial surgery dictates that the potential for upper airway obstruction is a potential concern with many procedures. The functional status of the patient, as with most systemic diseases, provides significant insight into the disease severity and the potential for perioperative complications. Much can also be learned by simply watching the patient in terms of the respiratory rate and work of breathing. Smoking tobacco should always be considered in all patients. Postoperative respiratory complications are more common in those who smoke [19]. The risk declines by  $50\%$  after only 8 weeks of smoking cessation, although patients who stop smoking for less than 8 weeks before surgery have a higher risk for complications than those who continue to smoke [20]. Cigarette smoke also results in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin (CoHb), which predisposes the patient to perioperative hypoxia. Pulse oximetry cannot detect CoHb and the displayed saturation level will, therefore, be incorrectly elevated. An arte

rial blood gas (ABG) is required to measure the CoHb. CoHb and nicotine both increase the potential for cardiac complications including ventricular fibrillation [21]. This additional risk can be eliminated with smoking cessation for  $24\mathrm{h}$ .

The need for additional preoperative pulmonary testing is dictated by the history, physical examination, functional status, smoking history, and age. The most common screening tool continues to be the history. The chest x-ray, although the yield is relatively low unless diffuse parenchymal disease, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is present, should be considered as a baseline in patients with known pulmonary disease. Pulmonary peak flow can be easily measured with an office peak flowmeter. This can help quantitate obstructive airway disease and identify those patients who are having an exacerbation of preexisting disease or whose disease is progressing. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is the gold standard in evaluating pulmonary function. PFT measures lung volumes and lung dynamics including flow rates throughout the respiratory cycle. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s  $(\mathrm{FEV}_1)$  and its relationship to the forced vital capacity (FVC) are particularly useful to quantitate disease severity and stratify patients. The measurement of the ABG is typically done in conjunction with the PFTs. The effects of a bronchodilator on pulmonary function are routinely measured as part of the PFT protocol. Knowing the improvement in lung function, if any, after the administration of the bronchodilator can better prepare the surgical/anesthesia team to handle a respiratory emergency. The measurement of the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, pH, and base excess allows the net effect of pulmonary disease on oxygenation to be seen. For a patient with known respiratory disease, previous PFTS, a history, examination, office PEFR measure, and chest x-ray are all that is needed for a preoperative assessment.

Respiratory disease is a common diagnosis among surgical patients. The net result of most respiratory diseases is hypoxemia that, in broad terms, may develop from one of four mechanisms: hypoventilation, diffusion impairment, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and shunting. Hypoventilation as defined by a decrease in respiratory rate or vital capacity that can be due to asthma, chronic COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, pneumonia, chest trauma, narcotics, neurologic disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Diffusion impairment may be due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Ventilation-perfusion mismatching can be the result of many processes including PE, whereas shunting is often seen with pulmonary edema, pneumonia, atelectasis, cardiac septal defects, and chronic liver disease.

The perioperative management of a patient in respiratory distress with hypoxemia and increased work of breathing requires intervention. The management of these patients entails a general initial approach while the cause for the hypoxemia is sought. Treatment involves the administration of oxygen using one of several methods, all of which increase the fractional concentration of inspired oxygen  $(\mathrm{FiO}_2)$ . The effect of varying the method of oxygen delivery on the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  should not be underestimated.

- Nasal cannula (1 L/min increases the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  by  $4\%$  to a maximum of  $40\%$  at 6 L/min)  
Rebreathing facemask (increases the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  to  $60\%$  at  $10~\mathrm{L / min}$ )  
Non-rebreathing facemask (increases the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  to  $90\%$  at  $10~\mathrm{L / min}$ )  
- CPAP/BiPAP (continuous positive airway pressure/bilevel positive airway pressure) with positive pressure (increases the FiO, to  $80\%$ )  
Intubate/tracheostomy (increases the  $\mathrm{FiO}_2$  to  $100\%$

Several diseases should be considered in any patient with signs or symptoms of disordered respiration. The diagnosis, and ultimately the treatment, depends on a good history, physical examination, and appropriate studies.

# 2.3.1 Asthma

Asthma is classically defined by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible bronchoconstriction due to smooth muscle contraction leading to reduced minute ventilation and hypoxemia. Signs and symptoms of asthma include episodic dyspnea, shortness of breath, nocturnal awakenings, limitation in activity, wheezing that is predominantly expiratory, cough, chest tightness, chest pain, and status asthmaticus. The likelihood of an asthma exacerbation in the perioperative period is dependent on many factors including the occurrence of pain, stress, aspiration during induction, and the presence of an unrecognized preoperative upper respiratory tract infection. The frequency, severity, duration, and response to therapy of recent asthma attacks are useful predictors. Furthermore, a history of emergency room visits and the need for intubation should be reasons for concern. Requirements for multiple asthma medications including inhaled steroids should also raise suspicion of severe disease. Patients with significant asthma as evident by these indicators are probably ASA class III patients and are probably not good candidates for office-based sedation or general anesthesia. Whereas well-controlled asthma poses minimal risk to patients, an exacerbation can occur in any asthmatic. Bronchospasm that heralds an asthma attack can occur rapidly and be difficult to manage even with positive-pressure ventila

tion and intubation. This is in part due to the combined effect of smooth muscle contraction, edema, and mucus plugging.

The diagnosis of asthma can be made with an appropriate history of asthma-like symptoms and PFT that indicates a reduction in  $\mathrm{FEV}_1$ , normal vital capacity, reduced  $\mathrm{FEV}_1$ /FVC (proportional to severity), and an increase in  $\mathrm{FEV}_1$  by  $10\%$  with bronchodilator treatment. Peak expiratory flow rate is best used to monitor asthma over time and identify potential exacerbations. A decline in the peak flow rate to less than  $80\%$  of baseline would suggest exacerbation, and elective surgery should be postponed until the patient can be stabilized and optimized.

The goal of asthma management is to maintain all preoperative medications. The choice of medication is usually determined by classifying asthma as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. The frequency and severity of symptoms,  $\mathrm{FEV}_1$ , and peak flow are all used to categorize patients into one of these groups. The choice of medication is individualized but often progresses through an algorithm that includes:

Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) such as albuterol  
Inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone  
Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium or tiotropium  
Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) such as salmeterol or formoterol

- Combination inhalers that include LABA and inhaled steroids

Other useful agents include:

Leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast  
Cromolyn  
Theophylline

Perioperative exacerbations may occur despite adequate control with medication. The treatment of exacerbations often requires that a SABA be administered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulizer every  $2\mathrm{h}$  as needed. Continuous nebulized treatment may be beneficial in children. Anticholinergic medication can also be administered by MDI or nebulizer every  $6\mathrm{h}$  as needed. A short course of oral or parenteral corticosteroid over a week may also be needed [22].

# 2.3.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two major respiratory diseases within COPD. Emphysema is characterized by dilated and collapsed small airways with alveolar destruction secondary to smoking or alpha 1

antitrypsin deficiency, a congenital deficiency. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by increased airway secretions and mucus production, often secondary to smoking. A patient with emphysema is often described as a "pink puffer," whereas a patient with chronic bronchitis is often described as a "blue bloater." The net result of both diseases is retention of carbon dioxide and eventually hypoxemia.

The symptoms and signs of COPD include chronic cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, decreased functional status, wheezing, and a barrel-shaped chest. As disease advances, patients may begin to expire with pursed lips, which increases intrathoracic pressure to help stent their airways open. The diagnosis of COPD can be made with an appropriate history supplemented with additional tests. PFTs reveal a reduction in  $\mathrm{FEV}_1$ , no change in vital capacity, and a reduction in the  $\mathrm{FEV}_1/\mathrm{FVC}$ . ABGs are particularly helpful and reveal an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen, and respiratory acidosis. The chest x-ray reveals a loss of lung markings, hyperinflation, and a flattened diaphragm.

COPD should be optimized before surgery. Smoking cessation should have occurred concurrently with the initial diagnosis of COPD, but if patients continue to smoke, complications will be higher. Smoking cessation should occur longer than 8 weeks before the planned surgical procedure. Elective surgery in the face of a COPD exacerbation or a URI is contraindicated. The patient may require a course of inhaled steroids or systemic steroids as part of the optimization program [23].

The perioperative management of patients with COPD aims to maintain the preoperative medication regime that is typically determined by classifying COPD as mild, moderate, severe, and very severe. All patients should be well hydrated and use humidified oxygen when needed to reduce the inspissation of secretions. Patients with mucopurulent sputum are best treated with a course of antibiotics such as azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or amoxicillin [24]. This is best completed before the planned surgery. In addition the patient should be instructed on how to perform postoperative lung expansion maneuvers. If the patient has been on long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy, pre-op stress dosing is indicated and either puffs of the inhaler or a nebulized SABA treatment should be delivered in the preoperative holding area.

Complications in patients with COPD undergoing surgery can be perioperative or frequently postoperative. The perioperative concerns are typically anesthesia related. Nitrous oxide is best avoided due to its blood/ gas coefficient and the potential to accumulate within the multiple bullae associated with COPD, which can rupture. Ventilator plateau pressures should be kept to a moderate level to further reduce this risk. Peak flow

pressures will typically be increased to allow for a short inspiratory and prolonged expiratory time. The latter is crucial to reduce the likelihood of auto-PEEP (auto-positive end-expiratory pressure). Despite maintaining normal preoperative medications, patients with COPD may experience postoperative exacerbations that require further treatment. This usually includes the administration of the following:

Oxygen delivery with nasal cannula or facemask.  
SABA such as an albuterol MDI or nebulizer as needed.  
Anticholinergic medication such as an ipratropium MDI or nebulizer as needed.  
Corticosteroid burst given orally or intravenously over 5 days (prednisolone  $1\mathrm{mg / kg / day}$ ).  
The need to intubate patients who are doing poorly should be considered early.

The potential concern of administering oxygen to COPD patients who rely on a hypoxic respiratory drive is more theoretical than real. Any patient with COPD who is hypoxemic as a result of the disease should be treated aggressively with oxygen.

# 2.3.3 Pneumonia

Nosocomial pneumonia may occur in the postoperative period. It may be associated with the use of mechanical ventilation, at which time it is referred to as "ventilator-associated pneumonia." The development of pneumonia may be influenced by the use of perioperative antibiotics, the placement of nasogastric feeding tubes, and the propensity for aspiration. The most common causative organisms associated with nosocomial pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and occasionally, anaerobic organisms. The net result is hypoxemia and sepsis. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, shortness of breath, fever, chest pain, decreased breath sounds, and fremitus. The diagnosis should be considered in any patient on a ventilator who develops fever and the need for increased ventilatory support including inspired oxygen pressure and PEEP. The peak pressures are often also elevated secondary to reduced lung compliance. Additional findings are a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan indicating infiltration or consolidation of lung parenchyma and parapneumonic pleural effusion, a bronchoalveolar lavage with cultured organisms, positive blood culture, and an increased white blood cell count. The treatment of pneumonia includes the use of parenteral antibiotics, which may involve either monotherapy or combination therapy depending on the organisms identified. The need to convert patients from an endotracheal tube to a

tracheotomy and the timing of this continue to be controversial [25].

# 2.3.4 Pulmonary Embolus

More than  $95\%$  of PEs are from the deep veins of the legs. These travel to the lungs, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular compromise. Most emboli are clinically silent owing to their small size. Risk factors include smoking, contraceptives, pregnancy, advance age, malignancy, abdominal and orthopedic surgery, and hereditary coagulation disorders such as antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden, and protein C and S deficiency. Prevention with sequential calf compressors, thromboembolic deterrent stockings, and perioperative UFH or LMWH is important. All patients who undergo surgery should be considered at risk for PE. In addition to the risk factors listed previously, general anesthesia and surgery produce a prothrombotic state that is compounded by bed rest. Early ambulation and appropriate preventive measures afford the best opportunity to reduce the risk of PE.

Signs and symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea, sinus tachycardia, hemoptysis, a swollen and painful leg, and pain on dorsiflexion of the foot (Homan's sign). The workup of possible PE may involve several investigations. An initial ABG with a large alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient would be suspicious for PE. A CT scan of the chest with contrast (PE protocol) can identify subsegmental pulmonary arteries and emboli within them. This has largely replaced the ventilation-perfusion scanning. A duplex ultrasound of the leg veins should also be obtained. The sensitivity of this scan is highest for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) between the knee and the groin. The D-dimer assay is a relatively simple blood test that measures the level of fibrin degradation products. A positive D-dimer may be due to a multitude of conditions, whereas a negative D-dimer virtually excludes DVT/PE, reflecting the high negative predictive value. An ECG most often reveals a nonspecific sinus tachycardia, although the classic pattern of an S wave in lead I and a Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III may be seen, reflecting right ventricular strain. Pulmonary angiography remains the gold standard but is infrequently used because it is invasive.

The treatment of PE may include an initial heparin bolus followed by a heparin drip. Alternatively, enoxaparin or fondaparinux can be administered subcutaneously. Long-term anticoagulation should also be simultaneously initiated with warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3. Massive PE leading to right ventricular strain may require chemical thrombolysis or surgical thrombectomy. Patients unable to be anticoagulated and

patients with recurrent PE despite anticoagulation are candidates for inferior vena cava filters to prevent the development of PEs. The filters may be permanent or temporary and are themselves at risk for obstruction.

# 2.3.5 Atelectasis

Atelectasis is a common postoperative outcome characterized by the segmental collapse of lung alveoli. It leads to a progressive decline in lung compliance, impaired segmental ventilation, retained secretions, and a decrease in functional residual capacity. The signs and symptoms of atelectasis include decreased breath sounds, inspiratory crackles at the bases, increased work of breathing, and a low-grade fever. The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and temporal relationship to the immediate postoperative period supported when indicated by chest x-ray. Treatment includes incentive spirometry and early ambulation.

# 2.3.6 Pulmonary Edema

Pulmonary edema can develop from cardiac and noncardiac causes. In the setting of normal cardiac function, it may be the result of fluid overload or it can follow extubation as a result of upper airway obstruction leading to negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE). The latter is more common in young males. The net result is significant alveolar transudation and hypoxemia. Risk factors include obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and maxillofacial surgical procedures. Signs and symptoms include increased work of breathing, dyspnea, shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds, and bilateral crackles. The diagnosis is based on the clinical suspicion, the development in the immediate postoperative period, and chest x-ray with diffuse infiltrates.

Treatment usually requires supplemental oxygen, support of the airway, and possible re-intubation and a short period of mechanical ventilation with PEEP. Diuretics may be used to facilitate fluid removal in more severe cases.

# 2.3.7 Airway

A preoperative assessment of the airway is mandatory, and the oral and maxillofacial surgeon is in a unique position to provide this evaluation. Complications related to establishing an airway and maintaining ventilation continue to be a source of significant patient morbidity and mortality. The oral and maxillofacial surgeon must carefully assess the potential for airway difficulty

and must be in a position to appropriately prevent it when possible and manage it when it develops during sedation or general anesthesia.

A thorough evaluation of the patient's airway begins with the patient's history. A history of prior sedation or general anesthesia that presented with a difficult airway or complication should be sought. This may require obtaining anesthesia records to verify the nature of the difficulty and the management rendered. The physical examination should address several airway-related issues. The patient's weight and body mass index should be obtained. Obese individuals present potentially difficult airways and, due to their weight, have a reduced functional residual capacity, making early oxygen desaturation likely. Pregnancy will produce an identical picture. A decrease in cervical range of motion, a decrease in the maximum incisal opening, or the presence of a retrognathic mandible all portend to a potentially difficult airway. Additional patients that may present with a difficult airway include those with congenital conditions such as Pierre Robin, Treacher Collins, Goldenhar, Klippel-Feil, and Down syndromes; those with oropharyngeal infections and oropharyngeal tumors; radiotherapy patients; and patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis. In all patients, the oral cavity and oropharynx should be examined and classified using the Mallampati scheme [26] (Table 2.6).

The difficulty of direct laryngoscopy and intubation correlates with advancing Mallampati class. In all patients undergoing sedation or general anesthesia, the Mallampati classification should be determined and used to predict the likelihood of a difficult airway. Supplemental measures to obtain and secure an airway should always be immediately available. For office-based procedures, the ability to support the airway with jaw lift, oral airway, nasal airway, and positive-pressure bag-valve-mask ventilation is mandatory. There will always be a small percentage of difficult airway patients who cannot be ventilated with these techniques. One or more additional techniques are needed. The surgeon should be proficient in the insertion of a laryngeal mask or

Table 2.6 Mallampati classification  

<table><tr><td>Class</td><td>Anatomy</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>Visualized entire tonsillar pillars, uvula, soft palate, hard palate</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>Visualized upper tonsillar pillars, base of uvula, soft palate, hard palate</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>Visualized base of uvula, soft palate, hard palate</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>Visualized hard palate</td></tr></table>

endotracheal tube and the performance of a cricothyroidotomy. Patients who present with potentially difficult airways might be better candidates for hospital-based procedures. This has the advantage of a more controlled environment where the possibility of using indirect laryngoscopes, fiberoptic intubation, or emergent tracheostomy can be readily performed [27, 28]. Furthermore, additional well-trained personnel are typically available and able to assist in an emergency. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the surgeon and anesthesiologist to provide a secure airway and one or more backup plans should the unexpected difficult airway be encountered.

# 2.4 Renal Disease

Renal disease and renal failure correlate directly with surgical morbidity and mortality [29]. HTN, DM, polycystic kidney disease, pyelonephritis, and autoimmune kidney disease can all result in diminished renal function. The normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is approximately  $120~\mathrm{mL / min}$ . Generally, the GFR needs to decrease to about  $30~\mathrm{mL / min}$  before a rise in serum creatinine or urea is seen. This represents a  $75\%$  loss in renal function before a significant increase in serum creatinine occurs. As renal disease progresses, the normal urine production declines from 0.5 to  $1\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$  until the patient eventually becomes oliguric or anuric. As the renal function decline continues, the patient will develop anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte abnormalities of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Furthermore, the ability to regulate acid-base homeostasis is impaired because the kidney can no longer effectively excrete hydrogen ions or conserve bicarbonate. The effective removal of metabolic waste products and urea is also impaired, resulting in azotemia and uremia, respectively. Renal disease also results in extrarenal disease including bone marrow suppression, thrombasthenia, pericardial effusion, and immunosuppression. The basic assessment of the patient with renal disease should include urine output, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, bicarbonate, and hematocrit.

Urine output depends on the level of hydration and patient age. Typically, urine output approximates  $1\mathrm{mL}/$ $\mathrm{kg / h}$  in a young adult. Serum creatinine and urea provide indirect evidence of renal function by correlating only roughly with the GFR owing to active renal secretion of the former and active renal resorption of the latter. The GFR can be calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, which requires the patient's age, sex, weight, and serum creatinine. More accurate methods to calculate GFR are available but these require a 24-h urine collection and the administration of a compound like inulin

that is filtered but neither secreted nor reabsorbed. Urinalysis with microscopy is only useful in the initial diagnosis of renal disease when the presence of protein, red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells, casts, and crystals can be identified. Urinalysis can be used to monitor renal disease progression in certain diseases such as DM.

Perioperative renal impairment can occur in a patient with preexisting renal disease or in otherwise healthy patients. Abnormalities in renal function should be classified as prerenal, renal, or postrenal. Prerenal causes of renal failure include hypovolemia, shock, hypotension, and heart failure. Renal causes of renal failure include glomerulonephritis (GN), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), interstitial nephritis (IN), and pyelonephritis. GN may be secondary to autoimmune disease, DM, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and amyloidosis. ATN may be secondary to renal ischemia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, drugs, and intravenous contrast media. IN is most often drug related. GN is readily identified by RBC casts in the urine, ATN by muddy brown casts, and IN by eosinophiluria. Postrenal causes of renal failure are usually obstructive in nature secondary to prostate hypertrophy, malignancy, and renal stones.

The initial diagnosis of acute renal failure may be made when urine output begins to decline, serum creatinine increases, and serum electrolyte abnormalities develop. The assessment for a patient with new-onset renal failure should include serum creatinine and urea, serum electrolytes, urinalysis with microscopy, and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). The latter helps to distinguish prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes of renal failure. Urine osmolality, urine sodium, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine ratio can also be used to help distinguish among the three broad causes of renal failure. The FENa is calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm {F E N a} = \frac {\left[ \text {U r i n e N a} \right] / \left[ \text {P l a s m a N a} \right]}{\left[ \text {U r i n e C r} \right] / \left[ \text {P l a s m a C r} \right]}
$$

A FENa less than  $1\%$  is consistent with prerenal causes, a FENa above  $2\%$  is consistent with renal causes, and a FENa above  $4\%$  is consistent with postrenal causes.

Perioperative management of the patient with renal disease should focus on volume status because patients may become fluid overloaded quickly. The use of intravenous fluid replacement should be done conservatively and without the addition of potassium. Clinically significant anemia should be managed acutely with packed cells, although the potential for significant fluid shifts exists. Chronic management usually mandates erythropoietin subcutaneously or intravenously. Long-term iron supplementation is also appropriate. Electrolyte abnormalities especially hyperkalemia can develop

quickly and can result in severe cardiac arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia above  $5.5\mathrm{mEq / L}$  mandates an ECG. A wide QRS complex, loss of P waves, and peaked T waves require urgent treatment with calcium gluconate to stabilize the cardiac membrane, kayexalate to bind gastrointestinal potassium, and dextrose/insulin to drive the intracellular movement of potassium. Dialysis may be needed when the hyperkalemia is excessively high or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias develop.

Many medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some antibiotics require discontinuation if they are nephrotoxic. Many other medications need to be renally dosed if they are renally excreted. This typically means a reduced frequency of drug administration rather than a reduced dose and early consultation with a pharmacist or nephrologist is indicated.

Patients with end-stage renal disease require dialysis, which is typically performed three times a week as an outpatient. Patients with acute renal failure or those with end-stage renal disease who are inpatients may also be managed with continuous renal dialysis, which is typical with patients in the intensive care unit. Less frequently, patients with renal disease receive peritoneal dialysis. Surgery should be performed the day after dialysis so that electrolytes are optimized and fluid shifts minimized. All medications should be renally dosed and the diet modified to ensure that it is consistent with the needs of the patient. This typically means a low-salt and low-protein diet.

# 2.5 Liver Disease

Liver disease can have a significant impact in the perioperative period. A careful history will often reveal patients who are at risk for liver disease including those with alcoholism, substance abuse, prior transfusions, hepatitis, tattoos, and sexual promiscuity. Signs and symptoms may be conspicuous by their absence, although fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, palmar erythema, spider telangiectasia, splenomegaly, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and increased abdominal girth are all suggestive. Screening for liver disease in an otherwise healthy patient is of little benefit. The end stage of liver disease is cirrhosis, which results in portal hypertension with esophageal varices and hemorrhoids with the inherent potential for severe gastroesophageal bleeding. Perioperative morbidity and mortality are significantly higher in this patient population. Surgery is generally contraindicated in patients with acute or fulminant hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, or severe chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, the 30-day mortality rate for nonmajor head and neck surgery increases substantially with advancing liver disease

with a tenfold increased risk for death with advanced lover disease.

The liver is an important organ for the metabolism of many drugs, and liver disease can adversely affect drug metabolism. Liver disease also influences mechanical ventilation owing to the respiratory compromise it produces through hepatopulmonary syndrome, pleural effusions, and pulmonary HTN. Liver disease also predisposes patients to excessive bleeding owing to the impaired synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent Factors II, VII, IX, and X.

Patients with cirrhosis have typically been risk stratified according to the Child's classification, but the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) system may be superior [30]. There is growing evidence that MELD can be used to predict risk in head and neck surgery. The MELD score is determined from an equation that includes the serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, and INR. Several modifications to this system have been suggested with the goal of more accurately predicting survival in patients with end-stage liver disease. An online calculator for determining a patient's MELD score can be found on the United Network for Organ Sharing website (▶ www.unos.org/resources/meldpeldcalculator.asp). Patients with a MELD score less than 10 can undergo elective surgery, those with a MELD score of 10-15 may undergo elective surgery with caution, and those with a MELD score greater than 15 should not undergo elective surgery.

Liver function can also be easily assessed using simple blood tests including:

Liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase.  
Bilirubin.  
Prothrombin time, INR, PTT.  
Serologic markers for hepatitis (A, B, or C) are of limited value unless in the setting of acute hepatitis or when establishing exposure or carrier status.

Recently the aspartate amino transferase to platelet ratio (APRI) has been found to be relatively sensitive and specific in identifying hepatic fibrosis [31]. A ratio  $>0.7$  suggests the presence of liver disease.

The perioperative goals of the patient with liver disease are multiple and depend to some degree on what the surgical procedure is and whether it is being performed under local anesthesia, sedation, or a general anesthesia. The elevated prothrombin time and INR can be corrected with vitamin K if time allows, although it may take  $12\mathrm{h}$  for the vitamin K-dependent factors to be synthesized in sufficient quantities to significantly decrease the INR. Alternatively, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or activated Factor VII can be administered with an immediate improvement in the INR. Desmopressin

DDAVP) can also be administered to increase von Willebrand's factor (vWF), which is normally produced in endothelium, megakaryocytes, and the liver. This results in increased platelet function through enhanced platelet binding. Ascites should be managed with diuretics, beta blockers, and the removal of excessive peritoneal fluid. Intravenous fluid should be limited, as should total sodium intake. Electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia must also be addressed with cautious supplementation. When present, elevated plasma ammonia levels should be managed with lactulose and dietary modification. Antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of peritoneal infection secondary to bacterial translocation should be considered. Fluid balance can remain a challenge, and careful management of blood volume, cardiac output, and urine production is required. The potential for severe and life-threatening gastroesophageal bleeding exists in all patients with liver disease, and consideration to reducing this risk with histamine  $(\mathrm{H}_2)$  antagonists is warranted.

# 2.6 Blood Disorders

# 2.6.1 Anemia

Patients may present with a history of anemia or it may be suspected based on nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and tiredness. Occasionally, patients may report blood loss in the stool or emesis or from menorrhagia. Anemia is an absolute or relative reduction in the hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit. The net result is hypoxemia due to a lack of oxygen-carrying capacity. Anemia may be due to a decrease in RBC production or an increase in RBC destruction. Patients with anemia require a diagnosis, and elective surgical procedures should be delayed if the anemia is significant. No absolute value can be used to decide what is significant, although when the anemia is symptomatic, this should be considered important. Females with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and breakthrough bleeding have a reason to be anemic, and referral to a gynecologist is needed. Female patients with gastrointestinal losses and all males with anemia require appropriate workup to identify the source of bleeding.

Anemia is diagnosed with a complete blood count (CBC), which will reveal a reduced red cell number, reduced hemoglobin, and a reduced hematocrit. RBC indices will also be available as part of the CBC and include the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The initial approach to a patient with anemia begins with determining whether it is a result of decreased production or increased destruction. The reticulocyte count can distinguish the two, with hypoproliferative disorders

associated with a reduction in the reticulocyte count, and anemia due to an increased red cell destruction would be associated with an increased reticulocyte count. Decreased RBC production can be divided into microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemia. All have the common feature of decreased RBC production with a decreased reticulocyte count below  $2\%$ . Microcytic anemia is defined by an MCV less than  $80~\mathrm{fL}$  and may be the result of iron deficiency, thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia, or sickle cell disease. Additional tests are required to distinguish among the four entities. Iron deficiency is the most common and easily recognized by a decrease in serum iron and serum ferritin and an increase in total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Thalassemia typically has a positive family history and diagnosis requires gel electrophoresis. Sideroblastic anemia is uncommon and associated with an increase in serum iron and ferritin, although diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy. Sickle cell trait/disease also typically provides a positive family history and can be confirmed with a blood smear or genetic testing.

Normocytic anemia is defined by an MCV of  $80 - 100\mathrm{fL}$  and may be the result of renal failure, chronic disease, or aplastic anemia. Macrocytic anemia is defined by an MCV greater than  $100\mathrm{fL}$  and is most often due to vitamin  $\mathbf{B}_{12}$  or folic acid deficiency. The serum vitamin  $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ , folic acid, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine can be used to distinguish the two.

Anemia due to increased RBC destruction is associated with an increased reticulocyte count above  $2\%$  and may be due to hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolysis, cold agglutinin disease, or mechanical destruction. A blood smear and direct and indirect Coombs' test can be used to identify the cause. The presence of schistocytes in the blood smear can be the result of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), prosthetic heart valve, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).

The general workup of the anemic patient should include a CBC, peripheral smear, MCV, and reticulocyte count. Additional tests should be requested based on the initial results and may include serum iron, ferritin, TIBC, vitamin  $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ , folate, Coombs' test (direct and indirect), methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and a bone marrow biopsy.

Iron-deficiency anemia may be treated with iron supplements, whereas megaloblastic anemias should be treated with vitamin  $\mathbf{B}_{12}$  or folate depending on the deficiency. Dietary change should also be instigated in all cases except pernicious anemia because a lack of intrinsic factor renders dietary vitamin  $\mathbf{B}_{12}$  ineffective. Megaloblastic anemia can be seen in vegetarians and those who avoid leafy green vegetables. Dietary inadequacy may also be seen in chronic alcoholics.

Sickle cell anemia deserves special mention because it is seen frequently in African Americans. Sickle cell trait is heterozygous and of minor clinical significance. Sickle cell disease is homozygous and clinically important. Deoxygenated RBCs polymerize and sickle. This leads to vaso-occlusive crises causing pain, cardiomyopathy, and infarcts of bone, lungs, and kidneys. Most patients undergo autosplenectomy owing to the progressive splenic infarction. Intravascular hemolysis also leads to gallstones in young patients. The treatment of sickle cell patients requires:

Hydration  
Supplemental oxygen  
- Hydroxyurea to decrease the incidence and severity of pain crises  
Narcotic pain medication during crises  
Aggressive treatment of infection  
Vaccination as a result of the autosplenectomy

# 2.6.2 Myeloproliferative Disease

This is a group of disorders characterized by a clonal proliferation of myeloid cells. All of these entities have the potential to transform into acute leukemias, although this occurs slowly. Myeloproliferative diseases may be suspected based on symptoms but may be identified from routine blood screening in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Myeloproliferative diseases can be classified according to the cell line responsible. Although bone marrow biopsy is the most sensitive diagnostic test, a CBC and smear are often suggestive. The four categories of myeloproliferative diseases include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Polycythemia vera is an elevated RBC count and may present with headache, CVA, angina, pruritus, amaurosis, claudication, and splenomegaly as a result of the hyperviscosity syndrome. Essential thrombocytosis is an elevated platelet count and presents with symptoms similar to those of polycythemia vera. Myelofibrosis is defined by an increase in bone marrow fibrous tissue and is associated with fatigue, weight loss, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and massive splenomegaly. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is discussed in the next section.

# 2.6.3 Leukemia

The leukemias are a group of malignant diseases of lymphocytes or myeloid cells. They are mentioned for completeness. The leukemias are classified according to cell type: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and chronic

lymphocytic leukemia. All leukemias tend to present with similar perioperative concerns. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ineffective leukocytosis present multiple surgical challenges. Infections are more common and should be treated aggressively. The medical management of leukemia causes further immunocompromise, increasing patient morbidity.

# 2.6.4 Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma

Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphoid tissue that resides predominantly within lymphoid tissue. It can be classified as Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) depending on the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are present in the former. Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is a low-grade form of NHL that secretes immunoglobulin leading to a hyperviscosity syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, and Raynaud's phenomenon.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant proliferation of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal antibody (M component). The disease progresses slowly but can lead to anemia, bone pain, hypercalcemia, renal disease, nephrotic syndrome, and hyperviscosity syndrome.

The treatment of lymphoma and MM includes chemotherapy and occasionally radiotherapy. The additional use of bisphosphonates in MM to reduce lytic lesions and bone pain has greatly improved the quality of life but has resulted in the development of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) in a proportion of patients.

# 2.6.5 Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia is due to decreased platelet production, increased destruction, or splenic sequestration. The net result is bleeding episodes that occur spontaneously or with minimal trauma when the platelet count falls below 50,000 cells/mm $^3$ . The causes of thrombocytopenia are multiple but the surgeon should be aware of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), TTP, HUS, and DIC. ITP is an autoimmune disorder that can follow an upper respiratory infection and is treated with steroids or splenectomy. Although often self-limiting, persistent mild perioperative thrombocytopenia may require steroids to increase the platelet count depending on the number and the nature of the planned procedure. TTP and HUS are characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, although the former is also associated with seizures. DIC may be seen in the perioperative period, particularly the multitrauma and septic patient. Patients are at risk for significant perioperative bleeding. All patients with thrombocyto

penia should be optimized before any surgical procedure. This entails managing the underlying condition and increasing the platelet count, which may necessitate platelet transfusion. Patients with DIC should not be considered surgical candidates.

# 2.6.6 Coagulopathy

Abnormalities of platelets, the intrinsic clotting pathway, and the extrinsic clotting pathway are all causes of coagulopathy. A personal or family history of a bleeding diathesis or a history of excessive bleeding with prior surgical procedures or extractions is a sensitive means of assessing potential bleeding problems. The propensity for bleeding is best assessed with a CBC to evaluate the platelet count; platelet aggregation tests to assess platelet function; and the prothrombin time (PT), INR, and PTT to evaluate the coagulation cascade. Routine screening in an asymptomatic patient without a history of bleeding is not recommended, however [32-37].

Thrombasthenia may be due to inherited defects as seen with Bernard-Soulier thrombasthenia, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, or von Willebrand's disease (vWD). The latter is a common autosomal disease associated with a decrease in vWF and Factor VIII. There are several types of vWD that are classified depending on whether the vWF defect is quantitative or qualitative. When the defect is quantitative, treatment with the vasopressin analogue (DDAVP) will increase the vWF and Factor VIII level. The preoperative platelet count and the nature of the surgery will determine whether this increase is sufficient for the planned procedure. When the platelet count is particularly low or the defect qualitative, Factor VIII concentrate, recombinant vWF, or cryoprecipitate will be necessary. A hematologist should be involved early in the patient's management to optimize the treatment. Platelet defects may also be acquired. This is very common and the potential impact should not be underestimated. A recent history of NSAIDs, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or platelet IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be sought. Many patients will fail to report the use of aspirin unless specifically asked. Lastly, patients with end-stage renal disease may present with uremia, which may reduce platelet function significantly.

The general aim with surgical patients is to achieve a platelet count above 100,000 cells/mm $^3$ . In addition, platelet function may be abnormal and should be assessed and corrected if possible. The use of clopidogrel and ticlopidine is not usually problematic for minor surgery, but the potential for bleeding exists and this needs to be considered before any major surgery. In the case of expected major blood loss at surgery, consultation with the patient's internist and subsequent discontinuation of clopidogrel and ticlopidine is recommended

1 week before the procedure. Platelet replacement may be required for patients with either thrombocytopenia or thrombasthenia. It should be remembered that the development of autoantibodies to prior platelet transfusions may result in a less than predictable response to subsequent platelet transfusions.

# 2.6.7 Hemophilia A and B

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder characterized by a deficiency in Factor VIII. Males are affected, although females may be carriers and can have hemophilia if they are homozygous. Factor VIII is a key coagulation factor in the extrinsic cascade and any deficiency can be measured with the PTT. The Factor VIII level can also be measured to quantitate disease severity. Hemophilia A can be classified based on the Factor VIII level:

Mild hemophilia with Factor VIII level of  $5 - 25\%$  
Moderate hemophilia with Factor VIII level  $1 - 5\%$  
Severe hemophilia with Factor VIII level lower than  $1\%$

The treatment of hemophilia A depends on the Factor VIII level and the nature of the proposed surgical procedure. Minor surgical procedures may require only modest elevations in Factor VIII level to  $50\%$  of the normal value. Major surgical procedures usually dictate that the level be restored to a normal level. The most common treatment involves replacement with recombinant Factor VIII. DDAVP can be used in mild cases and results in a mild increase in Factor VIII level through endothelial cell release. Cryoprecipitate can also be used but carries the risk of disease transmission because it is obtained from pooled human donors. If antibodies have developed prior to Factor VIII replacement therapy, then activated Factor VII may be required. With a half-life of  $12\mathrm{h}$ , Factor VIII replacement needs to be given twice a day. Despite an improvement in the PTT or factor, local measures at the time of surgery are also of paramount importance in helping to reduce the risk of postoperative bleeding. Antifibrinolytics should also be considered in this patient population. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid can be administered systemically or applied topically as a mouthwash/gargle and have been shown to reduce the number of postoperative bleeding episodes. A growing number of patients are maintained on home therapy and learn to self-administer Factor VIII when necessary or have a family member do so. These patients can have minor surgery performed on an ambulatory basis. They should be instructed in conjunction with their hematologist/hemophilia nurse to administer the appropriate number of units at home preoperatively and postoperatively.

Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is less common than hemophilia A and is autosomal recessive in the mode of inheritance. It is due to a deficiency in Factor IX. The half-life of Factor IX is  $18\mathrm{h}$ , and, accordingly, replacement is required every  $18\mathrm{h}$ . Distinguishing between hemophilia A and B can initially be difficult because they both present with an elevated PTT. A Factor IX assay is required to make the diagnosis of hemophilia B. Treatment is with Factor IX replacement, which should increase the Factor IX level and normalize the PTT.

# 2.6.8 Warfarin Therapy

Many patients present who are anticoagulated with warfarin. They may have a history of AF, prosthetic heart valve, peripheral vascular disease, DVT, or PE. The adequacy of treatment is measured by evaluating the PT or the INR. The actual therapeutic level required is determined more by the medical condition necessitating the anticoagulation. Warfarin is a potent inhibitor of the vitamin K-dependent proteins II, VII, IX, X, C, and S. Proteins C and S are involved in the fibrinolytic pathway, and, as such, a deficiency of these proteins tends to promote coagulation. The type of surgery planned, the INR, and the underlying medical need for warfarin will dictate whether to discontinue it before surgery, although considerable controversy exists. For minor surgery, such as extractions and the surgical removal of teeth, maintaining warfarin with an INR of less than 3.0 or 3.5 seems appropriate, given the potential for significant embolic complications in those who discontinue warfarin. Local hemostatic measures during surgery are paramount and should be combined with postoperative tranexamic acid or EACA [38].

Major surgery dictates a different approach. Several options exist and should be tailored to the patient. Early discussion and treatment planning with the patient's treating physician is needed before any decision making.

- Stop warfarin 4 days before the procedure and resume after surgery (if medically appropriate to discontinue).  
- Stop warfarin 4 days before the procedure. Bridge with enoxaparin  $1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  subcutaneously twice a day and resume warfarin after surgery. Hold enoxaparin the night before and the morning of the procedure and resume the evening of the procedure.  
- Stop warfarin 4 days before the procedure. Bridge with UFH infusion and resume warfarin dose after surgery. Hold heparin  $6\mathrm{h}$  before the procedure and resume  $6\mathrm{h}$  after surgery.  
Use local hemostatic measures during surgery.  
- Administer tranexamic acid or EACA orally or topically.

Active bleeding or the emergent need for surgery dictates a different approach. Warfarin can be reversed with the administration of vitamin K, although it typically takes  $10 - 12\mathrm{h}$  for the reversal to occur. It also has a short half-life and may need to be redosed every  $6\mathrm{h}$ . Acute bleeding necessitates immediate treatment and replacement of clotting factors with FFP.

# 2.6.9 Hypercoagulable Diseases

There are multiple inherited and acquired conditions that predispose patients to thrombosis. The acquired states include antithrombin III deficiency, protein C and S deficiency, Factor V Leiden deficiency, and Factor II mutation. Acquired states include prolonged immobilization, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, malignancy, smoking, nephritic syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Acquired causes should be eliminated whenever possible. Patients may be receiving warfarin, and this may influence the perioperative management. Additional perioperative steps that can reduce the risk for DVT and PE should be instituted.

Encourage ambulation as soon as possible.  
Use sequential calf compressors.  
Use thromboembolic deterrent stockings (TEDS).  
Use UFH at 5000 units subcutaneously every  $8\mathrm{h}$  or enoxaparin  $30\mathrm{mg}$  subcutaneously every  $12\mathrm{h}$ .

DVT should be suspected if leg pain, leg swelling, lower extremity pitting edema, pain on dorsiflexion (Homan's sign), chest pain, shortness of breath, unexplained sinus tachycardia, or an elevated A-a oxygen gradient is noted. Appropriate workup should include a duplex ultrasound of the lower extremity, D-dimer assay, and spiral CT of the chest if PE is suspected. Appropriate management requires heparin anticoagulation and long-term warfarin treatment. Patients who cannot tolerate warfarin or who develop additional episodes of DVT on warfarin sodium (Coumadin) may require an inferior vena cava filter.

# 2.7 Endocrinology

# 2.7.1 Diabetes Mellitus

DM affects a significant proportion of the population and is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islet cells or the development of insulin resistance. Elevated blood glucose level and the by-products of glucose metabolism result in multiple negative physiological and end-organ changes (Table 2.7).

Signs and symptoms of DM include polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, acanthosis nigricans, peripheral skin pigmentation/ulcers, peripheral neuropathy, decreased visual acuity, nonketotic hyperosmolar coma, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), altered mental status, and electrolyte abnormalities.

The diagnosis of DM can be established using a number of methods. A random blood glucose above  $200\mathrm{mg / dL}$  is suggestive of DM. A fasting blood glucose between 100 and  $125\mathrm{mg / dL}$  is considered to represent a prediabetic state. A fasting blood glucose above  $126\mathrm{mg / dL}$  is diagnostic of DM. If the random or fasting blood glucose levels are inconclusive, then the oral glucose tolerance test can be used. This requires the ingestion of  $75\mathrm{mg}$  of glucose after an 8-h fast. A post blood glucose is then measured at  $2\mathrm{h}$  with a blood glucose level of  $140 - 199\mathrm{mg / dL}$  considered to represent impaired glucose tolerance and a blood glucose of greater than  $200\mathrm{mg / dL}$  diagnostic of DM.

A significant number of patients with DM will require surgical procedures. For diabetic patients undergoing procedures under local anesthesia, no change in their medication regime is warranted, provided that they

will resume a normal diet postoperatively. Diabetic patients undergoing a general anesthesia or intravenous sedation will be fasting and require a change to their normal regime. Management of the diabetic patient can be divided into the preoperative and postoperative periods. Furthermore, management depends on whether the patient is treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.

# 2.7.1.1 Preoperative

The general goal is to avoid excessive hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. This generally represents maintaining the blood glucose between 80 and  $140\mathrm{mg / dL}$ . Adjustments to a patient's insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medications will need to be made and depend on the what type

of insulin or oral hypoglycemic the patient is taking (Table 2.8).

The sliding scale for insulin administration is derived from individuals with relatively normal insulin sensitivity and should be used to adjust the blood sugar level in the perioperative period. Patients who respond poorly to the calculated insulin dose may have reduced insulin sensitivity and adjustment to the formula is needed or consideration of changing to a CII. SSI requires that blood glucose be measured every  $6\mathrm{h}$ . Regular insulin is then administered subcutaneously according to the formula:

$$
\text {U n i t s r e g u l a r i n s u l i n} = \frac {\text {B l o o d S u g a r L e v e l} - 1 4 0}{4 0}
$$

The glucose control in the preoperative period can be estimated by measuring the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The latter measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin over the prior 3 months, which reflects the average glucose level over that time. It is an independent predictor of morbidity. A hemoglobin A1c  $\geq 8\%$  suggests poor preoperative glucose control and the patient will likely benefit from delaying elective surgical procedures until the HbA1c can be reduced.

DKA can occur in insulin-dependent diabetics, usually as a result of inadequate insulin, infection, or drug use. It is associated with severe hyperglycemia and ketosis. There is a  $1\%$  mortality rate even when treated appropriately. The clinical manifestations include polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, hypotension, nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and Kussmaul's respiration. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of an anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, pseudohyponatremia, and ketoacidosis (acetoacetate and  $\beta$ -hydroxybutyrate) in serum and urine. The treatment of DKA requires aggressive intravenous hydration with normal saline, intravenous regular insulin as an initial bolus and infusion, potassium replacement, and bicarbonate when severe acidosis or cardiac instability is present. The latter is typically defined by a pH of less than 7. The fluid used for hydration should be changed to a dextrose-containing fluid such as  $\mathrm{D}_5^{1/2}\mathrm{NS}$  when the glucose level reaches  $250~\mathrm{mg/dL}$ . DKA may take many hours to treat because the hourly reduction in the glucose level with this regime should not exceed approximately  $100~\mathrm{mg/dL/h}$ .

Nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic coma can occur in older non-insulin-dependent diabetics. Precipitating factors are the same as for DKA. The mortality rate is higher than DKA owing in part to the older patients. The key clinical features are severe dehydration and altered mental status. Significant hyperglycemia and an increase in serum osmolality  $(>350\mathrm{mOsm / L})$  are typical. The treatment includes aggressive rehydration with normal saline. This should be accompanied by the administration of regular insulin as a bolus and infusion.

# 2.7.2 Thyroid

Surgical patients may present with a history of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism is typically characterized by the progressive destruction of thyroid tissue. It occurs in Hashimoto's thyroiditis in which an autoimmune lymphocytic infiltrate develops with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Subacute thyroiditis is also autoimmune and often follows a flurlike illness and presents with jaw pain but is usually self-limiting and resolves in a few months. Hypothyroidism

may also be iatrogenic, resulting from the medical treatment of hyperthyroidism. The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, facial edema, delayed deep tendon reflexes, and altered mental status. The diagnosis is usually established by observing a decreased free thyroxin  $(\mathrm{T}_4)$  and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Mild hypothyroidism is not a contraindication to surgery [39]. The treatment of hypothyroidism requires levothyroxine. The adequacy of treatment can be measured through TSH levels, which should approach normal. Myxedema is the only emergent hypothyroid condition that can develop as a result of infection, surgery, medications, or any other stressful event. The diagnosis of acute myxedema is based on a history of hypothyroidism and the development of altered mental status, seizures, or hypotension. Treatment requires immediate intravenous levothyroxine and corticosteroids. Patients in a myxedema coma also require intravenous liothyronine. Any patient who presents with acute myxedema preoperatively requires postponement of the surgery until appropriate treatment has been rendered and the patient made euthyroid.

Hyperthyroidism is most often due to Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibodies. There is the potential for thyroid storm with fever, cardiac arrhythmias, high-output cardiac failure, coma, and death. The signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include tachycardia, anxiety, tremors, heat intolerance, weight loss, AF, diarrhea, elevated systolic blood pressure, exophthalmos, and pretibial myxedema. The diagnosis can be established by the presence of an increased free  $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ , decreased TSH, and the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibodies. The treatment of hyperthyroidism may require several approaches, although the development of thyroid storm mandates a rapid and aggressive approach. Many patients with hyperthyroidism will have been treated with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy, which should render them euthyroid or even hypothyroid [40, 41]. These patients provide no additional perioperative risk. Others may have mild hyperthyroidism that requires beta blockers and either propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole to reduce thyroxin secretion in the perioperative period. A significant concern for any patient with a history of hyperthyroidism is the potential for thyroid storm. It can develop quickly with fever, tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac failure, altered mental status, and death. Treatment requires a prompt diagnosis and the sequential administration of beta blockers, PTU or methimazole, and sodium iodide. One problem is that the signs and symptoms that present may be confused with malignant hyperthermia (MH), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or pheochromocytoma. Additional treatment includes hyperventilation to help manage the

hypercarbia secondary to the hypermetabolic state and rapid cooling to manage the increasing body temperature. Decreasing ambient temperature, cool intravenous fluids, and cooling blankets may also be needed. For either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, elective surgery should be delayed until the treatment makes the patient euthyroid as determined by thyroid hormone levels. Emergent or urgent procedures should be undertaken without delay and the patients should be monitored closely. The potential need to supplement patients with thyroid hormone, corticosteroids, and cardiovascular support or the need to block the production and effects of excess thyroid hormone should be recognized early.

# 2.7.3 Adrenal

Patients with adrenal disease may present with excessive adrenal function or adrenal insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by excessive plasma cortisol levels. It can be secondary to adrenal hyperplasia, pituitary adenoma, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, or exogenous corticosteroid administration. Patients present with truncal obesity, moon facies, abdominal striae, hirsutism, hyperglycemia, HTN, and purpura. The diagnosis is confirmed with a 24-h urine-free cortisol level, high dexamethasone suppression test, and abnormal ACTH level. Conn's syndrome is characterized by excessive aldosterone levels. This is usually secondary to adrenal hyperplasia or adenoma of the zona glomerulosa but can occur as a result of renal disease and increased serum renin. Patients present with HTN, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hyperchloremia, and alkalosis. The diagnosis is confirmed with elevated serum aldosterone levels. The perioperative concerns relate primarily to fluid balance, electrolytes, and glucose level, all of which require appropriate correction as needed.

Adrenal insufficiency may be primary or secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to destruction of the adrenal glands from autoimmune disease, infection, or infarction and is referred to as Addison's disease. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to a lack of ACTH due to pituitary failure. Primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency can be distinguished based on the presence of hyperpigmentation, ACTH level, and the cosytropin stimulation test. The inadequate levels of adrenal cortisol place the patient at risk for an acute adrenal crisis when stressed with surgery or any infection. Acute adrenal crisis is characterized by nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, fever, lethargy, severe hypotension, altered mental status, and electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with adrenal insufficiency are usually

managed with prednisolone replacement therapy. The steroid administration, while providing adequate replacement for daily physiologic needs, is insufficient to manage the patient's requirements in the perioperative period. This requires a significant increase in the perioperative steroid dose. Occasionally, patients may also be receiving mineralocorticoid replacement (fludrocortisone) if the adrenal insufficiency has resulted in decreased aldosterone production. For minor procedures such as extractions, the patient should double the usual corticosteroid dose on the morning of the procedure. Blood pressure should be monitored during and after the procedure. Hypotension should be treated with intravenous hydrocortisone  $(100\mathrm{mg})$  or an equipotent dose of another steroid. For major procedures, the patient should receive intravenous corticosteroids in the perioperative period. Doses should be equivalent to or greater than  $300\mathrm{mg}$  of cortisol per day, which represents the normal physiologic endogenous steroid production in the face of major surgical stress. Hydrocortisone can be administered every  $6\mathrm{h}$  and the dose or frequency increased to maintain blood pressure. Alternatively, a more potent steroid with a longer half-life such as dexamethasone can be administered. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency may also have fluid and electrolyte abnormalities from the relative lack of aldosterone. Judicious fluid replacement and management of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are required.

# 2.7.4 Pituitary Disease

Diabetes insipidus (DI) can occur as a result of a decrease in pituitary antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production or as a result of renal insensitivity to ADH. These two disorders are referred to as central and nephrogenic DI, respectively. They present with severe polyuria, polydipsia, increased serum osmolality ( $>300$  mmol), and mild hypernatremia. The diagnosis of DI can be made with the water deprivation test in which inappropriate urine production occurs in the face of restricted water intake. The continued urinary loss of free water results in the increased serum osmolality and hypernatremia. The distinction between central and nephrogenic DI is made by administering DDAVP. Central DI responds to DDAVP with an appropriate decrease in free water urinary loss and a corresponding correction of the serum osmolality and hypernatremia. The long-term management of central DI is nasally administered DDAVP, whereas nephrogenic DI is treated with sodium restriction and liberal water intake. The perioperative management of the surgical patient with DI revolves around fluid and electrolyte balance.

# 2.8 Neurologic Disease

# 2.8.1 Trauma

The spectrum of neurologic disease is wide with some patients presenting significant perioperative challenges. Acute neurologic deterioration in the setting of trauma is a special circumstance that also demands particular attention. The initial management of the trauma patient requires a systematic approach. The primary survey is designed to identify and correct life-threatening conditions and entails an assessment of the airway, breathing, circulation, and disability. The latter is a neurologic assessment that can be influenced by many factors including the airway, breathing, and circulation. The assessment of the neurologic status continues with the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which helps determine severity, treatment, and prognosis of head-injured patients (Table 2.9) [42].

Injury may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the score. Severe injury as determined by a GCS of 8 or less typically mandates intubation, although less severe injuries may also require a secure airway. The

Table 2.9 Glasgow Coma Scale  

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Score</td></tr><tr><td>Eye opening</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Spontaneously</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>To speech</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>To pain</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>No response</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Verbal response</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Orientated</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Confused</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Inappropriate words</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Incomprehensible</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>No response</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Motor response</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Obeys commands</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Localizes pain</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Withdraws to pain</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Flexes to pain</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Extends to pain</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>No response</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

nature of the neurologic injury will depend in part on the mechanism of injury. Gunshot wounds are typically associated with penetrating and avulsion injuries, whereas motor vehicle crashes, sporting injuries, and domestic violence are more likely to result in extradural, subdural, subarachnoid, and parenchymal hemorrhage or diffuse axonal damage. Early involvement of the neurosurgical team to manage and treat the injury is paramount. Generalized goals of treatment are to limit further damage by controlling hemorrhage, minimizing cerebral edema, and maintaining cerebral perfusion. The role of the maxillofacial surgeon is limited, but the importance of securing the airway is critical and may necessitate intubation or an emergent airway.

# 2.8.2 Seizures

Seizures can occur in the perioperative period in healthy patients and those with a known seizure disorder such as epilepsy. Seizures can be classified as partial and generalized. Unremitting generalized seizure activity is termed status epilepticus. The potential causes of seizure are many. Epilepsy is a frequent cause of seizures, and a careful history regarding the frequency and severity of seizure activity should be sought. This will enable the surgeon to determine whether local anesthesia, sedation, or a hospital-based procedure is appropriate. Patients with well-controlled seizures can generally undergo anesthesia and surgery in the office or hospital. Irrespective of the procedure location, seizure medication should always be maintained. A multitude of medications are currently available to control seizures. Traditional medications such as phenytoin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, and phenobarbital are used less frequently owing to the side effects including sedation. Bone marrow suppression with carbamazepine and liver enzyme inhibition with valproic acid may also occur. Newer drugs such as gabapentin, pregabalin, lamotrigine, topiramate, and tiagabine are becoming more popular owing to their efficacy and side effect profile.

Additional potential causes of seizure activity include anesthesia-related drugs, drug and alcohol withdrawal, degenerative central nervous system disease, head trauma, CVA, and metabolic derangements. Two particular anesthetic drugs that can reduce the seizure threshold are local anesthetics and meperidine. Local anesthetic overdose can suppress inhibitory neurons and increase seizure activity. Meperidine has an active metabolite, normeperidine, that can promote seizure activity particularly in the face of renal insufficiency. Benzodiazepine, barbiturate, and alcohol withdrawal can also promote seizures owing to loss in neuronal

inhibition from these drugs. Head injury can also promote seizures from raised intracranial pressure, extravascular blood, and diffuse axonal injury. Metabolic derangements may be encountered in relatively healthy surgical patients, and this may also lead to seizures. Sodium, calcium, magnesium, glucose, urea, and ammonia are particularly important in this regard. Fluid and electrolyte balance is paramount, and all abnormalities should be corrected promptly.

New-onset seizures require treatment as well as a search for the cause. Signs and symptoms of seizure include altered mental status, confusion, loss of consciousness, and abnormal movement. The diagnosis of seizure may require an electroencephalogram (EEG). The initial treatment of perioperative seizures may require intravenous loading and maintenance with phenytoin. Fosphenytoin may be preferred owing to the more predictable bioavailability. Benzodiazepines may also be used to terminate a seizure but play no role in the long-term management of recurrent seizure activity. The transition to oral seizure medications is best managed in conjunction with neurology.

# 2.8.3 Cerebrovascular Accident

Atherosclerosis of the carotid and cerebral blood vessels places patients at risk for CVA and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the perioperative period. Carotid atherosclerosis may be suspected based on the presence of a carotid bruit. A carotid duplex ultrasound is typically used to better define the severity of the stenosis. Occasionally, angiography, CT angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography may be used. Stenosis greater than  $70\%$  may benefit from endarterectomy before any elective surgical procedure [43]. CVA may be the result of thromboembolic events or hemorrhage, whereas TIA is typically a result of the former. AF also increases the risk for CVA owing to atrial thrombosis and subsequent embolic events. Thrombosis of the lower extremity veins can also lead to CVA or TIA in the presence of atrial or ventricular septal defects. Patients with AF who are typically on warfarin should continue the medication in the perioperative period whenever possible. Patients with a history of TIA or thromboembolic CVA are often treated with aspirin or ticlopidine, which should be continued in the perioperative period if the nature of the planned surgical procedure allows. Surgical patients with a history of hemorrhagic CVA need to have their blood pressure well controlled. They may also have a history of HTN. Excessive elevations or reductions in blood pressure may also predispose to either CVA or TIA.

# 2.8.4 Myasthenia Gravis

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the development of antibodies against the acetylcholine (Ach) receptor. It is often the result of thymus hyperplasia or a thymoma. Stressors including surgery, infections, and certain medications such as aminoglycosides, phenytoin, and meperidine may predispose patients to a myasthenic crisis. The signs and symptoms of a myasthenia crisis may include weakness, fatigue, ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia, respiratory distress, or failure to wean from the ventilator. Patients who present with a history of MG present challenges mostly related to their ventilatory status. This has an impact on their ability to undergo sedation, general anesthesia, and ventilator separation. Close collaboration with the neurologist managing the MG is strongly recommended. The diagnosis of an MG requires repetitive muscle activity with demonstrative progressive weakness, an electromyogram with decreased amplitude on repetitive nerve stimulation, and the edrophonium test, during which there is a rapid but transient improvement in symptoms due to increased Ach at the motor endplate. The diagnosis can also be supported by the presence of anti-Ach receptor antibody and a thymoma on CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest. The perioperative treatment of MG may involve anticholinesterase medication such as pyridostigmine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasmapheresis.

# 2.9 Other Conditions

# 2.9.1 Malignant Hyperthermia

MH is a serious, life-threatening condition characterized by a state of hypermetabolism leading to hyperthermia and massive rhabdomyolysis. It is an autosomal dominant genetic defect of one of several receptors within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A mutation in the ryanodine receptor accounts for most cases, although several other receptors such as the CACNA 1S calcium channel receptor are involved in some patients. Certain anesthetic drugs including all volatile agents and succinylcholine can cause the rapid accumulation of calcium within the sarcoplasmic reticulum within skeletal muscle. The patient with a history suspicious of MH would benefit from a definitive diagnosis before any future anesthesia. This typically requires a skeletal muscle biopsy and the caffeine halothane contraction test, which has a sensitivity and specificity of  $97\%$  and  $75\%$ , respectively [44]. Genetic susceptibility testing is cur

rently available for the ryanodine and CACNA 1S receptor mutations [45]. More often than not, the diagnosis is made only after the rapid development of MH.

One of the earliest features of developing MH is hypercarbia as seen through an increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide. This is followed by tachycardia, muscle rigidity, metabolic acidosis, and hyperthermia. Massive rhabdomyolysis with renal failure, electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia, cardiovascular collapse, and death ensues unless treated aggressively.

The treatment of MH mandates immediate cessation of the volatile anesthetic agent or succinylcholine followed by hyperventilation to eliminate any volatile agent and reduce end-tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . This should then be followed by the administration of dantrolene  $(2.5\mathrm{mg / kg})$  and fluid resuscitation. Dantrolene is available as Dantrium® or Revonto® is available as a  $20\mathrm{mg}$  vial with each vial requiring  $60~\mathrm{mL}$  of sterile water for reconstitution. A  $100\mathrm{kg}$  patient would therefore require 12.5 vials or reconstituted dantrolene which can be time consuming in a emergent situation. Dantrolene is also available as Ryanodex® with each vial containing  $250~\mathrm{mg}$  and requiring only  $5\mathrm{mL}$  or sterile water for reconstitution. Doses in excess of  $2.5\mathrm{mg / kg}$  may be needed.

An arterial or venous blood gas should be obtained to determine the degree of metabolic acidosis followed by the administration of bicarbonate  $(1 - 2\mathrm{mEq / kg})$  and cooling. Hyperkalemia above 5.9 will require calcium chloride  $(10~\mathrm{mg / kg})$  for myocardial stabilization followed by glucose/insulin  $50~\mathrm{mL}$ $50\%$  dextrose and 10 units of regular insulin).

# 2.9.2 Autoimmune Disease

There are a multitude of autoimmune diseases that are likely to affect surgical patients. These include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren's syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, and polymyositis. The autoimmune disease as well as the medical treatment of the disease results in suppression of the immune system and increases the likelihood of perioperative complications. In addition, organ systems may be the target of the disease resulting in airway, pulmonary, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, renal, hematologic, and neurologic difficulties. Wound healing may also be impaired in many of these patients and surgical infections are more common.

Three autoimmune diseases worth elaborating on are rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis. Surgical patients with one of these diseases are likely to be encountered. Rheumatoid arthritis, despite the name, is a multisystem disease. In

addition to the classic symmetrical involvement of the joints, nonarticular involvement can include the pericardium, pleura, lung, blood vessels, muscle, bone marrow, and skin. This can result in pericarditis, pleuritis, pneumonitis, vasculitis, myopathy, bone marrow suppression, and ulcers. Anemia of chronic disease is also often present. Rheumatoid factor may or may not be present in patients. Temporomandibular joint involvement may occur and result in limited opening, arthralgia, degenerative joint disease, and apertognathia. Cervical involvement may limit neck extension, further complicating anesthesia. The patient with limited opening may present anesthetic challenges, and planning for a difficult airway is essential. Many of the medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis result in complications themselves. NSAIDs reduce platelet function; glucocorticoids result in adrenal insufficiency and Cushing's syndrome; and the slow-acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and anticytokine drugs are all immunosuppressive. SAARDS and DMARDS include hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and leflunomide. Anticytokine drugs continue to grow in number. Several categories of drugs exist including the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist anakinra, B cell-depleting agent rituximab, T cell costimulator blocking agent abatacept, and the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab. Ideally, patients with rheumatoid arthritis should have their disease control maximized before an elective surgical procedure. However, cessation of anticytokine medication before an elective procedure may be appropriate, given the potential for infection in this group, and this should be discussed with the rheumatologist. Cessation of medication typically requires 1 week before and after the surgical procedure.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is another autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement. Features may include anemia, thrombocytopenia, rash, polyarthritis, photosensitivity, uveitis, coagulopathy, neurologic manifestations, psychosis, and renal disease. Perioperative concerns relate primarily to anemia, renal disease, adrenal suppression, and risk for DVT. Care should be exercised in the use of radiographic contrast media and drugs may need to be renally dosed. Appropriate risk reduction for DVT mandates sequential calf compressors in the perioperative period, early mobilization, and heparin or enoxaparin prophylaxis. Additional steroids to compensate for adrenal suppression are likely, but this will depend on the nature of the surgical procedure and the usual daily steroid dose.

Ankylosing spondylitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressing spondylosis and immobility. Kyphosis develops insidiously and results in a rigid cervical spine that provides significant challenge for anesthesia. This is often combined with temporoman

dibular joint involvement and limited opening. Sedation is generally contraindicated in this group owing to the inability to secure an airway should it become necessary. General anesthesia is also problematic and often requires fiberoptic intubation or an awake tracheostomy. The kyphosis also reduces pulmonary compliance and functional residual capacity.

# 2.9.3 Immunodeficiencies

Deficiencies in cell-mediated immunity predispose patients to infection from bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Cell-mediated immunity can be assessed by observation of the prototypical cell-mediated response of the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. This is classically seen with the Mantoux test, in which an intradermal injection of tuberculin is given. A more predictable method of evaluating cell-mediated immunity is by measuring the ratio of CD4 helper T cells to the CD8 suppressor cells. This provides quantitative information but might not necessarily correlate with normal function. One of the most common causes of reduced cell-mediated immunity is HIV. However, the advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality by reducing the viral load and increasing the CD4 count in most patients.

Deficiencies in humoral immunity also predispose patients to infection. Humoral immunity is best assessed by measuring the serum level of the five classes of immunoglobulin. Prior vaccination may also lead to the development of circulating antibody, which can be readily measured to determine the adequacy of the humoral system.

Deficiencies in the nonspecific immune pathway often present with abnormalities of neutrophil function. This predisposes patients to bacterial and fungal infections. Although the absolute neutrophil count can be measured, neutrophil function should also be evaluated. An absolute neutrophil count below 500 cells/mL requires patient isolation and prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal treatment. Deficiencies in complement also predispose patients to bacterial infections. Individual complement factors can be measured as can the entire complement cascade function through the CH50 assay.

Immunocompromised patients should have a thorough history to ascertain whether there is a history of recurrent infections, opportunistic infections, generalized lymphadenopathy, or weight loss. A thorough understanding of any identified autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency is necessary to further appreciate the effect on organ systems. The clinical examination should identify signs of immunodeficiency, which manifest as

opportunistic infections. Of particular importance are oral and esophageal candidiasis, gingivitis and periodontitis, oral ulceration, diarrhea, and persistent cough and shortness of breath. Laboratory investigations may include a CBC with differential, CD4/CD8 ratio, serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgE, IgD, and IgA), functional assays for neutrophil and complement function, and a chest x-ray.

Immunocompromised patients need to be aggressively treated when infections occur. This includes early surgical intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The use of perioperative and postoperative antibiotics should be considered in all but the simplest elective surgical procedures. Optimizing the immune status is also critical, although difficult to do in the short term. Treatment of the underlying cause of immunodeficiency is paramount. This is particularly true for HIV. HAART has no role in the acute setting but should be implemented as soon as possible. Optimizing blood glucose control reduces patient morbidity and should be the goal in all patients. Consideration should also be given to reducing or eliminating perioperative steroids, which will further suppress the inflammatory response and immune system.

Patients who have lost their spleen through surgery or sickle cell disease are a special group. They are at risk for bacterial infections, particularly from bacteria with polysaccharide capsules such as Pneumococcus, Meningococcus, and Haemophilus. These patients should be vaccinated against these organisms. Early and aggressive treatment of infections is appropriate.

A significant number of patients take immunosuppressive agents to modulate autoimmune disease, treat malignancy, or suppress organ transplant rejection. A multitude of drugs are used, and these can result in neutropenia and lymphopenia. This places patients at risk for poor wound healing, infection, and overwhelming sepsis. Treatment of the underlying autoimmune disease should be optimized before any elective surgery. The judicious discontinuation of certain medications in the perioperative period should be discussed with the patient's rheumatologist or internal medicine specialist. Perioperative antibiotics should be considered in most patients, and any infections that do develop should be treated aggressively.

HIX affects more than one million Americans and results in the progressive destruction of CD4 helper T cells. This may lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with opportunistic infections. Infection with HIV should be considered in any patient with signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections. The diagnosis of HIV infection requires a screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test and a confirmatory Western blot. The CD4 count is used to assess disease progression and is often combined with polymerase

chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate viral load and response to HAART. There are four broad drug categories in HAART. These include nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and fusion inhibitors. The CD4 count should be known before all surgical procedures. This allows for risk stratification and appropriate prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Every organ system can be affected by HIV/AIDS, and management of these patients can be challenging.

For a CD4 count below 200 cells/mL, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; PCP) prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, dapsone, atovaquone, or pentamidine is needed. As the CD4 count declines below 100 cells/mL, prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis becomes important with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as the first choice. When the CD4 count falls below 50 cells/mL, the potential for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) necessitates prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic. Patients with HIV who will require surgery may benefit from receiving prophylactic treatment in the perioperative period even if currently not receiving such medication.

# 2.9.4 Substance Abuse

The oral and maxillofacial surgery patient may present with a problem related to substance abuse. This may include alcohol, opioids, or illicit drugs. A thorough understanding of the substance abuse will allow appropriate social and surgical management of the patient. In general terms, a distinction should be made between patients who abuse drugs and those who are dependent on them. Abuse is best defined as an individual who continues to use a drug despite social, interpersonal, and legal consequences. Drug dependence has the same features of abuse as well as ongoing physical harm. Patients with dependence are at risk of withdrawal when drugs are discontinued. Withdrawal is invariably emotionally and physically painful but, in addition, can be life-threatening depending on the drug involved.

Alcohol withdrawal is much more concerning than opioid withdrawal. The "CAGE" questionnaire is a simple means of screening for alcohol abuse and potential dependency [46]. The four questions that are asked are "Have you ever felt the need to cut down?", "Have you ever felt angry at someone's criticism of your drinking?", "Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking?", and "Have you ever had an eye opener?". Two or more positive answers correlate with a high likelihood of alcohol abuse. Alcohol withdrawal may be characterized by

a state of neuronal excitability. This may lead to severe syndrome of delirium tremens (DTs) with associated hallucinations, autonomic instability, hypertension, seizures, and coma [47]. Alcohol withdrawal can be avoided by continuing to provide alcohol in the perioperative period or by providing an alternative sedative medication. Benzodiazepines are the most appropriate medications to consider. Chlordiazepoxide and lorazepam are two common agents. Chlordiazepoxide can be given preemptively as a 4-day tapered oral regime beginning with  $50\mathrm{mg}$  every  $4\mathrm{h}$  on day 1,  $50\mathrm{mg}$  every  $6\mathrm{h}$  on day 2,  $25\mathrm{mg}$  every  $4\mathrm{h}$  on day 3, and  $25\mathrm{mg}$  every  $6\mathrm{h}$  on day 4. Most surgeons prefer to carefully evaluate potential patients and treat when the first signs of central nervous system excitation are seen. Early signs include restlessness, agitation, and tremulousness. Lorazepam can then be administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously every  $6 - 8\mathrm{h}$ . Additional areas of concern in patients with alcohol dependence include liver disease, anemia, and nutritional deficiency. Patients are often deficient in folate and thiamine, and these should be repleted.

Opioid-related deaths in the United States have reached epidemic proportions with 47,600 deaths in 2017. Deaths from prescription-related opioid abuse account for  $35\%$  (16,600) of these deaths. Patients may be taking opioids for either acute or chronic pain. Those patients receiving opioids for chronic pain will typically be under the care of a pain specialist. Despite the legitimate use of opioids for acute or chronic pain, the potential for adverse events (AE), tolerance, and adverse drug-related behavior (ADRB) including abuse, misuse, and addiction. It is estimated that there were more than 16,000 prescription opioid-related deaths in the US in 2017. It remains critical to minimize opioid exposure by adopting a systematic approach to pain management for all patients. This should include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and gabapentinoids as first-line analgesics. The use of opioids should be the last resort beginning with weak, moderate, and finally strong opioids when needed. Prescriptions should be for the minimum time period possible and must comply with state-run prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP).

The risk for ADRB in opioid naive patients can be calculated with a moderate sensitivity using the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) [48] or the Revised Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients in Pain (Revised SOAPP) [49]. A positive from the ORT or SOAPP is associated with a relative risk (RR) for ADRB of 14.3 and 2.5, respectively. Patients who are already receiving opioids can be evaluated for the risk of ADRB by completing the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) which has a RR of 2.7 when positive [50].

# 2.9.5 Obesity

Patients with obesity present many challenges in addition to the actual surgical procedure. Obesity is best measured by calculating the body mass index (BMI;  
Table 2.10). This is calculated by dividing the mass in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. The BMI allows patients to be risk stratified.

Surgical risks increase exponentially with the BMI once obesity is reached. The most common perioperative complications tend to be pulmonary. Obesity results in a restrictive pattern of lung disease due to decreased chest compliance and a superiorly displaced diaphragm, especially in the supine patient. Additional complications include a reduced functional residual capacity and the propensity to desaturate rapidly, airway obstruction, bronchospasm, atelectasis, PE, and pneumonia. Obese patients are also likely to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which potentially increases the likelihood of comorbid conditions such as HTN, coronary artery disease, and CVA. Office procedures under local anesthesia eliminate potential airway concerns. Intravenous sedation is more problematic and may not be appropriate for the obese and morbidly obese patient because the ability to secure an airway may be very challenging or not possible in the emergent setting. When sedation is chosen, the level should be light enough for the patient to maintain his or her own airway and respirations. Patients undergoing hospital-based procedures will still provide significant perioperative challenges, but these are more readily managed in this setting. The potential immediate postoperative need for CPAP in this group, particularly with a history of OSA, should not be underestimated. ASA recommends that any patient with OSA be carefully screened to determine whether they are candidates for ambulatory surgery. Factors that need to be considered include the severity of the OSA, coexisting disease, type of surgery, type of anesthesia, postopera

tive opioid needs, and the post-discharge observation [51]. A growing number of hospitals and anesthesia services are requiring patients with a proven diagnosis of OSA to be planned for overnight hospital admission with continuous pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation.

Drug pharmacokinetics are also different in the obese patient, particularly for lipid-soluble drugs. The redistribution of lipid-soluble drugs to large body stores increases the volume of distribution, which significantly delays emergence from anesthesia.

Postoperatively, patients should be encouraged to rest with an elevated head of bed, ambulate as soon as possible, use incentive spirometry, and receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

# 2.9.6 Geriatric Patients

Elderly patients can provide significant challenges in the perioperative period. Those challenges depend on their general health status, comorbidities, and age. Advancing age is itself not considered a predictor of complications, but medical conditions such as HTN and coronary artery disease are more common in this age group. Furthermore, physiologic changes ensure that the compensatory mechanisms are less able to accommodate anesthetic and surgical stresses. The medical history, current medications, and an assessment of the functional capacity are still reasonably sensitive tools to detect potential problems. Common complications that can occur in the elderly include atelectasis, pneumonia, MI, DVT, PE, CHF, and altered mental status.

Pulmonary function typically declines and is seen as a reduced lung compliance, vital capacity, and functional residual capacity. The A-a oxygen gradient also increases with age. There is roughly a  $5\mathrm{-mmHg}$  reduction in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen for each decade of life. A healthy 20-year-old would, therefore, have a partial pressure of oxygen of  $100\mathrm{mmHg}$  on room air, whereas a 70-year-old would have a partial pressure of  $75\mathrm{mmHg}$ . Furthermore, the elderly patient's response to hypoxia and hypercarbia is blunted. The potential to desaturate rapidly or become apneic is high. Pulmonary vascular changes also ensure that ventilation-perfusion mismatching increases, further reducing pulmonary function.

Cardiac function also declines with a reduction in the maximal heart rate. This reduces a significant compensatory mechanism that would otherwise allow cardiac output to increase. The development of CAD is ubiquitous, and even without a prior history, MI, acute coronary syndrome, or angina, the presence of CAD should be suspected. HTN is also often present to some

degree and is likely to have reduced ventricular compliance through LVH. This may be recognized as an additional  $\mathrm{S}_4$  on auscultation or with an ECG. This further reduces the heart's ability to increase cardiac output. Autonomic dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, and dystrophic calcification may also lead to postural hypotension, carotid stenosis, and aortic valve stenosis, respectively.

Renal function declines insidiously, and, although there may be no clinical symptoms or signs of renal disease, the GFR is reduced. This is best assessed with the creatinine clearance. Serum creatinine is an indirect measure of creatinine clearance but may remain relatively normal owing to the reduced muscle mass. The most clinically important renal concerns in the elderly patient are related to fluid and electrolyte balance. Judicious fluid administration and appropriate monitoring of fluid balance are important. Urinary retention, particularly in males, may also be problematic secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer.

Elderly patients often fail to exhibit the classic signs of infection. Pyrexia and an elevated white cell count may be conspicuous by their absence. The signs may be subtle and deterioration rapid. Fatigue, malaise, and altered mental status may be early indicators of infection, electrolyte abnormality, MI, or PE. The ability to make the appropriate diagnosis relies on a strong index of suspicion.

The preoperative evaluation of the elderly patient requires a thorough history, physical examination, and ancillary studies as needed. The latter depends on the history, physical examination, nature of the planned procedure, and the type of anesthesia proposed. Additional studies may include a CBC, chemistries, ECG, chest x-ray, carotid or cardiac ultrasound, and PFTs. Other healthcare providers who are managing the patient's medical conditions may need to be contacted to further clarify the severity of systemic diseases and the patient's suitability for the planned anesthesia and surgical procedure. Perioperative and postoperative medications should be chosen carefully and used judiciously to avoid unwanted responses. Dose reduction should be the rule for most medications [52]. Generally, the fewer the medications introduced, the less likely the patient is to develop side effects.

# 2.9.7 Pediatric Patients

The pediatric patient provides significant challenges just as does the geriatric patient. The physiology and anatomy of pediatric patients dictate a unique approach to their management. The airway presents challenges in that the mouth is small, the tongue large, the epiglottis large and floppy, and the vocal cords more anterior.

Intubation can, therefore, be more difficult and the use of a Miller blade for direct laryngoscopy may be more appropriate. The functional residual capacity is reduced, and the predisposition to rapid and early desaturation is always present. Cardiac output is proportional to heart rate because the pediatric patient has little capacity to increase stroke volume. Blood volume is higher than in adults at approximately  $80~\mathrm{mL / kg}$ . Fluid administration and resuscitation need to be carefully administered and are weight based. Urine output is higher than adults and may approximate  $2 - 3\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$  in infants and toddlers. This declines with increasing age. Children also have large surface areas and can rapidly develop hypothermia. This mandates appropriate techniques to keep them warm including warming blankets and fluid warmers. Drugs should be administered based on weight and should be checked to ensure that they are appropriate for the pediatric patient. Certain NSAIDs such as aspirin should be avoided owing to the potential for developing Reye's syndrome, whereas certain antibiotics such as the tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones should also be avoided owing to their adsorption into mineralizing tissue such as teeth, bones, and cartilage.

# 2.9.8 Pregnancy

Pregnancy results in many maternal physiologic changes. Cardiac output, minute ventilation, and renal perfusion increase. There is a relative anemia due to dilution. Pulmonary function declines largely due to the reduction in functional residual capacity with the gravid uterus. As the pregnancy progresses, compression of the inferior vena cava while supine reduces cardiac filling with a reduction in cardiac output and blood pressure. Second- and third-trimester pregnancies, therefore, require a lateral decubitus position when supine to avoid this problem. The gravid uterus also increases intra-abdominal pressure, resulting in delayed gastric emptying and increased gastroesophageal reflux disease. The potential for aspiration is, therefore, increased. When general anesthesia is needed, this necessitates a rapid induction with cricoid pressure to help reduce the risk. Nausea and emesis, if present, typically improve as the pregnancy progresses but can further compound the risk of aspiration. The frequency of urination also increases over time as the bladder is compressed by the enlarging uterus. Additional complications that may develop include preeclampsia, eclampsia, and the HELLP syndrome. Preeclampsia is characterized by HTN, proteinuria, headache, and edema. The onset of tonic-clonic seizures heralds eclampsia. The HELLP syndrome can accompany either preeclampsia or eclampsia and is characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and

low platelets. These are serious and potentially life-threatening conditions that mandate early and aggressive intervention by the obstetrician and gynecologist.

Any drug administered to the mother should be considered capable of crossing the placenta and entering the fetal circulation. Different plasma protein concentrations in the fetus may further compound maternal drug administration by leading to fetal trapping of those drugs. Teratogenic drugs are most problematic in the first trimester during fetal organogenesis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced a classification system for drugs and pregnancy that guides the choice of drugs (Table 2.11).

It would be ideal to use only category A drugs during pregnancy, but most drugs fall into category B or C as defined by the FDA. The decision should be individualized for the patient. Category D and X drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy. Even after childbirth, maternal drugs may result in potential harm to the infant through breastfeeding. Many drugs are present in breast milk, and precautions should be taken that may include choice of another drug that is not present in breast milk, a safer drug, or avoidance of breast feeding for a period of time.

Table 2.11 Drug classification in pregnancy  

<table><tr><td>Class A</td><td>Adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td>Class B</td><td>Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women or animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester</td></tr><tr><td>Class C</td><td>Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks</td></tr><tr><td>Class D</td><td>There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks</td></tr><tr><td>Class X</td><td>Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits</td></tr></table>

# Key Points

The risk of cardiac complications during noncardiac surgery can be determined by history, functional classification, and the invasiveness of the surgery. Consultation with the team caring for the patient's cardiac disease is always recommended. Cardiac conditions including recent MI, decompensated CHF, ventricular dysrhythmias, and aortic stenosis require additional concerns.  
Pulmonary complications are the most common perioperative complications. Many patients with chronic pulmonary disease are not optimized for surgery leading to unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary embolism is a common and serious postoperative pulmonary complication. The occurrence can be significantly decreased with proper management.  
Patients with underlying renal disease who sustain acute kidney injury (AKI) often require continuous renal replacement therapy and may progress to end-stage renal failure. Radiograph contrast dye and nephrotoxic medications can precipitate AKI in the surgical patient. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to fatal dysrhythmias. Fluid overload can precipitate cardiac failure in patients with renal and cardiac disease. Careful perioperative management and understanding the fragility of these patients will prevent and minimize the morbidity and mortality in these patients.  
The impact of liver failure on clotting, drug metabolism and on cardiac and renal function must be assessed. Patients require care for the anesthetic management, operative bleeding and blood loss, and postoperative pain management protocols.  
The surgeon must have a management plan in place for patients with coagulation disorders before elective surgical procedures. Close collaboration with the patient's hematology team is almost always required. Major surgical procedures can be undertaken in these patients with these management plans in place.  
Diabetes affects a significant number of people globally. Surgeons must take into consideration the end-organ damage in the diabetic patients as well as perioperative glucose control.  
Identification of neurological injuries patients with maxillofacial trauma is paramount to prevent further neurological injury during the management of the facial trauma. For the elective patients with neurological disease, careful anesthetic management and seizure control will minimize potential life-threatening perioperative complications.  
Special considerations in the perioperative period need to be taken for patients with a history of malignant hyperthermia, immune deficiencies, obesity, pregnancy, and pediatric patients.

# Conclusion

For the oral and maxillofacial surgeon regardless of what procedure they are performing in addition to performing a thorough history and focused physical examination for every patient, it is essential to have an understanding of the common systemic disease and how to manage these patients in the perioperative period. The outcome of the patients' surgery is the responsibility of the surgeon. Optimizing the patient preoperatively and careful management of the patient postoperatively cannot be left to the patients' medical team alone but should be a collaborative effort with the surgeon.
