# Learning Aims

The implant surgeon should develop diagnostic skill to recognize and correct soft tissue integration.

# 14.1 Soft Tissue Integration

The term soft tissue integration describes the biologic processes that occur during the formation and maturation of the structural relationship between the soft tissues (connective tissue and epithelium) and the transmucosal portion of an implant. Although experimental and clinical research have only recently begun to focus on improving our understanding of the factors that can affect this soft tissue environment, our current knowledge indicates that the maintenance of a healthy soft tissue barrier is as important as osseointegration itself for the long-term success of an implant-supported prosthesis. As such, the implant surgeon must be well acquainted with various surgical techniques and approaches for successfully managing peri-implant soft tissues in commonly encountered clinical situations. Furthermore, when an inadequate quantity or quality of soft tissue is available to secure a stable peri-implant environment, the implant surgeon must know the principles and techniques to successfully reconstruct these components. This chapter focuses on basic principles and surgical techniques to manage and, when indicated, reconstruct peri-implant soft tissues to enhance the long-term predictability and aesthetic outcomes achieved in implant therapy.

# 14.2 Flap Management Considerations

# 14.2.1 Introduction

The primary goal of implant soft tissue management is to establish a healthy peri-implant soft tissue environment. This goal is accomplished by obtaining circumferential adaptation of attached tissues around the transmucosal implant structures, thereby providing the connective tissue and epithelium needed for the formation of a protective soft tissue seal [1]. In addition, when implant therapy is performed in aesthetic areas, recreating natural-appearing soft tissue architecture and topography at the prosthetic recipient site is often necessary. To achieve these goals, the surgeon must carefully

preserve and manipulate existing soft tissues at the implant site and perform soft tissue augmentation, when indicated. The quantity, quality, and positioning of the existing attached tissues relative to the planned implant emergence should be evaluated before implant surgery. The flap should be designed to ensure that an adequate band of attached, good-quality tissue is always available lingual or palatal to the planned implant emergence. Designing the flap in this fashion is practical because subsequent correction of soft tissue problems occurring in lingual and palatal areas is difficult. Preoperative evaluation using a surgical template helps the surgeon visualize whether adequate tissue quality and volume are available in the area critical for prosthetic emergence. The surgeon can then decide where the incisions will have to be made or how the existing soft tissues must be manipulated with specific surgical maneuvers to establish a stable peri-implant soft tissue environment in each individual case.

# 14.2.2 Design for Submerged Implant Placement

When placing a submerged implant, the buccal flap must be designed to preserve both the blood supply to the implant site and the topography of the alveolar ridge and mucobuccal fold. The access flap is outlined by a pericrestal incision and one or more linear or curvilinear vertical releasing incisions that extend onto the buccal aspect of the alveolar ridge. The pericrestal incision is beveled to the lingual or palatal aspects (Fig. 14.1). The incision is initiated over the lingual or palatal aspects of the ridge crest, and the scalpel blade is angled

![](images/3ec5acde25e2d4e4e87546405ebd9ad9a144e3c9cd84439be74a653767e9e817.jpg)

The blue arrows represent the buccal beveled incisions recommended for abutment connection and nonsubmerged implant placement in the maxilla and mandible. (Adapted from Sclar [2])

to make contact with the underlying bone. Typically, linear vertical releasing incisions are used in edentulous situations, and curvilinear beveled incisions are used in partially edentulous situations. In either case, reflection of the buccal flap exposes the entire ridge crest and provides ample access for implant instrumentation. This is accomplished with minimal lingual or palatal flap elevation, thus preserving periosteal circulation and providing attached tissue to anchor the buccal flap during subsequent wound closure. The stability of the postoperative wound complex is improved, and the topography of the alveolar ridge and mucobuccal fold is preserved. As a result, wound dehiscence is decreased, and the use of a provisional prosthesis during the osseointegration period is facilitated.

# 14.2.3 Design for Abutment Connection and Nonsubmerged Implant Placement

Except for the location and bevel of the pericrestal incisions, the same flap design is used for an abutment connection to submerged implants as for placement of nonsubmerged implants (see Fig. 14.1). The pericrestal incision is initiated in a position that ensures the maintenance of approximately a  $3\mathrm{-mm}$  apicocoronal dimension of attached lingual tissue or good-quality palatal mucosa (free of rugae) for readaptation around the emerging implant structures. The quantity and position of the existing soft tissues guide the location of the incision. In general, this incision is located closer to the midcrestal position than the one made for submerged implant placement. The scalpel blade is held so as to create a buccal bevel to facilitate abutment connection and implant placement while preserving periosteal blood supply by minimizing the need for a lingual or palatal flap reflection. In addition, the buccal bevel maximizes the amount of attached tissue reflected with the buccal flap (see Fig. 14.1).

As suggested previously, by adjusting the location and bevel of pericrestal incisions and precisely locating linear or curvilinear vertical releasing incisions, the implant surgeon is equipped with practical flap designs for submerged implant placement, abutment connection, and nonsubmerged implant placement in edentulous and partially edentulous and aesthetic case types (Figs. 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, and 14.6).

Fig. 14.6 The flap design for aesthetic implant therapy is outlined by pericrestal and curvilinear beveled releasing incisions. The vertical legs of the releasing incisions are made in the adjacent interdental areas, thereby providing the opportunity to camouflage within interdental grooves and the mucogingival junction. This flap design incorporates greater amounts of mucosal tissues, improving the overall elasticity of the flap. When combined with tension-releasing cutback incisions, coronal advancement is facilitated without an embarrassment of circulation to the flap margin. The flap design is exaggerated by moving the releasing incisions farther away from the site when reconstruction of large-volume aesthetic ridge defects is necessary or for implant placement at sites where vestibular depth is inadequate.

# 14.2.4Surgical Maneuvers for Management of Peri-implant Soft Tissues

Once the flap has been outlined in a manner that ensures an optimal lingual and palatal soft tissue environment, the surgical maneuvers that are used for managing the resulting buccal flap during abutment connection and nonsubmerged implant placement can be determined, for the most part, by the apicocoronal dimension of the attached tissue remaining on the buccal flap margin. Three distinct soft tissue surgical maneuvers are commonly used during abutment connection or nonsubmerged implant placement to achieve the desired outcome of obtaining primary closure with circumferential adaptation of attached tissues around emerging implant structures: resective contouring, papilla regeneration, and lateral flap advancement.

Although the minimum width of attached tissue necessary to establish a stable peri-implant soft tissue environment has yet to be established, the following guidelines for using each of the soft tissue maneuvers provide con

sistent results in most clinical situations. It is important to note that the use of a specific maneuver is based primarily on the apicocoronal dimension of the attached tissue remaining along the buccal flap margin at each implant site. A combination of these surgical maneuvers is often indicated because the width of attached tissue remaining on the buccal flap varies as a result of necessary adjustments made in the path of the crestal incision to maintain an adequate width of attached tissue on the lingual or palatal flap.

# 14.2.4.1Resective Contouring

When the width of the gingival tissues remaining on the buccal flap is  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$ , resective contouring facilitates circumferential adaptation of the soft tissues around the emerging implant structures. A fine scalpel blade held in a round handle is used to perform a gingivectomy on the buccal flap corresponding in shape and position to the anteriormost abutment or nonsubmerged implant neck. After resective contouring, the tissue is adapted around the emerging implant structure; this process is then repeated sequentially around each implant (Fig. 14.7). The contoured flap is then repositioned apically and secured around the abutments with a suture passing through each interimplant area; additional sutures are placed to close the curvilinear releasing incisions.

# 14.2.4.2Papilla Regeneration

When the width of the gingival tissues remaining on the buccal flap is  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$ , use of the papilla regeneration maneuver is indicated. Advocated by Palacci and colleagues [3], this maneuver facilitates primary closure and circumferential adaptation around the transmucosal implant structures while preserving an adequate band of attached tissue around the emerging implant structures. In addition, attached mucosa is taken from the top of the ridge and moved in a buccal direction, while approximately  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of attached lingual or palatal tissues is preserved. A fine scalpel is subsequently used to sharply dissect the tissues to create pedicles in the buccal flap, which are passively rotated to fill the interimplant spaces (Fig. 14.8). Passive adaptation of the pedicles in the interimplant space may require reverse cutback incisions made away from the base of the pedicle. The tissues are sutured, avoiding tension within the pedicles, usually using a figure-of-eight horizontal mattress suture. Alternatively, a simple interrupted suture passed through the buccal flap in a fashion that passively advances the pedicle into the interimplant space is effective in many situations. Care must be taken to avoid placement of the suture through the pedicle because this would reduce circulation to the pedicle. Another varia

Fig. 14.7 Resective contouring maneuver. When the apicocoronal dimension of the attached tissue remaining on the buccal flap used for the abutment connection or a nonsubmerged implant placement is between 5 and  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , resective contouring is used to facilitate circumferential adaptation of the soft tissues around the emerging implant structures.

(Adapted from Sclar [2])

tion of this technique uses pedicles created in the palatal flap, which can also be rotated to fill the interimplant spaces, and is especially useful in maxillary situations where thick palatal tissues exist [2].

# 14.2.4.3Lateral Flap Advancement

When the width of the gingival tissues remaining on the buccal flap is  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$ , the use of the lateral flap advancement maneuver facilitates primary closure and circumferential adaptation of attached tissues around the emerging implant structures (Fig. 14.9) [2]. This maneuver is especially suited for completely edentulous

![](images/80955ff7920b52420f3289efb5747b66c4e1048382ac612b61a08061d56c3cfa.jpg)

When the apico-coronal dimension of the attached tissue remaining on the buccal flap used for an abutment connection or a nonsubmerged implant placement is between 3 and  $4\mathrm{mm}$ , lateral flap advancement is used to facilitate circumferential adaptation of the soft tissues around the emerging implant structures. (Adapted from Sclar [2])

or posterior partially edentulous implant case types, in which an adequate band of attached tissue exists adjacent to the implant site. Attached tissues available from adjacent areas are simply repositioned to obtain primary closure with attached tissues around the emerging implant structures.

This maneuver requires that the flap be designed to extend beyond the area of implant placement to include the attached tissues present in adjacent edentulous areas. As the closure progresses, the flap advances, resulting in primary closure around the implants and the creation of a denuded area that will heal by secondary intention at the distal extent of the dissection. This surgical maneuver is useful in edentulous situations and in Kennedy classes I and II partially edentulous situations.

# 14.3 Rationale for Soft Tissue Grafting with Implants

The rationale for soft tissue augmentation around dental implants is related to the need for soft tissue around natural dentition. In general, experienced clinicians agree that an adequate zone of attached tissue around a natural tooth or implant prosthesis is desirable to better withstand the functional stresses resulting from mastication and oral hygiene. Moreover, a certain amount of attached tissue is needed to withstand the potential mechanical and bacterial challenges presented by aesthetic restorations that extend below the free gingival margin. Potential mechanical challenges include tooth preparation, soft tissue retraction, impression procedures, cementation of provisional and permanent restorations, removal of implant healing abutments,

replacement of healing abutments with permanent abutments, taking of implant-level impressions, and placement of provisional and permanent implant restorations.

After the final restoration, the intracrevicular aesthetic restorative margins may continue to present a permanent inflammatory challenge to the surrounding soft tissue attachment apparatus. Some implant practitioners believe that the microgap at the site of the abutment connection to two-piece implants may present a similar challenge. Whether these challenges result in an initial apical displacement of the marginal tissues or possibly even progressive loss of attachment depends on multiple factors, including the following [2]:

# Variable factors influencing the implant soft tissue

Age of the patient  
General health of the patient  
- Host resistance factors  
Effects of systemic medications  
Periodontal phenotype  
Technique and effectiveness of oral hygiene  
Frequency and technique of professional oral hygiene care  
Operative technique  
Choice of restorative materials  
- Initial location of restorative margin vis-à-vis circumferential biologic width requirements  
- Prominence of the implant position in the alveolus  
Preexisting bony dehiscence  
Design and surface characteristics of the implant  
Depth of implant placement  
Thickness and apicocoronal dimension of the attached tissue

Because multiple factors influence the health of the marginal tissues, prospective or retrospective experimental or clinical studies are difficult to design and conduct, much less interpret. Certainly, studies that primarily consider the apicocoronal dimension of attached tissue and its effect on marginal soft tissue health, without considering the other factors, are inconclusive at best. Therefore, the rationale for soft tissue augmentation around natural dentition or a dental implant prosthesis should be based on clinical experience rather than on results from experimental or clinical studies [2].

# 14.4 Clinical Guidelines for Soft Tissue Augmentation

When the apicocoronal dimension of attached tissue remaining on the buccal flap will be less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , the surgeon should consider soft tissue augmentation. Other factors to consider include tissue thickness, tissue qual

ity, the presence of soft tissue inflammation or pathology, the type of implant restoration planned, and the aesthetic importance of the site. In a nonaesthetic area, the surgeon can use the various surgical maneuvers described previously to obtain primary closure and then reevaluate the need for soft tissue grafting based on the health and volume of peri-implant attached tissues obtained after initial healing. In contrast, when the total width of attached tissue present is less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  in an aesthetic area, soft tissue augmentation is indicated before implant placement. In most instances, this can be accomplished with an epithelialized palatal mucosal graft, which quickly provides an improvement in the quality of the soft tissues.

Similarly, in aesthetic areas, small-volume soft tissue aesthetic ridge defects can be corrected simultaneously with submerged or nonsubmerged implant placement with subepithelial connective tissue grafting, whereas large-volume soft tissue aesthetic ridge defects are most predictably reconstructed before implant placement with a series of subepithelial connective tissue grafts. Large-volume soft tissue defects can also be corrected with the use of a vascularized interpositional periosteal connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap, which, in ideal circumstances, allows for predictable reconstruction synchronous with implant placement.

# 14.5 Principles of Oral Soft Tissue Grafting

The first principle of oral soft tissue grafting is that the recipient site must provide for graft vascularization. It is understood that free grafts initially survive by plasmatic diffusion and are subsequently vascularized as capillaries and arterioles form a vascular network providing the permanent circulation for the graft. When a recipient site is partially avascular (e.g., a denuded root surface, an exposed implant abutment, or an area recently reconstructed with a block bone graft), the dissection should be extended to provide a peripheral source of circulation to support the free graft over the avascular or poorly vascularized areas. Although pedicle grafts and flaps maintain their blood supply, it is also good surgical practice to prepare a recipient site that can contribute circulation to ensure optimal results in the event of a reduction of circulation to a portion (most commonly, the margin) of the pedicle graft or flap.

The second principle of oral soft tissue grafting is that the recipient site must provide a means for rigid immobilization of the graft tissue. Initial graft survival requires that the graft be immobilized and intimately adapted to the recipient site. Mobility of the graft dur

ing initial healing can interfere with its early nourishment through plasmatic diffusion or can disrupt the newly forming circulatory supply to the graft, resulting in excessive shrinkage or sloughing of the graft.

The third principle is that adequate hemostasis must be obtained at the recipient site. Active hemorrhage at the site prevents the intimate adaptation of the graft to the recipient site. Hemorrhage also interferes with the maintenance of the thin layer of fibrin between the graft and the recipient site, which serves to physically attach the graft to the recipient site and provides for the plasmatic diffusion that initially nourishes the graft before its vascularization. Preparation of a recipient site with a uniform surface enhances the intimate adaptation with the graft. The periosteum is generally considered to be an excellent recipient site for oral soft tissue grafts because it fulfills all of the requirements discussed previously. In addition, decorticated alveolar bone can support and nourish a free soft tissue graft, although immobilizing the graft at the site is more troublesome.

The fourth principle of oral soft tissue grafting involves the size and thickness of the donor tissue. The donor tissue must be large enough to facilitate immobilization at the recipient site and to take advantage of peripheral circulation when root or abutment coverage is the goal. The graft also must be large enough and thick enough to achieve the desired volume augmentation after secondary contraction has occurred. In addition, the donor tissue should be harvested to ensure a uniform graft surface that facilitates intimate adaptation to the recipient site. Thicker grafts  $(>1.25\mathrm{mm})$  are especially useful for root and abutment coverage when graft healing over the central portion of the avascular surface is characterized by necrosis. The necrotic graft is gradually overtaken by granulation tissue from the periphery and ultimately forms a scar. Thicker grafts are better able to maintain their physical integrity during this process, which can take as long as 4-6 weeks. In summary, harvesting a graft that is too small or too thin should be avoided by evaluating the donor site before surgery and by applying the foregoing principles during recipient- and donor-site surgery.

Although failure to adhere to these surgical principles may not result in the loss of the soft tissue graft, increased complications such as inadequate volume yield, graft sloughing, wound breakdown, infection, and patient discomfort can be expected.

Successful principles of oral soft tissue grafting

1. Vascularity  
2. Rigid immobilization  
3. Hemostasis  
4. Adequate donor size

# 14.6 Epithelialized Palatal Graft Technique for Dental Implants

# 14.6.1 General Considerations

The use of an epithelialized palatal graft for the treatment of a mucogingival defect has enjoyed a long history of predictable success [4-6]. This versatile technique can be used not only to increase the dimensions of attached tissue around the natural dentition and dental implants but also as a predictable method for covering denuded root or abutment surfaces. Although the term free gingival graft is a misnomer, it is commonly used to describe the transfer of epithelialized tissue harvested from the palate. When the contemporary surgical technique is used as described later, thick split-thickness grafts  $(>1.25\mathrm{mm})$  or full-thickness grafts are preferred around both natural dentition and dental implants.

# 14.6.2 Contemporary Surgical Technique

# Key Point

Gingival grafting is indicated before implant placement in the severely atrophic maxilla or mandible that is less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in height and has less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of attached tissue.

The surgical technique for gingival grafting around dental implants is essentially the same as the technique used around natural dentition [2, 4-7]. When gingival grafting is performed after implant abutment connection or delivery of the final restoration, a horizontal incision is made through the interimplant papilla coronal to the desired final tissue position. This facilitates abutment coverage with the gingival graft. When gingival grafting is performed at second-stage surgery or simultaneously with nonsubmerged implant placement, the horizontal incision is made at the mucogingival junction, and any existing gingival tissues are repositioned to the lingual or palatal aspect of the implants (Fig. 14.10a). This step is extremely important when implants are placed in the mandible because subsequent lingual soft tissue defects in this area are difficult to correct. A split-thickness dissection is then carried apically to create a uniform periosteal site. In the edentulous mandible, care must be taken to avoid damage to the mental nerve with the vertical releasing incisions that typically outline the mesial and distal extents of the recipient site in the dentate patient. Instead, in these instances, a midline verti

cal releasing incision and sharp dissection are used to create an adequate recipient site ( $>5$  mm apicocoronal dimension) with a half-moon shape, as shown in Fig. 14.10b. Subsequently, the mucosal flaps are excised, and residual elastic or muscular tissue is removed with tissue scissors or nippers. When working in a severely atrophic mandible, the mucosal flaps are preserved and sutured to the periosteum at the base of the dissection. The technique for graft immobilization is the same regardless of whether gingival grafting is

performed around natural dentition, at second-stage surgery for submerged implants, or at the time of non-submerged implant placement. The graft is sutured to each papilla or interimplant area coronally and then to the periosteum peripherally to rigidly immobilize the graft at the recipient site (Figs. 14.11 and 14.12; see also Fig. 14.10c). The following graft immobilization pressure is applied with a moistened saline gauze for  $10\mathrm{min}$ . Although a periodontal dressing is not necessary for the recipient site, a protective dressing for the donor site is recommended.

Gingival grafting is indicated before implant placement in the severely atrophic maxilla or mandible that is less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in height and has less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of attached tissue. In this clinical situation, the surgeon should avoid significant dissection of the palatal or lingual tissues. Instead, a large recipient bed is created on

the buccal aspect of the site, extending far enough apically from the midcrest to re-create the buccal vestibular fold. The graft is then harvested and rigidly immobilized with sutures placed approximately  $5\mathrm{mm}$  apart to avoid unnecessary trauma and hematoma formation at the periphery. During subsequent implant surgery, a  $3\mathrm{-mm}$  or greater portion of the mature grafted tissue is repositioned lingually, providing good-quality gingival tissue for wound closure over submerged implants and circumferential adaptation of attached tissue around emerging implant abutments or nonsubmerged implants.

# 14.7 Subepithelial Connective Tissue Grafting for Dental Implants

# 14.7.1 General Considerations

The subepithelial connective tissue graft is an extremely versatile procedure that can be used to enhance soft tissue contours around the natural dentition and dental implants (Figs. 14.13, 14.14, and 14.15). The procedure combines the use of a free soft tissue autograft harvested from the palate that is interposed beneath a partial-thickness pedicle flap at the recipient site (i.e., open approach). Alternatively, the graft can be secured in a split-thickness pouch prepared at the recipient site (i.e., closed approach). The graft is harvested internally from the palate, resulting in a partial-thickness donor-site pouch that allows for primary closure and, thus, a more comfortable palatal wound. Because the graft is positioned between the periosteum and a partial-thickness cover flap or pouch at the recipient site, it

enjoys the advantage of a dual blood supply to support graft revascularization. Because of the abundant blood supply available for healing, the connective tissue graft is less technique-sensitive, easier to perform, and more predictable than the gingival graft. The connective tissue graft also results in superior color matching and aesthetic blending at the recipient site. The subepithelial connective tissue graft can be used during initial implant-site development before implant placement or simultaneous with submerged implant placement for the correction of small-volume soft tissue aesthetic ridge defects. Similarly, the connective tissue graft can be performed simultaneously with an abutment connection or nonsubmerged implant placement to reconstruct these small-volume soft tissue defects or for the correction of soft tissue recession defects that develop in the recall period. Finally, whenever a large-volume soft tissue aesthetic ridge defect is present, a series of connective tissue grafts is usually required for reconstruction of these aesthetic ridge defects before implant placement [2].

# 14.7.2 Surgical Technique: Donor-Site Surgery

The technique for harvesting subepithelial connective tissue grafts from the premolar region of the palate has two variations: the single-incision approach and the dualincision approach [7, 8]. In either case, the donor-site surgery begins with a full-thickness curvilinear incision made through the palatal tissues approximately  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the gingival margin of the premolars (Fig. 14.16a). This incision can be made perpendicular to the surface of the palatal tissue, or it can be slightly beveled. When it is made perpendicular to the palatal tissues, the thickness of the coronal portion of the graft is maximized; however, this usually prevents passive primary closure. In contrast, beveling the first incision limits the thickness of the coronal portion of the graft but, in many cases, enables a passive primary closure.

When using the dual-incision approach, a partial-thickness curvilinear incision is made approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the first incision to complete an ellipse (see Fig. 14.16b). This incision defines the thickness of the subepithelial connective tissue graft to be harvested. The incision should be approximately  $1\mathrm{mm}$  deep to ensure adequate thickness of the remaining cover tissue and to minimize the incidence of sloughing at the donor site. The scalpel is then oriented parallel to the surface of the palatal tissue, and sharp dissection is used to create a rectangular pouch. The apical extent of the dissection is determined by the height of the palate. The mesiodistal extent of the dissection is determined by the length of the first and second incisions, which, in turn, are determined by the overall size of the palate and the width of the premolars. The scalpel blade is then used to complete the outline of the donor connective tissue graft with incisions that pass through the underlying connec

tive tissue and periosteum just short of the mesial and distal extent of the pocket. Unnecessary trauma to the overlying palatal tissues is thus avoided when the scalpel is turned perpendicular to the surface of the donor tissue. A Buser periosteal elevator and membraneplacement instrument are then used to carefully begin subperiosteal elevation of donor tissue at the coronal aspect of the dissection. Once the coronal aspect of the graft has been elevated, it is carefully supported with tissue forceps, and the subperiosteal elevation is extended to the apical portion of the pouch. Next, gentle traction is placed on the elevated tissue with forceps, and a horizontal incision is made through the apical aspect of the donor tissue from within the pouch. The harvested tissue, which contains the epithelium, connective tissue, and periosteum, is then transferred with tissue forceps to the recipient site or temporarily placed on sterile gauze moistened with saline. If the graft is submerged under the recipient's site flap, curved Iris tissue scissors should be used to remove the epithelial tissue. Hemostasis is then obtained at the donor site by placing an absorbable collagen dressing, such as CollaPlug, and applying pressure with saline-moistened gauze. The donor site is closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic gut sutures on a P3 needle passed through the interproximal areas.

The single-incision technique differs in that only one incision is used to establish access to both the subperiosteal and the subepithelial planes of dissection. This approach begins with a full-thickness curvilinear incision, as described previously. Next, the scalpel is reoriented within the incision until it is parallel to the surface of the palatal tissue. Subepithelial dissection that paral

lems the external surface of the palatal tissue is accomplished to create a rectangular pouch. After making the first incision, the surgeon may find it useful to perform subperiosteal elevation coronally. This improves visualization of available soft tissue thickness (Fig. 14.17),

thereby aiding the surgeon in establishing the appropriate subepithelial plane of dissection. The remainder of the surgical procedure is identical to the procedure described previously for the dual-incision technique.

The advantage of the dual-incision approach is that it is easier to perform. Because the thickness of the donor tissue is defined by the second incision, the result is the harvesting of a graft of uniform thickness. The disadvantage of this approach is that primary closure is seldom possible, and therefore, the palatal wound can be uncomfortable. Nevertheless, this approach is usually recommended for the novice surgeon. Although harvesting a donor graft of uniform thickness is technically more challenging when the single-incision approach is used, primary closure of the palatal wound results in greater patient comfort. As a result, most experienced surgeons prefer this approach.

# 14.7.3Surgical Technique: Recipient-Site Surgery

Preparation of the recipient site involves either the elevation of a split-thickness flap through supraperiosteal dissection (open technique) or a supraperiosteal dissection, which avoids vertical releasing incisions to create an envelope or pouch (closed technique). The decision of which technique to use when grafting around a natural tooth or an implant restoration depends on several factors. The open technique allows direct visualization during dissection, which ensures the preparation of a uniform recipient site. This approach also allows for significant coronal advancement when vertical soft tissue

augmentation is needed over an exposed root or abutment surface. The vertical releasing incisions used in the open technique sacrifice some circulation. However, the use of a curvilinear beveled flap with tension-releasing cutback incisions avoids embarrassment of circulation to the flap margin and allows for greater coronal flap advancement than do traditional trapezoidal flaps that require periosteal releasing incisions to allow even limited coronal advancement.

In contrast, the closed technique avoids the need for vertical incisions, thus preserving the blood supply to the site and optimizing aesthetic results. However, as a "blind" technique, it can be technically more demanding. Also, because it does not allow for significant coronal advancement of the cover flap, this technique is of limited use when significant vertical soft tissue augmentation is needed, and it is contraindicated whenever vestibular depth limits the preparation of an adequately sized recipient site. In general, the closed recipient site is preferred when the abutment or root exposure is less than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  apicocoronally or when there is a significant risk of sloughing of the cover flap because of poor vascularity at the site.

# 14.7.3.1 Closed Technique

The technique for closed recipient-site preparation is the same whether it is performed around a natural tooth or an implant restoration. A horizontal incision is extended to the mesial and distal aspects of the soft tissue defect just coronal to the level of the root or abutment coverage desired (Fig. 14.18). Using a no. 15C scalpel, the surgeon makes this incision at a right angle to the epithelium at a depth of approximately  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . The horizon

tion. a Split-thickness dissection (shaded area). b Graft mobilization apically and coronally. (a, b Adapted from Sclar [2])

tal incisions not only mark the graft's final coronal position but also facilitate the pouch dissection and subsequent immobilization of the graft.

Next, the scalpel is oriented parallel to the tissue surface, and the horizontal incisions are extended into the sulcus to create the entrance to the recipient site. The split-thickness dissection is extended apically beyond the mucogingival junction at the mesial and distal aspects of the site before crossing the midline. To ensure that the recipient site can contribute adequate peripheral blood supply to sustain the graft, the dissection must extend well beyond the width of the soft tissue defect being corrected. As a general rule, the width of the recipient site should be three times that of the exposed root or abutment, which can be accomplished by extending the defect mesially and distally. The surgeon must take care to avoid perforating or tearing the overlying tissues with the scalpel; a meticulous technique is required to ensure a uniform recipient-site surface.

The blunt end of a membrane-placement instrument is then used to probe the resultant pouch and confirm that the dissection is complete. Occasionally, strands or webs of tissue extending from the overlying tissues to the periosteum are detected in the apical extent of the dissection. If not released with sharp dissection, these tissue strands prevent proper positioning and passive adaptation of the connective tissue graft within the pouch. A periodontal probe is then used to measure the dimensions of the recipient pouch and to guide the surgeon in the donor harvest, and pressure is applied with saline-moistened gauze to obtain hemostasis.

Once the recipient site has been prepared and the donor tissue has been harvested, the donor tissue should be intimately adapted and rigidly immobilized at the recipient site. When a closed recipient site is used, the dimensions of the donor connective tissue should closely match those of the recipient-site pouch. Curved Iris tissue scissors are used to size the graft before securing it in the pouch. The graft should always be oriented so that the periosteal side faces down at the recipient site. A 4-0 chromic suture on a P3 or FS2 needle is used to place a horizontal mattress suture that enters the apical portion of the recipient pouch, engages the graft, and exits the pouch apically. This suture is used to gently "pull" the graft into the recipient pouch and secure the graft apically, thereby resisting subsequent coronal displacement. First, the suture needle is passed through the vestibular mucosa into the recipient pouch and retrieved with forceps. The suture needle is then passed through the connective tissue side of the graft and back through the periosteal side of the graft. Next, the membraneplacement instrument is used to identify the apical extent of the recipient site, and the suture needle is passed back through the mucosal tissue to exit the pouch

several millimeters lateral of where it entered. A fine hemostat is clamped across equal lengths ( $\sim 7.5$  cm) of the suture material, and suture scissors are used to cut away the remaining suture and needle.

Subsequently, the surgeon uses the clamped suture material to slowly pull the graft into the recipient pouch, taking care not to tear the overlying tissue. The paddle end of the membrane-placement instrument is used like a shoehorn to guide the graft into the entrance of the recipient pouch. The flat portion of the instrument is moistened with saline and placed between the graft and the overlying tissue as the graft is gently pulled into the pouch. This technique prevents bunching of the graft at the entrance of the recipient pouch as well as excessive stretching of, and damage to, the overlying tissues. The spiked end of the membrane-placement instrument is then used to gently "push" the graft further into the pouch entrance, while the clamped suture material is used to "pull" the graft apically. A triple tie secures the graft in the pouch.

The graft is secured coronally, either with interrupted sutures that pass through the graft and interproximal tissues (see Fig. 14.18) or with a sling suture. Interrupted sutures in the papillary area are then used to secure the cover tissue pouch. Additional sutures can be carefully placed to approximate the coronal margins of the pouch in an effort to cover more of the exposed graft. Nevertheless, because significant coronal advancement of the overlying tissues is not possible, a portion of the graft will remain uncovered. Whenever possible, it is recommended that two thirds or more of the graft be secured within the recipient-site pouch. Gentle pressure is applied over the graft site with saline-moistened gauze for a minimum of  $10\mathrm{min}$ .

# 14.7.3.2 Open Technique

Again, the technique for open recipient-site preparation is the essentially the same whether it is performed around a natural tooth or an implant restoration or to improve soft tissue contours during implant-site development. This approach is useful for a moderate amount of vertical soft tissue augmentation, making it applicable for abutment coverage procedures and for improving soft tissue contours during implant-site development or when performed over a submerged implant (Fig. 14.19). The dissection begins by outlining the recipient site with partial-thickness horizontal and vertical incisions using a no. 15C scalpel blade on a round handle. The horizontal incision, which is performed first, extends mesial and distal to the soft tissue defect at a level just coronal to the final soft tissue position desired after augmentation. Exaggerated curvilinear beveled incisions with tension-releasing cutback incisions are then initiated apically well beyond the mucogingival junction to outline the cover flap. Next, sharp

dissection is used to elevate a split-thickness flap. The dissection is initiated coronally with a no. 15C scalpel blade. Flap elevation is continued apically under direct vision with sharp dissection under tension, which is carefully maintained with the use of micro-Adson tissue forceps. The goal is to maximize the thickness of the overlying tissue flap, leaving only a thin layer of immobile periosteum. When coronal advancement of the cover flap is performed, the adjacent papillary areas are

deep epithelialized with a fresh no. 15C scalpel. This further extends the wound margin, thereby reducing flap retraction and greatly enhancing incision line aesthetics. It also eliminates the possibility that the undersurface of the coronally advanced flap will be coapted over an epithelial surface, which would prevent initial wound healing and could result in dehiscence along the incision. The dimensions of the recipient site are then measured with a periodontal probe, and hemostasis is

obtained by applying gentle pressure with saline-moistened gauze.

Once the donor graft has been harvested, it is usually trimmed to be slightly smaller than the open recipient site. This facilitates immobilization of the graft and suturing of the cover flap into position without unwanted engagement of the underlying graft, which can cause graft dislodgment secondary to swelling or retraction of the cover flap. Whether grafting around natural dentition or an implant restoration(s), the graft is first secured coronally with sutures passed through the adjacent papillary areas using a 4-0 chromic gut suture on a P3 needle. Alternatively, sling sutures can be used for this purpose. Next, the graft is secured laterally and apically to the periosteum with additional sutures. The goal is to gently stretch the tissue, thus improving its adaptation to the recipient site.

Next, the cover flap is secured coronally with interrupted sutures passing through the papillae. These sutures should pass through the facial flap and the deepithelialized papillary tissue and then return under the contact points, where they are tied facially. Alternatively, a sling suture can be used. In this case, the suture passes through the flap and the papillary tissue on the first pass; it then passes under the contact points as it returns to the facial aspect, where it is tied. Depending on the thickness of the cover flap tissue, 4-0 or 5-0 chromic gut suture on a P3 needle is used. Next, the cover flap is secured laterally. The use of exaggerated curvilinear beveled incisions to outline the cover flap not only extends the recipient site, providing additional circulation to sustain the graft, but also facilitates immobilization of the graft and closure of the cover flap.

The suture needle should be perpendicular to the beveled incision as it passes through the tissue. It also should be oriented in an apicocoronal direction as it is passed through the flap and adjacent tissue. A single pass is recommended to ensure precise positioning of the cover flap. The attached tissue contained in the flap is first precisely repositioned and secured with sutures placed laterally. The sutures then are placed apical to the mucogingival junction. When performed as part of implant-site development or when grafting over a submerged implant, the recipient site is extended further onto the palatal or lingual surface of the alveolar ridge via split-thickness dissection, and the graft is secured in a similar fashion before closing the cover flaps, as described previously. Moistened saline gauze is used to apply gentle pressure at the site for  $10\mathrm{min}$ ; a periodontal dressing is not usually needed.

# 14.8 Vascularized Interpositional Periosteal Connective Tissue Flap

# 14.8.1 General Considerations

The VIP-CT flap is an innovative technique that provides for reconstruction of large-volume soft tissue aesthetic ridge defects with a single procedure [2]. In addition, the pedicled blood supply derived from the connective tissue-periosteal plexus within the flap provides the biologic basis for predictable simultaneous hard and soft tissue grafting procedures during aesthetic implant-site development, even at compromised sites. Additional advantages of the technique include negligible postoperative soft tissue shrinkage; enhanced results realized from hard tissue grafting procedures owing to the supplemental source of circulation and the contribution to phase 2 bone graft healing provided by the mesenchymal cells transferred with the flap; and, when hard and soft tissue site-development procedures are necessary, reduced treatment time and patient inconvenience.

Although the amount of horizontal soft tissue augmentation obtained with the VIP-CT flap is consistently greater than that obtained with free soft tissue grafting techniques, the amount of vertical soft tissue augmentation typically obtained exceeds that obtainable even when several free soft tissue grafts are performed, which has allowed the re-creation of positive gingival architecture, even in situations in which previous hard and soft tissue site-development techniques have fallen short. This technique has also proved useful in the treatment of compromised sites in which existing soft tissues were poor in quality and severely scarred, rendering them inadequate to support required hard tissue implant-site development (Fig. 14.20). It is a predictable means of resubmerging an implant in the anterior area when an unexpected soft tissue dehiscence compromises the final aesthetic result.

The volume of tissue transfer routinely obtained with the VIP-CT flap has also allowed the camouflaging of small-volume combination hard and soft tissue ridge defects as well as the correction of large-volume soft tissue defects simultaneously with implant placement (Figs. 14.21 and 14.22), as previously discussed.

Of greatest significance, this technique provides the implant surgeon with a proven technique for predictable simultaneous hard and soft tissue aesthetic implant-site development at compromised anterior sites with large-volume combination aesthetic ridge defects (Fig. 14.23). These enhanced results are directly

# 14.8.2Surgical Technique

As in the previously described techniques, the surgeon begins by outlining and preparing the recipient site and then proceeds to donor-site preparation. An exaggerated curvilinear beveled flap design is used at the recipient site.

sion at the distal aspect of the recipient site parallels the gingival margin on the oral aspect of the adjacent tooth (Fig. 14.24a).

After recipient-site preparation, donor-site preparation begins by extending this incision horizontally to the distal aspect of the second premolar. To facilitate subsequent closure of the donor site, the orientation of this incision should be slightly beveled and follow a path approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the free gingival margins of the canine and premolar teeth (see  $\square$  Fig. 14.24a). Sharp dissection is then used internally to create a split-thickness palatal flap in the premolar area. The subepithelial dissection is carried mesially toward the distal aspect of the canine. The surgeon should be careful to maintain an adequate thickness of the palatal cover flap

to avoid sloughing. In most cases, the dissection has to be deeper in the area of the palatal rugae to avoid perforating the cover flap. Next, a vertical incision is made internally through the connective tissue and periosteum at the distal extent of the subepithelial dissection, as far apically as is possible without damaging the greater palatine neurovascular structures. This incision defines the margin of the flap. Using a Buser periosteal elevator and a membrane-placement instrument, the surgeon then carefully elevates the resultant periosteal-connective tissue layer, beginning in the second premolar area and working toward the anterior extent of the dissection. Usually, this careful subperiosteal dissection yields intact periosteum on the undersurface of the pedicle, which aids in subsequent rigid immobilization of the graft. Furthermore, intact periosteum potentially provides osteoblastic activity if applied over a bone graft when simultaneous hard and soft tissue site development is performed. A second incision is then initiated under tension internally at the apical extent of the previous vertical incision and extended horizontally anterior to the distal aspect of the canine. The outline of the periosteal-connective tissue pedicle is now complete. Limiting the incisions to the anatomic landmarks given ensures that the margin of the pedicle is safely harvested from the palatal area, where the thickest amount of connective tissue is available, without risk of damage to adjacent neurovascular structures. Next, a Buser periosteal elevator is used to carefully elevate the periostealconnective tissue pedicle and undermine the full thickness of the palatal mucosa and periosteum at the base of the pedicle, just beyond the midline of the palate (see Fig. 14.24b). This subperiosteal elevation or undermining begins at the distal aspect of the dissection

sequently, the VIP-CT flap is developed via subepithelial and subperiosteal dissections performed within the bicuspid region of the palate. c Subperiosteal undermining is extended to the midline, allowing the flap to passively rotate to the midline, where it is secured to the deepithelialized areas and periosteum at a split-thickness recipient site or over a block bone graft when simultaneous reconstruction is performed. (a-c Adapted from Sclar [2])

in the area of the second premolar and is carried anteriorly toward, but short of, the incisive foramen so as to avoid compromise to the neurovascular structures in this area. Doing so provides additional elasticity at the base of the pedicle to allow passive rotation to the recipient site without the need for a tension-releasing cutback incision. Essentially, the two distinct planes of dissection performed define the interpositional periostealconnective tissue pedicle flap without disrupting its circulation. The subepithelial plane is superficial to the greater palatine vessels but deep enough to avoid sloughing of the palatal cover flap. The subperiosteal plane is deep to the greater palatine vessels and is limited anteriorly and posteriorly to avoid damage to the neurovascular structures as they course through the palate.

Tension-releasing cutback incisions extended into the base of the pedicle flap are rarely necessary when subperiosteal undermining is performed. When unavoidable, these relaxing incisions are initiated at the pivot point of flap rotation along the line of greatest tension. Although the line of greatest tension is the radius of the rotation arc created by the apical horizontal incision, the pivot point may not coincide with the termination of that incision. This is because the periosteal undermining causes a favorable displacement of the flap's pivot point and, in most cases, allows for tension-free rotation of the flap into the maxillary anterior area without the need for a tension-releasing cutback incision. Nevertheless, when a tension-releasing cutback incision is necessary despite undermining, the surgeon must be careful to limit the length of the incision to avoid embarrassing the circulation. An intraoperative assessment of the area of greatest tension will guide the placement of releasing incisions. Next, the flap is rotated into the

recipient site and rigidly immobilized with sutures placed apically and/or laterally (see  $\square$  Fig. 14.24c). Alternatively, the flap can be secured directly to a block bone graft using sutures passed through transosseous perforations in the bone graft. An absorbable collagen dressing, such as CollaPlug, is used as an aid to hemostasis and to eliminate dead space in the donor harvest area. Finally, the donor and recipient sites are closed primarily with absorbable sutures, and gentle pressure is applied with saline-moistened gauze for  $10\mathrm{min}$

# 14.9 Oral Soft Tissue Grafting with Acellular Dermal Matrix

# 14.9.1 General Considerations

Acellular dermal matrix (AlloDerm) has been used as an alternative to harvesting autogenous epithelialized palatal grafts and subepithelial connective tissue grafts in periodontal surgery since 1996. AlloDerm grafts are composed of freeze-dried allograft skin processed to remove all immunogenic cellular components (epidermis and dermal cells), leaving a useful acellular dermal matrix for soft tissue augmentation. AlloDerm can be used to increase the width of attached tissue around the natural dentition and implants, obtain root or abutment coverage, and correct small-volume soft tissue ridge defects. The advantages of using AlloDerm include the elimination of donor-site surgery for greater patient comfort, unlimited tissue supply, excellent handling characteristics, and decreased surgical time. Disadvantages include greater secondary shrinkage and

slower healing at the recipient sites when used as an onlay graft or when complete coverage of an interpositional AlloDerm graft is not obtainable. Predictable root or abutment coverage requires coverage of the AlloDerm graft with good-quality cover flap tissue.

# 14.9.2Surgical Technique

The surgical technique for using AlloDerm is essentially the same as that described previously for the gingival and subepithelial connective tissue grafts. The AlloDerm graft must be rehydrated for  $10\mathrm{min}$  before use. Two distinct sides of the AlloDerm graft are identified by applying the patient's blood to each surface and rinsing with sterile saline. The connective tissue side will retain the red coloration, whereas the basement membrane side will appear white. The connective tissue side contains preexisting vascular channels that allow for cellular infiltration and revascularization. When used as an onlay graft to increase the width of attached tissues, the connective tissue side should be oriented toward and intimately adapted to the recipient site (Fig. 14.25). When used for root or abutment coverage, the basement membrane side of the graft should be oriented toward the exposed root or abutment (Fig. 14.26). The basement membrane side of the AlloDerm graft facilitates epithelial cell migration and attachment. Wherever possible, the author recommends preparing a larger recipient site  $(6 - 8\mathrm{mm}$  apicocoronal dimension) and immobilizing a larger AlloDerm graft than what is used when an autogenous gingival graft is performed. This offsets the additional shrinkage observed with AlloDerm onlay grafts.

Improvement has been observed in the rate of incorporation of AlloDerm onlay and interpositional grafts when platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is incorporated into the surgical protocol [2]. In these instances, the AlloDerm graft is first rehydrated in nonactivated anticoagulated PRP solution before its immobilization at the recipient site. Subsequently, activated PRP is used topically at the recipient site as a growth factor-enriched wound dressing. Whenever PRP is used with AlloDerm or autogenous soft tissue grafts, care must be taken to avoid the formation of a PRP blood clot between the soft tissue graft and the periosteal recipient site or the cover flap [2].

# Conclusion

This chapter provides the implant surgeon with the basic information necessary for the successful management of peri-implant soft tissues in the most common clinical scenarios. In addition, it presents principles of oral soft tissue grafting and surgical details of the most commonly used oral soft tissue grafting techniques. However, because limited information concerning the indications, advantages, and expected outcomes of the individual surgical approaches and techniques has been presented, further study by the reader is encouraged.

recession treated with AlloDerm grafts. b The postoperative view demonstrates successful root coverage at sites amenable to such a result and an increased width of attached tissue at those sites not amenable to complete root coverage
