# 40.1 Introduction

The incidence, severity, morbidity, and mortality of odontogenic infections have declined dramatically over the past 60 years. In 1940 Ashbel Williams published a series of 37 cases of Ludwig's angina in which  $54\%$  of the subjects died [1]. Only 3 years later, he and the late Dr. Walter Guralnick published the first prospective case series in the field of head and neck infections, in which the mortality rate of Ludwig's angina was reduced to  $10\%$  [2]. This dramatic reduction in mortality from  $54\%$  to  $10\%$  was not due to the first use of penicillin in the treatment of these infections. Rather, Dr. Guralnick applied the principles of the initial establishment of airway security, followed by early and aggressive surgical drainage of all anatomic spaces affected by cellulitis or abscess. Since then, with the use of antibiotics and advanced medical supportive care, the mortality of Ludwig's angina has been further reduced to  $4\%$  [3].

These accomplishments impose upon oral and maxillofacial surgeons the obligation to remain intellectually prepared for the always unscheduled occurrence of severe odontogenic infections by keeping fresh one's knowledge of the relevant anatomy and surgery, and by remaining abreast of current developments in the microbiology and antibiotic therapy of odontogenic infections.

# 40.2 Principles of Surgical Management of Odontogenic Infections

The late Dr. Larry Peterson, who brought the first edition of this text to fruition, articulated the principles of management of odontogenic deep fascial space infections. These are eight sequential steps that, if followed with thoroughness and good judgment, will ensure a high level of care for these increasingly uncommon, yet occasionally life-threatening infections.

These principles outline the structure of this chapter. The eight steps in the management of odontogenic infections are as follows:

1. Determine the severity of infection.  
2. Evaluate host defenses.  
3. Decide on the setting of care.  
4. Treat surgically.  
5. Support medically.  
6. Choose and prescribe antibiotic therapy.  
7. Administer the antibiotic properly.  
8. Evaluate the patient frequently.

# 40.3 Principles of Modern Antibiotic Therapy

In recent years, evidence-based principles of the use of antibiotics have been formulated [4]. These principles guide the practice of steps 6 and 7 of the surgical management of odontogenic infections. This chapter discusses some of the available evidence for the principles of the modern therapeutic use of antibiotics in odontogenic infections. The principles of prophylactic antibiotic therapy (principles 9 and 10 below) are beyond the scope of this chapter, and are discussed elsewhere [5].

The principles of modern antibiotic therapy are:

1. Surgery to remove the cause and establish drainage is primary; antibiotics are adjunctive treatment.  
2. Use therapeutic antibiotics only when clinically indicated.  
3. Use specific antibiotic therapy as soon as possible, based on culture and sensitivity testing.  
4. Use the narrowest spectrum empiric antibiotic effective against the most likely pathogens.  
5. Avoid the use of combination antibiotics, except in specific situations where they are shown to be necessary.  
6. Use the least toxic indicated antibiotic, considering interaction with concurrent medications.  
7. Minimize the duration of antibiotic therapy, as appropriate to the presenting type of infection.  
8. Use the most cost-effective appropriate antibiotic.  
9. Use prophylactic antibiotics only where proved effective or according to professional guidelines.  
10. Follow the guidance of evidence-based recommendations and professional guidelines when they are available.

This chapter examines the Principles of Surgical Management of Odontogenic Infections and the first eight Principles of Modern Antibiotic Therapy in order and discusses and relates current knowledge to them.

# 40.4 Step 1: Determine the Severity of Infection

# Key Points

The severity of an infection is determined primarily by where it is and how quickly it is spreading  
Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency.

Within the first few minutes of the presentation of a patient with a significant odontogenic infection, the surgeon should have accomplished the first three steps listed above. A careful history and a brief but thorough physical examination should allow the treating surgeon to determine the anatomic location, rate of progression, and the potential for airway compromise of a given infection. The host defenses, including immune system competence and the level of systemic reserves that can be called upon by the patient to maintain homeostasis, are largely determined by history. Given this initial database, the surgeon must then decide upon the setting of care, which will have a great influence on the outcome.

The clinical presentation and relevant surgical anatomy of infections of the various deep fascial spaces of the head and neck have been well described in other texts [6, 7]. The borders, contents, and relations of the various anatomic deep spaces that are likely to be invaded by odontogenic infections are described in Tables 40.1 and 40.2.

Three major factors must be considered in determining the severity of an infection of the head and neck: anatomic location, rate of progression, and airway compromise.

# 40.4.1 Anatomic Location

The anatomic spaces of the head and neck can be graded in severity by the level to which they threaten the airway or vital structures, such as the heart and mediastinum or the central nervous system. The buccal, infraorbital vestibular, and subperiosteal spaces can be categorized as having low severity because infections in these spaces do not threaten the airway or vital structures. Infections of anatomic spaces that can hinder access to the airway due to swelling or trismus can be classified as having moderate severity. Such anatomic spaces include the masticator space, whose components may be considered separately as the submasseteric, pterygomandibular, and superficial and deep temporal spaces, and the perimandibular spaces (submandibular, submental, and sublingual). Infections that have high severity are those in which swelling can directly obstruct or deviate the airway or threaten vital structures. These anatomic spaces are the lateral pharyngeal and retropharyngeal, the dan

ger space, and the mediastinum. Cavernous sinus thrombosis and other intracranial infections also have high severity. Table 40.3 lists the severity level of each of the various deep fascial spaces.

# 40.4.2 Rate of Progression

Upon interviewing the patient with an infection, the surgeon can appraise the rate of progression by inquiring about the onset of swelling and pain and comparing those times to the current signs and symptoms of swelling, pain, trismus, and airway compromise. In a study of 37 severe hospitalized odontogenic infections, Flynn and colleagues found trismus in  $73\%$  and dysphagia in  $78\%$  of patients with severe odontogenic infection at presentation [8].

Odontogenic infections generally pass through three stages before they resolve, the characteristics of which are listed in Table 40.4. During the first 3 days the swelling is soft, mildly tender, and doughy in consistency. Between days 2 and 5 the swelling becomes hard, red, and exquisitely tender. Its borders are diffuse and spreading. Between the fifth and seventh days, the center of the cellulitis begins to soften and the underlying abscess undermines the skin or mucosa, making it compressible and shiny. The yellow color of the underlying pus may be seen through the thin epithelial layers. At this stage the term fluctuance is appropriately applied. Fluctuance implies the bimanual palpation of a fluid wave by one hand as the abscess is compressed by the other hand. The final stage of odontogenic infection is resolution, which generally occurs after spontaneous or surgical drainage of an abscess cavity. The swelling then begins to decrease in size, redness, and tenderness. The resolving swelling may stay firm for some time, however, as the inflammatory process is involved in removing necrotic tissue and bacterial debris.

A special note should be made of an especially rapidly progressive infection called necrotizing fasciitis. Occasionally found in the head and neck, frequently due to odontogenic sources, necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading infection that follows the platysma muscle down the neck and onto the anterior chest wall. Diabetes and alcoholism have been shown to be significant predisposing factors, whereas medical compromise, delay in surgery, and mediastinitis are associated with increased mortality [9]. It can rapidly result in necrosis of large amounts of muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and skin, resulting in severe reconstructive defects (  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Fig. 40.1). Similar processes may be involved in descending necrotizing infections of the neck, which frequently progress to the mediastinum. The earliest signs of necrotizing fasciitis are small vesicles and a dusky purple discoloration of the involved skin (  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Fig. 40.2). Soon thereafter

the skin may become anesthetic. Thereafter frank necrosis occurs [10].

A suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics, repeated surgical drainage, antiseptic wound packing, and intensive medical supportive care, including fluids, calcium, and possibly blood transfusion [10]. Repeated surgical debridement is the rule, not the exception. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also be of benefit [11].

In addition to sending specimens of pus and necrotic tissue for culture and sensitivity, the surgeon should send a specimen of nearby fascia for histopathologic examination. If the causative bacteria are group A beta-

hemolytic streptococci (the streptococcal subtype), they may be elaborating an exotoxin (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, speB) that inhibits chemotaxis of white blood cells to the site of infection. Microscopically, masses of streptococci would be seen without a surrounding inflammatory cell infiltrate [12].

# 40.4.3 Airway Compromise

The most frequent cause of death in reported cases of odontogenic infection is airway obstruction. Therefore, the surgeon must assess current or impending airway

obstruction within the first few moments of evaluating the patient with a head and neck infection.

Complete airway obstruction is, of course, a surgical emergency. In such cases insufficient or absent air movement in spite of inspiratory efforts will be apparent. In highly skilled hands, one brief attempt at endotracheal intubation may be made, but a direct surgical approach

to the airway by cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy is more predictably successful. In such extreme circumstances the presence of infection overlying the trachea is less important than the absence of ventilation. Therefore, infection in the region of surgical airway access is not a contraindication to an emergency cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy.

In partial airway obstruction, abnormal breath sounds will be evident, consisting of stridor or coarse airway sounds suggestive of fluid in the upper airways. The patient may assume a special posture that straightens the airway, such as the "sniffing position," in which the head is inclined forward and the chin is elevated, as if one were sniffing a rose. Other such postures include a sitting patient with the hands or elbows on the knees and the chest inclined forward with the head thrust anterior to the shoulders (tripod position), which also straightens the airway and pulls the tongue forward and

allows secretions to drool outward onto the floor or into a pan. Occasionally a patient with a lateral pharyngeal space infection will incline the neck toward the opposite shoulder in order to position the upper airway over the laterally deviated trachea (  $\square$  Fig. 40.3).

Trismus is an ominous sign in the patient suspected of odontogenic infection. A maximum interincisal opening that has decreased to  $20\mathrm{mm}$  or less in a patient with acute pain should be considered an infection of the masticator space until proved otherwise. Infections of the pterygomandibular space are sometimes missed

because trismus hinders the examiner's view of the oropharynx. Therefore, it is important for the examiner to position the patient's occlusal plane parallel to the plane of vision and to orient a light coaxial to that plane of view. Then the patient is asked to maximally open the mouth in spite of pain, and the tongue is depressed with a mirror or tongue blade. This should allow the examiner to get at least a glimpse of the position of the uvula and the condition of the anterior tonsillar pillars. The affected tonsillar pillar will usually be edematous and reddened, and it will displace the uvula to the opposite side (Fig. 40.4). If the suspected site of infection is touched with the mirror or tongue blade, acute pain may be elicited, especially as compared to the opposite side. The patient's report of pain should be distinguished from the gagging that is likely to occur.

Various clinical tests have been proposed with the aim of predicting difficult intubation. The Mallampati test has been correlated with difficult intubation by its initial proponent, as have trismus of less than  $20\mathrm{mm}$  and decreased thyromental distance [13, 14]. These results, however, have not been confirmed by independent examiners, although the combination of an abnormal Mallampati test and a thyromental distance of less than  $5\mathrm{cm}$  has been correlated with difficult intubation in one study [14].

In airway obstruction, the respiratory rate may be increased or decreased; yet one functional method of assessing the effectiveness of respiratory efforts readily available to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon is the pulse oximeter [15].

An oxygen saturation of below  $94\%$  in an otherwise healthy patient is indeed an ominous sign, because it indicates insufficient oxygenation of the tissues due to hypoperfusion or hypooxygenation. Given the patient with clinically apparent partial airway obstruction, an abnormally low oxygen saturation is an indication for immediate establishment of a secure airway.

Soft tissue radiographs of the cervical airway and chest can be quite valuable in identifying deviation of the airway laterally on a posteroanterior film or anterior displacement of the airway on a lateral view. These films can be taken fairly quickly, which can be an advantage for radiographic examination of the patient with a significant cervical swelling. During prolonged periods in the supine position, as required by the older generation of computed tomography (CT) scanners, an infected swelling may obstruct the airway. On the other hand, the newer high-speed CT scanners can obtain a computerized CT examination within seconds to minutes, which, if available, would make conventional soft tissue radiographs obsolete (Fig. 40.5). In a prospective study Miller and colleagues found  $89\%$  accuracy,  $95\%$  sensitivity, and  $80\%$  specificity in identifying "drainable pus" by the combined use of contrast enhanced CT and clinical examination [16]. By "drainable pus," the authors meant a collection of  $2\mathrm{mL}$  or more of pus. The high diagnostic

yield therefore of contrast-enhanced CT and clinical examination makes this combination the method of choice for evaluation of potential airway obstruction, as well as characterizing the location and quality of infections in the head and neck [16].

# 40.5 Step 2: Evaluate Host Defenses

# Key Points

- Host defenses are determined primarily by the health of the immune system and the systemic reserve of the patient  
The level of diabetes control is the most common factor affecting the host's ability to combat infection  
Cardiac and respiratory health are the most important determinants of systemic reserve

# 40.5.1 Immune System Compromise

Box 40.1 lists the medical conditions that can interfere with proper function of the immune system, which is, of course, essential to the maintenance of host defense against infection. Diabetes is listed first because it is the most common immune-compromising disease. Diabetics have the combination of a white blood cell migration defect, which inhibits successful chemotaxis of white blood cells to the infected site from the blood stream, and a vascular defect that impairs blood flow to small vessel tissue beds, especially in end organs such as the foot. Orally, diabetics have an increased susceptibility to periodontal infections. This disease also appears to decrease host resistance to more severe odontogenic infections such as necrotizing faciitis and deep fascial space infections [17].

The iatrogenic use of steroids has increased over recent years with the use of these medications to treat asthma, skin conditions, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other inflammatory conditions. Corticosteroids appear to stabilize the cell membranes of immunocompetent cells, thereby decreasing the immune response. Patients with organ transplants are often treated with corticosteroids, as well as other immunosuppressive medications such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, to suppress organ rejection reactions.

It has been postulated that every patient with malignant disease has some defect of the immune system. The mechanisms of immune compromise in malignancy are variable and not well identified, but the surgeon treating the patient with ongoing cancer should assume that there is some defect of the immune system. Cancer chemotherapy directly suppresses the immune system along

with rapidly dividing cancer cells. Therefore, all patients who have received cancer chemotherapy within the past year should be considered immunocompromised.

Other conditions that impair immune function include malnutrition, alcoholism, and chronic renal disease. The role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in diminishing host resistance to odontogenic infections is somewhat unclear and paradoxical. HIV infection first and primarily damages the T cell. On the other hand, most odontogenic infections are due to extracellular bacteria, which are attacked by B cells, the white blood cells that elaborate antibodies. Although HIV infection may damage B cells early in the course of the disease, its most devastating effects are seen on the T cells, which explains the increased rate of cancers and infections by intracellular pathogens in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and pre-AIDS. Although patients with HIV seropositivity may suffer a more intense and/or prolonged hospital course than other patients, HIV seropositivity does not seem to increase the incidence of severe odontogenic infections [18].  $\square$  Figure 40.6 illustrates the postoperative condition of a man with previously untreated HIV infection complicated by necrotizing fasciitis and osteomyelitis of the mandible.

# 40.5.2 Systemic Reserve

The host response to severe infection can place a damaging physiologic load on the body. Fever can increase sensible and insensible fluid losses and caloric requirements. A prolonged fever may cause dehydration, which can therefore decrease cardiovascular reserves and deplete glycogen stores, shifting the body metabolism to a catabolic state. The surgeon should also be aware that elderly individuals are not able to mount high fevers, as often seen in children. Therefore, an elevated temperature at an advanced age is not only a sign of a particularly severe infection, but also an omen of decreased cardiovascular and metabolic reserve, due to the demands placed on the elderly patient's physiology [19].

In a prospective study of 37 consecutive patients admitted to the hospital with severe odontogenic infection, the statistically significant predictors of the length of stay, based on multivariate analysis, were indicators of the severity of infection, such as number of infected anatomic spaces, time in the operating room, and complications, such as therapeutic antibioitc failure, and the need for reoperation [20]. In other studies, number of involved spaces [21], diabetes [21], neck swelling, C-reactive protein  $>100$ , and trismus also have been associated with an increased hospital stay [22].

of hospital stay than other sources of head and infection in one study [21]. Therefore, evaluation of the anatomic extent and source of the infection, medical compromise, and C-reactive protein are important in determining the severity of infection as well as in estimating the length of hospital stay.

Interestingly, multiple studies have confirmed in various ways that dental treatment prior to hospital admission, such as endodontic therapy, tooth extraction, or intraoral incision and drainage shorten the length of subsequent hospital stay and the cost of care [23-25], and even decrease C-reactive protein prior to admission [26]. The outdated statement that dental treatment may worsen the spread of odontogenic infections has thus been disproved.

The physiologic stress of a serious infection can disrupt previously well-established control of systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and renal disease. The increased cardiac and respiratory demands of a severe infection may deplete scarce physiologic reserves in the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or atherosclerotic heart disease, for example. Thus, an otherwise mild or moderate infection may be a significant threat to the patient with systemic disease, and the surgeon should be careful to evaluate and manage concurrent systemic diseases in conjunction with direct management of the infection.

# 40.6 Step 3: Decide on the Setting of Care

# Key Points

Hospital admission is the safest location for treatment of severe odontogenic infections, due to the availability of constant monitoring, airway management, advanced radiologic studies, and general anesthesia

Box 40.2 lists the indications for hospital admission of the patient with a severe odontogenic infection. As previously stated, an elevated fever increases metabolic needs and fluid losses, which can lead to dehydration. In addition to the clinical signs of dry skin, chapped lips, loss of skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes, dehydration can be assessed in the presence of normal serum creatinine by an elevated urine specific gravity (over 1.030) or an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) with a normal serum creatinine, which indicates prerenal azotemia.

Infections in anatomic spaces that have a moderate or high severity (see Table 40.3) can hinder access to the airway for intubation by causing trismus, directly

compress or deviate the airway by swelling, or threaten vital structures directly. Thus, an odontogenic infection involving the masticator space, the perimandibular spaces, or the deep neck spaces indicates hospital admission.

Occasionally, general anesthesia is required for patient management due to inability to achieve adequate local anesthesia, the need to secure the airway, or the inability of the patient to cooperate, as in a young child. Sometimes concurrent systemic disease indicates hospital admission and may even delay surgery, as in the need to reverse warfarin anticoagulation.

In deciding whether to admit the patient with a serious odontogenic infection, it is generally safer to err on the side of hospital admission. The inpatient setting affords the patient with continual professional monitoring, supportive medical care, the availability of radiologic and medical consultative services, and, most importantly, a team that can rapidly secure the airway should it become compromised.

Recently, Christensen et al. [27] found in a prospective study that blunting of the inferior border of the mandible by infectious swelling and trismus with an interincisal opening of less than  $25\mathrm{mm}$  were strongly associated with the need for CT imaging for the evaluation of odontogenic infection. Painful swallowing (odynophagia) and induration of the mouth floor were also predictive of the need for CT. These findings may guide surgeons and emergency physicians on whether CT examination is necessary as part of the evaluation for hospital admission. Further, use of the anatomic criteria in Table 40.3 for moderate or severe infections can eliminate unnecessary ordering of CT examinations and thus reduce the costs of care [28].

# Key Points

Surgical therapy begins with airway security

- Removal of the source of infection and the establishment of dependent drainage are the key steps in infection surgery  
Culture and sensitivity testing by sampling of the infected tissues enables the selection of an antibiotic regimen specific to the given case

# 40.7.1 Airway Security

The dramatic reduction in the mortality of Ludwig's angina from  $54\%$  to  $10\%$  in only 3 years, afforded by Williams and Guralnick, was made possible by their changed surgical policy of immediate establishment of airway security by intubation or tracheotomy, followed by aggressive and early surgical intervention [2]. No antibiotics were used in their patients, except sulfa drugs in some cases. In the antibiotic era, mortality has been further reduced to about  $4\%$  [3]. It is therefore apparent that immediate establishment of airway security and early aggressive surgical therapy are the most important intervention steps in the management of severe odontogenic infections.

Box 40.3 lists the indications for an operating room procedure. The paramount indication is of course to establish airway security. The involvement of moderate or high severity anatomic spaces generally necessitates a definitive airway management procedure, as well as surgical intervention in anatomic locations that are not amenable to profound local anesthesia. An infection that is rapidly progressing through the anatomic fascial planes, as in necrotizing fasciitis, indicates the prompt establishment of a secure airway, even if for anticipatory reasons, as well as the possible need to extend the anatomic dissection into regions that had not been contemplated preoperatively. Sometimes general anesthesia is required for patient management reasons alone, especially in the patient who is not able to cooperate, such as a young child or mentally handicapped individual.

Successful airway management in difficult situations requires a team approach. Preoperatively the surgeon should communicate with the anesthesiologist to establish the airway management plan. The anesthesiologist should be interested in understanding the anatomic location of the infection, as well as its implications for airway management. The anesthesiologist will value the opportunity to see any effacement, displacement, or deviation of the airway as demonstrated on clinical examination and CT. The airway management plan should include the projected initial management, as well as secondary procedures should the initial approach fail.

An infrequently used surgical technique that may aid in protecting the airway during intubation or tracheotomy is needle decompression. In this technique, under local anesthesia an abscess of the pterygomandibular, lateral pha

ryngeal, submandibular, or sublingual space is aspirated with a large-bore needle in order to decompress the surrounding tissues. This maneuver may decrease the risk of abscess rupture through taut, distended oropharyngeal tissues during instrumentation of the airway. Additional benefits of this procedure are the redirection of pus drainage into the oral cavity or onto the skin, where it can easily be removed, and obtaining an excellent specimen for culture and sensitivity testing.

# 40.7.2 Surgical Drainage

In general, surgery for management of severe odontogenic infections is not difficult. Given a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the deep fascial spaces of the head and neck, the surgeon should be able, by using appropriate anatomic landmarks, to use small incisions and blunt dissection without direct exposure and visualization of the entire infected anatomic space.

Figure 40.7 illustrates the appropriate locations for extraoral incision placement for drainage of the various anatomic deep spaces. In addition, an intraoral vertical incision over the pterygomandibular raphe can be used to drain the pterygomandibular space as well as the anterior compartment of the lateral pharyngeal space, as illustrated in Fig. 40.8. Lest the surgeon crush a vital structure within the beaks of a hemostat during blunt dissection, it is crucial to insert the instrument closed, then open it at the depth of penetration, and then withdraw the instrument in the open position. A hemostat should never be blindly closed while it is inside a surgical wound.

Another important principle of surgical incision and drainage is the need to dissect a pathway for the drain that includes the locations where pus is most likely to be found. This can be guided by the preoperative CT examination and by knowledge of the pathways that odontogenic infection is most likely to take. For example, in drainage of the submandibular space, if incisions are placed over the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle at the submandibular, submental, and sublingual location and at the submandibular, sublingual location as shown in Fig. 40.7, then the dissection must pass superiorly and medially until the medial (lingual) plate of the mandible is contacted. The most likely pathway for odontogenic infections to enter the

![](images/09b31fc8748137bedd0d09678ab822022c2c4709ee800bcbd95940fe2011c756.jpg)  
Fig. 40.7 Incision placement for extraoral drainage of head and neck infections. Incisions at the following points may be used to drain infections in the indicated spaces: superficial and deep temporal, submasseteric; submandibular, submental, sublingual; submandibular, sublingual, pterygomandibular, submasseteric; lateral pharyngeal, retropharyngeal; lateral pharyngeal, retropharyngeal, carotid sheath.

Fig. 40.8 Intraoral incision placement for drainage of the anterior compartment of the lateral pharyngeal space (curved arrow) and the pterygomandibular space (straight arrow). (Adapted from Flynn [57])

submandibular space is through the thin lingual plate of the mandible, which also approximates the root apices of the lower molar teeth. By exploring this location, the surgeon may find a collection of pus that would otherwise have been missed. In order to pass a drain through the submandibular space effectively, the surgeon should therefore pass a large curved hemostat from one incision upward to the medial side of the mandible and then down to the other incision. A Penrose drain can then be grasped in the tip of the hemostat and pulled through the dissected pathway from one incision to the other, thus draining the entire submandibular space. The resulting pathway for a through-and-through drain in the submandibular space is illustrated in Fig. 40.9.

The advantages of through-and-through drainage are the provision of two pathways for the egress of pus, placement of the incisions in healthy tissue in cosmetically acceptable areas, and the ability to irrigate the infected wound with unidirectional flow from one incision to the other. Wound irrigation is facilitated especially by the use of a Jackson Pratt-type drain, which is noncollapsible and perforated. Such unidirectional superior-to-inferior drainage of the pterygomandibular space using intraoral and extraoral incisions and a Jackson Pratt drain is illustrated in Fig. 40.10. Recent evidence, however, does not support increased effectiveness of irrigating drains [29].

Nonetheless, it does make clinical sense to remove by irrigation bacteria, pus, clots, and necrotic tissue from infected wounds as they accumulate. Similarly the use of bulky occlusive dressings has not been shown to substantially alter the outcome of cases of odontogenic infection. However, the use of such a dressing, as illustrated in Fig. 40.11, may be more comfortable over the long run than a dressing that is taped to the skin, and it certainly helps to prevent the contamination of the hospital by pathogenic organisms. The need for this type

of hygiene is bound to increase in coming years, as both antibiotic-resistant organisms and critically ill, sometimes immunocompromised patients increasingly inhabit hospitals.

Drains should be discontinued when the drainage ceases. They may be advanced gradually or removed all at once. There is no evidence in favor of either technique. Pus usually stops flowing from surgically drained abscesses in  $24 - 72\mathrm{h}$ , but this process may take somewhat longer when only cellulitis has been encountered. It should be kept in mind, however, that latex Penrose drains can be antigenic, and after several days they may cause exudation due to foreign body reaction alone.

# 40.7.3 Timing of Incision and Drainage

Much of the surgical literature on the management of deep fascial space infections of the head and neck advocates an expectant approach to surgical drainage of deep neck infections. The overall strategy of this approach is to use parenteral antibiotic therapy as a means of controlling, localizing, or even eradicating the soft tissue infection. Failure of the medical approach is determined by patient deterioration, impending airway compromise, and the identification of an abscess by CT or clinical examination or both. Only then is surgical drainage undertaken [30-32]. The expectant approach to management of severe odontogenic infections has not been supported by empiric investigation.

The alternative strategy, successfully demonstrated by Williams and Guralnick, is the immediate establishment of airway security as necessary, and aggressive early surgical intervention [2]. Identification of an abscess is not required before surgical intervention. The approach by Williams and Guralnick is predicated on the concept that early incision and drainage aborts the spread of infection into deeper and more critical anatomic spaces, even when it is in the cellulitis stage. In a prospective case series of 37 patients hospitalized with severe odontogenic infections, Flynn and colleagues performed surgical drainage on all patients as soon as possible after admission [8]. In none of their cases did incision and drainage seem to hasten the spread of infection. The need for reoperation and length of hospital stay was not significantly different between those patients in whom abscess and those in whom cellulitis was found [8]. On multivariate analysis, when all potentially confounding variables were controlled for, the only significant predictor of abscess formation was the negatively associated identification of peptostreptococci in culture. Thus, peptostrepto

cocci were associated with cellulitis significantly more than abscess [20].

# 40.7.4 Culture and Sensitivity Testing

Infections that present in the low severity anatomic spaces (see Table 40.3) are not in an anatomic position that is likely to threaten the airway or vital structures. In the absence of immunologic or systemic compromise, such infections are very unlikely to become serious or life-threatening. Straightforward treatments, such as removal of the involved teeth, intraoral incision and drainage, and empiric antibiotic therapy, are almost always successful. In this setting it can be hard to justify the increased cost of routine culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Furthermore, since most odontogenic pathogens are slow-growing species, identification can become an expensive and time-consuming task for the microbiology laboratory. This expense is hard to justify, given the fact that at least until recently, the oral flora is routinely sensitive to the penicillins. Therefore, most microbiology laboratories, when given a specimen that grows out  $\alpha$ -hemolytic streptococci mixed with short, anaerobic, weakly gram-negative rods, will report the growth of normal oral flora, thus avoiding the necessity for species identification and subsequent antibiotic sensitivity testing. For these reasons routine culture and sensitivity testing for minor oral infections does not appear to be justified.

When an infection involves anatomic spaces of moderate or greater severity, or when there is significant medical or immune system compromise, culture and sensitivity testing as early as possible in the course of infection is important because the final result of antibiotic sensitivity testing can be delayed for as much as 2 weeks when fastidious or antibiotic-resistant organisms are involved.

Culture and sensitivity testing is also justified when the surgeon is dealing with infections that have been subjected to multiple prior courses of antibiotic therapy or in chronic infections that are recalcitrant to therapy. Immunocompromised patients also tend to harbor unusual pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae in diabetes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in intravenous-drug abusers, and intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria in HIV/AIDS. In summary, culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in unusual infections, the medically and immune compromised, and certainly in all cases severe enough to require hospitalization.

Proper culture technique involves the harvesting of the specimen in a manner that minimizes contamination by normal oral or skin flora. Ideally the skin or mucosa should be prepared with antiseptic and isolated, and the

culture should be obtained by aspiration from the point of maximum inflammation, where abscess is most likely to be found. If this is not possible, then at surgery a swab and culturette system can be used, although the surgeon must be careful to avoid contamination of the specimen by saliva or skin flora.

Furthermore, the culture transport system should be designed to maintain the viability of anaerobic organisms, which do not survive in commonly available aerobic culturetette systems. Requests for anaerobic cultures of specimens from aerobic culturetettes will be rejected by most microbiology laboratories. Therefore, the surgeon should keep on hand a small supply of culture swabs that are specifically designed to preserve viable anaerobic bacteria for transport to the microbiology laboratory. It is important to check the expiration date of such transport media, since anaerobic culturetettes usually have a short shelf life.

Even though the surgeon may not encounter pus during aspiration attempts or surgical drainage, fluid aspirates and swab cultures of infected sites do yield valid cultures with readily interpretable results. Therefore, specimens should be sent for culture and sensitivity testing even when pus is not obtained.

In the future, molecular methods using probes for the DNA of the common pathogens of odontogenic infection will likely become clinically available, allowing identification of the causative pathogens within 1 day, early risk stratification, and guidance of antibiotic selection [33, 34].

# 40.8 Step 5: Support Medically

# Key Points

Medical supportive care includes control of any pre-existing systemic disease and maintenance of hydration and nutrition  
Age is a significant factor in the host response to the physiologic stress of infection and surgery

Medical supportive care for the patient with a severe odontogenic infection is composed of hydration, nutrition, and control of fever in all patients. Maintenance or reestablishment of electrolyte balance and the control of systemic diseases may also be a crucial part of the necessary supportive medical care for some cases, and the reader is referred to appropriate texts for a more comprehensive discussion of these matters.

Decreased prealbumin levels, indicating acute malnutrition, has been correlated with an increased length of hospital stay in severe odontogenic infections. Prealbumin levels can therefore be used in evaluating a patient's systemic reserve at the time of admission, and

can also indicate the need for aggressive nutritional support in a given case [35].

Initial temperature has been shown to be a significant predictor of the length of hospital stay with severe odontogenic infections [36]. Fever below  $103^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ $(39.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  is probably beneficial. Mild temperature elevations promote phagocytosis, increase blood flow to the affected area, raise the metabolic rate, and enhance antibody function. Above  $103^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ , however, fever can become destructive by increasing metabolic and cardiovascular demands beyond physiologic reserve capacity. Energy stores can be rapidly depleted and the loss of fluid is significantly increased.

Adequate hydration is perhaps the best method for controlling fever. Daily sensible fluid loss, consisting primarily of sweat, is increased by  $250~\mathrm{mL}$  per degree of fever. Insensible fluid loss, consisting mainly of evaporation from lungs and skin, is increased by 50 to  $75~\mathrm{mL}$  per degree of fever per day. Therefore, a  $70~\mathrm{kg}$  patient with a fever of  $102.2^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  would have a daily fluid requirement of about  $3100~\mathrm{mL}$ . This would translate to a required intravenous infusion rate of approximately  $130~\mathrm{mL}$  per hour, assuming no oral intake and no other extraordinary fluid losses [37].

The next approach to controlling fever is usually taken by the administration of acetaminophen or aspirin. Fevers are often exaggerated in children and decreased in the elderly. Thus, an older patient with a relatively mild elevation of temperature may have a fairly significant infection. At the same time the surgeon may wish to control fever in the elderly at a lower temperature level than in the younger patient because of a fever's increased cardiovascular and metabolic demands [37]. Fever can be controlled or reduced by a variety of other methods when necessary. These include cool water or alcohol sponge baths, chilled drinks when practical, or even an immersion bath using tepid water.

Fever also increases metabolic demand by  $5 - 8\%$  per degree of fever per day [37]. Therefore, it may be necessary to supplement the infected patient's oral intake, which is likely to be significantly inhibited by the local effects of the infection and surgery, by using supplementary feedings or even enteral nutrition via a feeding tube.

# 40.9 Step 6: Choose and Prescribe Antibiotic Therapy

The first eight principles of modern antibiotic therapy are included in Step 6, because they govern the choice of antibiotic. Those eight principles are repeated here:

1. Surgery to remove the cause and establish drainage is primary; antibiotics are adjunctive treatment.

2. Use therapeutic antibiotics only when clinically indicated.  
3. Use specific antibiotic therapy as soon as possible, based on culture and sensitivity testing.  
4. Use the narrowest spectrum empiric antibiotic effective against the most likely pathogens.  
5. Avoid the use of combination antibiotics, except in specific situations where they are shown to be necessary.  
6. Use the least toxic indicated antibiotic, considering interaction with concurrent medications.  
7. Minimize the duration of antibiotic therapy, as appropriate to the presenting type of infection.  
8. Use the most cost-effective appropriate antibiotic.

# 40.9.1 Surgery to Remove the Cause and Establish Drainage is Primary; Antibiotics are Adjunctive Treatment

Beginning in 1943, with the seminal work of Williams and Guralnick [2], the scientific evidence has mounted that in odontogenic infections the most important treatment is the surgical therapy, ranging from incision and drainage to timely removal of the causative tooth, to endodontic therapy for restorable teeth, when appropriate. As discussed above, several recent studies have shown that the length of hospital stay is shorter when some type of surgical therapy has been rendered prior to hospital admission [23-26]. Igoumenakis et al. [24] compared two groups hospitalized with severe odontogenic infections, one with tooth extraction performed just prior to admission and the other without. Improvement occurred more rapidly and hospital stay was significantly shorter in the extraction group.

Matijevic et al. compared subjects with odontogenic infection treated with amoxicillin, cephalexin, and no antibiotic. All of the subjects received appropriate surgical treatment, consisting of incision and drainage, tooth extraction, or root canal therapy, as appropriate. Although the time to resolution was slightly longer in the non-antibiotic group, there were no statistically significant differences among the three groups. All three groups had met the resolution point by 1 week after intervention. This study indicates, therefore, that time to resolution of odontogenic infection in the antibiotic groups was not significantly shorter than in the control (surgery alone) group [38].

Current and long-standing evidence clearly indicates that in odontogenic infections the most important therapeutic step is surgical control of the source of the infection. Antibiotics are adjunctive treatment.

# 40.9.2 Use Therapeutic Antibiotics Only When Clinically Indicated

Much has been written in recent years about the unnecessary use of antibiotics as a cause of increased antibiotic resistance among the human pathogenic flora. Significant evidence is now available that antibiotic resistance is increasing among the oral pathogenic flora as well, and antibiotic prescribing practices for dental infections likely play a role. The presence of one or more penicillin-resistant organisms in culture specimens from odontogenic infections has increased from  $33\%$  in 1991 [39] to  $63\%$  in 2017 [40]. Clindamycin resistance increased from  $13.7\%$  in 2006 [41] to  $32\%$  in 2017 [40].

The indications for therapeutic antibiotics for odontogenic infection are listed in Box 40.4. Fever, swelling, and lymphadenopathy are signs of an infection spreading beyond the periapical region into the periaVeolar soft tissues and beyond into the deep fascial spaces of the head and neck. Trismus and dysphagia are ominous signs also. Flynn et al. found trismus in  $73\%$  and dysphagia in  $78\%$  of severe odontogenic infections requiring hospitalization [8]. Trismus due to infection is a sign that the masticator space (including the pterygomandibular, submasseteric, superficial temporal, or deep temporal spaces) is involved.

# 40.9.3 Use Specific Antibiotic Therapy as Soon as Possible, Based on Culture and Sensitivity Testing

Table 40.5 lists the most common pathogens in odontogenic infections. In short, the target of empiric antibiotic therapy is the oral streptococci and the obligate oral anaerobes (Peptostreptococci, Fusobacteria, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas). The antibiotics of choice for these bacteria are discussed in the next section.

Specific antibiotic therapy is based on the results of culture and sensitivity testing. Culture specimens should be harvested as soon as possible in the clinical course of infections severe enough to warrant hospitalization, in immunocompromised patients, intravenous drug abusers, infections likely to require prolonged antibiotic therapy, and when the infecting flora may have been altered by prior courses of antibiotics.

Because of the increasing rates of antibiotic resistance among the oral pathogens, and the increasing

occurrence of unusual and highly antibiotic resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae in orofacial infections, such as osteomyelitis and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws, identification of the causative pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivities has become even more important than previously.

In addition to allowing timely administration of the most effective antibiotic regimen, the results of culture and sensitivity testing allow deescalation of the initially administered empiric antibiotic therapy, which is of necessity broad spectrum and designed to cover all of the likely pathogens. For example, if the combination of a carbapenem and vancomycin were used initially in a case of necrotizing fasciitis, a culture yielding Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes) would indicate reducing the spectrum of the antibiotic therapy to the combination of penicillin G and clindamycin, which is effective against S. pyogenes. In this manner, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is appropriately shortened, thus reducing selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

# 40.9.4 Use the Narrowest Spectrum Empiric Antibiotic Effective Against the Most Likely Pathogens

Two recent systematic reviews of studies comparing the effectiveness of various commonly used antibiotics in odontogenic infections have both found that, given appropriate surgery, the commonly used antibiotics are equally effective with respect to clinical cure. Therefore, antibiotic selection is based on the individual patient's medical history, pharmacologic safety, and of least importance, cost [42, 43]. Further, given appropriate surgical intervention, the surgeon can confidently select

a narrow spectrum antibiotic for initial therapy pending the results of culture and sensitivity testing.

The empiric antibiotics of choice for odontogenic infections are listed in Table 40.6 based upon their narrow spectrum, relative safety, and cost. They are also separated by the location of care, since intravenous antibiotics are available to inpatients. Intravenous antibiotics may also be given to outpatients via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in odontogenic infections requiring prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy [44].

Flynn et al. found a  $21\%$  clinical failure rate of intravenous penicillin G in severe odontogenic infections. All of the patients meeting the criteria for clinical antibiotic failure subsequently yielded antibiotic-resistant organism(s) when culture results became available. This high failure rate eliminates the natural penicillins (G and V) as antibiotics of choice in hospitalized cases [8]. Ampicillin-sulbactam has thus become the intravenous antibiotic of choice for severe odontogenic infections in many institutions. The addition of sulbactam, a beta

lactamase inhibitor to ampicillin, significantly increases its effectiveness against the penicillin-resistant aerobic and anaerobic oral pathogens, most of which synthesize penicillinase.

Clindamycin resistance rates are also rising, to as high as  $32\%$  of cases in 2107 [40].

In infections that threaten the intracranial contents, selection of an antibiotic that crosses the blood-brain barrier is essential. Clindamycin does not cross the blood-brain barrier well. The penicillins cross the blood-brain barrier when the meninges are inflamed. Metronidazole, a few cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone), the fluoroquinolones (such as moxifloxacin), and linezolid cross the blood-brain barrier. These antibiotics, therefore, may be used in such infections.

# 40.9.5 Avoid the Use of Combination Antibiotics, Except in Specific Situations Where They are Shown to be Necessary

Combined antibiotic therapy regimens significantly increase the cost of care, especially when given intravenously, and by increasing their antimicrobial spectrum, can select for the survival of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Nonetheless, clinical research has substantiated the therapeutic efficacy of combination antibiotics for treatment of certain infections, such as the combination of penicillin G and gentamicin in streptococcal endocarditis [45, 46]. Further, combined antibiotics may interfere with each other, as when bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics are used together.

Clindamycin and the macrolides (erythromycin family) attach to the same receptor site of target bacteria, prohibitively competing with each other. A similar competition occurs between linezolid and vancomycin. These pairs of antibiotics should not be combined due to their mutual antagonism.

The toxicities of antibiotics can be synergistic, as in the increased nephrotoxicity of vancomycin and gentamicin when they are combined.

Odontogenic infections are usually polymicrobial, yielding 4-6 species when conventional culturing methods are used, and as many as 18 species per case when molecular methods are used [33]. Given appropriate surgical therapy, however, a single antibiotic is effective [42, 43].

Necrotizing fasciitis is one of the rare head and neck infections in which empiric combination antibiotic is appropriate. This life-threatening infection causes necrosis of massive amounts of skin and fascia and may pro

ress deeply into the mediastinum. Mortality approaches  $40\%$  in some series, increasing with delay in diagnosis and effective treatment and with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus [47, 48]. There are five subtypes of necrotizing fasciitis, based upon their bacterial etiology: polymicrobial, clostridial, streptococcal, staphylococcal, and Klebsiella. Therefore, the initial antibiotic therapy must cover all of these subtypes, until culture results identify the causative pathogens. Empiric and specific antibiotic therapy for necrotizing fasciitis is illustrated in  $\square$  Fig. 40.12.

Certain head and neck pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, undergo frequent mutations that may confer antibiotic resistance. Since the 1940s, when antibiotics came into widespread clinical use, this organism has demonstrated its ability to develop resistance to each new family of antibiotics within 2 years of its introduction. Currently, some S. aureus strains are resistant or only partially susceptible to nearly every antibiotic we have. Therefore, in staphylococcal osteomyelitis of the mandible, it may be necessary to use combinations of antibiotics to obtain at least partial suppression of the staphylococci and to prevent the emergence of new strains that are completely resistant to the antibiotics used [4].

Table 40.7 ranks the major antibiotic families according to their major toxicities.

The penicillins, especially amoxicillin, because of increased compliance due to a longer dosage interval and due to its lower cost than penicillin V, are among the safest antibiotics appropriate for odontogenic infection.

The risk of allergic reaction is significantly reduced by careful history taking.

Clindamycin becomes the empiric antibiotic of choice in penicillin allergy, even though in recent reports the oral pathogens are becoming more frequently resistant to it [40, 41]. Antibiotic-associated colitis due to intestinal overgrowth of Clostridium difficile remains a concern. This antibiotic should be avoided in patients with a history of this condition.

Azithromycin has a significant safety advantage over the other macrolide antibiotics, because it is not metabolized by the CYP3A4 microsomal enzyme, which is responsible for the frequent and potentially severe drug interactions of the other macrolides, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin. Azithromycin also has a better safety rating in pregnancy than the other macrolides.

Among the fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin's spectrum covers the odontogenic pathogens, including anaerobes. Eikenella corrodens, an occasional oral pathogen, is uniformly resistant to clindamycin. When this organism is isolated in culture, the fluoroquinolones become the antibiotic of choice. They are well absorbed by the oral route, which can eliminate the need for a PICC line in cases requiring prolonged therapy. The fluoroquinolones, however, have many serious drug interactions and are chondrotoxic.

Since metronidazole is effective only against obligate anaerobes, it is generally used in combination with other antibiotics effective against aerobes, such as the penicillins. However, ornidazole, another nitroimidazole, has been used alone with good effectiveness, in odontogenic infections when combined with appropriate surgery [49].

Because of its interaction with ethyl alcohol, patients taking metronidazole must be able to completely abstain from alcohol.

# 40.9.7 Minimize the Duration of Antibiotic Therapy, as Appropriate to the Presenting Type of Infection

During our training, many of us were taught to instruct our patients that they must complete the entire prescribed course of antibiotic therapy, lest partially sensitive strains survive and replace the completely sensitive strains in the population of the target bacteria. Over time, this could lead to a rising minimum inhibitory concentration of that bacterium, conferring antibiotic resistance.

Further investigation has disclosed that antibiotic resistance is often conferred in a single step, by transfer of antibiotic resistance genes even among different species. Transfer of such genetic material can occur by plasmid transduction, bacterial conjugation with direct cytoplasmic interchange, direct absorption of resistance genes from nearby dead bacteria, vector transduction by viral bacteriophages, and single-step mutations [50].

Since there is an energy cost to the bacterial cell for acquiring and maintaining antibiotic resistance mechanisms, "wild" strains that do not carry antibiotic resistance genes have a metabolic advantage over the resistant strains. Paradoxically, limitation of the period of antibiotic exposure may allow the "wild" strains to gradually outcompete the resistant strains and replace them, thus reducing antibiotic resistance of the target bacterial species [50].

There are two high-quality trials of the duration of antibiotic therapy for odontogenic infections. Lewis et al. [51] compared two large doses of amoxicillin on the day of surgery with a 5 day course of penicillin V and Chardin et al. [52] compared 3 and 7 day courses of amoxicillin, combined with appropriate surgical treatment. At 7 days after surgery, there were no differences in the clinical parameters of swelling, fever, and lymphadenopathy between the groups in either study. These studies indicate that there is no difference in clinical cure at 7 days using either a 1-3 day antibiotic course or a 5-7 day antibiotic course, given appropriate surgery.

# 40.9.8 Use the Most Cost-effective Appropriate Antibiotic

Another practical matter that must always be considered in administering antibiotics is their cost, especially the out-of-pocket cost to the patient. The costs of a week's supply of commonly used antibiotics are com

pared in Table 40.8. When a patient does not have prescription drug insurance coverage, such as in the working poor and the elderly, the retail cost of the antibiotic can be a significant factor in whether the prescribed antibiotic is indeed followed. In 2018 the retail cost of 1 week's supply of penicillin V  $500\mathrm{mg}$  taken 4 times per day was US\ $18.59 at a large pharmacy chain in the northeastern United States. The retail cost of 1 week's supply of clindamycin \(300\mathrm{mg}$  taken 4 times per day was US\\)79.99. These prices reflect generic medications, not brand name antibiotics, which are significantly more expensive. Thus, an indigent patient may not be able to pay for a more expensive antibiotic, and therefore he or she may be forced to either take reduced amounts of the antibiotic, to extend the dosage interval, or to forgo taking the antibiotic entirely. Accordingly, the astute clinician will take the cost factor into account. When appropriate, a frank discussion of the cost of the antibiotic as compared to the patient's means appears to be the best policy.

# 40.10 Step 7: Administer the Antibiotic Properly

# Key Points

For severe odontogenic infections, the intravenous route is generally most advantageous  
Certain antibiotics are, however, equally well absorbed orally as intravenously. This can provide a therapeutic advantage in certain situations, such as intravenous drug abusers and long-term antibiotic therapy

The tissue level of antibiotics determines their effectiveness. Those tissue levels are of course dependent on the antibiotic's level in serum, through which the antibiotic must pass in order to achieve therapeutic levels in soft tissues, bone, brain, and abscess cavities. Administration of antibiotics by the oral route requires that the drug successfully navigate the vagaries of the highly acidic stomach, the basic intestinal tract, and chemical interference by ingested foods. Once an antibiotic is absorbed by the gastric or intestinal mucosa, it may then be subject to first-pass metabolism in the liver and subsequent excretion though the bile. Part of the excreted antibiotic may then be reabsorbed by the intestine, resulting in enterohepatic recirculation. For these reasons, orally administered antibiotics achieve much lower serum levels at a slower rate than when they are injected directly into the vascular system intravenously.

Some antibiotics, however, are equally well absorbed intravenously and orally. The fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, are the best examples of this.

For this reason the fluoroquinolones are not given intravenously unless use of the oral route is contraindicated.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the concentration of an antibiotic that is required to kill a

given percentage of the strains of a particular species, reported as  $50\%$  or  $90\%$  of strains  $\mathrm{(MIC}_{50}$  or  $\mathrm{MIC}_{90}$ , respectively). The effectiveness of some antibiotics is determined by the ratio of the serum concentration of

the antibiotic to the MIC required to kill a particular organism. For example, with the fluoroquinolones and the aminoglycosides, if the serum concentration achieved is three to four times the MIC for the organisms involved, then maximum killing power will be achieved. These are examples of concentration-dependent antibiotics [53].

With time-dependent antibiotics, such as the  $\beta$ -lactams and vancomycin, antibiotic effectiveness is determined by the duration for which the serum concentration of the antibiotic remains above the MIC. With time-dependent antibiotics, it is necessary to know the serum elimination half-life  $(t_{1/2})$  of the antibiotic in order to determine its proper dosage interval. The dosage interval can then be designed in order to maintain the serum concentration above the MIC for at least  $40\%$  of the dosage interval [53].

Fortunately, the mathematics involved in these calculations have already been determined by the drug manufacturer. Dosage intervals should not be changed from published guidelines by the surgeon. Nonetheless, the surgeon must be aware of the greater effectiveness of intravenous antibiotics over their oral counterparts. For example, when penicillin G is given every  $4\mathrm{h}$  intravenously, a peak serum blood level of  $20~\mu \mathrm{g / mL}$  is achieved. Since the serum elimination half-life of penicillin G is  $0.5\mathrm{h}$ , after  $3\mathrm{h}$  (6 half-lives) the serum concentration will be approximately  $0.3~\mu \mathrm{g / mL}$ . Since the  $\mathrm{MIC}_{90}$  of Streptococcus viridans is  $0.2~\mu \mathrm{g / mL}$ , the serum concentration of penicillin G after an intravenous dose of two million units will remain above the  $\mathrm{MIC}_{90}$  for approximately  $75\%$  of the dosage interval. Therefore, penicillin G, two million units given intravenously every  $4\mathrm{h}$ , should be highly effective against the viridans group of streptococci, especially the abscess-forming S. milleri group.

By the same method, the peak serum level that can be achieved with an oral dose of  $500\mathrm{mg}$  of amoxicillin is  $7.5~\mu \mathrm{g / mL}$ , and its  $t_{1 / 2}$  is only  $1.2\mathrm{h}$ . Since amoxicillin's  $\mathrm{MIC}_{90}$  for viridans streptococci is  $2\mu \mathrm{g / mL}$ , the serum concentration of amoxicillin will fall below the  $\mathrm{MIC}_{90}$  at approximately  $2\mathrm{h}$  after the peak serum level has been achieved, which is only  $25\%$  of the 8-h dosage interval. Therefore, oral amoxicillin, even though it is considered by many to be a more effective antibiotic, is less likely to be effective against the viridans streptococci than intravenous penicillin G.

# 40.11 Step 8: Evaluate the Patient Frequently

# Key Points

- Close clinical follow-up care is an essential part of the management of the infected patient

Postoperative CT examination and repeat culture and sensitivity testing can help to detect inadequate surgical drainage, spreading infection, and superinfection by resistant bacteria  
Recurring or persistent infection after incision and drainage of soft tissues may be a sign of osteomyelitis

In outpatient infections that have been treated by tooth extraction and intraoral incision and drainage, the most appropriate initial follow-up appointment is usually at 2 days postoperatively for the following reasons:

1. Usually the drainage has ceased and the drain can be discontinued at this time.  
2. There is usually a discernible improvement or deterioration in signs and symptoms allowing the next treatment decisions to be made.

For odontogenic deep fascial space infections that are serious enough for hospitalization, daily clinical evaluation and wound care are required. By 2 to 3 postoperative days the clinical signs of improvement should be apparent, such as decreasing swelling, defervescence, cessation of wound drainage, declining white blood cell count, decreased malaise, and a decrease in airway swelling such that extubation can be considered. Also at this time, preliminary Gram stains and/or culture reports should be available, which may provide some guidance as to the appropriateness of the empiric antibiotic therapy.

If the above signs of clinical improvement are not apparent, then it may be necessary to begin an investigation for possible treatment failure. The causes of treatment failure in odontogenic infections are listed in Box 40.5. One of the best methods of reevaluation is the postoperative CT. A postoperative CT can identify continued airway swelling that may preclude extubation, or further spread of the infection into previously undrained anatomic spaces, or it may confirm adequate surgical drainage of all the involved anatomic spaces by the visualization of radiopaque drains in all of the involved fascial spaces.

Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether the inability to extubate a patient is due to antibiotic resistance or inadequate surgical drainage.  $\blacksquare$  Figure 40.13 illustrates two such cases in which a postoperative CT was able to identify the most likely cause for the lack of clinical improvement. In  $\blacksquare$  Fig. 40.13a, oropharyngeal swelling surrounds the endotracheal tube in spite of the presence of surgical drains in all of the infected spaces. This lack of improvement at 4 postoperative days was due to therapeutic failure of penicillin, which was treated by changing this patient's antibiotic to clindamycin. Subsequently the patient improved. In  $\blacksquare$  Fig. 40.13b,

of a patient with a previously placed drain in the left pterygomandibular space (arrow). Note the extension of the infection into the right and left lateral pharyngeal spaces and the retropharyngeal space, with constriction and deviation of the airway. (Reproduced with permission from Flynn [57])

![](images/b53b60203286285732374a7a926793c0cfab6caaf1b8636fa68ff503ce8ca9af.jpg)

there is continued oropharyngeal swelling surrounding the endotracheal tube at 5 postoperative days. On the other hand, the infection has progressed from the successfully drained left pterygomandibular space to the left and right lateral pharyngeal spaces, as well as the retropharyngeal space. This patient was taken back to the operating room for repeated drainage of all of the infected spaces.

It should be noted, however, that in this author's experience, the use of CT scanning to determine whether a patient can be extubated gives a late positive signal. The best available clinical test for the ability to extubate in the case of upper airway swelling is the air leak test (Fig. 40.14). The air leak test is performed in the following manner in the spontaneously ventilating patient:

1. The endotracheal tube and trachea are suctioned.  
2. The oxygen supply is reconnected and any coughing that was stimulated by the tracheal suctioning is allowed to subside.  
3. The oropharynx and oral cavity are suctioned free of debris, hemorrhage, and secretions.

4. The cuff of the endotracheal tube is deflated while the oxygen supply is maintained.

5. After waiting for any coughing to subside, the oxygen supply is disconnected and the surgeon's thumb is placed to occlude the opening of the endotracheal tube.  
6. The patient is then instructed to breathe spontaneously around the endotracheal tube, and if this can be done, a positive air leak test is obtained. If the patient cannot breathe around the occluded endotracheal tube, then a negative result is obtained, and extubation should be delayed.

Given a positive air leak test result, the best method for patient extubation involves extubation over a stylet or preferably an endotracheal tube changer. Consideration may be given to performing the extubation procedure in an operating room, where the best facilities for handling an airway emergency are available. One method for extubation over a tube changer is described as follows:

1. The patient is preoxygenated for  $3 - 5\mathrm{min}$  
2. The endotracheal tube and trachea are suctioned.  
3. Five milliliters of  $1\%$  lidocaine without epinephrine is administered via the endotracheal tube, followed by oxygenation and then repeated tracheal suctioning.  
4. The oral cavity and oropharynx are suctioned free of debris, hemorrhage, and secretions.  
5. The oxygen supply is disconnected and a tube changer then is introduced into the trachea via the endotracheal tube.  
6. The cuff of the endotracheal tube is deflated and the endotracheal tube is withdrawn over the tube changer until its tip is in the oropharynx.  
7. If the patient is able to breathe around the tube changer as it remains in the trachea, then extubation can be completed.  
8. If the patient is not able to breathe around the tube changer, then the endotracheal tube is re-inserted over the tube changer into the trachea.  
9. The endotracheal tube cuff is re-inflated, the tube changer is withdrawn, and oxygen is reconnected.

After extubation, the patient is closely monitored clinically and with pulse oximetry. Arterial blood gases may be drawn  $1\mathrm{h}$  after extubation in order to verify adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

Occasionally, the infecting flora, especially in a particularly severe infection with a prolonged course, will change during the course of treatment. This may be due to the selection pressure exerted by intensive antibiotic therapy, or it may be due to the subsequent introduction of hospital-acquired pathogens, resulting in a nosocomial infection. Therefore, in prolonged treatments and in especially severe cases it may be prudent to reculture infected sites, so that any new or previously undetected pathogens can be identified.

![](images/9862554db9323cb2956d5e3528e479833364c5e4fa70fa7f0a0ef8de327d5fd4.jpg)

In cases where there is continued chronic drainage from an infected site, such as in diagnosed or suspected osteomyelitis, the surgeon's mnemonic for the causes of a fistula can be used. "FETID" stands for foreign body, epithelium, tumor, infection, and distal obstruction. In the maxillofacial region, this mnemonic can be used to provide a differential diagnosis for the chronic drainage of pus. Foreign bodies may be represented by bone plates and screws, or dental or cosmetic facial implants. Epithelium may cause chronic drainage simply because an epithelialized fistulous tract has not been completely excised or because an epithelium-lined cyst has drained externally. Tumors (especially malignant ones) that become infected do not heal, which may result in chronic drainage. Infection can of course drain chronically, which should alert the surgeon to suspect osteomyelitis or a chronic periapical abscess that is draining onto the skin, as in Fig. 40.15. Distal obstruction classically refers to intestinal obstructions, but the concept can still be applied to the salivary ducts and to the natural sinus drainage pathways, such as the ostium of the maxillary sinus. When these openings for natural drainage of saliva or mucus become obstructed, then infection may result and drainage may occur by an alternate pathway, such as proximal fistulization of the submandibular salivary duct due to a salivary stone blocking the natural opening of the submandibular duct.

If a thorough search for previously undetected pathogens turns up negative or or if another cause for treatment failure cannot be found, then the surgeon

should consider the possibility of antibiotic failure, such as microbial resistance to empiric antibiotic therapy or the use of an incorrect dosage or route of administration for the antibiotic. The criteria for changing antibiotics are listed in  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Box 40.6. Because of the necessary time delay in obtaining culture and sensitivity reports, it is occasionally necessary to change from one empiric antibiotic to another. Ideally the surgeon should consider another of the empiric antibiotics of choice listed in  $\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} \end{array} }$  Table 40.6. The input of an infectious disease consultant may also be valuable in this situation.

# Summary

Severe odontogenic infections can be the most challenging cases that an oral and maxillofacial surgeon will be called on to treat. Often the patient with a severe odontogenic infection has significant systemic or immune compromise, and the constant threat of airway obstruction due to infections in the maxillofacial region raises the risk of such cases incalculably. Furthermore, the increasing rarity of these cases and the ever-changing worlds of microbiology and antibiotic therapy make staying abreast of this field difficult for the busy surgeon. Therefore, the eight steps in the treatment of severe odontogenic infections, first outlined by Dr. Larry Peterson, remain the fundamental guiding principles that oral and maxillofacial surgeons must use in successful management of these cases. The application of the eight steps must be thorough and the surgeon's

mind must always remain open to the possibility of treatment failure, an error in initial diagnosis, antibiotic resistance, and previously undiagnosed medically compromising conditions. Although adherence to these principles cannot always guarantee a successful result, it can assure the oral and maxillofacial surgeon that he or she is practicing at the highest standard of care.
