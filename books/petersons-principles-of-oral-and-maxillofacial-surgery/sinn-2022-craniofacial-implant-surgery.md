# 15.1 Introduction

Reconstruction of acquired or congenitally absent facial structures such as ears, eyes, the nose, and other structures is a challenging task for the reconstructive surgeon. Often, inadequate soft tissue, cartilaginous, or osseous structure exists for a reconstruction that is both functional and aesthetic and is achieved with a reasonable effort on the part of the surgeon and patient.

The use of external titanium cranial implants for prosthetic reconstruction in the head and neck region was developed by the pioneering work of Brænemark, Briene, Adell, and others in the late 1960s and early 1970s [1-5]. Since this technology emerged as a reliable reconstruction method for the maxillofacial/oral region, early work began regarding extraoral applications of the titanium osseointegrated implant. Initially, concern regarding long-term stability and recurrent infection was vocalized by many authors. Subsequently, work in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Tjellström, Albrektsson, Brænemark, and Lindström revealed that the extraoral application of reliable technique [6-12]. Following the initial application of this technology for auricular reconstruction, other reconstructive procedures utilizing osseointegrated retention such as orbital, nasal, and frontal prostheses have been evaluated in the literature.

Osseointegration can be defined as direct structural and functional connection between ordered, living bone and the surface of a load-carrying implant [13].

# 15.2 Prosthetic Reconstruction

Most authors agree that prosthetic reconstruction of the ear results in a cosmetically superior result when compared with autogenous reconstruction. This is not to imply that traditional reconstructive techniques cannot achieve an excellent aesthetic result; however, the complex anatomy of structures such as the ear and nose can be extremely difficult to reconstruct and nearly impossible to replicate with traditional reconstructive surgery. Implant-retained prostheses offer an excellent reconstructive option that provides for excellent symmetry, color, and anatomic detail. Further, prosthetic reconstruction offers a rescue option for unacceptable or failed autogenous grafting procedures [12, 14, 15].

Implant-retained prostheses offer several advantages over more traditional prosthetic techniques. Cranial implants provide secure attachment of the prosthesis, which obliviates adhesives, double-sided tape, glasses, or other more traditional fixation methods that may compromise prosthetic stability. They enhance the patient's quality of life via improved self-image, greater activity level owing to superior retention, and ease of prosthesis management. Traditional adhesives have several disadvantages such as discoloration of the prosthesis, skin reactions (especially in radiated areas), and poor performance during activity or perspiration [12, 14, 16]. Another significant advantage of cranial implantation is that the technique avoids distortion of tissues inherent in traditional surgical reconstruction, which allows for superior tumor surveillance. It has been suggested, despite difficulties with osseointegration in irradiated bone, that cranial implants may have an advantage in the post-irradiation patient due to poor-quality soft tissues available for reconstruction [17].

Several disadvantages to prosthetic reconstruction exist including the necessity of prosthetic/implant maintenance due to normal wear and discoloration and depending on the level of the patient's activity. The prosthesis may be dislodged at inopportune times such as social or athletic events, and some authors have noted that some patients may have adverse psychological effects related to the prosthesis [12, 14-16].

# 15.3 Autogenous Reconstruction

The advantages of using autogenous tissue in head and neck reconstruction follow the generally accepted principles of reconstruction, that is, stable long-term reconstruction with living tissue with an intact blood supply. An inherent advantage with autogenous reconstructions is the potential to fight infection and heal [15, 16]. In addition, the cartilaginous framework may have some growth potential in younger patients [18]. Traditional techniques allow for the reconstruction of partial deformities (preserving local tissue), whereas prosthetic reconstruction is usually reserved for total loss of the structure and may actually require removal of local tissues to facilitate prosthetic rehabilitation. Traditional reconstruction may be a superior option for the poorly compliant patient as well. An added advantage is the elimination of prosthetic support/maintenance that can be a significant expense to the patient.

The primary disadvantage to autogenous reconstruction is that the final result is often less than satisfactory to the surgeon and the patient in terms of aesthetic outcome [19]. In reference to auricular reconstruction, Wilkes and Wolfaardt noted that "the final reconstructed ear is acceptable aesthetically but less likely to exactly match the contralateral side when compared to a prosthetic ear" [15]. Autogenous reconstruction generally requires multiple-staged procedures and may necessitate tissue expansion, multiple grafts, or adjacent tissue transfers (such as temporoparietal flap). Such procedures are technically more demanding and may increase the risk of surgical complications such as flap necrosis, nerve injury, alopecia, and infection. Greater surgical and donor site morbidity (i.e., costochondral grafting) are further disadvantages to traditional reconstructive surgery. The time required for reconstruction is another issue, with the average time of the classic four-stage reconstruction being around 9 months (with an additional 3 months if tissue expansion is required) versus 4-5 months for prosthetic reconstruction (in the nonirradiated patient) with cranial implants [15].

# 15.4 Technical Considerations

The most important technical aspect to consider when placing titanium implants in the craniofacial skeleton is appropriately positioning the implants to allow for successful prosthetic reconstruction. This necessitates close consultation with the maxillofacial anaplastologist/prosthetist during the treatment planning phase in order to avoid inaccurate implant placement resulting in unusable points of fixation. The quantity and quality of bone in the proposed implant site should be evaluated with appropriate imaging before placement of cranial implants. Axial and coronal computed tomography (CT) provide excellent osseous detail and allow visualization of anatomic structures related to the implant site. A prefabricated surgical template is recommended for accurate placement at the time of surgery (Fig. 15.1). The most common surgical sites selected for the placement of cranial implants are the temporal bone, the orbit, and the maxilla/nasal region. Technical considerations related to these individual sites are discussed later.

Fig. 15.1 Preservation of the body of the zygoma during resection surgery is preferred because it serves as an important anchorage site during the reconstruction surgery

# 15.4.1 Temporal Implants

In the case of temporal cranial implants for auricular reconstruction, most authors prefer a subperiosteal-, anterior-, or inferior-based flap. Careful dissection to avoid perforation is necessary, especially in the previously operated patient or in the event that preoperative radiation was administered to the region. The subcutaneous region of the flap is meticulously thinned in order to prevent soft tissue mobility around the implant. The presence of soft tissue mobility at the implant/soft tissue interface may lead to significant soft tissue reactions [20]. An appropriate  $(\sim \geq 25\mathrm{mm})$  amount of the flap width is maintained to ensure vascularity of the pedicle. Lundgren and coworkers [21] proposed ideal positioning parameters and recommended placement approximately  $18\mathrm{mm}$  from the external auditory canal at the 6:00, 9:00, and 12:00 o'clock positions for the right ear and the 12:00, 3:00, and 6:00 o'clock positions for the left ear. The distance between implants should be approximately  $11\mathrm{mm}$  (center to center). Generally, we have found these estimates to be accurate; however, local anatomic considerations often necessitate placement of the implants into non-ideal locations. Prosthetic reconstruction should still be possible provided the surgeon does not exceed the parameters outlined by the surgical guide. The implant-retaining magnets must be contained within the confines of the final prosthesis in order to achieve an optimal outcome.

The complication rate is extremely low, although some patients may suffer from dural exposure during the surgical procedure. They are managed conservatively and usually heal uneventfully. In general, middle cranial fossa or sigmoid sinus exposures do not create problems in most cases. Injury to aberrant anatomic variants of the intratemporal portion of the facial nerve is rare but should be considered when operating on younger patients or patients with craniofacial anomalies [20, 22, 23].

- Distance between implants should be approximately  $11\mathrm{mm}$  (center to center).

# 15.4.2 Orbital Implants

Owing to the osseous anatomy of the orbit, orbital implants must be placed radially within the orbital rim to provide adequate bone thickness for retention. Generally, implant placement within the lateral rim is recommended owing to the increased thickness of the bone in this region. We have found the medial orbit to be problematic in most cases secondary to lack of adequate bone and increased anatomic complexity due to the lacrimal fossa. Unfortunately, this means that the desired axial loading of the implants is impossible in this region, which is a less favorable biomechanical situation when compared with other craniofacial implant regions. Therefore, meticulous technique and consideration for staged bone grafting may be required for a successful implant-retained orbital prosthesis. Usually, three to four implants are placed in the lateral rim to provide adequate prosthetic stability. Further, it is important to note that the implants must be placed sufficiently within the orbit, slightly behind the rim, to allow adequate prosthetic thickness to provide camouflage for the implant fixtures.

# Surgical Orbital Implant Placement

Three to four implants are placed in the lateral rim to provide adequate prosthetic stability.  
- Must be placed sufficiently within the orbit, slightly behind the rim, to allow adequate prosthetic thickness to provide camouflage for the implant fixtures.

# 15.4.3 Nasal Implants

Implantation of the nasal region can be technically challenging owing to the poor availability of quality bone. The more complex anatomy of the nasal cavity and the thin friable tissue in the area add to the difficulty of cranial implantation in this region. This is especially true in the irradiated patient. Implants are generally placed in a triangular arrangement with one fixture superior (radix) and two placed in a lateral position with the frontal pro

cess of the maxilla. The implants must be placed slightly within the nasal cavity to engage adequate bone and, as in the case of the orbital reconstruction, provide for adequate prosthetic thickness.

# Surgical Nasal Implant Placement

- Implants are generally placed in a triangular arrangement with one fixture superior (radix) and two placed in a lateral position with the frontal process of the maxilla.  
- Must be placed slightly within the nasal cavity to engage adequate bone and provide for adequate prosthetic thickness.

# Key Points

The most important technical aspect to consider when placing titanium implants in the craniofacial skeleton is appropriately positioning the implants to allow for successful prosthetic reconstruction.

# 15.5 Surgical Technique

When considering the placement of maxillofacial implants in any type of maxillofacial defect, the fixtures should be placed with the planned prosthetic framework in mind. The angle of the implants should provide an emergence profile allowing for proper prosthetic design without interfering with the ideal sculpture of the prosthesis. Misplaced implants may cause poor aesthetic outcome. Proper spacing and angles of the implants are necessary to allow manipulation of the prosthetic components.

# 15.5.1 Pretreatment Criteria

1. Collaboration with the oncologic surgeons before the resection of maxillofacial lesions  
2. Presence of adequate residual bony volume for support of maxillofacial implants  
3. Consideration of the thickness of the overlying soft tissues  
4. Close planning with the maxillofacial prosthodontist and/or anaplastologist allowing for the proper emergence profile of the prosthesis

The preceding points are a few of the preoperative considerations that will allow predicable outcomes for the treatment of patients with simple and complex maxillofacial defects.

# 15.5.2 Pre-resection Collaboration

Planning with the oncologic surgeons before resection of patients with maxillary tumors is essential in order to maximize the residual volume of zygomatic bone remaining after the tumor ablation surgery.

Communication of the contours of soft tissue reconstruction immediately after the resection of the tumors is also important. In order to allow adequate for the emergence profile of the abutments as well as the retaining components of the maxillofacial prosthesis, consideration of the "depth" of the defect is critical. In cases of orbital exoneration, the free flap reconstruction must allow for a residual "concave" defect. If the depth of the defect is not adequate, preprosthetic soft tissue surgery may be necessary in consultation with the maxillofacial prosthodontist and/or the anaplastologist. Close cooperation between the oncologic surgeons and the maxillofacial surgeon is paramount.

# 15.5.3 Residual Bony Volume

The need for adequate residual bony volume for placement of the maxillofacial implants is obvious. The conventional preoperative evaluation has relied on traditional radiographs and/or two-dimensional CT scans for planning of the implant positions. The surgeons would use the limited information gained from these radiographs and, in conjunction with intraoperative "trial and error," locate at times the extremely limited bony volume for the placement of maxillofacial implants in the attempt to avoid hollow spaces such as the frontal, ethmoidal, and maxillary sinuses. The advent of computer-guided software has allowed the adaptation of this technology for the treatment of maxillofacial defects.

# 15.5.4 Computer-Guided Treatment Planning

The Maxillofacial Concept Software allows collaboration between the surgeon, the maxillofacial prosthodontist, and/or the anaplastologist in planning treatment for the patient with maxillofacial defects before initiation of the treatment. The two-dimensional DICOM files of the patient are converted into three-dimensional format, which allows better visualization of the remaining osseous tissues by the surgical team. The patient's soft tissue can also be reformatted and superimposed onto the reconfigured three-dimensional bony volume showing the topography of the patient's remaining facial and intraoral architecture.

The maxillofacial prosthodontist and the anaplastologist can assess the thickness of the soft tissues and guide the surgical team in the best location for the implants and, consequently, the abutments and the prosthetic framework design. By using the information provided by the Maxillofacial Concept Software, the entire team can plan the position of the implants that best complies with the surgical and the prosthetic principles. The surgical team preoperatively can now position the

implants, evaluate their trajectory (Fig. 15.2), select final abutments (Fig. 15.3), and modify the treatment plan several times until the best implant positions for the support of the maxillofacial prosthesis leading to the most transparent transition line and aesthetic emergence profile are reached (Fig. 15.4). The final treatment plan can then be taken to the operating room, and the "virtual surgery" can be translated to the actual patient (Fig. 15.5).

Fig. 15.6 "Feathered" margin of the prosthesis allows for a subtle transition line between the prosthesis and the patient's skin

# 15.5.5 Overlying Soft Tissues

Equal importance is given to the presence of healthy overlying and surrounding peri-implant soft tissues. Whether cutaneous or mucosal tissue, the clinicians must be very aware of the thickness of the tissues in order to allow a maintainable environment around the

prosthetic substructures by the patient and the maxillofacial prosthodontist. The management of the periabutment soft tissue is very similar to the intraoral management of soft tissue surrounding abutments. Thinning of the flaps is usually necessary to allow a maintainable depth of soft tissue around maxillofacial abutments.

# 15.5.6 Transition Line

The transition line of the prosthesis with the patient's skin should be as subtle and low profile as possible to allow for a lifelike appearance (Fig. 15.6). In any type of defect, the fixtures should be placed with the planned prosthetic framework in mind. The angle of the implants, the trajectory, and its long axis during its placement should provide for adequate emergence profile allowing for proper bar design and/or magnet placement without interfering with the ideal sculpturing of the prosthesis. Proper spacing and angles of the implants are also necessary to allow the manipulation of the prosthetic screws and drivers needed during fabrication and delivery of the maxillofacial prosthesis.

# 15.5.7 Surgical Considerations

Treatment of patients with maxillofacial defects may involve the intraoral and extraoral structures. It is important to define the type of implants used for the treatment of the various clinical cases.

# 15.5.7.1 Extraoral Implants

The implants used are the regular platform implants. The extraoral implants used to date are the machined surface regular platform Brænemark, 4.0-mm implants. Extraoral implants used for the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) appliance or to support a prosthetic ear are not the regular platform Brænemark implants. The implants used for ear prosthesis are specially designed to support the ear reconstruction or the BAHA appliance. Vistafix implants developed also by Brænemark and more currently revised are the implant of choice for ear prosthetic stability and BAHAs (Fig. 15.7). They are available in 3.0- and 4.0-mm lengths with a 1.5-mm collar that is slightly submerged in the bone to increase the surface area of bone contact (Fig. 15.8).

# 15.5.7.2 Intraoral and Intranasal Implants

Intraoral and intranasal implants are also the machined surface, regular platform implants or conical cranial implants available from Straumann. In cases in which the zygomatic bone is used for anchoring implants, several approaches were considered. For patients having had partial or total maxillectomies, regular platform implants were used in the remaining portion of the zygomatic body to allow for contralateral point stabilization of the prosthetic framework. In cases in which the maxillary residual arch is intact, the Branemark zygomatic implant with the  $45^{\circ}$  angulated platform can be used.

# 15.5.8 Preparing the Osteotomy

Most cases are treated in the operating room under general anesthesia. After sterile preparation and draping of the patient, lidocaine with epinephrine is administered to the surgical field to allow better control of hemostasis. Sharp

dissection through the epithelium, connective tissue, and periosteum exposes the residual bony defect. The drilling sequence to prepare the osteotomy is the same as for conventional intraoral implants. The surgeon has to clinically judge the quality of bone while preparing the osteotomy. When using cranial implants, either Brænemark or Straumann, the osteotomy can be completed with a specially designed drill that is either 3 or  $4\mathrm{mm}$  in length and create the collar osteotomy simultaneously (Fig. 15.8).

# 15.5.9 Orbital Defects

Placement of two to three implants is generally adequate for support of the substructure and the orbital prosthesis. The preferred site is the lateral supraorbital rim, if it has not been resected. However, implants may be placed in the residual periorbital bony rim. Special consideration for treatment planning the orbital prosthesis is the available depth of the orbital defect. Inadequate orbital depths will not allow the tipping of the trajectory of the implant into the center of the orbit, resulting in inade

quate space for the fabrication of the substructure and the orbital prosthesis. Virtual planning of the implants is performed (Fig. 15.9), and the orbital depth is established intraoperatively by debulking of the orbital contents. The implants are placed as planned at  $35\mathrm{-N}/$  cm (Fig. 15.10). The immediate postoperative implant positioning is in concert with the proposed virtual planning of the implants (Fig. 15.11). The computer-guided treatment planning allows for the positioning of the implants in appropriate bony volume in concert with the proper trajectory for reconstruction of the maxillofacial prosthesis (Fig. 15.12). After exposure of the orbital rim, a round bur is used to identify the position of the implant (Fig. 15.13). A paralleling pin is placed upon completion of the  $2\mathrm{-mm}$  osteotomy to better evaluate the trajectory of the implant (Fig. 15.14). The final osteotomy depth is  $3\mathrm{mm}$  followed by the insertion of the implant. Most procedures follow the one-step protocol in which the temporary healing abutment is placed at the time of the implant surgery with adaptation of the soft tissues around the temporary healing abutment (Figs. 15.15 and 15.16).

Three to 4 months of osseointegration period is allowed followed by fabrication of the substructure and the prosthetic eye (Figs. 15.17, 15.18, 15.19, and 15.20).

# Orbital Implant Surgical Considerations

- Placement of two to three implants is generally adequate for support of the substructure and the orbital prosthesis.  
The preferred site is the lateral supraorbital rim.  
- Most procedures follow the one-step protocol in which the temporary healing abutment is placed at the time of the implant surgery.  
Three to 4 months of osseointegration period is allowed followed by fabrication of the substructure and the prosthetic eye.

# 15.5.10 Nasal Defects

Placement of the implants for support of a nasal prosthesis is unique because access by the maxillofacial prosthodontist must be considered during planning of the position of the implants. The generally accessible bone volumes that can support the implants are in the premaxilla. Placing two implants through the nasal floor in positions corresponding with dental positions nos. 7 and 10 is recommended (Fig. 15.21). During treatment planning, especially in the fully dentate patient, consideration of vital structures including the teeth and the neurovascular content of the nasopalatine canal is essential. The use of the maxillofacial planning software allows for visualization of the existing vital structures avoiding their collision with the proposed implants (Fig. 15.22). Aesthetic considerations of the final prosthesis must also be taken into account. In cases in which the oncologic resection was not orchestrated with the maxillofacial reconstruction phase of the patient's treatment, an excess of remaining soft tissue hinders an aesthetic prosthetic outcome (Fig. 15.23). Three general paranasal areas should be considered when plan

play is aesthetic at rest for the female patient. In order to establish the proper lip drape, a "gull-wing" resection of the upper lip immediately below the nasal apertures is performed through the skin, connective tissues, and periosteum (Fig. 15.25). The repositioning of the inferior portion of the resection allows for the visual evaluation of the adequacy of the resection. In order to allow room for the fabrication of the metal substructure supporting the prosthetic nose, excess portion of the nasal cartilage is trimmed. Debulking of the paranasal connective tissues allows for the maxillofacial prosthesis artistic license to create favorable contours for a thin finish line of the prosthesis.

Following the virtual treatment planning, the two implants are placed with the implant platforms tilted outward to allow ease of access by the maxillofacial prosthodontist. The one- stage surgical protocol is followed. However, it is prudent to place the final abutment at the time of stage I surgery. Placement of the final abutment and the impression coping at the time of surgery in conjunction with packing with triple antibiotic pressure dressing allow for the adaptation of the nasal mucosa to the nasal floor. It is not advisable to place the third implant in the nasal bone as the nasal prosthesis is implant retained; therefore, there are no biomechanical advantages to the third implant. The emergence profile

# Nasal Implant Surgical Considerations

Two implants should be placed through the nasal floor in positions corresponding with dental positions nos. 7 and 10.  
Three general paranasal areas should be considered when planning a nasal prosthesis for a predictable aesthetic outcome.  
The upper lip drape is established via a "gull-wing" resection of the upper lip immediately below the nasal apertures performed through the skin, connective tissues, and periosteum.  
In order to allow room for the fabrication of the metal substructure supporting the prosthetic nose, excess portion of the nasal cartilage is trimmed.  
- Debulking of the paranasal connective tissues allows for favorable contours for a thin finish line of the prosthesis.  
The one-stage surgical protocol is followed.  
Allow for 3-4 months for osseointegration.

# 15.5.11 Complex Maxillofacial Defects

Complex maxillofacial defects, a combination of orbital and nasal defects with or without intraoral involvement, need case-by-case planning. However, the concept for the positioning of the implants remains the same; using the least number of implants to allow adequate support of the prosthesis by the metal substructure is the guide to planning in this group of patients.

Combination of orbital and nasal defects (Fig. 15.27) may be treatment planned as an orbital defect plus a nasal defect. The lateral orbital rim is the preferred position for the support of the orbital prosthesis. In the planning process, care must be taken to appre

![](images/45c5a08f05fe198f989974491fd5646868e6d0969c0bd28d26b11f5f87a11c3a.jpg)

The premaxillary floor of the nose is the preferred area for placement of implants to support the nasal prosthesis (Fig. 15.29). The use of the medial portion of the superior orbital rim should be avoided, if possible, because the natural concavity of the upper eye lid in this area does not allow for fabrication of the superstructure (Fig. 15.30). The final orbital-nasal prosthesis may be retained by one or two magnets (Fig. 15.31).

# 15.5.12 Unusual Maxillofacial Defects

Multiple variations of maxillofacial defects exist, and therefore, it is paramount for the maxillofacial surgeon and the oncologic surgeon to collaborate before the resection of the tumor with the reconstructive phase in mind. Preservation of the zygomaticomaxillary complex, in total or in portion, aids in the future reconstruction of patients with orbital defects (Figs. 15.32 and 15.33). Postresection, virtual planning allows for identification of optimal surgical and prosthetic sites for the placement of the implants (Fig. 15.34). The resultant clinical

Fig. 15.31 Completed magnet-retained prosthesis on the left

implant positions are predictably gained using the preoperative computer-guided software (Fig. 15.35).

# Key Points

- Implant planning and placement requires close cooperation between the oncologic surgeons and the maxillofacial surgeon.  
Having adequate residual bony volume is key when preparing for surgery. CT scan provides three-dimensional interpretation of the residual bony volume.  
Surgeons must be very aware of the thickness of the tissues in order to allow a maintainable environment around the prosthetic substructures by the patient and the maxillofacial prosthodontist.  
The angle of the implants, the trajectory, and its long axis during its placement should provide for adequate emergence profile allowing for proper bar design and/or magnet placement without interfering with the ideal sculpturing of the prosthesis.  
- When using cranial implants, the osteotomy can be completed with a specially designed drill that is either 3 or  $4\mathrm{mm}$  in length and creates the collar osteotomy simultaneously.

# 15.6 Healing Period

The traditional two-stage or the one-stage surgical protocol may be adopted per the surgical teams' preference. For the two-stage approach, after installation of the implants, cover screws are placed, and the implants are submerged. Stage II surgery, exposure of the extraoral implants through the cutaneous tissue, is performed 3-6 months after the stage I surgery.

# 15.6.1 Abutment Connection and Impression Taking

The final abutments are placed approximately 2-4 weeks after the stage II surgery. This will allow the resolution of the soft tissue swelling around the temporary healing abutments installed at stage II surgery. The impression can be taken at this time.

For the one-stage approach, temporary healing abutments or the final abutments are secured to the implants

immediately after their insertion. The peri-abutment soft tissues are maintained by daily hygiene using warm water with occasional application of triple antibiotic if necessary. For the one-stage protocol, impressions may be taken at the stage II appointment, 3-4 months after placement of the implants.

# 15.6.2 Soft Tissue Reactions and Infections

The rate of soft tissue reactions around percutaneous implants has been reported between  $3\%$  and  $60\%$ , with significant variation reported depending on the stated definitions used to classify a reaction [24, 25]. Most authors have noted soft tissue reactions of approximately  $3 - 7\%$  of percutaneous implants, with the majority of the reactions being mild erythema or irritation [17, 26]. In a total of 2624 postoperative implant observations in 309 cranial implants (follow-up from 1 to 12 years), Westin and colleagues [20] noted a  $3\%$  incidence of significant skin reactions. Abu-Serriah and

associates [27] found soft tissue infection to be the most common complication in a group of 150 cranial implants.

They also note that decreased after the first 2 years of service in the temporal region; however, implants in the orbital and nasal regions exhibited a constant rate of soft tissue complications when observed over time.

Fourteen percent of the implants included in the current study exhibited some form of soft tissue reaction at some point during the follow-up period. These ranged from mild to significant reactions including granulation tissue and infection and, in some cases, resulted in loss of the implant. Holgers and Tjellström [25] utilized a classification scale for soft tissue reactions surrounding percutaneous titanium implants. Utilizing Holgers and Tjellström's classification system, we found that  $95.6\%$  (109/114) of the cranial implant tissue reactions fell within classes 0-3 and required only local measures to

control soft tissue reactions. In the event that local revision was necessary, electrocautery was utilized to remove granulation tissue, and sharp dissection was used to thin the tissue surrounding the implant interface. Patients who underwent revision were also placed on appropriate empirical antibiotics. The patients were then instructed regarding home care and followed up monthly, with the majority having improvement of the peri-implant inflammation. The remaining implants (5) exhibited significant reactions, which, despite efforts and multiple revisions, resulted in loss of the implants.

The most common isolates from peri-implant cultures obtained from skin-penetrating cranial implants are Staphylococcus (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus) and Streptococci species, gram-negative bacilli, and yeast species such as Candida parapsilosis [28]. Routine culture of peri-implant tissues is not beneficial owing to contaminants from normal skin flora and the

rarity of frank infection surrounding the implants. In the event that empirical antibiotic therapy fails or clinical suspicion of an unusual pathogen exists, culturedirected antibiotic therapy may be beneficial. Soft tissue reactions around the skin-penetrating implant can be minimized with excellent hygiene and meticulous surgical technique (e.g., appropriate flap thinning and maintaining adequate blood supply by maintaining a robust pedicle). We do not recommend routine use of antibiotic ointments for transcutaneous titanium implants. Medications such as steroid cream or antibiotic ointment should be reserved for short-term therapy, and long-standing soft tissue reactions should be evaluated for peri-implant infection or soft tissue revision surgery as noted earlier. Long-term utilization of antibacterial ointments around skin-penetrating implants may also have the adverse effect of selection of resistant strains of bacteria or yeast species [28-31].

# 15.7 Longevity of Cranial Implants

The successful placement and osseointegration of cranial implants have been evaluated by multiple authors. Histologically, osseointegration of cranial implants appears to closely resemble that of intraoral titanium dental implants [32]. It is generally accepted that the success rate differs dramatically relative to the location in which the implant is placed. The most predictable site for cranial implant placement is the temporal bone, by a significant margin. Long-term success rates in the temporal region have been reported ranging from  $92\%$  to  $98\%$  in larger studies (Fig. 15.36) [12, 14, 17, 21-23, 26, 27].

Success rates in orbital implantation have been reported from  $91\%$  to  $96\%$  [17, 22, 23]. In the present study, a total of 31 orbital implants were placed with a success rate of  $87.1\%$ . Cranial implants placed in the

nasal region are especially difficult owing to the low availability of adequate bone in the region and difficulty with soft tissue management and hygiene. Success rates reported in the literature when implanting the nasal region range from approximately  $70\%$  to  $80\%$  [17, 22, 23].

# Key Points

The most predictable site for cranial implant placement is the temporal bone.  
- Implants placed in the nasal region are the least predictable due to the low availability of adequate bone in the region and difficulty with soft tissue management and hygiene.

# 15.8 Radiation in Cranial Implantation

When utilizing cranial implants for reconstruction of oncologic defects of the facial skeleton, placement of implants into radiated bone is inevitable. As with all radiated tissues, soft tissue fibrosis coupled with the loss of the microvasculature occurs in the recipient bed. The resulting decreased oxygen tension has a negative effect on the ability to place titanium implants and obtain successful integration. Most authors report significantly

increased failure rates (range  $17 - 42\%$ ) when placing cranial implants into radiated bone [17, 22, 33-36]. When examining 81 cranial implants, Jacobsson and coworkers [26] noted a success rate of  $62.7\%$  (as compared to  $92.1\%$  in nonirradiated bone). The orbit is an especially difficult location to achieve implant integration after radiation therapy [37]. In a group of 24 orbital implants, Roumanas and colleagues [23] observed a high rate of loss in the irradiated orbit and noticed a  $100\%$  complication rate including failure to integrate and late failure, tissue inflammation, and soft tissue recession. Successful implantation of the orbit is significantly more difficult in the radiated patient, with most authors reporting success rates in the range of  $50 - 66\%$  [23, 26, 33]. Despite the adverse effect of radiation regarding cranial implant osseointegration, the risk of craniofacial osteoradionecrosis is quite low and seldom observed [17, 23, 33, 37]. The timing of implant placement at the conclusion of radiation therapy remains controversial, with most authors recommending a delay of 6-19 months before implant placement [23, 27, 33].

The utilization of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been advocated by multiple authors in the literature to improve integration rates and optimize soft tissue healing when placing cranial implants into irradiated bone [17, 27, 33]. When examining 125 irradiated cranial implants, Granstrom and associates [33] noted  $38.4\%$  of

irradiated implants were lost versus  $17\%$  in the nonirradiated group. Of the irradiated implants, 45 received preoperative HBO therapy, and no implants were lost in this group. The authors concluded that HBO was extremely beneficial in the radiated field before placement of cranial implants. In reference to the proposed soft tissue benefits of HBO, the authors also observed no statistical difference in local skin reactions when comparing patients who received HBO therapy and those who did not.

# Key Points

The orbit is the most difficult location to achieve implant integration after radiation therapy.  
The risk of craniofacial osteoradionecrosis low and seldom observed.  
Timing of implant placement at the conclusion of radiation therapy is to delay treatment upward of 6-19 months before implant placement.  
HBO therapy is beneficial in the radiated field before placement of cranial implants.

# 15.9 Prosthetic Considerations

Stable and consistent prosthetic attachment is crucial to the successful rehabilitation of the maxillofacial patient. For the anaplastologist or practitioner who is designing and fabricating prostheses, implementing cranial implants can significantly help meet the needs of the patient. Anaplastology (from the Greek ana, again, and plastos, something made or formed) is commonly defined as the application of prosthetic materials for reconstruction of an absent, disfigured, or missing body part. "The anaplastologist is charged with the formidable task of restoring the delicate beauty of the human ear" [38]. This task is assigned and applied to all facial prosthetic reconstructions.

# 15.9.1 Preoperative Planning

Preoperative appointments with the anaplastologist are considered an integral part of the treatment planning process for patients having prosthetic reconstruction [39]. At the initial consultation, before and after photos of previous cases can be shown to help the patient visualize possible results and treatment options. The anaplastologist can effectively plan to achieve the highest level of realism and symmetry attainable under given circumstances. When possible, presurgical impressions capturing natural anatomy before planned resections or

tumor excision are very helpful. This record of the patient's own facial features can help to establish a prosthetic design that the patient will ultimately recognize and relate to. Discussion of all retention types should be initiated at this stage with the advantages of each clearly explained.

# 15.9.1.1 Options without Cranial Implant Surgery

A patient's lifespan, poor hygiene, or psychosocial implications can be contraindications for an implant-retained prosthesis. In these cases, an adhesive-retained prosthesis can be designed relatively quickly without requiring any surgery or osseointegration waiting time. However, prosthetic adhesives can be cumbersome especially to older patients who have limited dexterity or impaired eyesight. An adhesive-retained prosthesis requires skill in locating it exactly on the soft tissue as designed by the anaplastologist or proper fit and aesthetics are compromised. The effectiveness of prosthetic adhesives can be severely diminished owing to soft tissue movement, oily skin types, and environmental factors such as extremely humid climates.

# 15.9.1.2 Options with Cranial Implant Surgery

An implant-retained prosthesis provides a secure and consistent method of attachment. The mechanical connection between patient and prosthesis can alleviate psychological concerns that the prosthesis will become loose or dislodge at any time [40]. It also ensures exact positioning without the need of a mirror or caregiver. In addition, the lifespan of an implant-retained prosthesis is typically longer than one requiring adhesive owing to less wear and tear associated with the adhesive removal process.

When the surgically placed, implant-retained type is chosen, the bar and clip versus magnetic attachment option should be decided presurgically (Figs. 15.37, 15.38, and 15.39). This decision will determine how many exposed implants are needed. Experience has shown that the gold bar arrangement proves more difficult for many patients to clean than the freestanding abutments for magnetic attachment. The magnetic attachment requires little manual dexterity; the magnetic force can actually help to guide the prosthesis into place [41]. Conversely, both the gold bar and the clips can break or bend, rendering attachment either difficult or impossible. Additional space within the prosthetic form for the acrylic housing containing the clips can also be compromising to the final design. The recently developed O-ring magnet by Technovent Ltd. "provides

far superior retention to that of conventional magnets" [42]. In the author's experience, using only one of these O-ring magnets in a prosthesis meets or surpasses the retention of a bar clip design.

To aid in the treatment planning for a prosthesis supported by cranial implants, bone quality should be examined with applicable imaging techniques before cranial implant placement.

# 15.9.2 Prosthetic Surgical Considerations

Successful prosthetic reconstruction using cranial implants is contingent upon proper positioning of the implants. When deciding how many implants to place, several factors should be taken into account. What is the minimum needed to support secure attachment for the patient's activity level? How many can be placed in the most ideal locations according to the surgical template? Does this allow adequate space between the abutments

for proper cleaning? If an implant fails, will the remaining be sufficient for retention? If the patient has been irradiated or bone quality is questionable, placing an additional implant should be considered.

The location and implication of hair-bearing tissue should be identified before surgery. Hair in the proposed peri-abutment region presents potential for infection [39]. Removing hair follicles or utilizing split-thickness skin grafts or laser hair ablation is the preferred way to manage unwanted hair.

# 15.9.2.1 Auricular Considerations

Advancements in three-dimensional technology such as scanning and milling machines provide for accurate reproduction of contralateral auricular forms. Utilizing such devices helps the practitioner accurately and quickly achieve a certain level of symmetry (Fig. 15.40). The patient's existing auricular cast is scanned, digitally mirror-imaged, and milled in three dimensions. This shape gives the anaplastologist a reliable reference in which to design the final auricular prosthesis.

In congenital cases, there are often several options to consider. Cartilaginous remnants from failed autoge-

nous reconstructions can be retained or sculpted and repositioned for the construction of a neotragus. The presence of a tragus allows the anterior prosthetic margins to be elegantly concealed behind this anatomic feature (Fig. 15.41). Symmetrically and well-positioned microtic tissue can remain underneath the implant-retained auricular prosthesis. Conversely, microtic tissue compromising the end aesthetic result can be partially or entirely removed at the time of implant placement. This should be clearly discussed with the patient before surgery, allowing plenty of time for decision-making. It is not uncommon for the patient to feel emotionally attached to her or his microtic tissue.

# 15.9.3 Templates

Implants should be placed in an area of the prosthesis that is thick enough to contain and naturally disguise the retentive hardware. Designing a prototype prosthesis before surgery will determine these areas of thickness and other important features. The prototype can then be used in the construction of the surgical template. The template should designate preferred implant locations (Fig. 15.42) and other optional sites in case the favored locations are not of acceptable bone quality. It should also denote ideal spacing between implant sites appropriate for the chosen attachment method (gold bar or freestanding magnetic). In addition, the orientation or angle

of the desired implants should be denoted. This angle should be conducive to cleaning around the abutments.

All templates should passively, but precisely, register onto the patient during surgery. Nearby anatomic features should be built into the template's design and, therefore, ensure proper placement. Various materials such as acrylic or silicone can be used in template fabrication. The chosen material must be properly sterilized before use in surgery. Even though the custom-designed template is provided to the surgeon, it is useful for the anaplastologist to be present at the implant surgery [40]. This facilitates consultation and ensures that the prosthetic result will not be compromised should unforeseen circumstances arise.

# 15.9.3.1 Auricular Templates

The basic reference mark in locating potential auricular implant sites is the middle of external auditory canal. When this landmark is available and symmetrical to the contralateral side, a clock-positioning guide can be referenced. In this technique, the ideal location is approximately  $20\mathrm{mm}$  from the center of the external auditory meatus. Positions are 8:00 o'clock and 10:30 for the right side and 1:30 and 4:00 o'clock on the left (Fig. 15.42). Utilizing these locations within the template should allow for the retentive hardware to be concealed in the antihelix portion of the prosthesis (Fig. 15.42). Any cartilaginous tissue intended for a neotragus can be indicated in the same template.

# 15.9.4 Construction of the Prosthesis

The final visual prosthetic result depends on achieving a delicate balance of many factors during all stages of construction. Fabrication begins with capturing an accurate impression. Soft tissue movement, areas of sensitivity, and hair surrounding the site should be taken into account. The range of motion in the soft tissue should be evaluated before capturing impressions. Impressions should be taken with the soft tissue in a natural state, which allows for tightly fitting prosthetic margins. For auricular impressions, having the patient open and close the jaw will demonstrate the range of motion of the temporomandibular joint. This is important for taking into account soft tissue movement during actions such as talking, chewing, and yawning.

An accurate impression material must be used to precisely register the abutments and record soft tissue. Applying two layers of polyvinyl siloxane material will achieve the required exactness. A thin, light-bodied layer is applied followed by a heavy-bodied material to stabilize the impression hardware (Fig. 15.43). For the

magnetic attachment type shown in Fig. 15.43, the transfer magnet will remain within the impression and be used for registering the laboratory analog abutments within the cast.

The resulting cast from this captured impression will serve as the canvas upon which to build the definitive prosthesis. Many tools are available for the practitioner to use when sculpting and designing the final form. Input and feedback from the patient should be especially encouraged during this stage. The prototype form should be tried on and examined by both patient and anaplastologist.

Prosthetic margins should utilize existing anatomic structures such as wrinkles, scar lines, and hair for disguise. Being a very prominent feature in the middle of the face, a nasal defect may not offer any of these attributes to take advantage of; thin, delicate tapering of margins must be planned for. The boundary of an orbital prosthesis can be effectively disguised behind the edges of the patient's spectacles (Fig. 15.44). Careful selection of the frames before prosthetic treatment can result in better camouflage of the margins.

# 15.9.4.1 Nasal Prostheses

For the nasal patient, it is important to ask for photographic references upon which to base the prosthetic design. Both profile and frontal photographs should be employed. This will ensure that the final result looks familiar and recognizable to the patient. Adequate airflow must also be accommodated within the prosthetic design. The required retentive hardware can consume a lot of space on the posterior side of the prosthesis (Fig. 15.45). Incorporating sufficient airflow is important for passive breathing and should be tested while the prosthesis is still in its prototype stage.

$\Theta$  Sufficient airflow is important for passive breathing and should be tested while the prosthesis is still in its prototype stage.

# 15.9.4.2 Color and Tinting of the Prosthesis

Creating realistic skin colors in silicone requires selecting a combination of colorant that mimics the absorption and transmission of human skin [43]. To achieve a high level of realism, several factors must be taken into consideration: opacity/translucency of the silicone, the correct hue (color), value (too dark or too light), and chroma (intensity) [38]. Various lighting conditions can alter any of these aspects of color. This phenomenon, known as metamerism, affects the camouflaging ability of the prosthesis. Therefore, the light source should be taken into account while mixing a patient's silicone color match. A wide range of color-corrective and daylight-simulating fixtures can be employed.

It is important to take into account the patient's skin color as a whole and any skin grafts or scarring in the adjacent soft tissue. If part of the prosthesis will be blending into a darker skin graft, for example, two or more silicone base shades should be mixed for transitioning into each area. Many different glazes, shadow, and highlight colors must be custom-blended to achieve realism (Figs. 15.46, 15.47, and 15.48). When the intrinsic colors are finalized, the silicone should be catalyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The final result should be undetected at a normal conversational distance and release the patient from having his or her condition recognized in social situations. This will transform the patient's self-esteem and overall presentation. Symmetry, organic form, and attention to color detail will contribute to the patient's acceptance of the prosthetic silicone feature.

# 15.10 Discussion

# 15.10.1 Retention Components

Once the implants have been confirmed to be osseointegrated, the framework for the prosthesis is fabricated. The framework for the maxillofacial prosthesis may be a simple or a complex gold bar. The two types of retention components used are magnets or clips. Prosthetic ears are secured to the underlying bar using clips. Magnets are preferred for ear prosthesis owing to ease of application and cleanliness of the area. Bar and clips do not allow access for cleaning and as good maintenance of the implants. For the isolated prosthetic eye or prosthetic nose, the use of clips or magnets can be considered. For the more complex and larger defect involving a prosthesis that replaces the eye-nose and a portion of the patient's cheek, a combination of clips and magnets may be desired.

# 15.10.2 Management of the Skin Tissues Around the Extraoral Abutments

Minimal soft tissue trauma during the surgical phase of the reconstruction in conjunction with the thinning of the subcutaneous tissues is critical for the long-term

maintenance of the extraoral implants. Minimizing motion around the abutments by application of a pressure dressing will also help in stabilizing the soft tissue adaptation around the extraoral abutments. The use of antibiotics and hydrocortisone applied to the pressure dressing will aid in reducing the inflammation and prevent bacterial colonization.

# 15.10.3 Long-Term Maintenance

In order to increase the long-term success of the extraoral implants, maintenance of healthy cutaneous cuff around the extraoral abutments is crucial. Daily cleansing of the percutaneous abutments using cotton swabs moistened with water and diluted peroxide followed by application of chlorhexidine has shown to be sufficient. A soft-bristled brush may also help in removing debris. It is important to avoid the use of sharp or metal instruments around the percutaneous abutments. The prosthesis should also be cleansed daily using soap and water. Care should be taken to maintain a clean surface in order to avoid damage to the prosthesis. Bacteria and/or fungal colonization on the surface of the prosthetic may cause skin irritation. Sleeping with the prosthesis removed allows ventilation and revascularization around the percutaneous abutments and should be encouraged.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, cranial implant-retained prosthetic reconstruction has proved to be successful. Replacement of eyes, ears, nose, and larger areas including combined midface defects frequently have no other options available. Burn patients and those with congenital defects are often good candidates for this type of reconstruction, especially after autogenous attempts have been inadequate. The use of cranial implant prosthetic reconstruction should be considered in difficult maxillofacial and cranial defects for more predictable results.
