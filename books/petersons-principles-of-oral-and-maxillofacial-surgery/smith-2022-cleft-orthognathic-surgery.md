Introduction Treatment of cleft patients can be complex and frustrating if some prior experience and planning has not been obtained by the surgeon. The patients may have poor prior experiences and expectations may be high and are sometimes hard to deliver. Patients may need to be guided through the system and it is very helpful to have a multidisciplinary team at your service. This chapter discusses these guidance issues, anatomical differences, and methods to overcome challenges of surgery. Communication with the orthodontist is critical for excellent outcomes and to help in the prevention of early and late relapse in these orthognathic surgical cases.

Important Conclusions Cleft orthoganthic surgery can be a technical and frustrating surgery to the uninitiated. It is essential for the surgeon to obtain assisted experience before performing these cases. The use of multidisciplinary teams and experienced orthodontists is essential. This chapter attempts to unravel some of the potential difficulties of these complicated cases, and surgery for this type of patient can be very rewarding due to significant facial and occlusal changes that occur.

In treatment of children with cleft lip and palate facial anomalies, the use of an interdisciplinary team approach continues to be of primary importance throughout adolescence. The coordination of care between restorative dentistry, surgery, orthodontics, and prosthodontics is critically important during this phase of reconstruction of the cleft lip and palate patient. As stated by the American Cleft Palate Association (ACPA), the minimum requirements for a cleft lip and palate team include a surgeon (oral and maxillofacial surgeon, otorhinolaryngologist, or plastic surgeon), a speech and language pathologist, and an orthodontist. These minimum requirements may be inadequate if the team does not provide a consultation for the other members who are truly important in the care of cleft lip and palate patients, specifically restorative dentistry and psychological counseling. Many children with cleft lip and palate have malformed teeth, dental crowding, missing teeth, supernumerary teeth, and ectopic eruption that frequently require careful evaluation and treatment by

pediatric or general dentists during the phases of mixed dentition and into the early permanent dentition. Many children have underdeveloped, or missing, maxillary lateral incisors and may be candidates for dental implants and/or other prosthetic reconstruction. Consequently, these professionals are of utmost importance to the team. Sometimes overlooked in interdisciplinary care of these patients is psychological counseling. A significant number of these children have self-esteem issues associated with their facial deformities, especially during the formative preteen years, and families need to maintain an open mind and discuss these social issues associated with their cleft lip and palate child. A thorough team discussion about the consultations that can be obtained, and the services that can be provided, must take place to ensure that each team member has access to all aspects of care and to ensure that patient expectations are reasonable and appropriate. On occasion, families become very complacent with follow-up and recall to the interdisciplinary cleft palate clinic owing to the fact that they have had their immediate needs met once the cleft lip and cleft palate have been repaired surgically. If speech problems have been addressed, or do not exist, the family may be satisfied with the progress, and it is critical that the interdisciplinary team review the patient records to ensure that patients who have been noncompliant with regular team meetings attempt to reenter the regular team meetings, especially during late transitional dentition and early permanent dentition, to alleviate significant problems in treatment who may present late for treatment. When children are not followed routinely, and present late in the orthodontic and surgical sequencing for treatment of cleft lip and palate, the treatment becomes much more complex, social issues become much more significant, and the problems may increase exponentially (Figs. 69.1, 69.2, and 69.3).

Orthognathic care in the cleft lip and palate patient begins with development of the maxilla in the transitional dentition, and during this time, the orthodontist should take every opportunity to develop the transverse dimension of the maxilla. Expansion of the maxilla before alveolar cleft bone grafting will help to maintain the transverse dimensions of the maxilla and will alleviate potential transverse problems with orthognathic surgery once the child has reached adolescence. Before orthognathic surgery, orthodontists should be acutely aware of whether the child has a propensity for maxillary anteroposterior (AP) and/or vertical hypoplasia and should be careful not to treat these problems with extraction of teeth in the lower arch to try to maintain a class I occlusion. Early in the adolescent period, children who are treated in this manner have a greater problem later on once they have transitioned into a class III malocclusion and are missing significant lower arch dimension.

The patient and family may initially think that the patient will not be a candidate for surgery, and this may have negative effects on the orthodontist-patient relationship if a surgery is recommended later. Statistically, the number of children who need to have orthognathic surgery and have had unilateral cleft lip and palate is approximately  $48.5\%$  and up to  $76.5\%$  in bilateral cleft patients [1-3].

Other orthodontic considerations for the cleft patient requiring orthognathic surgery include preoperative orthodontic banding and bonding. It is critical to ensure that surgical rectangular arch wires and adequate surgical lugs are in place before surgery to allow the surgeon to manipulate the maxilla during the surgical procedure. The surgeon will have a difficult enough time manipulating the maxilla without having additional problems

associated with poorly bonded orthodontic appliances with small arch wires and without adequate surgical lugs for intraoperative intermaxillary fixation. The orthodontist should ensure that the molars have bands with buccal tubes. These small issues can provide an increasingly frustrating surgical procedure that may result in inadequate treatment due to fixation errors.

Maxillary hypoplasia in three planes of space is the most common problem encountered in children with cleft lip and palate, and there is controversy regarding what degree of this

restricted growth is surgically induced and what degree of hypoplasia is intrinsic [3]. Decisions must be made by the interdisciplinary team, with parental and patient input, regarding whether the patient will have early surgery, end-of-growth surgery, or both. Many children entering junior high school, grades 6 and above, may be experiencing psychosocial issues owing to the negative aesthetic effects of severe maxillary hypoplasia, and these children may be candidates for early orthognathic surgery with maxillary advancement surgery (Fig. 69.4a-d). The surgical treatment may proceed with or without orthodontics. Discussions about early orthognathic surgery must include an understanding by the family and patient that, in most situations, the patient will require secondary surgery after the cessation of facial growth.

Early in the history of orthognathic surgery, the application to children with cleft lip and palate dentofacial anomalies proved to be difficult. Many institutions, both before and after the introduction of rigid fixation, employed a philosophy of "splitting the AP discrepancy" between the maxilla and the mandible or avoided treatment of the maxilla completely [4, 5]. Patients with severe maxillary hypoplasia may have had a Le Fort I

Lateral cephalogram of a 12-year-old with early intervention maxillary advancement via internal distraction osteogenesis. Secondary orthognathic surgery was discussed if continued growth of

osteotomy performed, repositioning the maxilla as anterior as possible allowed by the scar tissue restriction. There is typically adjunctive bone grafting and some form of additional fixation utilized in these cases of large maxillary advancements in the cleft patient to prevent relapse. Subsequently, the mandible was then repositioned posteriorly to achieve a class I canine and molar relationship with the maxilla.

In many patient situations, the projection of the mandible may be in a relatively normal position, and essentially, the technique of treating to the deformity was employed. Treating to the deformity has significant ramifications in the form of compromised facial aesthetics and possible iatrogenic obstructive sleep apnea due to narrowing of the posterior airway (Fig. 69.5a, b).

In contemporary orthognathic surgery of children with cleft deformities, if cephalometrically and clinically

the mandible is in a normal AP position, it should not be repositioned posteriorly to split the difference with the maxilla; this will allow increased projection of the maxilla, elevation of the nasal tip, increased lip support, and the establishment of stable occlusion. Maxillary advancement does not correct the lip scarring or retraction or compensate for an unaesthetic lip repair, and it does not normalize the anatomic landmarks [5]. The skeletal surgery must occur before the final soft tissue revision, including any lip and nasal aesthetic procedures. The increased support provided by maxillary advancement for the nose and lip changes the cosmetic appearance without direct surgery on these structures. The judgment of the surgeon who performs the definitive lip and nasal surgery may be hindered if the skeletal deformity is not addressed before the final aesthetic soft tissue procedures.

Other presurgical orthognathic considerations for patients with bilateral cleft lip and palate include the use of palatal splints, especially in situations in which the bone graft is less than adequate in the alveolar cleft to help prevent fracture of the bone graft in this area and after the down-fracture and manipulation of the maxilla. A palatal splint will help stabilize the bone of the lateral segments as well as the premaxilla so that the intersegment bone does not fracture and will allow stabilization of the entire complex, so that additional bone grafting can be accomplished during the orthognathic procedure, if indicated. Occlusal splints must be fabricated before surgery with consideration of whether overcorrection of the jaw movements will be planned. Posnick and Ewing [6] showed that 24 patients without pharyngoplasty with mean maxillary advancements of  $6.7\mathrm{mm}$  relapsed immediately after surgery with a mean relapse of  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  over a 2-year follow-up period. Planned overcorrection in the model surgery and splint fabrication will usually decrease or eliminate relapse potential. Cleft patients with relatively small maxillary AP discrepancies will usually have excellent results with minimal relapse after maxillary advancement with overcorrection (Figs. 69.6a-d and 69.7a, b).

Shifting from conventional model surgery to virtual surgical planning (VSP) has significantly increased the speed of orthognathic planning, improved visualization of bony interferences that will be encountered during surgery, enhanced training tools for learning surgeons, as well as facilitated communication with patients, family, and other professionals involved in the treatment.

Specially for planning maxillary movements in cleft patients, VSP proved to be extremely useful. It is now possible to plan different maxillary advancements and have as many splints as necessary during actual surgery. Of course it was also possible to construct different treatment plans with model surgery, but it was highly inconvenient and time consuming to build more than one intermediate splint.

The preferred sequence for orthognathic surgeries in cleft patients is conventional - beginning with the maxilla. Usually, two or three different anteroposterior movements are planned, ideal, and more conservative (Fig. 69.8a-c). The different protocols used to perform the VSP do not determine the surgical sequence. This determination will occur after VSP is accomplished, and before splints are built. At this stage, maxilla is moved to final position and mandible remains in its original position. Care is taken to open the bite at least  $0.10\mathrm{mm}$  at first tooth contact when constructing the splints, to make sure there are no teeth overlapping. All of the splint STL files are transferred to a 3D printer for fabrication.

By creating two or any number of intermediate splints, the surgeon brings multiple intermediate splints for the surgical field and, after safe mobilization of the maxilla, the ideal splint (largest maxillary movement as indicated) is inserted. If this planning proves not feasible, the more conservative splints can be used, and after maxillary fixation, mandibular osteotomy is performed to achieve best possible occlusion without the aid of final splints.

The procedure for performing maxillary osteotomies is described elsewhere in this text, and the important aspects of differences in cleft patients are discussed. Cleft patients undergoing orthognathic surgery many times may have had a prior pharyngeal flap surgery to

correct hypernasality and velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI). The anesthesiologist should be made aware of the presence of the pharyngeal flap and that plans for alteration from the usual intubation protocol may be necessary. The endotracheal tube should not be forced

through the nasopharynx because it can track submucosally along the posterior pharyngeal wall. Using a small catheter or an endoscope first through the endotracheal tube then gently through the lateral ports of the pharyngeal flap will facilitate the intubation (Fig. 69.9a-e). Another technique is to use a gloved finger and digitally palpate the right or left lateral pharyngeal port, depending on which side of the nose the endotracheal tube is placed, through the mouth and contact finger with the endotracheal tube, ensuring that it follows the finger through the intended port. The use of hypotensive anesthesia has shown significant decrease in blood loss in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. It has also been documented that the incidence of transient bradycardia during maxillary manipulation was decreased in controlled hypotension [7]. An additional method for reducing blood loss includes the use of Transxemic Acid (TXA). Statistically significant reduction in blood loss has been shown in age groups for patients receiving surgical procedures in the craniofacial region. Dosage of  $10\mathrm{mg / kg}$  bolus preoperatively and  $1\mathrm{mg / kg}$  maintenance dose throughout the procedure has shown to drastically reduce the blood loss in craniofacial surgical patients and improving the quality of the surgical field. [8, 9]

A cleft maxilla differs from an intact maxilla because of the absence of soft and hard tissues and multiple prior surgical procedures that were required to repair and close defects.

Perfusion of the mobilized maxilla is dependent on vessels coming from the overlying soft tissues, predominantly involving the palatal tissues. In cleft patients, this tissue is commonly scarred and fibrotic; therefore, care must be exercised when designing the incision to perform the osteotomy in order to maximize preservation of blood supply. With few exceptions, almost all patients may be treated with a Le Fort I osteotomy via a circum-vestibular incision and maxillary down-fracture approach. For those with severe palatal scarring, who have previously undergone an island palatal repair, and those with bilateral clefts of the maxilla, an anterior buccal soft tissue pedicle should be left intact on the mobilized maxilla to maintain adequate vascular perfusion. Technically, this is a more challenging operation. Almost all unilateral cleft patients can be treated with a Le Fort I osteotomy via a circumvestibular approach. The circumvestibular incision is made from the zygomaticomaxillary buttress to the opposite side, high in the mucobuccal fold (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 69.10).

Fig. 69.10 A high circumventibular incision ensures adequate perfusion to the anterior maxilla. Note that the attached gingiva on both sides of the cleft is reflected and preserved if grafting has not been done, this is not an ideal situation. The remaining tissue lining the cleft walls is later incised and reflected palatally or buccally, depending on where it is needed for closure

Subperiosteal dissection exposes the entire lateral wall of the maxilla from the piriform rims to the pterygoid plates and from the alveolus, above the roots of the teeth, to the inferior orbital rim. The broad exposure permits excellent visualization of all planned osteotomies. At the conclusion of maxillary mobilization, this incision permits the maxilla to be down-fractured and pedicled entirely based upon the palatal soft tissues and the remaining buccal soft tissues below the incision. Good visualization and ease of mobilization are the major advantages of this approach. Hemorrhage control is performed with direct visualization. With this in mind, the incision design for bilateral cleft lip and palate patient is different even if there is a well-healed alveolar cleft bone graft in place. A tunneling technique should be accomplished with a small vertical incision in the midline and horizontal incisions on the lateral segments with a tunneling technique in between the cuspid and the lateral incisor areas (Fig. 69.11a-d). When an anterior buccal pedicle remains, the operation is technically more difficult. This preservation of labial soft tissues will prevent devascularization of the premaxillary

bone segment and mucosa and can be accomplished in most cases without difficulty. For most patients with a cleft palate, the area of greatest resistance to mobilization of the posterior maxilla is the vertical portion of the palatine bone, located in the posteromedial aspect of the maxillary sinus. The bone is thick and access is limited, and this is the area of the descending palatine vessels that should be maintained, when possible. It is often desirable to segmentalize the maxilla of a cleft patient in order to improve occlusal relationships, but segmentation of the maxilla should be performed with caution, considering the compromised vascularity and scarring of the soft tissues [10]. The compromise of acceptance of a posterior cross bite or other minor occlusal disharmonies may be preferred over the risk of avascular necrosis of the soft and hard tissues after a segmental osteotomy. It is possible to close dental spaces with segmental osteotomies, and this is frequently done in residual alveolar clefts. During the osteotomy, closure of the nasal lining is of critical importance and, as stated earlier, requires bone grafting into the area to help stabilize the maxilla and to provide proper contours of the maxilla and alveolar bone (Fig. 69.12a, b).

General considerations in performing orthognathic surgery for cleft lip and palate patients include knowledge of differences in anatomy for children with and without cleft lip and palate deformities as compared with the typical skeletally mature adolescent orthognathic surgical patient. Patients with cleft maxillary deformities may have heavy buttressing of the maxilla, specifically at the piriform rim and pterygomaxillary buttress region of the posterior maxilla [11]. It is impor

tant to note this anatomic anomaly before orthognathic surgical procedures so that careful and thorough osteotomies can be completed in these regions to ensure that maxillary down-fracture can be completed without difficulty. Failure to weaken these buttress regions before mobilization may result in an unfavorable fracture, for example, in the pterygoid plate region extending to the skull base or orbit, and blindness has been reported after Le Fort I osteotomies of cleft patients [12]. Additional instrumentation that may help in down-fracturing and stretching of the soft tissue pedicle includes a modified Tessier rib-spreading forceps or a Smith sagittal split osteotomy-spreading forceps. These spreading forceps can easily fit posterior to the hard palate and allow slow controlled expansion of the scarred palatal soft tissue pedicle of the maxilla. This will increase the possible magnitude of down-grafting and advancement and improve the surgeon's ability to completely mobilize the maxilla. Significant time must be taken to stretch the soft tissue pedicle in the vertical and AP dimensions to allow proper down-grafting and projection of the maxilla. Soft tissue handling is important after the downfracture, and attempts at reconstruction of the nasal floor and closure of any residual fistulas will improve the final results of the surgery (Fig. 69.13a, b).

Residual bony defects can then be grafted to provide a better skeletal base for nasal aesthetic and alveolar and dental reconstruction in the future. The bone graft may be wedged into defects to help retain the proper maxillary position and promote osseous healing. Choices of bone augmentation range from iliac crest to the use of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP).

bone graft as needed it is preferable to have all major bone grafting done prior to orthognathic surgery

Increasing clinical use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) has facilitated significant changes in maxillary bone grafting procedures within oral and maxillofacial surgery. Its use in cleft orthognathic surgery seems to be very appropriate. Consideration should be given to composite-type grafting scenarios where autogenous bone is used along with BMP. Bone grafts can be used for immediate stabilization with a membrane of BMP-impregnated collagen sponge over the site to help with enhanced bone formation in the region. Fixation of the cleft maxilla should be done with as heavy a fixation as possible for stabilization [13, 14]. One consideration in the use of more rigid fixation is that the weak link in maintaining the position of the maxilla is not the plate or screws but the bone and bony contacts. Therefore, the surgeon should attempt to maintain as much bone-to-bone contact as possible and use bone grafts at the buttress regions, when necessary. The relapse potential of the osteotomized cleft maxilla is clinically significant in many situations, and a slow posterior migration of the entire maxillary complex may still occur, regardless of the size of the plates and screws or the amount of bone contacts.

# 69.1 Cleft Distraction Osteogenesis

Any discussion of orthognathic surgery in the cleft lip and palate patient must include consideration for the use of distraction osteogenesis (DO). As discussed in

$\triangleright$  Chap. 64, children with severe class III malocclusions remain one of the very few indications for DO in facial

bone reconstruction. Other chapters review the basic biologic principles and concepts of DO; however, it should be noted that, in the mid-1990s, at the First International Conference on Craniofacial Distraction Osteogenesis, DO was introduced in the opening ceremony as the panacea for facial bone osteotomies in all aspects of orthognathic surgery and other facial deformity correction [10]. As time and surgical experience have progressed, there are very few indications for DO in orthognathic surgery and/or the correction of facial deformities. Adolescents with severe maxillary hypoplasia due to cleft deformities are appropriately treated with DO owing to the fact that there is slow expansion of the scar that has restricted the growth of the maxilla and the most common level of the osteotomy for DO is at the Le Fort I level [15].

Various DO techniques and devices are available for maxillary distraction in the cleft patient, but a common device used is an external head frame (halo) distraction device, in which traditional maxillary osteotomies are performed for the procedure. Care should be taken to completely mobilize the maxilla, because the distraction device will not overcome inadequate mobilization of the maxilla and hardware failure will likely occur. Specially made bone plates are secured to the maxilla with screws, and these plates have a large diameter rectangular wire looping around the upper lip to the external surface of the skin in the paranasal regions. This wire is attached to an adjustable activation bar that can be manipulated in the vertical, horizontal, and transverse planes of space. The activation bar is then attached to a vertical bar positioned at the midline of the face and connected to the

head frame distraction device (Fig. 69.14a, b). One of the major advantages of an external head frame distraction device is that the vectors of distraction can be controlled in three planes of space easily during the distraction process. Also, there is ready access to the activation arms of the distraction device, and most of the mechanisms of the device are readily visible with only the interface at the bone being in a buried position. Large magnitude linear distraction movements are possible, with average reported AP distraction movements of  $8 - 15\mathrm{mm}$  and vertical inferior movements ranging from  $1.6 - 13\mathrm{mm}$  [11]. Following the osteotomies and placement of the DO devices, the latency period is typically 5 days, and the distraction rate is usually  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{mm}/$  day, depending upon the age of the cleft patient at the time of DO. Techniques that can aid in the proper final position of the maxilla with both internal and external DO appliances include occlusal splints and the use of intermaxillary elastics to guide the maxilla into the proper final location. During the DO activation period, alterations in the vector can be accomplished to allow the teeth to fit into the splint and the final resting position of the maxilla. The usual consolidation period, dur

ing which time the maxillary bone can heal, requires 2-3 months (8-12 weeks). The removal of external frame distraction devices is simple and can be accomplished in the office with or without local anesthesia. The removal of the bone plates may be more complex and will require, at the minimum, local anesthesia and intravenous sedation. Patients may need to use a reverse-pull (protraction) headgear for night use for a period of 6 months after an external frame device has been removed to maintain the position of the maxilla and prevent relapse. Suzuki and colleagues [16] found a  $22.3\%$  horizontal relapse and a  $53.07\%$  vertical relapse during the first 6 months after DO surgery. Patients need to be prepared to wear the external head frame device for at least 3-4 months, and approximately 6 months of reverse-pull headgear in the postoperative period. Some have suggested that rigid fixation be accomplished after the distraction process upon removal of the DO devices [17]; and these discussions should involve the orthodontist before surgery, but may serve to stabilize the maxilla further and prevent relapse. Disadvantages of external frame devices include the social appearance of the patient during treatment time, and other frequent com

plaints include difficulty finding a comfortable sleeping position and accidental trauma to the device from siblings, friends, and pets. The external frame device is large and bulky and may be easily caught on other objects or displaced by other people. Some patients decline the option of a head frame device owing to its appearance, especially if the child is in school. When using DO, the patient should be followed at regular intervals to ensure that the distraction process is proceeding as planned and it should be recognized that the need for a reverse-pull headgear is also a disadvantage (Fig. 69.15).

Internal distraction devices may also be used in the cleft patient and can work well and provide movement in the maxilla in the AP and yaw vector directions. Advantages of an internal device include increased patient acceptance, no visibility of the appliance exter

nally, ability to remove the activation arms of the distractor once the distraction has been completed while leaving the distraction appliance in place for consolidation, and the ability to leave the distraction devices on for 6-9 months after the distraction process to allow for increased stability of the maxilla; this will eliminate the need for a post-DO reverse-pull headgear (Figs. 69.16 and 69.17). Disadvantages of the internal devices are that the appliances are unidirectional in nature, they require a second surgery for removal, and they do not allow the surgeon to make significant changes once the appliances are in place and distraction is proceeding. In addition, placement of the devices in a parallel fashion bilaterally can be difficult for the surgeon. The surgical procedure includes typical osteotomies for the unilateral or bilateral cleft maxilla, down-fracturing the maxilla to

ensure adequate mobility of the maxilla, and then placement of the internal distraction devices and ensuring as close as possible the paralleling bilaterally of the vector of the distraction. Depending upon the need for increasing the vertical dimension of the face, the angle of the distraction device can be changed to allow for a "ramping down" of the maxilla in a downward and forward vector. Essentially, changes in the vertical position of the maxilla can be effected with the angulation of the device at placement, but cannot be altered during the course of the distraction process. Most internal distraction devices are secured with screws into the buttress of the zygoma and onto the body of the maxilla, and the activation arms are placed, if not already part of the devices, and the wounds are closed. Again, the latency period is 5 days, and the rate of distraction is  $1 - 1.5\mathrm{mm}/$  day divided into a rhythm of two to three times per day. The internal distraction devices can correct for midline asymmetries during distraction by adjusting the yaw during distraction via activation of one device more than the other so that midline changes occur as well. As

with the external frame distraction device, the use of occlusal splints with good interdigitation of teeth into the splint can help guide the treatment path of the distracting maxilla and, as mentioned, as distraction progresses, changing the quantity of distraction on the right or left will change the midline position of the maxilla.

Depending upon magnitude of the maxillary midline discrepancy, intermaxillary elastics can be used to settle the maxilla into its final occlusal resting place in the occlusal splint. The maximum possible distraction distance of the maxilla with currently available internal DO devices is  $30~\mathrm{mm}$ . For some internal distraction devices, once the distraction process has been completed, the activation arms that are visible in the oral cavity can be removed, leaving the rigid devices in place submucosally. At this point, there is nothing visible to the patient intraorally during the consolidation phase, and while healing of the bone is occurring, the device is typically left in place for 4-6 months postoperatively, although the consolidation period may be shorter in the 3- to 4-month period, as with external devices. After

consolidation, local anesthesia can be used to remove the bone plates and distraction devices intraorally, although, in some cases, bone may have healed over the plates, requiring a more aggressive approach for removal in an operating room setting. In most situations, by allowing additional time for consolidation with the distraction device in place, the patient usually avoids the need for a reverse-pull headgear in the post-DO period. Again, standard plates and screws may be used for additional stabilization when the buried DO devices are removed. If mandibular surgery is required for either internal or external distraction, it can be accomplished at the time of the initial surgery so that the mandible can be placed in any required position. Once the rigid fixation is accomplished in the mandible, the final splint is placed and the maxilla is distracted into the newly repositioned mandible.

During cleft orthognathic surgery, whether it is by traditional Le Fort techniques or DO, closure of fistulae should be accomplished, whether they are palatal in nature or in the area of the alveolar cleft. Incisions should be made to account for the closure of the fistula.

Careful attention should be made for manipulation of the nasal mucosa and closure with placement of a resorbable membrane in the area, and/or bone grafting, and then closure of the oral mucosa as a three-layer closure technique. If there is a significant bony defect in the alveolar cleft region or the piriform region, this should be augmented with bone, using the options discussed previously.

# 69.2 Postsurgical Considerations

If at any time there is an early sign of relapse of the maxilla in the postoperative period, reverse-pull head-gear should be applied along with vertical and class III elastics to help maintain the position of the maxilla in the healing phase and limit the amount of relapse. Patients and families must understand that there will be a secondary procedure to remove hardware, which may require general anesthesia in a hospital setting. The orthodontist provides a critical role in the postoperative management of these patients.

# 69.2.1 Velopharyngeal Considerations

It is possible for the cleft patient who has no VPI to develop VPI after maxillary advancement surgery. This is especially true in the cleft patient who has not had any form of pharyngeal flap for correction of speech problems [17]. Occasionally, it is necessary to section the pharyngeal flap to achieve the desired maxillary advancement; this may cause worsened hypernasality and should be discussed with patients and parents before maxillary surgical advancement. Although the literature is mixed, maxillary DO in the cleft patient has been reported to result in unchanged velopharyngeal function most commonly. Many studies have shown no difference in worsening of hypernasality when comparing Le Fort to maxillary DO in the cleft patient. It should be remembered that worsening of hypernasality after maxillary surgery in the cleft patient, with or without DO, ranges from  $6\%$  to  $17\%$ , and in similar reports,  $70\%$  of children had an improvement in articulation after maxillary anterior repositioning [14]. Perhaps the most appropriate way to consider the effect of maxillary surgery on VPI is to classify the preoperative VPI status into mild, moderate, and severe. Maxillary advancement, with or without DO, may cause a worsening of one level, such that a mild VPI may progress to a moderate VPI that is well tolerated, whereas a severe VPI is certainly unlikely to change with maxillary surgery, and a pharyngeal flap may be required for correction. The concerning VPI status is the moderate VPI patient that may be tolerated presurgically, but may become a severe VPI with significant symptoms postsurgically. This group should be the focus of future research in the area of VPI effects of Le Fort versus DO surgery in the cleft patient.
