# Learning Aims

This chapter focuses on the genetic basis and common issues associated with the management of craniofacial dysostosis syndromes (CFD). The reader should gain an appreciation for the importance of maintaining normal visceral organ function, the critical nature of staged reconstruction, and an appreciation of the nuances of treatment between the major forms of CFD.

# 49.1 Introduction

Cranial vault sutures are a form of bone articulation in which the margins of the bones are connected by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. The cranial vault is composed of six major sutural areas and several minor sutures, which serve two critical functions during the postnatal period. Initially, the sutures allow head deformation during vaginal delivery. Later, during an infant's postnatal development, cranial vault sutures facilitate head expansion to accommodate propulsive brain growth [1]. Only small amounts of pressure  $(5\mathrm{mmHg})$  from the growing brain are required to stimulate bone deposition at the margins of a cranial bone [2, 3]. Under normal conditions, the brain volume will triple within the first year of life, and by age 2 years, the cranial volume is four times that at birth [4]. Normally, closure of the cranial vault sutures occurs earlier than closure of the membranous facial bone sutures, which often remain patent until adulthood.

The term craniosynostosis is defined as a premature fusion of a cranial vault suture. With rare exception, this is an intrauterine event. A more accurate description of craniosynostosis may be a congenital absence of the cranial vault sutures. The result is fusion of the bones adjacent to the suture and arrested sutural growth of the adjacent bones. The classic theory known as Virchow's law states that premature fusion of a cranial vault suture results in limited development of the skull perpendicular to the fused suture and a compensatory "overgrowth" through the sutures that remain open [5]. The result is a dysmorphology with characteristics depending on the sutures affected and potential neurologic consequences related to underlying brain compression. Most forms of craniosynostosis represent nonsyndromic malformations limited to the cranial vault and orbital regions. Management typically requires a combined neurosurgical and craniofacial approach for release of the involved suture and reshaping of the dysmorphic skeletal components. Discussion of the management of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is beyond the scope of this chapter. Craniofacial dysostosis (CFD) is the term applied to syndromal forms of craniosynostosis. These disorders

are characterized by sutural involvement that not only includes the cranial vault but also extends into the skull base and midfacial skeletal structures. CFD syndromes have been described by Carpenter, Apert, Crouzon, Saethre-Chotzen, and Pfeiffer [6]. Although the cranial vault and cranial base are thought to be the regions of primary involvement, there is also significant impact on midfacial growth and development [7, 8]. In addition to cranial vault dysmorphology, patients with these inherited conditions exhibit a characteristic "total midface" deficiency that is syndrome-specific and must be addressed as part of the staged reconstructive approach.

# 49.2 Genetic Aspects

FGFR-related CFD syndrome includes FGFR1-related craniosynostosis (Pfeiffer syndrome types 1, 2, and 3); FGFR2-related craniosynostosis (Apert syndrome; Beare-Stevenson syndrome; Crouzon syndrome; FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis; Jackson-Weiss syndrome; Pfeiffer syndrome types 1, 2, and 3); and FGFR3-related craniosynostosis (Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, FGFR3-related isolated coronal synostosis, and Muenke syndrome).

The eight disorders considered as part of the FGFR-related craniosynostosis spectrum are Pfeiffer syndrome, Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Beare-Stevenson syndrome, FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and Muenke syndrome. All but Muenke syndrome and FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis generally present with bicornal synostosis or cloverleaf skull anomaly.

The diagnosis of Muenke syndrome (FGFR3-related coronal synostosis) is based on identification of a disease-causing mutation in the FGFR3 gene. The diagnosis of FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis is based on identification of a disease-causing mutation in the FGFR2 gene. The diagnosis of the other six FGFR-related craniosynostoses is based on clinical findings; however, molecular genetic testing of the FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 genes may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of these syndromes in questionable cases.

FGFR-related craniosynostosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Affected individuals have a  $50\%$  chance of passing the mutant gene to each child. Prenatal testing is available; however, its use is limited by poor predictive value. Molecular testing is necessary to establish the diagnosis for two of the disorders, Muenke syndrome and FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis. Individuals with Muenke syndrome may have unilateral coronal synostosis or megalencephaly without

craniosynostosis: The accurate diagnosis depends upon identification of a disease-causing mutation in the FGFR3 gene. FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis is characterized only by uni- or biconoral craniosynostosis: The accurate diagnosis depends upon identification of a disease-causing mutation in the FGFR2 gene.

# 49.3 Functional Considerations

# 49.3.1 Brain Growth and Intracranial Pressure

If the rapid brain growth that normally occurs during infancy is to proceed unhindered, the cranial vault and base sutures must remain open and expand during phases of rapid growth, resulting in marginal ossification. In craniosynostosis, premature fusion of sutures causes limited and abnormal skeletal expansion in the presence of continued brain growth. Depending on the number and location of prematurely fused sutures, the growth of the brain may be restricted [2, 9-11]. In addition, abnormal cranial vault and midfacial morphology occurs as determined by Virchow's law. If surgical release of the affected sutures and reshaping to restore a more normal intracranial volume and configuration are not performed, decreased cognitive and behavioral function is likely to be the end result.

Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is the most serious functional problem associated with premature suture fusion. A "beaten-copper" appearance along the inner table of the cranial vault seen on a plain radiograph or the loss of brain cisternae as observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan may suggest elevated ICP [12], but these are considered soft radiographic findings.

Intracranial hypertension can be established invasively by means of a burr hole craniotomy used to place either an epidural or an intraparenchymal pressure sensor. Increased ICP is most likely to affect individuals with great disparity between brain growth and intracranial capacity and may occur in as many as  $42\%$  of untreated children in whom more than one suture is affected [2, 10, 13]. Unfortunately, there is no absolute agreement on what levels of ICP are normal at any given age in infancy and early childhood.

The clinical signs and symptoms related to elevated ICP may have a slow onset and be difficult to recognize in the pediatric population. Although standardized CT scans allow for indirect measurement of intracranial volume, it is not yet possible to use these studies to make

judgments as to who requires craniotomy for decompression [14, 15]. Careful neurosurgical and pediatric ophthalmologic evaluations are critical components of the data gathering required to formulate a definitive treatment plan in a patient with craniosynostosis.

# 49.3.2Vision

Untreated craniosynostosis with elevated ICP will cause papilledema and eventual optic nerve atrophy, resulting in partial or complete blindness. If the orbits are shallow (exorbitism) and the eyes are proptotic (exophthalmos), as occurs in the CFD syndromes, the cornea may be exposed and abrasions or ulcerations may occur. An eye extending outside of a shallow orbit is also at risk of trauma. If the orbits are extremely shallow, herniation of the globe itself may occur, necessitating emergency reduction followed by partial tarsorrhaphies or urgent orbital decompression.

Some forms of CFD result in a marked degree of orbital hypertelorism, which may compromise visual acuity and restrict binocular vision. Divergent or convergent nonparalytic strabismus or exotropia occurs frequently and should be considered during the diagnostic evaluation. This may be the result of congenital anomalies of the extraocular muscles themselves. Paralytic or nonparalytic unilateral or bilateral upper eyelid ptosis also occurs with greater frequency with CFD than in the general population.

# 49.3.3 Hydrocephalus

Hydrocephalus affects as many as  $10\%$  of patients with a CFD syndrome [16-19]. Although the etiology is often not clear, hydrocephalus may be secondary to a generalized cranial base stenosis with constriction of all the cranial base foramina, which affects the patient's cerebral venous drainage and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics. Hydrocephalus may be identified with the help of CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to document progressively enlarging ventricles. Difficulty exists in interpreting ventricular findings as seen on a CT scan especially when the skull and cranial base are brachycephalic. The skeletal dysmorphology seen in a child with severe cranial dysmorphology related to craniosynostosis may translate into an abnormal ventricular shape that is not necessarily related to abnormal CSF flow. Serial imaging and clinical correlation is indicated, and a great deal of clinical judgment is often required in making these assessments.

# 49.3.4Effects of Midface Deficiency on Airway

All newborn infants are obligate nasal breathers. Many infants born with a CFD syndrome have moderate to severe hypoplasia of the midface as a component of their malformation. They will have diminished nasal and nasopharyngeal spaces with resulting increased nasal airway resistance (obstruction). The affected child is thus forced to breathe through the mouth. For a newborn infant to ingest food through the mouth requires sucking from a nipple to achieve negative pressure as well as an intact swallowing mechanism. The neonate with severe midface hypoplasia will experience diminished nasal airflow and be unable to accomplish this task and breathe through the nose at the same time [20-23]. Complicating this clinical picture may be an elongated and ptotic palate and enlarged tonsils and adenoids. The compromised infant expends significant energy respiration, and this may push the child into a catabolic state (negative nitrogen balance). Failure to thrive results unless either nasogastric tube feeding is instituted or a feeding gastrostomy is placed. Evaluation by a pediatrician, pediatric otolaryngologist, and feeding specialist with craniofacial experience can help distinguish minor feeding difficulties from those requiring more aggressive treatment.

Sleep apnea of either central or obstructive origin may also be present. If the apnea is found to be secondary to upper airway obstruction based on a formal sleep study, a tracheostomy may be indicated. In rare situations, "early" midface advancement is useful to improve the airway and allow for tracheostomy decannulation. Central apnea may occur from poorly treated intracranial hypertension and other contributing factors. If this is the case, the condition may improve by reducing the ICP to a normal range through cranio-orbital or posterior cranial vault decompression or expansion.

The literature confirms that as many as  $50\%$  of children with Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndrome develop obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during the first 6 years of life [24, 25]. Documented OSA in a child with CFD is frequently treated with tracheostomy. It may also be treated by adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, midface advancement, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). If left untreated or ineffectively treated, OSA will result in disabilities ranging from failure to thrive; recurrent upper respiratory infection; cognitive dysfunction; developmental delay; cor pulmonale; or sudden death [26]. Overwhelmingly, the documented midface hypoplasia in many CFD children is a primary cause of OSA. If feasible, effective surgical midface advancement is the preferred biologic treatment approach.

Clinical symptoms of OSA will include heavy snoring, difficulty in awake breathing, observed apnea during sleep, excessive perspiration during sleep, and daytime somnolence. Polysomnography remains the gold standard for diagnosis. In the pediatric population, apnea, defined as absence of air flow for more than two breadths, and hypopnea, defined as a reduction of greater than or equal to  $50\%$  of nasal flow signal amplitude of more than two breadths, define OSA syndrome. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the number of obstructive apneas in combination with hypopneas (followed by desaturation) per hour. The oxygenation-desaturation index (ODI) is the number of desaturations  $(\geq 4\%)$  decrease with respect to the baseline) per hour. A score of less than 1.0 is considered normal. Definition of the severity of the condition in children includes between 1 and 5 events as mild OSA; 6 to 25 as moderate OSA; and greater than 25 events as severe OSA. In the child with CFD and moderate to severe midface deficiency who is documented to have OSA, neither tonsillectomy nor adenoidectomy generally provides sufficient opening of the upper airway.

Ishii and coworkers [27] used lateral cephalometric radiographs to evaluate the nasopharyngeal airway after Le Fort III advancement in Apert and Crouzon syndrome individuals with OSA. They were able to document improvement in the nasopharyngeal airway in the study patients after successful midface advancement surgery.

Arnaud and colleagues [28, 29] completed studies to review respiratory improvement in CFD patients suffering with OSA that underwent monobloc advancement (DO approach). Fourteen of the 16 study patients  $(88\%)$  showed improvement as measured by oxygen level during sleep. Tracheostomy removal was possible in 4 of 6 study patients. In one of the patients, a tracheostomy was required 6 months after midface advancement due to recurrent severe OSA.

Witherow and colleagues [30] found a significant improvement in OSA in all patients diagnosed with CFD (Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer) as documented by polysomnography at 24 months after undergoing monobloc advancement (distraction osteogenesis approach). Before monobloc advancement, 14 of their patients had severe OSA with either tracheostomy or the use of CPAP in place. For the study patients undergoing monobloc advancement, only  $43\%$  (6/14) had resolution of their OSA. Unfortunately, 8 of the 14 patients  $(57\%)$  remained dependent on tracheostomy or CPAP despite the monobloc advancement procedure.

Nelson and associates [31] studied 18 CFD individuals, all presenting with bilateral coronal synostosis and midface deficiency. In 15 of 18 patients  $(83\%)$ , either tracheostomy or CPAP was required for treatment of OSA

before midface advancement. After the midface advancement procedures, 5 of the tracheostomy patients were decannulated, and in 6, CPAP was no longer required  $(11/15 = 73\%)$ . The mean postsurgical follow-up was 3 years.

In the CFD patient undergoing midface advancement, the lack of universal success in the relief of OSA could be for a combination of reasons including inadequate midface advancement, midface relapse after initial advancement, other anatomic factors not addressed by the midface advancement (septum, turbinates, soft palate, tonsils, adenoids, mandible, tracheomalacia), a central sleep apnea component, or inadequate (abnormal) contraction forces of the pharyngeal dilator muscles during sleep. In CFD, not only is the anatomy of the upper airway different for each syndrome, but a wide variation of deformity is also seen within each syndrome. Differences in the soft tissues and the quality of the pharyngeal muscles compared with normal may be attributed to a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) [32]. CFD patients with OSA who are nonresponders to an effective midface advancement may have pharyngeal wall collapse due to poor pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleeping. Whereas a tendency for airway collapse can be overcome through midface advancement, the individual must also have sufficient ability to control/contract (maintain tone) of the pharyngeal muscles while asleep.

It would appear that in some CFD individuals (Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer syndromes) despite effective midface advancement (Le Fort III/monobloc/facial bipartition), the long-term dependence on tracheostomy or CPAP for resistant OSA should be anticipated. In patients with persistent OSA despite optimal maxillofacial skeletal morphology, airway collapse due to inadequate pharyngeal muscle tone appears to play a role.

# 49.3.5Dentition and Occlusion

The incidence of dental and oral anomalies is higher among children with CFD syndromes than in the general population. In Apert syndrome in particular, the palate is high and constricted in width. The incidence of isolated cleft palate in patients with Apert syndrome approaches  $30\%$  [13]. Clefting of the secondary palate may be submucous, incomplete, or complete. Confusion has arisen over whether the oral malformations and absence of teeth that are often characteristic of these conditions are a result of congenital or iatrogenic factors (e.g., injury to dental follicles associated with early midface surgery). The midfacial hypoplasia seen in the CFD syndromes often results in limited maxillary alveolar bone to house a full complement of teeth. The result is severe crowding, which often requires serial extrac

tions in order to address the problem. An Angle class III skeletal relationship in combination with anterior openbite deformity is typical.

# 49.3.6 Hearing

Hearing deficits are more common among patients with the CFD syndromes than in the general population [24]. In Crouzon syndrome, conductive hearing deficits are common, and atresia of the external auditory canals may also occur. Otitis media is more common in Apert syndrome, although the exact incidence is unknown. Middle ear disease may be related to the presence of a cleft palate that results in Eustachian tube dysfunction. Congenital fixation of the stapedial footplate is also believed to be frequent. The possibility of significant hearing loss is paramount in importance and should not be overlooked because of preoccupation with other, more easily appreciated craniofacial findings.

# 49.3.7 Extremity Anomalies

Apert syndrome results in joint fusion and bony and soft tissue syndactyly of the digits of all four limbs [24]. These Apert-associated extremity deformities are often symmetrical. Partial or complete fusion of the shoulder, elbow, or other joints is common. Broad thumbs, broad great toes, and partial soft tissue syndactyly of the hands may be seen in Pfeiffer syndrome, but these are variable features. Preaxial polys syndactyly of the feet may also be seen in Carpenter syndrome.

# 49.4 Morphologic Considerations

Examination of the patient's entire craniofacial region should be meticulous and systematic. The skeleton and soft tissues are assessed in a standard way to identify all normal and abnormal anatomy. Specific findings tend to occur in particular malformations, but each patient is unique. The achievement of symmetry and normal proportions and the reconstruction of specific aesthetic units are essential to forming an unobtrusive face in a child born with a CFD syndrome.

# 49.4.1Frontoforehead Aesthetic Unit

The frontoforehead region is dysmorphic in an infant with CFD [25-30]. Establishing normal position of the forehead is critical to overall facial symmetry and balance. The forehead may be considered as two separate aesthetic components: the supraorbital ridge-lateral

![](images/c973ebb32ca9de55e612dc77870aa04a5b28b6c5bd6f6082208567b7b2af9b9d.jpg)

orbital rim region and the superior forehead (Fig. 49.1) [31, 32]. The supraorbital ridge-lateral orbital rim region includes the glabella and supraorbital rim extending inferiorly down each frontozygog

matic suture toward the infraorbital rim and posteriorly along each temporoparietal region. The morphology and position of the supraorbital ridge-lateral orbital rim region is a key element of upper facial aesthetics. In

a normal forehead, at the level of the frontonasal suture, an angle ranging from  $90^{\circ}$  to  $110^{\circ}$  is formed by the supraorbital ridge and the nasal bones when viewed in profile. In addition, the eyebrows, overlying the supraorbital ridge, should be anterior to the cornea. When the supraorbital ridge is viewed from above, the rim should arc posteriorly to achieve a gentle  $90^{\circ}$  angle at the temporal fossa with a center point of the arc at the level of each frontozygomatic suture. The superior forehead component, approximately  $1.0 - 1.5\mathrm{cm}$  up from the supraorbital rim, should have a gentle posterior curve of about  $60^{\circ}$ , leveling out at the coronal suture region when seen in profile.

# 49.4.2Posterior Cranial Vault Aesthetic Unit

Symmetry, form, and the appropriate intracranial volume of the posterior cranial vault are closely linked. Posterior cranial vault flattening may result from either a unilateral or a bilateral lambdoidal synostosis, which is rare; previous craniectomy with reossification in a dysmorphic flat shape, which is frequent; or postural molding because of repetitive sleep positioning [33]. A short anterior-posterior cephalic length may be misinterpreted as an anterior cranial vault (forehead) problem when the occipitoparietal (posterior) skull represents the primary region of the deformity. Careful examination of the entire cranial vault is essential to defining the dysmorphic region so that appropriate therapy may be carried out.

# 49.4.3Orbitonasozygomatic Aesthetic Unit

In CFD syndromes, the orbitonasozygomatic regional deformity is a reflection of the cranial base malformation. For example, in Crouzon syndrome when bilateral coronal suture synostosis is combined with skull base and midfacial deficiency, the orbitonasozygomatic region will be dysmorphic and consistent with a short (anteroposterior) and wide (transverse) anterior cranial base [34]. In Apert syndrome, the nasal bones, orbits, and zygomas, like the anterior cranial base, are transversely wide and horizontally short (retruded), resulting in a shallow hyperteloric upper midface (zygomas, orbits, and nose) [34]. Advancing the midface without simultaneously addressing the increased transverse width will not adequately correct the dysmorphology [35].

# 49.4.4Maxillary-Nasal Base Aesthetic Unit

In the CFD patient with midface deficiency, the upper anterior face (nasion to maxillary incisor) is vertically short, and there is a lack of horizontal anteroposterior projection of the midface [36, 37]. These findings may be confirmed with cephalometric analysis that indicates a sella-nasion angle (SNA) below the mean value and a short upper anterior facial height (nasion to anterior nasal spine). The width of the maxilla in the dentoalveolar region is generally constricted with a high-arched palate. In order to normalize the maxillonasal base region, multidirectional surgical expansion and reshaping are generally required. The maxillary lip-to-tooth relationship and occlusion are normalized through Le Fort I osteotomy and orthodontic treatment as part of the staged reconstruction.

# 49.4.5 Quantitative Assessment

A quantitative analysis of measurements taken from CT scans, surface anthropometry, cephalometric analysis, and dental casts is critical to data gathering for evaluation of craniofacial deformities [38-43]. This analysis will confirm or refute clinical impressions, aid in the treatment planning of intraoperative skeletal movements and reshaping, and provide a framework for objective assessment of immediate and long-term results. These methods of assessment rely on the measurement of linear distances, angles, and proportions based on accurate, reliable, and reproducible anatomic landmarks found to be useful for patient evaluation.

# 49.4.6CT Scan Analysis

The use of CT scans has clarified our appreciation of the dysmorphology of a child born with a craniofacial malformation [44, 45]. Accurate standardized points of reference have been identified in the cranio-orbitozygomatic skeleton based on axial CT images [42, 43]. Knowledge of differential facial bone growth patterns and normal measurement values can now be used to improve diagnostic accuracy, assist in the staging of reconstruction by understanding growth vectors, and offer the option of making intraoperative measurements that correlate with the preoperative CT scan measurements and ideal dimensions. This information can effectively guide the surgeon in the recon

struction of an individual with a craniofacial malformation and also allows for accurate postoperative reassessment.

# 49.4.7 Anthropometric Surface Measurements

Cross-sectional studies of the patterns of postnatal facial growth based on anthropometric surface measurements have been carried out in growing white children [38-41, 46]. This published material has proved useful in the quantitative evaluation and recognition of discrepancies in postnatal development in the head and face of patients with specific craniofacial syndromes. This is particularly useful when evaluating basic distances, angles, and proportions of the head, face, and orbits in patients affected with CFD syndromes.

# 49.4.8Cephalometric Analysis

Cephalometric radiography, first introduced by Broadbent in 1931, has been traditionally used to study the morphology and patterns of growth of the maxillofacial skeleton [47]. The large collection of normative data developed allows clinicians to monitor an individual's facial growth. The interpretation of cephalometric radiographs remains useful in the analysis of facial heights and maxillary, mandibular, and chin positions and their relationships to one another, the cranial base, and the dentition [30, 36, 48, 49]. The lateral cephalometric radiograph offers an accurate view from the midsagittal plane if the facial skeleton being analyzed is relatively symmetrical. Unfortunately, the number of anatomic landmarks that can be identified accurately in the cranio-orbitozygomatic region is limited because of the overlap of structures, which makes predictably locating these anatomic landmarks more difficult.

# 49.5 Surgical Management

# 49.5.1 Historical Perspectives

As early as 1890, Lanelongue [50] and then Lane [51] reported a surgical approach to the treatment of craniosynostosis. Lanelongue's aim was to remove the fused suture (strip craniectomy) in the hopes of controlling the problem of brain compression within a congenitally small cranial vault. By the turn of the century, Harvey Cushing, the most prominent neurosurgeon of his day, suggested that surgical intervention for the problem of craniosynostosis was misdirected and that more attenuated

tion should instead be given to the schooling of these children. Schillito disagreed with Cushing and enthusiastically supported the concept of surgical intervention to improve the outlook for these children. He believed that the linear "strip" craniectomy of the fused sutures would "release" the skull and allow the cranium to reshape itself and continue to grow in a normal and symmetrical fashion [52]. The strip craniectomy procedures were supposed to allow for a new suture line at the site of the previous synostosis. With the realization that this goal was not biologically feasible, attempts were made to remove portions of the cranial vault surgically and to either leave large open areas or use the removed segments as free grafts to refashion the cranial vault shape. Problems with these methods included uncontrolled postoperative skull molding, reossification into dysmorphic configurations, and the occurrence of large residual skull defects.

The concept of simultaneous release of the fused suture combined with more meticulous cranial vault reshaping carried out in infants was initially suggested by Rougerie and coworkers [53] and then refined by Hoffman and Mohr in 1976 [54] for children born with unilateral coronal synostosis. Whitaker and colleagues [55] proposed a more formal anterior cranial vault and orbital reshaping procedure for unilateral coronal synostosis in 1977. Marchac and associates [41] published their experience with a "floating forehead" technique for simultaneous unilateral coronal and bilateral coronal suture release and forehead and upper orbital osteotomies with advancement to manage craniosynostosis in infancy. Unfortunately, the "floating forehead" technique resulted in unpredictable reossification of the open cranial vault areas. In addition, bitemporal constrictions or bulging and vertex of the skull concavities or bulging were frequent developments as reossification occurred. In any case, the hope for midface growth did not materialize.

In the 1950s, Gillies and Harrison [56] reported experience with an extracranial Le Fort III "type" osteotomy to improve the anterior projection of the midface in an adult with Crouzon syndrome. The initial Gillies procedure was actually carried out in 1942. He mobilized the midface by a variety of osteotomies preformed through skin excisions directly over each osteotomy site. The midface was mobilized and advanced and intermaxillary fixation (IMF) applied. After removal of the IMF (2 weeks after the operation), the metal cast cap (dental) splint was attached to a plaster head cap, which was maintained for 3 weeks. There is no evidence that Gillies and Harrison used any bone grafts in the surgical gaps created. The early enthusiasm for this technique later turned to discouragement when the patient's facial skeleton relapsed to its preoperative status. There was

relapse—both at the maxillary incisor level and of the eye proptosis.

Dr. Tessier was aware of Gillies' previous work and the accompanying difficulties. In 1967, Tessier [57] described a new (intracranial-cranial base) approach to the management of Crouzon syndrome. This work was first presented in France at a meeting in Montpelier in 1966 and the following year at the International Plastic Surgery Meeting in Rome. Tessier's landmark presentations and publications were the beginning of modern craniofacial surgery. To overcome the earlier problems encountered by Gillies and Harrison, Tessier developed an innovative basic surgical approach that included new locations for the Le Fort III osteotomy, a combined intracranial-extracranial (cranial base) approach, use of a coronal (skin) incision to expose the upper facial bones, and use of fresh autogenous bone graft. He also applied an external fixation device to help maintain bony stability until healing had occurred.

In 1971, Tessier [58] described a single-stage frontofacial advancement in which the fronto-orbital bandeau was advanced as a separate element in conjunction with the Le Fort III complex below and the frontal bones above [57-66]. Seven years later, Ortiz-Monasterio and coworkers [67, 68] refined the "monobloc" osteotomy to advance the orbits and midface as one unit, combined with frontal bone (anterior cranial vault) repositioning to correct the upper and midface deformity of Crouzon syndrome. In 1979, Van der Meulen [69] described the "medial fasciotomy" for the correction of midline facial clefting. Van der Meulen split the monobloc osteotomy vertically in the midline, removed central nasal and ethmoid bone, and then moved the two halves of the facial skeleton together for correction of the orbital hypertelorism. To correct the midface dysplasia and associated orbital hypertelorism in Apert syndrome, Tessier refined the vertical splitting and reshaping of the midline split monobloc segments, thus correcting the midface deformity in three dimensions in a procedure now known as facial bipartition. More recently, Posnick and colleagues [70, 71] have independently documented the advantages of Tessier's facial bipartition technique for the correction of the Apert upper and midface deformity.

The widespread use of autogenous cranial bone grafting has virtually eliminated the need for rib and hip grafts when bone replacement is required in cranio-orbitozygomatic procedures. This represents another of Tessier's contributions to craniofacial surgery.

In 1968, Luhr [72] introduced the use of small metal (vitalium) plates and screws to stabilize maxillofacial fractures and then osteotomies. In current practice, the use of internal miniplate and microplate and screw (titanium) fixation (of various sizes) is the preferred form of

fixation when stability and three-dimensional craniomaxillofacial reconstruction of multiple osteotomized bone segments and grafts are required. In infants and young children, the stabilization of non-load-bearing osteotomy segments such as the cranial vault stabilization with resorbable materials is now generally preferred. This avoids issues or uncertainty concerning either growth restriction or brain trauma from retained hardware.

More recently, the intraoperative placement of a distraction device as a method of achieving advancement of the midface in patients with severe forms of craniofacial hypoplasia has been added to the surgeon's armamentarium [47]. If used, distraction osteogenesis is not applied until after successful completion of standard osteotomies and disimpaction in the operating room. The distraction apparatus is anchored to the "stable" skeleton either internally or externally (through a "halo" head frame) and then to the palatal (intraoral) and infraorbital rims or zygomatic buttresses. Advancement of the "total midface" can then proceed. Once adequate (midface) advancement has been accomplished (on an outpatient basis) over a period of several weeks, the patient is generally returned to the operating room for stabilization and final reconstruction. The final reconstruction may require additional segmental osteotomies, bone grafting, or placement of plate and screw fixation. The "distraction approach" to the midface deformity is a labor-intensive, technique-specific, and relatively crude method of accomplishing horizontal advancement with difficulty in controlling the vertical dimension of the midface and without the ability to alter the transverse deformity or deficiency. In our opinion, the current level of distraction technology leaves it an adjunctive rather than a primary technique. It is most useful when the midfacial hypoplasia is severe to the extent that conventional techniques cannot reliably allow the immediate (in the operating room) desired advancement and when complex vertical and transverse reconstruction is not required.

# 49.5.2Philosophy Regarding Timing of Intervention

In considering the timing and type of intervention, the experienced surgeon will take several biologic realities into account: the natural course of the malformation (i.e., is the dysmorphology associated with Crouzon syndrome progressively worsening or is it a nonprogressive craniofacial deformity?), the tendency toward growth restriction of an operated bone (aesthetic unit) that has not yet reached maturity (i.e., we know that operating on a palate of a child born with a cleft in infancy will cause

scarring and later result in maxillary hypoplasia in a significant percentage of individuals), and the uncertain relationship between the underlying growing viscera (i.e., brain or eyes) and the congenially affected and surgically altered skeleton (i.e., if the cranial vault is not surgically expanded by 1 year of life in a patient with multiple suture synostosis, will brain compression occur?).

In attempting to limit functional impairment and also achieve long-term ideal facial aesthetics, an essential question the surgeon must ask is, "During the course of craniofacial development, does the operated-on facial skeletal of the child with CFD tend to grow abnormally, resulting in further distortions and dysmorphology or are the initial positive skeletal changes (achieved at operation) maintained during ongoing growth?" Unfortunately, the theory that craniofacial procedures carried out early in infancy will "unlock growth" has not been documented through the scientific method [52, 56, 57].

# 49.5.3Incision Placement

For exposure of the craniofacial skeleton above the Le Fort I level, the approach used is the postauricular coronal scalp flap. This allows for a relatively camouflaged access to the anterior and posterior cranial vault, orbits, nasal dorsum, zygomas, upper maxilla, pterygoid fossa, and temporomandibular joints. For added cosmetic advantage, placement of the coronal incision more posteriorly on the scalp and with postauricular rather than preauricular extensions is useful. When exposure of the maxilla at the Le Fort I level is required, a circumvestibular maxillary intraoral incision is used. Unless complications occur that warrant unusual exposure, no other incisions are required for managing any aspect of the CFD patient's reconstruction. These incisions (coronal [scalp] and maxillary [circumvestibular]) may be reopened as needed to further complete the patient's staged reconstruction.

# 49.5.4 Management of Cranial Vault Dead Space

Cranial reshaping in the CFD patient provides space for the compressed brain to expand into. Unfortunately, after anterior cranial vault expansion and monobloc advancement, an immediate extradural (retrofrontal) dead space is combined with the osteotomy-created gap across the skull base (connecting the anterior cranial fossa and the nasal cavity). This combination of factors may complicate the postoperative recovery (e.g., CSF leakage, infection, bone loss, fistula formation). After

frontofacial advancement, the nasal cavity-cranial fossa communication is managed by being gentle to the tissues; good hemostasis; effective repair of any dural tears (dural grafting as needed); complete separation of dural and nasal mucosal tissue planes by interposing a combination of bone grafts, tissue sealants, and flaps; avoidance of pressure gradients across the opening while the nasal mucosa is healing; and prevention of "over-" or "under-" shunting (when a shunt is in place). The preferred way to manage the retrofrontal (lobes of the brain) dead space and the gap across the skull base osteotomy site (separating the cranial fossa and nasal cavities) after frontofacial advancement remains controversial, but all agree that it is a critical aspect of the reconstruction.

In the CFD patient, relatively rapid (6-8 weeks) filling of the surgically expanded intracranial volume by the previously compressed frontal lobes of the brain has been documented after cranio-orbital expansion in infants. It has also been shown to occur after frontofacial advancement in children and young adults when the volume increase remains in a physiologic range. These observations support the conservative management of the retrofrontal dead space in younger patients. More gradual and less complete filling of the space is thought to occur in older children and adults. If so, this may be particularly troublesome when the anterior cranial fossa dead space communicates directly with the nasal cavity (i.e., monobloc advancement, facial bipartition, intracranial Le Fort III) across the (open-gap) skull base interface. When feasible, closing off (sealing) the nasal cavity from the cranial fossa across the skull base osteotomy at the time of operation is preferred. Insertion of a pericranial flap or other fillers can help to separate the cavities. The use of fibrin glue to seal the anterior cranial base provides a temporary separation between the cavities, allowing time for the reepithelialization (healing) of the torn nasal mucosa. To reconstruct the defect across the skull base, (gap) bone grafts of various types have also been used. Until the torn nasal mucosa heals, potential communication between the nasal cavity and the cranial fossa may result in the transfer of air, fluid, bacteria, and nasocranial fistula formation. To facilitate nasal mucosa healing and limit a pressure gradient across the communication, postoperative endotracheal intubation may be extended for 3-5 days and/or bilateral nasopharyngeal airways may be placed after extubation. The avoidance of positive-pressure ventilation, enforcement of sinus precautions, and restriction of nose blowing further limit reflux of air, fluid, and bacteria (nose to cranial fossa) during the early postoperative period. When anterior cranial vault procedures are performed and aerated frontal sinuses are present, management is by either cranialization or obliteration.

Aside from a learning curve in mastering the technical skills of completing the monobloc osteotomies and disimpaction, the surgical morbidity from these procedures primarily results from a combination of the anticipated retrofrontal dead space, unavoidable tears in the nasal mucosa, and management of nasocranial communication across the skull base gap with the potential for fluid, air, and bacterial contamination. Two benchmark studies clarify these issues.

Posnick and associates [73] studied the issue of retrofrontal dead space, the communication across the skull base, nasal mucosal lacerations, and associated morbidity in a consecutive series of patients  $(N = 23)$  undergoing either monobloc or facial bipartition osteotomies combined with cranial expansion by a single surgeon (JCP) during a 4-year timeframe (1987-1991). The extradural (retrofrontal) dead space was measured from consistent CT scan images at specific postoperative intervals (immediate, 6-8 weeks, and 1 year). The study confirmed the presence of an immediate retrofrontal dead space that generally filled in with the expanding brain/dura by 6-8 weeks after surgery. Specific intraoperative measures were taken by the surgeon to close (seal) the nasofrontal communication using flaps, fibrin glue, and Gelfoam. Precautions to prevent a pressure gradient across the communication (repair of dural tears, sinus precautions, and nasal stinting) were meticulously adhered to with the objective of providing time for nasal mucosal healing. The infection rate in this study group was limited to 2 of 23 patients or  $9\%$ . In both patients who developed infection, a retrofrontal (extradural) fluid collection with drainage across the residual nasofrontal communication occurred. Both patients healed without major sequela but did require further reconstruction of resorbed portions of the cranial vault.

Wolfe [74] completed a critical analysis of 81 monobloc advancements carried out over a 27-year period. This was a retrospective chart analysis of a series of patients undergoing either monobloc (frontofacial) advancement (MFFA) or facial bipartition (MFFA plus FB). The procedures were carried out at seven different craniofacial centers and included 49 MFFAs and 32 MFFAs plus FBs. This included the techniques of osteotomy followed by placing the osteotomized units in their preferred location in the operating room (classic approach) and osteotomies carried out followed by distraction (buried versus external). There were significant complications in the distracted (DO) group and fewer in the nondistracted (classic osteotomy) group. Complications included 2 deaths (cardiac arrest in 1 patient and complications arising from hypovolemia in the other). One case was aborted owing to large volume blood loss; there were 3 infections/sequestrations; and 1

CSF leak (no meningitis). The authors concluded that the MMFA or MMFA plus FB provided a superior morphologic result to the Le Fort III advancement. All patients were believed to also require orthognathic surgery. Blood loss and operative time were equivalent for both classic and distraction procedures. The authors concluded that for the majority of patients, the classic approach offered improved morphologic results. The incidence of infection and CSF leaks was not diminished through the use of the distraction approach.

Bradley and coworkers [75] recently completed a single-center retrospective chart review study comparing differences in morbidity in a series of CFD patients undergoing combined cranial vault expansion and monobloc advancement for correction of the upper and middle face deformities/hypoplasia. They describe three different sequential treatment groups over a period of 23 years. Group I patients (1979-1989:  $N = 12$ ) underwent monobloc advancement without any special attention to the retrofrontal dead space or the communication through the skull base between the anterior cranial fossa and the nasal cavity. Group II (1989-1995:  $N = 11$ ) patients underwent varied attempts at closure of the skull base gap with pericranial flaps and fibrin glue. Group III (1995-2002:  $N = 24$ ) patients underwent monobloc osteotomies and disimpaction but without any immediate advancement. An internal distraction device was placed across the osteotomized zygoma on each side. After 7 days, the monobloc and forehead advancement was initiated at  $1\mathrm{mm/day}$  for approximately 2-4 weeks. The infection rate for group III patients was significantly lower (2 of 24 patients or  $8\%$ ) than for those in groups I and II. Neither of the two infections in group III resulted in bone loss. Not surprisingly, the group I patients had the greatest morbidity.

Advancement of the monobloc osteotomy in the CFD patient using the DO technique described by Bradley and coworkers [75] is likely to facilitate early nasal mucosa healing and thereby limit communication of fluid, air, and bacteria across the surgically created skull base gap. By allowing a 1-week delay in the actual advancement, the nasal mucosa may achieve sufficient healing to explain a drop in the infection rate from the  $9\%$  described by Posnick and associates [73] to the  $8\%$  described by Bradley and coworker's group III patients.

Bradley and coworkers [75] also describe a greater advancement in their group III (DO treatment) patients compared with their groups I and II patients. Confounding variables in their study may explain these differences including greater experience and improved surgical technique by the surgeons in the later years of their study (group III patients) and effect of comorbidities (e.g., high rate of infection in group I and group II patients that likely increased relapse and limited long

term advancement). More important, no correlation is shown by Bradley and coworkers [75] between a number of millimeters of advancement of the frontofacial osteotomies in the CFD patient and either greater functional gains or enhanced facial aesthetics. In fact, with a monobloc (frontofacial) osteotomy as much aesthetic damage is done by overadvancement (enophthalmos) as by underadvancement (residual eye proptosis). In addition, the achievement of a "normal" occlusion is rarely a treatment objective at the time of monobloc advancement. Accomplishing an ideal occlusion without creating enophthalmos requires a separate Le Fort I osteotomy to differentially advance the maxilla often combined with maxillary segmentation and mandibular (sagittal split) osteotomies. To achieve the most favorable facial balance for the CFD patient, an experienced clinician's aesthetic sense of the preferred morphology and focused technical expertise to alter the skeleton intraoperatively is essential. Several key technical aspects include the following:

1. The ability to remove, segment, and then reshape and stabilize (plates and screws) the anterior cranial vault.  
2. The ability to separate the orbits and midface as a unit (monobloc) from the skull base.  
3. The ability to further segment the monobloc (at the upper orbits) and reconstruct (with cranial grafts) as needed.  
4. The ability to separate the monobloc into halves (facial bipartition) and then alter the two facial halves to achieve the most favorable morphology. This often requires simultaneously increasing the maxillary transverse width and decreasing the upper face width to correct hypertelorism of the orbits, zygomas, nose, and bitemporal regions (e.g., Apert syndrome). Facial bipartition also provides the ability to correct transverse facial arc of rotation deformities. For example, changing the Apert syndrome patients' concave facial arc of rotation toward a normal convexity is an essential aspect of the reconstruction.

Any potential advantage of limiting morbidity due to infection across the skull base with the DO technique should be considered in light of limitations to achieve the previously mentioned key technical and aesthetic aspects (points 1-4). Added morbidity with the DO technique occurs: due to pin tract infection/scarring/loosening requiring reapplication; the need for device removal; and dependence on a patient's, family's, and clinician's continued commitment to staying the course for necessary outpatient DO procedures/adjustments to achieve an acceptable result must also be factored into the decision-making process.

When a CFD patient is to undergo intracranial volume expansion as part of the craniofacial procedure and they also require hydrocephalus management, the potential for morbidity increases. Complications may arise from excessive CSF drainage (overshunting). With "overshunting," there is decreased brain volume to fill any surgically created retrofrontal dead space. Frontofacial advancement and/or cranial vault expansion procedures should be carefully staged with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting procedures. We believe that the presence or absence of a VP shunt is not in itself a major risk factor in the success of a frontofacial advancement procedure. An important aspect is satisfactory physiologic function of the ventricular system. Ultimately, the decision regarding the need for and sequencing of shunting is based on the patient's neurologic findings and the neurosurgeon's judgment. In a patient with a VP shunt in place before the surgery, experienced neurosurgical evaluation including CT scanning of the ventricular system is carried out to confirm physiologic shunt function.

# 49.5.5 Soft Tissue Management

A layered closure of the coronal incision (galea and skin) optimizes healing and limits scar widening. Resuspension of the midface periosteum to the temporalis fascia in a superior and posterior direction facilitates redraping of the soft tissues. Each lateral canthus should be adequately suspended or reattached in a superoposterior direction to the lateral orbital rim. The use of chromic gut for closure of the scalp skin in children may be used to obviate the need for postoperative suture or staple removal.

# 49.6 Crouzon Syndrome

Crouzon syndrome is a frequent form of CFD. It is characterized by multiple anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Its manifestations are generally less severe than those of Apert syndrome, and there are no malformations of the extremities. Typically, the cranial vault presentation is premature synostosis of both coronal sutures with a resultant brachycephalic shape to the skull. Cranial vault suture involvement other than coronal may include sagittal, metopic, or lambdoidal, either in isolation or in any combination. The cranial base and upper face sutures are variably involved, resulting in a degree of midface hypoplasia with an Angle class III malocclusion. The orbits are hypoplastic, resulting in a degree of proptosis with additional orbital dystopia that

may produce a mild orbital hypertelorism and flatness to the (transverse) arc of rotation of the midface.

By clinical examination alone, it may be difficult to accurately separate nonsyndromic bilateral coronal synostosis from Crouzon syndrome, with its expected midface deficiency. It is now known that Crouzon syndrome is caused by multiple mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) gene, some of which are identical to those seen in Pfeiffer and Jackson-Weiss syndromes. It is likely that in the past many of these individuals have been misdiagnosed as having Crouzon syndrome. The  $5\%$  of individuals with Crouzon syndrome who have acanthosis nigricans (pigmentary changes in the skin fold regions) are said to have Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans. It can be present in the neonatal period or appear later. Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans has been described with a specific Ala391Glu mutation in FGFR3.

# 49.6.1 Primary Cranio-orbital Decompression: Reshaping in Infancy

The initial treatment for Crouzon syndrome generally requires bilateral coronal suture release and simultaneous anterior cranial vault and upper orbital osteotomies with reshaping and advancement (see Fig. 49.1) [63-66]. Our preference is to carry this out when the child is 9-11 months of age unless clear signs of increased ICP are identified earlier in life (Fig. 49.2). Reshaping of the upper three quarters of the orbital rims and supraorbital ridges is geared toward decreasing the bitemporal and anterior cranial base width, with simultaneous horizontal advancement to increase the anteroposterior dimension. This also increases the depth of the upper orbits, with some improvement of eye proptosis. The overlying forehead is then reconstructed according to morphologic needs. A degree of overcorrection is preferred at the level of the supraorbital ridge when the procedure is carried out in infancy. In our opinion, by allowing additional growth to occur (waiting until the child is 9-11 months old), the reconstructed cranial vault and upper orbital shape is better maintained with less need for repeat craniotomy procedures but without risking compression of the underlying brain.

The goals at this stage are to provide increased intracranial space in the anterior cranial vault for the brain; to increase the orbital volume, which allows the eyes to be positioned more normally for better protection from exposure; and to improve the morphology of the forehead and upper orbits.

A postauricular coronal (scalp) incision is made, and the anterior scalp flap is elevated along with the temporalis muscle in the subperiosteal plane. Bilateral circumferential periorbital dissection follows, with detachment of the lateral canthi, but with preservation of the medial canthi and nasolacrimal apparatus to the medial orbital walls. The subperiosteal dissection is continued down the lateral and infraorbital rims to include the anterior aspect of the maxilla and zygomatic buttress. The neurosurgeon then completes the craniotomy to remove the dysmorphic anterior cranial vault. With protection of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (remaining anterior to each olfactory bulb), safe direct visualization of the anterior cranial base and orbits is possible at the time of orbital osteotomies.

The orbital osteotomies are then completed across the orbital roof and superior aspect of the medial orbital walls, laterally through the lateral orbital walls and inferiorly just into the inferior orbital fissures. The three-quarter orbital osteotomy units, with their tenon extensions, are removed from the field. The orbital units are reshaped and reinset into a preferred position. Orbital depth is thereby increased, and global proptosis is reduced. Fixation is generally achieved with 28-gauge interosseous wires or suture at each infraorbital rim and with plates and titanium or resorbable screws at the tenon extensions and frontonasal regions.

The removed calvaria is cut into segments, which are placed individually to achieve a more normally configured anterior cranial vault. The goal of reshaping is to narrow the anterior cranial base and orbital width slightly and provide more forward projection and overall normal morphology.

# 49.6.2 Repeat Craniotomy for Additional Cranial Vault Expansion and Reshaping in Young Children

After the initial suture release, decompression, and reshaping are carried out during infancy, the child is observed clinically at intervals by the OMFS/craniofacial surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, pediatric ophthalmologist, and developmental specialist and undergoes interval CT scanning. Should signs of increased ICP develop, urgent brain decompression with cranial vault expansion and reshaping is performed [47]. When increased ICP is suspected, the location of brain compression influences for which region of the skull further expansion and reshaping is planned.

If the brain compression is judged to be anterior, then further anterior cranial vault and upper orbital

osteotomies with reshaping and advancement are carried out. The technique is similar to that described previously [47, 65]. If the problem is posterior compression, expansion of the posterior cranial vault, with the patient in the prone position, is required (Fig. 49.3).

The "repeat" craniotomy carried out for further decompression and reshaping in the child with Crouzon syndrome is often complicated by brittle cortical bone (which lacks a diploic space and contains sharp spicules piercing the dura), the presence of previously placed fixation devices in the operative field (e.g., Silastic sheeting, metal clips, stainless steel wires, plates, and screws), and convoluted thin dura compressed against (or herniated into) the inner table of the skull. All of these issues result in a greater potential for dural tears during the calvarectomy than would normally occur during the primary procedure. A greater potential for morbidity should be anticipated when re elevating the scalp flap, dissecting the dura free of the inner table of the skull and cranial base, and then removing the cranial vault bone.

# 49.6.3 Management of "Total Midface" Deformity in Childhood

The type of osteotomies selected to manage the "total midface" deficiency or deformity and residual cranial vault dysplasia should depend on the extent and location of the presenting dysmorphology rather than on a fixed approach to the midface malformation [47, 53-56, 65, 66, 72, 76, 77]. The selection of a monobloc (with or without additional orbital segmentation), facial bipartition (with or without additional orbital segmental osteotomies), or Le Fort III osteotomy to manage the basic horizontal, transverse, vertical orbital, and upper midface deficiencies or deformities in a patient with Crouzon syndrome depends on the patient's presenting midface and anterior cranial vault morphology. The observed dysmorphology is dependent on the original malformation, the previous procedures carried out, and the effects of ongoing growth (Figs. 49.4 and 49.5).

When evaluating the upper and midface in a child born with Crouzon syndrome, if the supraorbital ridge is in good position when viewed from the sagittal plane (the depth of the upper orbits is adequate), the midface and forehead have a normal arc of rotation in the transverse plane (not concave), and the root of the nose is of normal width (minimal orbital hypertelorism), there is little need to reconstruct this region (the forehead and upper orbits) any further. In such patients, the basic residual midface deformity is in the lower half of the orbits, zygomatic buttress, and maxilla. If so, the defor

mity may be effectively managed using an extracranial Le Fort III osteotomy.

If the supraorbital ridges, anterior cranial base, zygomas, nose, lower orbits, and maxilla all remain deficient in the sagittal plane (horizontal retrusion), a monobloc osteotomy is indicated (see Figs. 49.4 and 49.5). In these patients, the forehead is generally flat and retruded and will also require reshaping and advancement. If upper midface hypertelorism (increased transverse width) and midface flattening (horizontal retrusion) with loss of the normal facial curvature (concave arc) are also present, the monobloc unit is split vertically in the midline (facial bipartition), a wedge of interorbital (nasal and ethmoidal) bone is removed, and the orbits and zygomas are repositioned medially while the maxilla at the palatal level is widened. The facial bipartition is rarely required in Crouzon syndrome, but the monobloc is. When a monobloc or facial bipartition osteotomy is carried out as the "total midface" procedure, additional segmentation of the upper and lateral orbits for reconstruction may also be required to normalize the morphology of the orbital aesthetic units [78-83].

For most patients, a surgeon's attempt to simultaneously adjust the orbits and idealize the occlusion using the Le Fort III, monobloc, or facial bipartition osteotomy in isolation, without completing a separate Le Fort I osteotomy, is an error in judgment. The degree of horizontal deficiency observed at the orbits and maxillary dentition is rarely uniform. This further segmentation of the midface complex at the Le Fort I level is required to establish normal proportions. If a Le Fort I separation of the total midface complex is not carried out and the surgeon attempts to achieve a positive overbite and overjet at the incisor teeth, overadvancement of the orbits with enophthalmos will occur. The Le Fort I osteotomy is generally not performed at the time of the total midface procedure. This will await skeletal maturity and then be combined with orthodontic treatment. Until then, an Angle class III malocclusion will remain.

A major aesthetic problem specific to the Le Fort III osteotomy when its indications are less than ideal is the creation of irregular step-offs in the lateral orbital rims. This will occur when even a moderate (Le Fort III) advancement is carried out. These lateral orbital step-offs are unattractive and are visible to the casual observer at conversational distance. Surgical modification performed later is difficult, often with less than ideal aesthetic results. Another problem with the Le Fort III osteotomy is the difficulty in judging an ideal orbital depth. A frequent result is either residual proptosis or enophthalmos. Simultaneous correction of orbital hypertelorism or correction of a midface arc-of-rotation

His deformities are characterized by mild bilateral coronal and marked bilateral lambdoid synostosis in combination with midface deficiency. He has diminished intracranial volume, resulting in brain compression. The orbits are shallow with resulting eye proptosis, and the midface is deficient with malocclusion. He is shown before and after undergoing posterior cranial vault decompression and reshaping to expand the intracranial volume. He later underwent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for management of hydrocephalus. He will require a total midface advancement (monobloc) with further anterior cranial vault reshaping after 5 years of

problem is not possible with the Le Fort III procedure. Excessive lengthening of the nose, accompanied by flattening of the nasofrontal angle, will also occur if the Le Fort III osteotomy is selected when the skeletal morphology favors a monobloc or facial bipartition procedure. It is not possible to later correct the surgically created vertical elongation of the nose.

Final reconstruction, as discussed previously, of the cranial vault deformities and orbital dystopia in Crouzon syndrome can be managed in patients as young as 5-7 years of age [47]. By this age, the cranial vault and orbits normally attain approximately  $85 - 90\%$  of their adult size [43]. When the upper midface and final cranial

vault procedure is carried out at or after this age, the reconstructive objectives are to approximate adult dimensions in the cranio-orbitozygomatic region, with the expectation of a stable result (no longer influenced by growth) once healing has occurred (see Fig. 49.4). Psychosocial considerations also support the upper midface and final cranial vault procedure taking place in patients 5-7 years of age. When the procedure is carried out at this age, the child may enter the first grade with an opportunity for satisfactory self-esteem. Routine orthognathic surgery will be necessary at the time of skeletal maturity to achieve an ideal occlusion, facial profile, and smile.

# 49.6.4Orthognathic Procedures for Definitive Occlusal and Lower Facial Aesthetic Reconstruction

Although the mandible has a normal basic growth potential in Crouzon syndrome, the maxilla does not. An Angle class III malocclusion, resulting from maxillary retrusion, with anterior open-bite often results. A Le Fort I osteotomy to allow for horizontal advancement, transverse widening, and vertical adjustment is generally required in combination with an osteoplastic genioplasty (vertical reduction and horizontal advancement) to further correct the lower face deformity. Secondary deformities of the mandible should be simultaneously corrected through sagittal split ramus osteotomies. The elective orthognathic surgery is carried out in conjunction with orthodontic treatment planned for completion at the time of early skeletal maturity ( $\sim 13-15$  years in girls and 15-17 years in boys) (Fig. 49.6).

# 49.6.5 Assessment of Results in the Crouzon Patient

The purpose of a quantitative assessment of the craniofacial complex, whether by CT scan analysis, anthropometric measurement, cephalometric analysis, or dental model analysis, is to help predict growth patterns, confirm or refute clinical impressions, aid in treatment planning, and provide a framework for objective assessment of the immediate and long-term reconstructive results.

# 49.6.6 Quantitative Assessment of Presenting Crouzon's Deformity and Surgical Results Based on CT Scan Analysis After First-Stage Cranio-orbital Reconstruction

Waitzman and colleagues [84, 85] developed a method of analysis based on CT scan measurements that allows for a more quantitative assessment of the upper and midface skeleton in both the horizontal and the transverse planes than was previously available. This method of quantitative CT scan analysis was utilized to document the differences in the cranio-orbitozygomatic region between children with Crouzon syndrome who had not yet undergone reconstruction and age-matched controls. Morphologic results achieved in those children 1 year after undergoing a classic suture release and anterior cranial vault and upper orbital procedure, designed to decompress and reshape these regions, were also evaluated.

The preoperative CT scan measurements of the children with untreated Crouzon syndrome confirmed a widened anterior cranial vault at  $108\%$  of normal and a cranial length averaging only  $92\%$  of normal. In comparison with age-matched controls, orbital measurements revealed a widened anterior interorbital width at  $122\%$  of normal, an increased intertemporal width at  $121\%$  of normal, globe protrusion at  $119\%$  of normal, and a short medial orbital wall length at only  $86\%$  of normal. The distance between the zygomatic buttresses and the interarch widths were found to be increased at  $106\%$  and  $103\%$  of normal, respectively. The zygomatic arch lengths were substantially shortened at only  $87\%$  of the values of age-matched controls.

These findings confirmed clinical observations of brachycephalic anterior cranial vaults with shallow, frequently hyperteloric orbits and globe proptosis. Generally, the midface in Crouzon syndrome is horizontally retrusive and transversely wide, which is reflected in wide and shortened zygomas. The same quantitative CT scan assessment was carried out in the children with Crouzon syndrome more than 1 year after undergoing anterior cranial vault and upper orbital osteotomies with reshaping, to compare their values with the new age-matched control values; we were not able to demonstrate any significant improvement in the cranio-orbitozygomatic measurements.

# 49.6.7 Quantitative Intracranial Volume Measurements Before and After Cranio-orbital Reshaping in Children with Crouzon Syndrome

In a previous study, we documented the intracranial volumes in children with Crouzon syndrome before and after cranio-orbital reshaping procedures. The intracranial volumes also were compared with those of an age- and gender-matched cohort, and we also reviewed the rate of cranial expansion with growth [84, 85]. The study included 13 children who presented sequentially with Crouzon syndrome and who subsequently underwent a classic first-stage cranio-orbital reconstruction by the senior author (JCP) in conjunction with a pediatric neurosurgeon. The primary method of osteotomy and bone graft fixation varied (e.g., wires, microplates, miniplates, and screws). The average age at the time of operation was 13 months (range, 6-46 months). Postoperative clinical follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months at the time of the study's completion. Of the children with Crouzon syndrome who were evaluated preoperatively, 12 of 13 had intracranial volume values greater than the mean. When comparing postoperative volumes with the normative data, all 13 maintained volumes at or greater

Fig. 49.6 A 19-year-old boy born with Crouzon syndrome. When he was 11 years of age, the patient was seen by another surgeon and underwent a Le Fort osteotomy with advancement through an extracranial approach. He presented in his late teenage years with asymmetrical and dystopic orbits, zygomatic hypoplasia, a retrusive upper jaw, an asymmetrical lower jaw, and a long chin. He underwent a combined orthodontic and orthognathic approach, including a Le Fort I osteotomy (horizontal advancement), bilateral sagittal split osteotomies of the mandible (correction of asymmetry), and an osteoplastic genioplasty (vertical reduction and horizontal advancement). Stabilization was accomplished with miniplates and screws.

than the mean. Ten of the 13 achieved intracranial volumes equal to or greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean. When reviewing each Crouzon patient's cranial capacity over time, 5 of the 13 approximated the normal growth curve, whereas 6 of the 13 exceeded it. According to the findings of our study, for the majority of children born with Crouzon syndrome, the cranial capacity will exceed the mean early in life and expand at a rapid rate in conjunction with cranio-orbital decompression and reconstruction. The biologic explanation for these unexpected findings remains unclear. It should be noted that other researchers have studied the intracranial volume of children born with craniosynostosis. Conflicting data have been reported, and further investigation is needed.

# 49.6.8 Quantitative Assessment of Presenting Deformity in Children with Crouzon Syndrome and Surgical Results After Monobloc Osteotomy Based on CT Scan Analysis

In the mid-childhood years, a group of children with Crouzon syndrome were assessed using quantitative CT scan measurements. We found them to have cranial vault lengths averaging only  $87\%$  of the age-matched norms. The medial orbital walls were (horizontally) short at  $87\%$  of normal, whereas the extent of globe protrusion was excessive at  $134\%$  of age-matched norms. The zygomatic arch lengths averaged only  $84\%$  of normal. These findings confirmed horizontal (anteroposterior) deficiency of the upper and midface.

After undergoing a monobloc osteotomy (orbits and midface) combined with anterior cranial vault reshaping and advancement carried out through an intracranial approach, the children's cranio-orbitozygomatic measurements were taken again. The mean cranial length initially achieved (after monobloc osteotomy) was  $98\%$ , and at 1 year, it was  $92\%$  of the control value. When compared with age-matched controls, the orbital measurements reflected improvement in the midorbital hypertelorism (midinterorbital width was  $97\%$  initially after operation and  $102\%$  at 1 year) and orbital proptosis (early after surgery,  $86\%$  of values for age-matched normal children;  $92\%$  at 1 year). The medial orbital wall length initially normalized at  $101\%$  and later at  $97\%$  of normal values. The zygomatic arch length initially corrected at  $106\%$  and later to  $101\%$  of normal.

# 49.7 Apert Syndrome

Apert syndrome has previously been classified on the basis of its clinical findings [86]. Postmortem histologic and radiographic studies have confirmed that skeletal deficiencies in the patient with Apert syndrome result from a cartilage dysplasia at the cranial base, leading to premature fusion of the midline sutures from the occiput to the anterior nasal septum. Molecular genetic studies now clarify that two common mutations account for  $98\%$  of Apert syndrome: P253R and S252W [87]. These mutations occur in the identical location as the FGFR1 mutation in Pfeiffer syndrome and the FGFR3 mutation in Muenke syndrome. In addition, a component of the syndrome is four-limb complex syndactyly of the hands and feet. Fusion and malformation of other joints, including the elbows and shoulders, often occur. In Apert syndrome, fused cervical vertebrae  $(68\%)$ , usually C5-6, can occur. Hydrocephalus is less frequent than in Crouzon syndrome  $(2\%$  vs.  $10\%)$ . Occasional internal organ anomalies can occur. The integument (soft tissue envelope) also varies from that in Crouzon syndrome, with a greater downward slant to the lateral canthi and a distinctive, S-shaped upper eyelid ptosis. The quality of the skin often varies from normal with acne and hyperhidrosis being prominent features.

Apert syndrome has previously been classified on the basis of its clinical findings [88, 89]. Postmortem histologic and radiographic studies suggest that skeletal deficiencies in the patient with Apert syndrome result from a cartilage dysplasia at the cranial base, leading to premature fusion of the midline sutures from the occiput to the anterior nasal septum [73, 90-93]. In addition, a component of the syndrome is four-limb symmetry complex syndactylies of the hands and feet (Fig. 49.7). Fusion and malformation of other joints, including the elbows and shoulders, often occur.

These mutations occur in the identical location as the FGFR1 mutation in Pfeiffer syndrome and the FGFR3 mutation in Muenke syndrome. At the molecular level, one of two FGFR2 mutations involving amino acids (Ser252Trp and Pro253Arg) has been found to cause Apert syndrome in nearly all patients studied [94-98].

# 49.7.1 Primary Cranio-orbital Decompression: Reshaping in Infancy

The initial craniofacial procedure for Apert syndrome generally requires bilateral coronal suture release and anterior cranial vault and upper three-quarter orbital osteotomies to expand the anterior cranial vault and reshape the upper orbits and forehead (see Fig. 49.1) [99, 100]. Our preference is to carry this out when the child is 9-11 months of age, unless signs of increased ICP are identified earlier in life. The main goals at this stage are to decompress the brain and provide increased space for it in the anterior cranial vault and to increase

the orbital volume to decrease globe protrusion. The fronto-orbital surgical technique is similar to that described for Crouzon syndrome (Fig. 49.8).

# 49.7.2 Further Craniotomy for Additional Cranial Vault Expansion and Reshaping in Young Children

As described for Crouzon syndrome, after the initial suture release, decompression, and reshaping carried out during infancy, the child is observed clinically at intervals by the craniofacial surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, pediatric ophthalmologist, and developmental

pediatrician and undergoes interval CT scanning [63, 67, 68]. Should signs of increased ICP develop, further decompression with reshaping of the cranial vault to expand the intracranial volume is performed (Fig. 49.9). In Apert syndrome, the posterior cranial vault more commonly requires expansion. The technique is similar to that described for Crouzon syndrome.

# 49.7.3 Management of the "Total Midface" Deformity in Childhood

In Apert syndrome, for almost all patients, facial bipartition osteotomies combined with further cranial vault reshaping permit a more complete correction of the abnormal craniofacial skeleton than can be achieved through other midface procedure options (i.e., monobloc or Le Fort III osteotomies). When using the facial bipartition approach, a more normal arc of rotation of the midface complex is achieved with the midline split. This further reduces the stigmata of the preoperative "flat, wide, and retrusive" facial appearance. The facial bipartition also allows the orbits and zygomatic buttresses as units to shift to the midline (correction of hypertelorism) while the maxillary arch is simultane

ously widened. Horizontal advancement of the reassembled midface complex is then achieved to normalize the orbital depth and zygomatic length. The forehead is generally flat, tall, and retruded, with a constricting band just above the supraorbital ridge, giving the impression of bitemporal narrowing. Reshaping of the anterior cranial vault is simultaneously carried out (Fig. 49.10; see also Figs. 49.8 and 49.9). See also Fig. 49.9h for preoperative craniofacial morphology and planned and completed osteotomies and reshaping. Note that stabilization was achieved with cranial bone grafts and plate and screw fixation. A Le Fort III osteotomy is virtually never adequate for an ideal correction of the residual upper and midface deformity of Apert syndrome [101, 102].

# 49.7.5 Assessment of Results in the Apert Patient

# 49.7.5.1 Quantitative Assessment of Presenting Apert's Deformity and Surgical Results Based on CT Scan Analysis After First-Stage Cranio-orbital Reconstruction

In a previously published study, we applied a method of quantitative CT scan analysis to document the differences in the cranio-orbitozygomatic region between children with Apert syndrome who had not been operated on and age-matched controls [85]. We also evalu

ated the morphologic results achieved in those children 1 year after a classic anterior cranial vault and upper orbital procedure was undertaken, which was designed to decompress the brain and reshape these regions. Eight consecutive infants and young children with Apert syndrome who underwent a classic cranio-orbital procedure by a craniofacial surgeon (JCP) in conjunction with a pediatric neurosurgeon over a 4-year period were reviewed. The series included seven girls and one boy, with an average age at surgery of 12 months (range, 9-23 months). The average postoperative follow-up period was 34 months (range, 12-48 months) at the close of the study. Preoperative and postoperative  $(>1$  year) CT scans were compared with those of age-matched controls. Percentages of normal were then compared for significant differences. All CT scans were reviewed by a consistent neuroradiologist experienced in CT scan measurements. Two of the children had clear evidence of hydrocephalus and required VP shunting before the craniofacial reconstruction procedures (at 3 and 5 months of age). A third child had mildly increased ventricular size, but clinical correlations did not suggest the need for shunting.

Significant preoperative morphologic findings included a wide anterior cranial vault at  $110\%$  of nor

mal, a maximum cranial length that averaged only  $90\%$  of normal, a substantially widened anterior interorbital width at  $117\%$  of normal, an increased lateral interorbital distance at  $112\%$  of normal, and a widened bitem

poral width at  $122\%$  of normal. Globe protrusion was significant at  $121\%$  of normal, and the medial orbital wall length was less than normal at  $92\%$ . In the upper midface (zygomatic) region, both the width between the

zygomatic buttresses and the interarch width were found to be increased at  $109\%$  of normal, whereas the zygomatic arch lengths were substantially shortened at  $79\%$  of normal. The measurements confirmed the clinical observations of brachycephalic, hyperteloric anterior cranial vaults, orbits, and zygomas, accompanied by eye proptosis and midface deficiency. Results of surgical reconstruction, as documented by CT scan measurements (analysis), showed that more than a year after surgery none of the craniofacial measurements had significantly improved  $(P < .05)$  in comparison with those of the new age-matched controls.

We also reviewed the medical records of this consecutive group of eight children with Apert syndrome to document any morbidity associated with the cranio-orbital surgery carried out in infancy. There were no infections, wound difficulties, or central nervous system or ophthalmologic sequelae after any of the operations performed. One infant suffered intraoperative cardiac arrest due to intravascular volume depletion; the arrest responded to closed-chest cardiac massage and blood transfusion. The patient was discharged after an unremarkable further recovery. Several years later, she returned and underwent a facial bipartition procedure.

Detailed ophthalmologic examinations were also performed in all infants in the study. Two patients showed funduscopic evidence of increased ICP with papilledema before surgery. Both of these patients had previously undergone limited linear craniectomies. In both patients, the funduscopic examination results normalized by 6 months after the brain decompression and cranio-orbital expansion and reconstruction.

Quantitative measurement of CT scans of the cranio-orbitozygomatic region confirms clinically observed findings in these patients before cranio-orbital surgery in infancy and early childhood to be brachycephalic anterior cranial vaults and upper face hypertelorism (of orbits and zygomas) with eye proptosis and a flat midface. We found that early brain decompression with cranial vault and upper orbital reshaping does not maintain a corrected shape in the craniofacial skeleton in children with Apert syndrome. Although the cranio-orbitozygomatic dysmorphology did not seem to worsen when analyzed at least 1 year after surgery, values remained far from those of the new age-matched controls, thus confirming the need for a staged reconstructive approach.

# 49.7.5.2 Quantitative Intracranial Volume Measurements Before and After Cranio-orbital Reshaping in Children with Apert Syndrome

In published studies, we applied a proven method for obtaining intracranial volume measurements using CT scans to measure the intracranial volume of a consecutive series of children with Apert syndrome before any craniofacial procedures [70]. We performed a classic cranio-orbital operation in each child (described previously for Crouzon syndrome), followed by longitudinal follow-up, and remeasured the intracranial volume at least 1 year later. We also compared our patients' intracranial volumes with those of an age-matched cohort (according to norms established by Lichtenberg [103]) and reviewed each patient's cranial growth velocity.

The study included six girls and two boys with an average age at operation of 12 months (range, 9-23 months). The average postoperative follow-up at the close of the study was 34 months (range, 12-48 months).

Preoperative intracranial volume in the patients with Apert syndrome ranged from  $393~\mathrm{mL}$  in a 2-month-old girl to  $1715~\mathrm{mL}$  in a 28-month-old girl. Comparison of the preoperative intracranial volume in patients with Apert syndrome to those of the age- and-gender-controlled cohort group of Lichtenberg showed that six of the eight patients had values at least 2 SD above the mean. Interestingly, the other two were infants who underwent VP shunting for hydrocephalus earlier in life. Their measured preoperative intracranial volumes were 2 SD below the mean.

When our patients' postoperative intracranial volumes were compared with those of the Lichtenberg cohort group, all eight achieved values at least 2 SD above the mean. The majority of the measured preoperative and postoperative intracranial volume values of our patients with Apert syndrome followed a growth curve that greatly exceeded the rate expected for normal children. In three of the patients, cranial vault growth velocity seemed to match closely that expected for a normal child, but with a starting point determined by their preoperative values.

Our findings confirmed that untreated patients with Apert syndrome are generally macrocephalic early in life, that classic cranio-orbital procedures carried out in childhood do not alter this trend, and that continued

cranial volume expansion often exceeds the mean. The ability to develop "normal" intracranial volume standards and to identify variations from normal in specific syndromes and in individual patients before and after surgery continues to elude us.

# 49.7.5.3 Quantitative Assessment of Presenting Deformity in Children with Apert Syndrome and Surgical Results After Facial Biplatition Osteotomy Based on CT Scan Analysis

In published studies, we assessed children with Apert syndrome, in the mid-childhood years, using quantitative CT scan measurements [70]. In the children with Apert syndrome at this age, many of the measurements varied from normal when compared with those of age-matched controls. The orbital measurements showed a substantially increased anterior interorbital width (123% of normal), an increased midinterorbital width (122% of normal), and an increased intertemporal width (126% of normal). The globe protrusion beyond the sagittal plane of the lateral orbital walls was excessive (142% of normal). There was also a short medial orbital wall length (85% of normal). The width between the lateral orbital walls was excessive at 111% of normal. Zygomatic arch lengths were substantially shortened at 83% of normal value.

After undergoing facial bipartition osteotomies with three-dimensional repositioning, combined with cranial vault reshaping carried out through an intracranial approach, assessments of CT scan measurements were taken early after the operation and 1 year later. Analysis of the measurements showed an improvement toward normal range. When compared with those of age-matched controls, the orbital measurements reflected correction of the hypertelorism; the anterior interorbital width early after operation was  $106\%$  and later was  $105\%$  of normal. The midinterorbital width initially improved to  $106\%$  and later to  $100\%$  of normal. The width between the lateral orbital walls stabilized at  $108\%$  and the intertemporal width at  $115\%$  of normal, an improvement over the preoperative value of  $126\%$  of normal. The zygomatic arch length was initially overcorrected at  $110\%$  and then stabilized at  $103\%$  of normal.

Further study was carried out to evaluate the presence of extradural (retrofrontal) dead space after the facial bipartition osteotomy to reconstruct the Apert syndrome upper and midface deformity. Seven patients with Apert syndrome (mean age, 8 years) underwent facial bipartition osteotomies with advancement. Extradural (retrofrontal) dead space was measured from

a reproducible axial CT scan slice for each patient at postoperative intervals (1-2 weeks, 6-8 weeks, and 1 year). An initial extradural (retrofrontal) dead space was identified early after surgery in each patient, with resolution occurring by the 6- to 8-week postoperative interval through expansion of the dura and frontal lobes of the brain. The dead space was confirmed to be closed in all patients at the 1-year postoperative interval.

We then reviewed the morbidity of the same consecutive series of patients with Apert syndrome who underwent facial bipartition and cranial vault reshaping through an intracranial approach [44]. Of the seven children with Apert syndrome, there were no deaths, cardiopulmonary sequelae, or injuries to the brain or eyes. New seizure activity or central nervous system problems did not occur, nor did infection develop in any of the patients after surgery.

# 49.8 Pfeiffer Syndrome

In 1964, Pfeiffer described a syndrome consisting of craniosynostosis, broad thumbs, broad great toes, and occasionally, partial soft tissue syndactyly of the hands [104]. This syndrome is known to have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with complete penetrance documented in all recorded two- and three-generation pedigrees [69]. Variable expressivity of the craniofacial and extremity findings is common (Figs. 49.11 and 49.12). Although some authors have found clinical similarities in certain patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Jackson-Weiss syndrome, the three disorders are nosologically distinct [47, 105]. According to Cohen and Kreiborg [105], the phenotypes of the three conditions do not correlate well with the known molecular findings [97]. Patients with these three syndromes may have similar or even identical mutations in exon B of FGFR2, yet they breed true within families, an observation that is as yet unexplained by the molecular findings [106-113].

Current thinking suggests that Pfeiffer syndrome is heterogeneous because it is caused by a single recurring mutation (Pro252Arg) of  $FGFR1$  and by several different mutations affecting  $FGFR2$  [114, 115]. Cohen and Kreiborg [106] have reviewed the literature and further subgrouped Pfeiffer syndrome according to clinical features, associated low-frequency anomalies, and outcome. According to Cohen and Kreiborg, type 1 corresponds to the classic Pfeiffer syndrome and is associated with satisfactory prognosis. The type 2 subgroup is associated with the cloverleaf skull anomaly whereas type 3 is not. Both types 2 and 3 have a less favorable outcome, with frequent death in infancy. The type 1 variant frequently presents with bicornal craniosynos

tosis and midface involvement. The longitudinal evaluation and staging of reconstruction depend on individual variations but is similar to that described for Crouzon syndrome.

# 49.9 Carpenter Syndrome

Carpenter syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis often associated with preaxial polysyndactyly of the feet, short fingers with clinodactyly, and variable soft tissue syndactyly, sometimes postaxial polydactyly, and other anomalies such as congenital heart defects, short stature, obesity, and mental deficiency [24]. It was first described by Carpenter in 1901 and was later recognized to be an autosomal recessive syndrome. In general, the reconstructive algorithm described for Crouzon syndrome can be followed.

# 49.10Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a high degree of penetrance and expressivity [116, 117]. Its pattern of malformations may include craniosynostosis, low-set frontal hairline,

ptosis of the upper eyelids, facial asymmetry, brachydactyly, partial cutaneous syndactyly, and other skeletal anomalies. As part of the reconstruction, cranio-orbital reshaping will almost certainly be required and is similar to that described for Crouzon syndrome. Evaluation and management of the total midface deficiency and orthognathic deformities as described for Crouzon syndrome should be followed.

# 49.11Cloverleaf Skull Anomaly

Kleeblattschädel anomaly (cloverleaf skull) is a trilobular-shaped skull secondary to craniosynostosis (Fig. 49.13) [118, 119]. The cloverleaf skull anomaly is known to be both etiologically and pathogenetically heterogeneous. This anomaly is also nonspecific: it may occur as an isolated anomaly or together with other anomalies, making up various syndromes (i.e., Apert, Crouzon, Carpenter, Pfeiffer, and Saethre-Chotzen) [120]. The extent and timing of anterior cranial vault or upper orbital, posterior cranial vault, and midface reconstruction will be dependent on individual variation in the presenting deformity. In general, the protocol described for Crouzon syndrome can be followed.

# Summary

Details of the timing and techniques for correction of the varied forms of CFD syndromes differ from center to center. However, an essential element of successful rehabilitation is the delivery of care by committed, experienced, and technically skilled clinicians. The combined expertise of an experienced craniofacial surgeon and pediatric neurosurgeon working together to manage the cranio-orbital malformation and the experienced maxillofacial surgeon and orthodontist working together to manage the orthognathic deformity is essential to achieve maximum function and facial aesthetics for each patient.

In 2012, a multidisciplinary panel developed and published the Parameters of Care for Craniosynostosis,

and the reader is directed there for further information regarding the sequencing and surgical treatment of infants and children with CFD syndromes [121]. Consistent with these parameters, our preferred approach for management of the CFD syndromes is to stage the reconstruction to coincide with facial growth patterns, visceral (brain and eye) function, and psychosocial development. Recognition of the need for a staged reconstruction serves to clarify the objectives of each phase of treatment for the craniofacial surgeon, team, and, most important, the patient and patient's family.

By continuing to define our rationale for the timing and extent of surgical intervention and then evaluating both function and aesthetic outcomes, we will further

improve the quality of life for the many hundreds of children born with syndromal forms of craniosynostosis. Our objective is to see each individual achieve personal success in life without special regard for the original malformation.
