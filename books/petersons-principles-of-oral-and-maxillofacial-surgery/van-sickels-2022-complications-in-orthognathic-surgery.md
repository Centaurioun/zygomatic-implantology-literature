# Learning Aims

1. Thorough and detailed treatment planning is essential in avoiding complications in orthognathic surgery.  
2. Vascular injuries can occur intraoperatively as well as postoperatively.  
3. Neurosensory deficits are expected immediately following orthognathic surgery, but the vast majority is temporary.  
4. The risk of mal- or nonunion in orthognathic surgery is rare, and knowledge of appropriate management is essential.  
5. Unanticipated segment fractures rarely occur; immediate recognition and treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.

# 68.1 Introduction

Orthognathic surgery has changed dramatically during the last decade and will continue to do so with time. Procedures that were thought impossible a few years ago are now being done routinely. Virtual planning and performing mandibular surgery first have all but eliminated errors during the preoperative phase of treatment. Newer fixation techniques and patient specific implants have likewise changed the everyday practice of orthognathic surgery. Nevertheless, complications can occur during treatment and in the postoperative phase. These include vascular injuries that either manifest themselves at the time or later, dental or periodontal injuries, infection and unanticipated fractures with mandible surgery, both sensory and motor nerve injuries, along with other less frequent complications. Several other topics are covered in prior chapters, such as, relapse (▶ Chap. 62), temporomandibular issues (▶ Chap. 63), and soft tissue issues (▶ Chap. 67).

# 68.2 Hemorrhage: Acute and Delayed

# 68.2.1 Acute Maxillary Hemorrhage

Severe acute hemorrhage has been documented with both maxillary and mandibular surgery and can have immediate or delayed effects [1-7]. In general, massive hemorrhage is rare in the perioperative period, but it is more likely to occur with maxillary versus mandibular surgery. The blood vessels that are most at risk of iatrogenic injury during maxillary surgery include the internal maxillary artery, posterior superior alveolar artery, and descending palatine arteries.

Massive blood loss rarely occurs secondary to injury to the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular

vein, but more likely occurs from injury to major branches of these blood vessels. During the separation of the pterygoid plates, it is possible to fracture the base of the skull while manipulating chisels or by directing chisels in an aberrant direction [8, 9]. There can be great variability in the location of the fracture in the posterior portion of the Le Fort osteotomy. How the maxilla fractures may not be under the control of the surgeon and can result in high fractures near the skull base or low anterior fractures through the pterygoid plates or even further forward in the maxillary alveolus. Any of these fractures can result in direct or indirect damage to major vessels in the region. When considering vascular injuries, it should be remembered that they may be injured directly during osteotome placement (branches of the internal maxillary artery) or indirectly through shattering the pterygoid plates with bone edge shearing through the regional vasculature (descending palatine arteries, pterygoid venous plexus). Meticulous efforts should be made to direct osteotomies low and medial in the pterygoid plate region and to down-fracture the maxilla without applying excessive force. If the maxilla is difficult to mobilize, osteotomy sites should be checked and the posterior osteotomy may be redirected into the tuberosity region to avoid the vessels in the area [10]. Patients who are undergoing a maxillary osteotomy to correct a malocclusion after trauma present special considerations. The previous midface trauma may have resulted in fractures at the base of the skull as well as unpredictable scar formation. Fusion of bony segments from the previous trauma may not fall along the usual natural suture lines or planes of cleavage. Therefore, excessive manipulation to mobilize the maxilla may result in the osteotomy following the previous fracture lines and not along the intended path, leading to an increased risk of unanticipated bleeding.

Generally, when brisk bleeding is encountered, one should complete the osteotomy and down-fracture the maxilla. Once the maxilla is free, an assessment is done to locate the source of bleeding. If the bleeding is brisk, the region may be packed, limiting blood loss while allowing for vascular contraction and improved visualization. Ideally the best opportunity to identify and ligate a bleeding vessel is when it is first injured. Ligature clips or electrocautery may be used if the vessel is seen. If hemorrhage continues to obscure the surgical field, packing with thrombin impregnation gauze, should be followed by attempts to directly occlude the bleeding vessel. Alternatively, resorbable hemostatic materials with or without topical thrombin, such as Surgicel (oxidized cellulose), Avitene (microfibrillar collagen), or Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin sponge), may be packed in the region under pressure to tamponade off the source of bleeding.

The internal and external carotid arteries, or terminal branches, may be susceptible to both direct and indirect insult during orthognathic surgery. Thrombosis of the internal carotid artery after orthognathic surgery may occur because of excessive neck extension secondary to patient positioning [11]. Mortality associated with thrombosis of the internal carotid artery has been estimated to be  $40\%$ , with an additional  $52\%$  of patients sustaining a significant permanent neurologic deficit. Extension of the neck serves to stretch and partially fix the internal carotid artery against the cervical vertebrae during surgery, and contralateral rotation of the head results in further stretch of the artery. Positioning of the patient's head in this manner places the internal carotid artery at risk for both direct and indirect trauma and should be avoided.

# 68.2.2 Delayed Maxillary Hemorrhage

Delayed hemorrhage after a Le Fort I may occur as early as several hours to as late as 9 or 10 days after surgery. The blood vessels most frequently involved are the descending palatine artery, the internal maxillary artery, and the pterygoid venous plexus of veins [6]. Typically, delayed hemorrhage is more likely venous in origin involving the pterygoid venous plexus of veins.

Recommendations to reduce these types of injuries include careful placement and orientation of the osteotomy in the pterygomaxillary suture with angulation of the osteotomy inferior from the zygomaticomaxillary crest toward the pterygoid plates [12]. The mean distance from the most inferior junction of the maxilla and the pterygoid plates to the position of the internal maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa is  $25\mathrm{mm}$ . With an average length of an osteotome of  $15\mathrm{mm}$ , assuming normal vascular anatomy, the margin of safety in order to separate the entire pterygomaxillary junction is only  $10\mathrm{mm}$ . However, patients with dentofacial and craniofacial anomalies may have anatomic variation from these normal values. The internal maxillary artery and its branches are most vulnerable to damage during their course through the pterygopalatine fossa and pterygomaxillary fissure when the maxillary tuberosity is separated from the pterygoid plates.

The posterior superior alveolar and the descending palatine arteries may be severed because they lie in close proximity to the bony walls. It is generally recommended that the descending palatine arteries be preserved, if possible. This is performed with retraction and protection of the vessels while using a cutting instrument to undermine the bone adjacent to the vessels. Then the bone is gently fractured away from the vessels. However, if bleeding is encountered, the arteries should be ligated

or cauterized rather than allowing it to retract and continue to bleed. Preservation of the descending palatine vessels has been shown to have minimal effects on a single-piece Le Fort osteotomy; however, preservation of these vessels during segmental maxillary surgery is preferred to maximize the blood supply to the maxillary segments. In general, when large advancements of the maxilla are necessary ( $>8\mathrm{mm}$ ), it may be difficult to preserve the palatine vessels, and therefore prudent to sacrifice them.

There are several treatment options for the patient with postoperative hemorrhage after maxillary surgery, and these vary with the degree and severity of the bleeding. The most obvious sign of this type of problem is hemorrhage emanating from both nares [3]. When a patient is initially seen with postoperative bleeding, intermaxillary fixation (IMF), if present, should be released. The patient's general physical status should be assessed. High blood pressure should be controlled, and appropriate bleeding and coagulation studies ordered. Abnormal coagulation parameters warrant prompt correction and possible hematology consultation. It should be remembered that this surgery may be the first in a young patient's life and may uncover an undiagnosed bleeding disorder. With a good light source and suction, the nasal cavity should be examined to determine whether a bleeding site is arterial or venous in nature. In the immediate perioperative period, nasal bleeding results from tears in the nasal mucosa that have become more active after extubation. If adequate visualization and assessment are not possible, the nose should be anesthetized and decongested with a local anesthetic and a vasoconstrictor. Local anesthetic injections in the nose and around the palatine foramina are useful in decreasing postoperative hemorrhage and allow for an adequate evaluation. If bleeding is minor in nature, it may be possible to treat the patient with bed rest and the use of anterior and posterior nasal packing for 3 to 5 days. Interventional radiology is recommended for patients who do not respond to local management, or when bleeding is severe or persistent. A computed tomography angiographic (CTA) exam can be used to identify the injured vessel. Angiography will allow direct embolization of the vessel at the point of severance (Fig. 68.1a and b). Additional operative techniques may be employed depending upon the specific clinical examination or angiographic findings. These include packing of the maxillary sinus or, in extreme cases, ligation of the external carotid artery at the lingual/facial artery branch. However, with collateral circulation, persistent bleeding may still occur after the external carotid artery is ligated. In general, severe late postoperative hemorrhage is most effectively managed by an interventional radiologist with angiography and embolization.

# 68.2.3 Mandibular Hemorrhage

As with maxillary surgery, major vessels can be injured during mandibular orthognathic surgery. Occlusion of the internal carotid artery has been described after a mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) [13], with major central nervous system morbidity. The medical and surgical management of internal carotid artery thrombosis is beyond the scope of this chapter. Prevention is accomplished with appropriate patient head positioning. Typically, vascular injuries with mandibular surgery are due to indirect trauma either through forceful placement of a retractor on the lingual surface of the ramus or the use of a mallet and chisel on the medial aspect of the mandible, with subsequent vascular injury. Placement of retractors and the use of chisels on the medial posterior aspect of the mandible should be performed with caution. It is preferable to limit dissection and subsequent chisel use to the area of the retrolingular fossa just distal to the area of the mandibular foramen.

# 68.2.4 Hemorrhage with Sagittal Split Osteotomy

Early reports noted numerous incidences of excessive bleeding with a sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) [14]. The vessels most commonly injured are the internal maxillary artery, the facial artery, and the inferior alveolar artery. These injuries were attributed to inexperience, excessive soft tissue stripping and dissection, and lack of appropriate instrumentation for the procedure. With current techniques and instrumentation, excessive hemorrhage during an SSO is not a major concern. In a series of 256 mandibular SSOs, the incidence of hemorrhage was  $1.2\%$  (3 cases) and included two cases of inferior alveolar artery injury and one anterior facial artery injury [15]. In a series of 1264 consecutive patients undergoing an SSO, 15 patients  $(1.2\%)$  had bleeding complications [16]. Of this group, the most common injury occurred to the retromandibular vein, with one case of bleeding from the facial artery. Four patients required reoperation secondary to an expanding hematoma. The majority of the cases in this series were performed using the classic Obwegeser technique without modifications. Hemorrhage due to vascular injury on the medial or lateral aspects of the mandible during an SSO may be controlled in a number of ways. The simplest methods include gauze packing, electrocautery, or clamping with a vessel clip if the severed vessel can be identified. Injecting local anesthetic with epinephrine (1:100,000) into the vessel walls may stop minor bleeding. Caution should be exercised when applying electrocautery in close proximity to neural tissues. When indicated, bipolar cautery should be used. As with bleeding from maxillary surgery, extraoral cervical approaches to the carotid arterial system to control bleeding sources are seldom necessary. In these rare cases, the involved vessel may be amenable to angiography and embolization.

# 68.2.5 Hemorrhage with Vertical Ramus Osteotomy

Vascular injury during a vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO) can be divided into four regions of the ramus: superior, middle, inferior, and posterior. In the superior sigmoid notch region, the maxillary artery is at risk for injury and it should be protected with careful placement of a Bauer retractor in the sigmoid notch. In the midramus region, the inferior alveolar artery and vein

entering the mandibular foramen are at risk. The inferior aspect of the VRO places the facial artery and vein at risk for injury, and the posterior aspect of the VRO places the retromandibular vein at risk for injury. Careful subperiosteal dissection around the posterior border of the ramus should be followed by placement of a Merrill-Levasseur retractor. Considering the sources of potential bleeding and the need to access them, the sequence of the VRO cuts should correspond to the surgeon's ability to access a bleeding vessel after completion of the osteotomy. Note that the VRO should be "scored" through the lateral ramus first, but not "completed" through to the medial ramus. The facial artery and retromandibular vessels may be controlled with extraoral pressure or retraction under or behind the mandible; therefore, the inferior cut should be completed first. Because the maxillary artery can be accessed with gauze packing to tamponade bleeding in the sigmoid notch region, this superior cut should be performed second. Finally, because the inferior alveolar artery is inaccessible from a lateral approach, the middle of the VRO should be completed third or last. Once the osteotomy is completed, the proximal segment can be retracted laterally, and the inferior alveolar artery accessed immediately. In a study of intraoral VROs, there was a low incidence of damage to the maxillary artery [17]. The masseteric artery may be injured by placing a saw or bur cut too far superiorly into the region of the sigmoid notch. The inferior alveolar artery injury is usually caused by placing the vertical osteotomy of the ramus too far anteriorly. This may result in severance of the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle on the medial aspect of the ramus. During a VRO, access to the inferior alveolar vessel is difficult, given the lateral approach. Fortunately, in most instances, intraoperative bleeding along the ramus cut or in the sigmoid notch can be controlled by pressure tamponade, until completion of the osteotomy allows for vessel ligation or electrocautery. Late vascular sequelae, such as the formation of an aneurysm, may require angiography and embolization.

# $\mathbb{O}$  Importance

Massive epistaxis is usually due to a pseudoaneurysm and is usually seen 7-10 days after a maxillary surgery.

# Tips and Tricks

CTA and interventional radiology are assets and should be utilized to manage immediate or delayed hemorrhage. They will be able to reveal the source of bleeding and through embolization can resolve the issue.

# Key Points

While minor bleeding after maxillary and mandibular osteotomies is to be expected and is usually easily controlled, delayed excessive bleeding days or weeks afterwards is not.

# 68.3 Vascular Compromises: Maxilla and Mandible

# 68.3.1 Vascular Compromise (Avascular Necrosis)

The morbidity of vascular compromise or ischemic complications varies with maxillary or mandibular procedures. The long-term complications of loss of blood supply range from fibrosis of pulpal tissues and minor periodontal defects to major loss of teeth, alveolus, or bony segments. More severe risk of complications are associated with segmental maxillary surgery and interruption of the blood supply [18]. Major risks include three or more segments, advanced age, and comorbid medical history, including microvascular disease (arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, etc.), immunocompromised state or poor wound healing (e.g., diabetes mellitus), and tobacco use. Technical issues include previous maxillary surgery, simultaneous premolar extraction, posteriorly positioning and kinking of palatal soft tissues, prolonged intraoperative hypotensive anesthesia, significant bony movements ( $>10$  mm), superior maxillary movement (impaction), or maxillary expansion with stretching or tearing of the palatal mucosa. Intraoperatively, there may be pressure from a palatal coverage splint or lack of segment stabilization. During follow-up, early signs of the development of avascular necrosis (e.g., gray, dusky gingiva) may not be recognized [18]. Several recommendations have been proposed to avoid vascular complications associated with segmental maxillary osteotomies. Preoperatively, it is critical to ensure that adequate space exists between teeth for interdental osteotomies. This includes careful examination of periapical radiographs before surgery or virtual planning to confirm root divergence. Model surgery or virtual planning should minimize the amount of bone removed in the osteotomy sites. Interdental osteotomies should be done with thin chisels and fine burs, using copious irrigation to prevent soft tissue damage. These steps will minimize the amount of heat generation and decrease the chance of creating necrotic bone or root defects. Release of soft tissues adjacent to osteotomy sites and gentle mobilization of segments to avoid tearing and cutting of flaps are essential. Splints with

palatal bars should not impinge on the palatal pedicle to prevent vascular compromise. Special consideration must be given to patients who had previous palatal surgery, or a cleft palate. Multiple small access incisions may be preferable to a standard bilateral circumventibular incision for these patients. Complications such as periodontal defects, pulpal necrosis, and delayed union or nonunion are more commonly seen in the anterior region of the mandible, but may be associated with any maxillary or mandibular segmental procedure. Mandibular segmental procedures require detailed planning of soft tissue incisions and careful elevation of soft tissue pedicles. The vascular supply to involved segments must be optimized by designing as large a soft tissue flap as possible, maintaining maximal soft tissue attachment to the segment(s) to be mobilized. This can be done by avoiding stripping of the lingual mucoperiosteal pedicle, and making the bony osteotomies as apical as possible to include as much muscle tissue as possible.

Avascular necrosis with major loss of soft and hard tissues of the maxilla is rare and is most often due to a compromised blood supply. Several recent studies have

utilized indocyanine green to dynamically analyze maxillary perfusion during conventional and segmental maxillary osteotomies and demonstrated the almost immediate reperfusion of the anterior maxilla following closure [19, 20]. As mentioned previously, this may be caused by a kinked vascular pedicle in the palatal mucosa or iatrogenic tearing of palatal flaps. Isolated cases of loss of the entire maxilla or individual segments have been reported (Fig. 68.2a-c) [18]. More common and subtle complications secondary to vascular compromise range from flattening of the papilla and loss of the gingiva due to periodontal defects in the areas of the osteotomies. The treatment of avascular necrosis may be divided into initial and delayed management strategies. Initially, the problem must be identified, and supportive care provided, including irrigation, chlorhexidine rinses, and instruction on good oral hygiene practices. If mobility of the maxilla exists, attempts should be made to stabilize the mobile segments, with the possible need to return to the operating room. Intermaxillary fixation should be released, if present, to allow for a comprehensive assessment. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics may

be considered. The most appropriate initial management is prompt referral for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. The problem with avascular necrosis is that by the time it is diagnosed, the damage has already occurred, and complete resolution, despite prompt HBO therapy, is unlikely. The delayed, or long-term, management of avascular necrosis includes allowing a sufficient period of time for demarcation of necrotic segments (months), then planning conservative removal of nonviable bone segments and teeth and repair of any associated oroantral and oronasal fistulae that may be present. Reconstructive options must include free soft tissue or osteomyocutaneous flaps, local tissue rearrangement, or adjacent soft tissue transfer, owing to the compromised blood supply in the area, which will not provide an environment conducive to support healing of a nonvascularized bone graft. After bone and soft tissue reconstruction, dental implant and prosthetic reconstruction may be considered.

Avascular necrosis of the proximal segment with an SSO is rare and has been attributed to excessive stripping of the segments [21]. Loss of bone secondary to aseptic necrosis has resulted in facial disfigurement with loss of the mandibular angle projection, or excessive antagonial notching. As early as 1974, Grammer and colleagues noted that necrosis of large areas of bone in the proximal segment after mandibular SSO occurred secondary to wide lateral elevation of the mucoperiosteal pedicle in the animal model [22]. They proposed that the devitalized bone usually revascularized; however, when revascularization does not occur, there is substantial bone loss at the gonial angle region. In 1977, Epker presented modifications of the sagittal split and discussed a technique in which the amount of lateral dissection was greatly decreased [23]. Adoption of this technique has greatly minimized the incidence of avascular necrosis after a mandibular SSO. Rigid fixation of bony segments permits early revascularization and prevents segment mobility. This has also minimized the incidence of avascular necrosis in the mandible.

Early publications suggested that an advancement genioplasty could be done successfully by repositioning the anterior inferior border of the mandible as a free bone graft. However, after a horizontal osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible occurs with advancement, resorption of the advanced bone segment occurs to varying degrees. The result is slight, or almost complete, loss of the advanced genial segment. Preservation of the lingual pedicle (geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles) and the buccal pedicle minimizes bone resorption and results in a more predictable soft and hard tissue chin contour.

The intraoral vertical subcondylar osteotomy is the mandibular procedure in which the proximal segment is

at most risk for avascular necrosis due to the wide release of periosteal attachments. One study reported 2 out of 42 patients with necrosis of the distal tip of the proximal segment [24]. The surgical technique involved stripping the entire lateral and medial surfaces of the mandible up to the neck of the condyle. With modifications of the VRO technique, in which a soft tissue pedicle of medial pterygoid muscle remains attached to the posterior and medial aspect of the proximal segment, aseptic necrosis of the tip of the proximal segment is generally not a major concern [25].

# 68.3.2 Nonunion of the Maxilla

Nonunion, delayed union, or fibrous union of the maxilla may be due to both local and systemic factors. The blood supply to the maxilla may be compromised during the surgery or may be questionable because of scarring from previous surgery. The presence of palatal scarring in a cleft patient with large maxillary advancements may make it difficult to passively reposition the maxilla and may worsen speech. In these cases, consideration may be given for use of distraction osteogenesis (Fig. 68.3a-c). Major contributory factors to postoperative maxillary mobility are parafunctional activity, large advancements, excessive masticatory forces, or occlusal irregularities or interferences. In patients where the maxilla was moved in an anterior and inferior direction, there may be insufficient bony interfaces at the piriform rim and zygomatic buttresses to allow osseous healing. Patients with systemic conditions that interfere with healing, such as diabetes, smoking, or an immunocompromised state, require individualized planning to minimize poor bone healing. When an unstable maxillary movement is anticipated, bone plates and screws may be combined with additional forms of stabilization, including bone grafts or synthetic substitutes, as well as intermaxillary fixation. With inferior repositioning of the maxilla, bone plates and grafts can be combined with adjustable pins for additional stability. In general, bone gaps of  $6\mathrm{mm}$  or greater, resulting from large maxillary advancements, should receive grafting where defects are present and may include the piriform rim and maxillary buttress regions.

After maxillary surgery, the primary physical finding that a nonunion exists is mobility of the maxilla during maximal intercuspation. The patient is generally able to move the maxilla superiorly by simply clenching the teeth together. Routine in-office imaging, such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) or conventional computed tomography (CT) can be utilized to further confirm the presence of lack of bony union (Fig. 68.4a-c). Treatment of a mobile maxilla may be

divided into early and late management. The use of short-term intermaxillary fixation is controversial and may not assist with bone healing across an established area of fibrous tissue interposition between bony segments and, in fact, may contribute to the nonunion by the constant pull of the mandible during attempted opening of the mouth. If maxillary mobility is noted in the early postoperative period, a short period of intermaxillary fixation may be beneficial to allow for neovascularization at the bone gap. Conversely, if the patient is already in intermaxillary fixation, removal may allow functional remodeling and bony consolidation. This is particularly important in the patient who has parafunctional occlusal activities. Selective occlusal adjustment after an occlusal analysis may be the most important

means to allow bony union to occur. In addition, flat plane occlusal splints may be used to distribute occlusal forces more evenly and appropriately. Again, for minor occlusal discrepancies, selective occlusal equilibration may resolve premature contacts that may have contributed to mobility of the maxilla. Also, patients should be instructed on the use of a non-chew diet. Heavy intermaxillary elastics should be discontinued because, with function, they put intermittent strong forces on the maxilla when the patient attempts mouth opening. For patients with posterior relapse, light short class III elastics can help prevent further movement and may allow osseous consolidation. However, all elastics must be used judiciously because they may aggravate the nonunion. Even if the final result is a minor class III maloc

clusion, this is usually easier to manage than a nonunion of the maxilla.

The late management of maxillary nonunion involves surgery for debridement of the fibrous tissue and either allogeneic or autogenous bone grafting and rigid stabilization of the maxilla at the buttress regions. This would include the use of bone plates and screws, particulate or corticocancelloous allogeneic or autogenous bone grafts, auxiliary stabilization techniques,

and possibly the use of alloplastic materials. Patient-specific implants can be utilized in these cases as well, as they afford the ability to place more rigid and precise fixation techniques, along with positioning fixation screws in more dense or solid bone (Fig. 68.5a-d). The reoperation should be approached aggressively by completely mobilizing the maxilla and removing interpositional fibrous tissue to allow an osseous union.

# 68.3.3 Nonunion of the Mandible

Nonunion or delayed union of the mandible may be due to avascular necrosis, insufficient bone contact, instability of the fixation devices, or instability of bone fragments. This complication may occur with SSOs and VROs. VROs warrant specific considerations, not only because a great deal of soft tissue and muscular attachments may be reflected off of the small proximal bone segment, but also because the proximal segment may not lie in close apposition to the distal mandible and may, in fact, be unstable without the use of rigid fixation devices. Therefore, any significant parafunctional movements or incidental postsurgical trauma in the early phases after surgery may contribute to a nonunion.

With regard to the SSO, larger advancements are of a greater concern than small advancements. For advancements greater than  $7\mathrm{mm}$ , additional fixation may be required in order to maintain stability (Fig. 68.6). Alternatively, skeletal suspension wires and a brief period of IMF have been shown to provide increased stability [26].

Delayed union of a mandibular SSO may be treated with a short period of IMF. Alternatively, a second operation may be necessary with the application of additional plates and screws or more rigid patient-specific implants for stability, similar to maxillary nonunion (Fig. 68.7a and b). Nonunion of the mandible after a vertical subcondylar osteotomy may be more of a problem with edentulous patients, or when a very short vertical cut is used (Fig. 68.7). A second opera

# Importance

Recognition and immediate management of nonunion in both maxillary and mandibular orthognathic surgery is essential for appropriate treatment and prevention of further, more severe, complications.

# Tips and Tricks

Patient-specific implants designed to position fixation screws in a more ideal position can help treat maxillary and mandibular nonunion. Another benefit is the ability to fabricate more rigid and lower profile fixation plates.

# 68.4 Dental and Periodontal Injuries: Maxilla and Mandible

Dental and periodontal injuries can be secondary to both vascular and nonvascular causes, and are most frequently related to treatment planning errors or technical errors made at the time of surgery (Fig. 68.9). Segmental procedures in the maxilla and mandible may cause a number of problems, including injury to tooth roots, loss of teeth, need for postoperative endodontic therapy, and the development of significant interdental periodontal defects.

# 68.5 Fistula Formation

Postoperative oronasal and oroantral fistulas generally result from palatal soft tissue injury at the time of surgery. Fistulas have been reported with segmental and conventional Le Fort osteotomies [27]. They usually result from rotary instruments or saws that perforate the palatal mucosa during a segmental procedure. Impingement of soft tissue during segment repositioning

![](images/0aaa67e46e889d15a82b3215571b8b41608ed69ef70473e1760a5d809994ac77.jpg)

and fixation may also result in tissue necrosis and subsequent fistula formation. Iatrogenic tearing of the palatal mucosa, and attempted stretching of the tissue, may also result in the potential for tissue necrosis. This occurs most commonly when an osteotomy is created in the maxillary midline, where the palatal mucosa is extremely thin. Segmental expansion movements that stretch the mid-palatal tissue may lead to a resultant tissue deficiency and nasal communication (  $\square$  Fig. 68.10a and b).

Careful manipulation of the soft tissue at the time of surgery preventing perforations is the best method of avoiding postoperative fistula formation. When expansion is required, the palatal mucosa can be incised with two parallel incisions just medial to the greater palatine foramen; bony separation then occurs in the mid-palatal region [27]. The tissue can stretch and expand in an area removed from the location of bony separation in the midline. An alternative technique involves making paramedian osteotomies in the nasal floor immediately adjacent to the lateral nasal walls. The overlying palatal mucosa is thicker and more elastic than the thin midline palatal mucosa [28]. If a small tear of the palatal mucosa is noted after a bony cut, care should be taken to release the palatal tissue from above before expansion of segments to allow laxity and closer approximation of the mucosa to prevent a large soft tissue defect. Closure of nasal floor lacerations at the time of surgery can help prevent future fistula formation, along with placement of cutaneous adhesive agents on the palatal mucosa.

When a fistula is noted postoperatively, several measures may be used to allow the fistula to close. Prevention of sinus and nasal infections is essential. Management may include systemic antibiotic therapy, local antibiotic rinses (i.e., chlorhexidine), and nasal decongestants. Constructing an appliance that will obturate the fistula

without placing pressure on the surrounding tissues can contribute to spontaneous closure by reducing food and bacterial contamination at the site. Care must be taken to ensure that there is not excessive pressure on the palatal mucosa from a palatal obturator splint that can result in decreased vascularity, with further loss of soft tissue and underlying bone, creating a larger hard and soft tissue defect to address with surgical correction. If local measures, appropriate medical therapy, and fistula obturation have been unsuccessful, surgical closure of the fistula is generally required.

It is recommended that at least 6 months have elapsed before considering closing a fistula to allow for revascularization of maxillary segments. Closure should be by a soft tissue flap raised from an area farthest from the injury with the least potential for loss of vascularity in the transfer. Buccal advancement flaps or local palatal island flaps may be used; however, if there is a significant loss of soft tissue, distant flaps should be considered. This could include the buccal fat pad, temporalis myofascial flap, or a tongue flap transferring vascularized soft tissue to the area of vascular compromise. If all these attempts have failed, a final resort may be the utilization of free soft tissue transfer (e.g., radial forearm free flap).

# Tips and Tricks

Closure of nasal mucosa at the time of surgery (prior to fixation of the maxilla), can help prevent formation of an oronasal fistula. Additionally, placement of cutaneous adhesive agents on the palatal mucosa overlying the laceration can further protect the area from formation of an oronasal fistula.

# 68.6 Infection

The incidence of postoperative infections after orthognathic surgery is low [16, 29-32]. Chow and colleagues reviewed 1294 consecutively treated patients who underwent one- and two-jaw orthognathic procedures with a complication rate of  $9.7\%$  overall, and a  $7.4\%$  incidence of postoperative infections [29]. They noted that those patients who received only a single preoperative dose of antibiotic had a higher rate of infection compared to those with longer duration of perioperative antibiotic management. As expected, two-jaw procedures had a higher incidence of infection than single-jaw procedures. The incidence of infection was almost equal between maxillary and mandibular osteotomies. In a series of 57 patients who underwent an SSO of the mandible, there was one case of infection resulting in significant relapse of the orthognathic procedure [30]. Becelli and associates had a  $2.48\%$  incidence of infection when examining 482 sides of patients who underwent a mandibular SSO [31]. These occurred within the first month after surgery and were treated effectively with systemic oral antibiotics; although several patients required screw removal with wound debridement. Bouwman and colleagues reviewed 700 consecutive cases of BSSOs for advancement of the mandible, and in 15 cases, bicondylal screws required removal due to infection [32]. Teltzrow et al. studied 1264 patients and noted a  $2.8\%$  incidence of infection after a BSSO requiring extraoral incision and drainage, despite a protocol including a single dose of perioperative intravenous antibiotic [16].

As seen from these reviews, the incidence of infection with orthognathic surgery is low. While it varies from one study to another, there is an overall incidence of  $1 - 5\%$ , consistent with clean-contaminated wounds. In addition, most infections occur within the first few weeks after surgery. Many of these are due to an infected hematoma, which usually resolves with an intraoral incision and drainage in the office. Infections due to loose hardware may occur early if there was insufficient stability at the time of surgery, but also may be seen several months after surgery following bony remodeling and resultant screw loosening.

Osteomyelitis after orthognathic surgery is especially rare. Teltzrow et al. had one patient develop osteomyelitis after a BSSO, which resolved after decortication and long-term systemic antibiotic therapy [16]. The authors of this chapter reported a case of unilateral osteomyelitis following a BSSO which was successfully treated with wound debridement, hardware removal, and long-term antibiotic management with the assistance of infectious disease physicians [33].

# 68.7 Nerve Injury: Sensory and Motor

# 68.7.1 Maxillary Sensory Injuries

Sensory injuries in the maxilla after orthognathic surgery have not been studied as extensively as those seen with mandibular surgery. With a carefully placed low circumvestibular incision, combined with gentle soft tissue retraction, nerve injury is generally inconsequential and limited to the terminal branches of the infraorbital nerve (V2). Spontaneous recovery of sensation to the lip, cheeks, and nose usually occurs within 2 to 8 weeks after surgery. In contrast, paresthesia due to damage of the sensory nerve supply to the teeth, gingiva, and mucosa are more common. Decreased sensation to the mucosa is typically transient and normal sensation commonly returns within 6 to 12 months. On occasion, patients will experience permanent numbness in a small area intraorally on the palate or buccal gingiva. To preserve sensation to the palate, some authors advocate preservation of the greater palatine neurovascular bundle whenever possible [34]. Failure of the teeth to respond to electric pulp stimulation may be temporary; however, permanent loss of response to electrical, hot, or cold stimulation is not unusual, and does not necessarily represent a tooth that requires endodontic therapy. The clinician must differentiate between a nonvital tooth and one that does not respond to stimulation, but still has an intact blood supply. Many studies have shown decreased blood flow to the maxillary teeth during and after Le Fort osteotomy with pulpal blood flow studies, with return to normal within several months.

# 68.7.2 Mandibular Sensory Injuries

# 68.7.2.1 Sagittal Split Osteotomy

Although traction injuries to the inferior alveolar nerve occur commonly during an SSO, transections of the nerve occur less commonly [35]. The most likely time for this to occur is during the splitting process of the osteotomy. When the segments are being separated, care should be taken to visualize and protect the nerve. If the nerve is in the proximal segment or encased in cortical bone, appropriate steps should be taken to release it. This may be as simple as releasing the nerve with a periosteal elevator from medullary bone, or it may require additional bone cuts to release it from cortical bone. Laborious efforts to release the nerve should be avoided, especially with a setback, as they may worsen the amount of nerve injury. One study suggested that low mandibular corpus body height and inferior position of the nerve

in the class II retrognathic patient population may increase the risk for injury [35]. With a transection injury, repair of the nerve with one or more nonresorbable 6-0 to 8-0 monofilament nylon sutures placed in the epineurium has been recommended [36]. It may be necessary to perform a decortication laterally to release the nerve to the mental foramen for mobilization. A large advancement will further separate the proximal and distal nerve stumps and prevent direct repair without tension. In one series, there was a  $3.5\%$  incidence of transection of the inferior alveolar nerve, which occurred anterior to, or in the third molar region, in all instances [15]. This is the location where the inferior alveolar nerve is most lateral and the buccal cortex of the mandible is thinnest, making the nerve most vulnerable to injury in this location. Nerve endings were approximated in nine patients by positioning the segments in close proximity, but without the need for epineural sutures. The length of follow-up for these patients was 2-5 years, and all of the patients had some return of sensation to the normal inferior alveolar nerve distribution.

Conversely, if the transection occurs at the vertical bony cut, immediate repair may be difficult and, as mentioned, it may be necessary to expose more of the nerve in the distal segment. When excessive tension on the nerve repair site is present, the nerve may have to be exposed distally to the mental foramen to allow a tension-free repair. The need for such an extensive procedure needs to be weighed against the primary goals of the orthognathic surgical procedure.

Injury to the inferior alveolar nerve, in the absence of a transection, is frequently associated with the SSO, and rates can be as high as  $15\%$  for permanent nerve deficits. Risk factors for neurosensory disturbance include advanced patient age, a simultaneous genioplasty procedure, and an increased magnitude of advancement [37, 38]. Multiple techniques have been suggested to prevent these injuries, including varying the osteotomy design, cautious chisel placement, meticulous dissection technique, decompression of the lateral fragment, and perioperative steroid use. Medial retraction of the neurovascular bundle inferiorly during the horizontal osteotomy may cause the nerve to be compressed against the lingula decreased intraoperative nerve conduction [35, 39]. Retraction on the medial aspect of the mandible should be done carefully to avoid compression nerve injuries. The ideal location to create the lateral buccal (vertical) cut is in the first and second molar region where the cortex is the thickest, the mandible is the thickest, and the nerve is farthest from the lateral cortex [15, 40]. Other recommendations to prevent nerve injuries are based on clinical experience, but no controlled studies have been done to determine whether one way is preferable over another.

Injury to the lingual nerve during an SSO can occur, but it is unusual [41, 42]. The lingual nerve may be injured by overpenetration of bicortical positional screws used to rigidly fix the osteotomy. The course of the lingual nerve near the medial surface of the mandible varies; therefore, any dissection on the lingual aspect of the mandible in the third molar region may temporarily or permanently injure this nerve [43]. As with inferior alveolar nerve injuries, lingual nerve injuries should be carefully followed and documented. If the nerve is visualized and has been transected, it should be repaired at the time of surgery. In general, symptoms of lingual nerve injuries after an SSO are rare and typically resolve with time, but in rare circumstances may require microneurosurgical repair.

# 68.7.2.2 VRO and Other Ramus Procedures

A vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO) is an alternative to the SSO for horizontal mandibular excess with a mandibular setback. This procedure may also result in permanent injury to the inferior alveolar nerve. The incidence of permanent paresthesia after an intraoral vertical subcondylar/ramus osteotomy ranges from  $9\%$  to  $11\%$  [44, 45]. Endoscopic approaches to the ramus may have a different incidence of nerve injury, but experience with these techniques is limited [46]. The incidence of nerve injury with the VRO procedure is mostly associated with the imprecise location of the inferior alveolar nerve. Traditionally, it has been suggested that a bulge on the lateral surface of the mandible (the antilingula) corresponds to the position of the lingula on the medial aspect of the mandible. Therefore, creation of an osteotomy posterior to the anti-lingula should theoretically avoid injury to the inferior alveolar nerve medially. Hogan and Ellis showed that the bulge on the lateral surface of the ramus corresponds to the insertion of muscles and tendons and had no relationship to the medial position of the inferior alveolar nerve [47]. Aziz and associates showed in a cadaveric study that, in most instances, the position of the lingula was located posteroinferior to the position of the anti-lingula [48]. In only  $33\%$  of the cadaver specimens, the lingula was found anterior to the anti-lingula. They noted that if the osteotomy was made  $5\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the anti-lingula, there was no risk of damage to the neurovascular bundle. Therefore, to avoid an injury to the inferior alveolar nerve, the saw blade should parallel the posterior border of the ramus and be placed  $5\mathrm{mm}$  posterior to the bulge of the anti-lingula on the lateral aspect of the mandible. An alternative approach to positioning of the vertical osteotomy is to place it  $7\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to and parallel to the posterior border of the ramus. This ensures an adequate distance from the inferior alveolar nerve and maintains enough proximal segment bone for stability

and/or fixation. If, despite these precautions, postoperative paresthesia occurs, it should be carefully followed, although microneurosurgical repair is usually not warranted, nor is it technically feasible.

# 68.7.2.3 Motor Nerve Injury

Injury to the branches of the facial nerve is much more common with extraoral approaches than with intraoral orthognathic surgery. However, there are reports of facial nerve injuries resulting from SSOs and VROs [49-52]. In one series of 1747 SSO procedures, the incidence of facial nerve injury was  $0.26\%$  [51]. The degree of injury can vary from partial loss of motor function to total facial paralysis and is more often seen after a setback of the mandible than with mandibular advancement [50]. The possible causes of facial nerve injury during SSO setback include impingement on the nerve when the distal segment is moved posteriorly, fracture of the styloid process and subsequent displacement, and introduction of retractors behind the ascending ramus with impingement on the nerve. Most of the reported cases of facial nerve injury occurred with mandibular setbacks without use of the Hunsuck modification, where the execution of the medial osteotomy may have caused the injury. However, the most likely cause of facial nerve injury is pressure on the nerve trunk, either by the position of the distal segment or by inadvertent placement of retractors behind the posterior border of the mandible (Fig. 68.11a and b). To prevent this complication, the horizontal osteotomy should extend just distal to the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle in the retrolongular fossa when an SSO is used for mandibular setback. If the horizontal osteotomy extends to the posterior border; bony recontouring should be performed proximal to the lingula to prevent posterior

overlap in the region of the posterior border of the ramus and the facial nerve. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the mandibular setback that causes this problem is unknown (possibly  $>8\mathrm{mm}$ ) and probably varies owing to variations in individual patient anatomy. Also, care should be taken when any retractors are placed behind the mandibular posterior border during all ramus osteotomy procedures.

When a facial nerve paralysis occurs after surgery, a number of electrical tests can be used to determine the depth of injury and subsequent therapy. Electroneurography (ENOG), a study of peripheral nerve conduction, or electromyography (EMG), which is the detection and evaluation of electrical potentials from muscles, may be used diagnostically [53, 54]. It is important to distinguish between an injury that causes segmental demyelination and one that causes distal Wallerian degeneration. With axonal interruption, the ability to transmit a neuronal impulse is lost over a period of 5-7 days. When axonal degeneration occurs, the prognosis for complete spontaneous recovery is poor. When a high-grade nerve injury is noted, surgical exploration should be considered to rule out a partial or complete transection of the nerve. As long as the axon remains intact at the site of the conduction block, the nerve will continue to respond to electrical stimulation distal to the injury site even though paralysis may be present. Evoked electromyography (EEMG), a test in which the degree of muscle twitch elicited is recorded, has been used as a prognostic test [55]. If the response to EEMG remains greater than  $25\%$  at 5 days, the injury is considered mild and the prognosis for spontaneous recovery is good [55].

Clinical management of the patient during the recovery phases of the paralysis can vary depending on the

specific nerve branches, and the type of nerve injury, involved. When the patient has difficulty obtaining full eyelid closure, an eye patch and lubricating eye drops may be useful. Permanent facial nerve injury may require further surgical intervention, such as, gold weight placement in the upper eyelid to aid in eyelid closure or static or dynamic facial reanimation procedures. Physical therapy such as heat, facial massage, and facial exercises, performed twice a day, has been suggested for neurosensory reeducation. Biofeedback neurosensory exercises may consist of raising the eyebrows, blowing the cheeks, and grinning while visualizing the attempts in a mirror. Even though no facial movement may be noted, intact nerve fibers will be activated and the exercise will help to maintain muscle tone through electrical and mechanical stimulation. Systemic corticosteroids had been used orally, intramuscularly, and intravenously for facial nerve paralysis in an attempt to decrease perineurial edema from the injury.

# Key Points

Intraoperative visualized transection of the inferior alveolar nerve should be repaired at the time in surgery to increase the likelihood of recovery.

Limited medial soft tissue dissection at the region of the lingual should decrease inadvertent pressure and injury on the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle.

# 68.8 Nasal and Paranasal Sinus Considerations

# 68.8.1 Alterations in Nasal Form: Septal Deviation

Maxillary repositioning requires manipulation of nasal components, associated facial musculature, and the maxillary sinus. As a result, alterations can occur with the internal nasal anatomy, including position of the turbinates, nasal septum, and internal nasal valve. Adverse effects of maxillary osteotomies on the alar bases, nasal tip, supratip depression, and upper lip may result in an unaesthetic postoperative facial appearance [56-58]. The bony and/or cartilaginous nasal septum may be deviated before surgery, at the time of surgery, or during extubation. Therefore, the septum should be inspected before and after surgery. During a Le Fort I osteotomy, it is possible to align the septum at its inferior anterior caudal end of the nasal crest of the maxilla posterior to the anterior nasal spine region. During surgery, the septum is disarticulated from the entire nasal crest of the maxilla; and most commonly with maxillary impaction, the maxilla will encroach upon the presurgical vertical dimension of the nasal septum. Owing to

this expected change during maxillary impaction, attention must be given to careful positioning of the septum at the time of surgery. Failure to do so may result in septal deviation and nasal airflow obstruction, or the end result may be an abnormal position of the columella and nasal tip deviation [57]. Several techniques are used to avoid septal deviation during superior maxillary repositioning, including resection of a portion of the inferior aspect of the bony (vomer) and cartilaginous nasal septum, or creating a deep groove in the superior aspect of the maxilla to prevent septal deviation as well as stabilize the septum in the midline. In segmental maxillary osteotomies, creating a bony island with parasagittal palatal cuts may eliminate posterior superior pressure of the nasomaxillary crest on the nasal septum, although this will not eliminate pressure from the anterior portion of the maxilla on the nasal septum.

When septal deviation is recognized postoperatively, three choices for management should be considered, including immediate manual repositioning, reoperation with reduction of the caudal septum, or a septoplasty at a later surgical procedure. If appropriate preventive measures were accomplished at the time of surgery, but postoperatively the nasal septum appears to be asymmetrical, this could be postoperative edema that may resolve spontaneously or may have occurred during extubation. In the early postoperative period, manipulation with a blunt instrument (e.g., Boies elevator or Asch nasal septum forceps) placed within the nasal cavity on each side of the base of the nasal septum may accomplish manual septal repositioning into a midline position. If rigid fixation has been used and the patient has no airway difficulties, short-term unilateral nasal packing on the side of the deviation may be considered. If septal deviation was not recognized during surgery, or if postoperative manipulation fails to correct it, immediate reoperation with caudal septal resection, with or without the need to remove the rigid fixation for surgical access, may be indicated. If these approaches are not acceptable to either the patient or the surgeon, and the patient does not have significant airway difficulties or cosmetic concerns, the septal deviation may be reevaluated at a later date with consideration for a standard septoplasty procedure, if necessary, and after complete resolution of edema and bony and soft tissue healing (Fig. 68.12a-c).

# 68.8.2 Alterations in Nasal Form: Internal Nasal Valve

Alteration of the internal nasal anatomy, nasal airway resistance, and breathing patterns as a result of maxillary surgery is an area of concern. Expansion of the maxilla has shown little change in the nasal airway resistance,

![](images/e1141b9982ef6469601ff05687b12b97554910458cef5897f5d4ee9309819f84.jpg)

and many patients remain obligate mouth breathers even after maxillary expansion surgery [59]. Of greater concern is the possibility that superiorly repositioning the maxilla may decrease the normal nasal airflow owing to an overall decreased dimension of the nasal cavity. Several studies have documented that the reverse is true, and that superior maxillary repositioning increases the nasal cross-sectional area, decreases nasal airway resistance, and increases nasal breathing due to an alteration in the angulation of nasal valve area [60-62]. The internal nasal valve is formed by the junction of the nasal septum and the upper lateral nasal cartilages, and the normal angle formed in this region is 10-15 degrees. In contrast, the "external" nasal valve is essentially formed by the nares, which are composed of the floor of the nose and the soft tissues within the nasal sill. The increase in alar base width that results from elevating the soft tissues to expose the maxilla causes a slight widening of the internal nasal valve, increasing the angle of the internal nasal valve ( $>20$  degrees), thereby reducing nasal airway resistance. The internal nasal valve is at the smallest cross-sectional area of the nasal airway, and slight alterations in this area have a significant effect on nasal breathing, whereas changes in larger intranasal areas have a much less effect on nasal airflow. This same phenomenon has been demonstrated in patients with cleft palates [63]. The effect of maxillary impaction on nasal airway resistance is determined preoperatively using the Cottle test, performed with lateral digital traction on the malar region to open the angle of the internal nasal valve while occluding the contralateral nostril; an improvement in nasal airflow is typically expected with this maneuver.

# 68.8.3 Alterations in Nasal Form: Alar Base

In addition to the internal nasal changes, facial aesthetic changes in nasal morphology may result from maxillary surgery. Failure to properly manage the nasal septum, paranasal musculature, and labial mucosa may result in undesirable facial aesthetic results. Adverse changes in nasal and perioral configuration after maxillary surgery may include excessive alar base widening; increased prominence of the alar groove; upturning of the nasal tip (with an obtuse nasolabial angle); flattening, shortening, and thinning of the upper lip; and down-turning of the labial commissures [57]. These complications may be compounded by internal deviation of the nasal septum, or asymmetrical positioning of the columella and nasal tip due to septal deviation. These types of problems are difficult to manage and are best treated with prevention. The need to control alar base width and the necessity of reconstruction of paranasal and perioral musculature have been described previously [56]. It should be remembered that any maxillary movement results in alar base widening due to musculature reflection off the anterior maxilla, and maxillary advancement contributes to even further alar base expansion. Therefore, all Le Fort procedures should incorporate a closure technique that includes an alar base cinch suture to control the degree of alar base widening and attempt to reestablish the presurgical alar base width. Undesirable upper lip changes can be prevented by the use of a low vestibular incision, and the use of a V-to-Y or double V-to-Y closure when indicated to preserve or increase upper lip vermilion display (Fig. 68.13a-c).

# 68.8.4 Postoperative Sinus Disease

Postoperative complications related to the maxillary sinususes are primarily a result of sinus infections, alteration or interruption of the sinus drainage system, and the persistence of an oroantral fistula. Although many patients experience sinus discharge or excessive nasal drainage and other sinus symptoms in the immediate postoperative period, true perioperative infections of the sinus region and the development of chronic sinusitis after Le Fort surgery are rare [64, 65]. Between 2 and 6 months after surgery, there will be normalization of the bony and soft tissue structures in over  $55\%$  of the patients, although, at 6 months, as many as  $30\%$  of Le Fort osteotomy patients will show some latent sinus mucosal edema and lack of normal mucociliary function [65]. The pseudociliated stratified ciliated columnar epithelium of the sinus mucosa may also undergo a

squamous metaplasia after surgery that may lead to alterations in normal sinus function.

Despite the rarity of postoperative sinus infections, there are several potential causes of infections after maxillary orthognathic surgery. The formation and retention of substantial hematomas in the sinus cavity is an obvious source of potential infection. Perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis with continued postoperative oral systemic antibiotics will help to prevent the blood clot from becoming infected before resorption. Other potential causes of infection in the sinus include preexisting sinus disease, a history of smoking, dental infection due to trauma to the teeth during the surgery (segmental procedures), soft tissue ischemia and vascular compromise (again, with segmental surgery), and the presence of debris or retention of foreign bodies within the sinus. Foreign objects such as wires, bone plates, or screws are rarely the isolated cause of a sinus

infection and do not appear to cause a significant increase in the incidence of infection after maxillary surgery [64].

Preoperative assessment of patients presenting for maxillary surgery should include a history and clinical examination, with careful attention to symptoms of any preexisting maxillary sinus disease. Evaluation of preoperative radiographs may provide some information regarding the presence of occult sinus pathology. Postoperative management of sinus infections should include appropriate antibiotic therapy verified by culture and sensitivity, decongestants, intranasal vasoconstrictors, and irrigation of patent fistulae, if present. Generally, sinus drainage can be managed to resolution within 10-14 days with these techniques. When a sinus infection is refractory to medical treatment, endoscopy, and possible surgical drainage of the sinus should be considered, and this sinus disease should be managed in a manner similar to treatment for patients with sinus disease who have not had Le Fort surgery with standard techniques.

# 68.9 Unanticipated Mandibular Osteotomy Fractures

# 68.9.1 Management of bad Splits

The intraoperative management of unusual osteotomy fragments (bad splits) is seen more frequently with mandibular procedures, especially the SSO, due to the osteotomy design which has two right-angle turns, where fractures in the bone may occur. The creation of additional osteotomy segments may occur on either the proximal or the distal bone fragments, or both. The incidence of unfavorable fractures with a BSSO is  $1.9 - 2.2\%$  with a slightly higher incidence when the third molars are present or have not been removed at least 9 months before surgery, and depending upon the individual patient anatomy, these bad splits may occur in either the proximal or the distal segment [66, 67]. The standard method for intraoperative management of a bad split is to complete the separation of the proximal and distal segments and then assess the pattern of inappropriate fracture. Typically, bad splits can be addressed adequately via the same intraoral access used for the procedure, and transcervical access is rarely used. Management will vary depending on the size (small vs. large) as well as the specific location of the fragment. It must first be determined where the fracture deviated from the desired split, and of course, how to possibly prevent a similar occurrence on the other side or in the future. Often, it is necessary to remove the free segment to gain access to

the remaining mandible. A saw or a bur may be used to create a groove on the intact mandible or individual fracture segments so that the SSO can occur along the original planned lines of osteotomy; chisels can be used to complete the desired split. The key to management is to visualize the damage and determine the precise orientation of the problem geometrically. Once the split is successfully completed, the distal segment can be advanced to its desired position. The position and size of the remaining fragments may make positioning of the condylar segment difficult. Segments are sequentially stabilized with plates and screws to the remaining bony fragments. An extraoral approach may be an option, but is usually not necessary. The following examples will illustrate the management of specific unanticipated osteotomy fractures.

# 68.9.2 Proximal Segment Buccal Plate Fracture, Partial

The difficulty in managing free bone segments depends on the location and size of the fractured pieces of bone. A fragment may shear off the lateral aspect of the proximal segment, thereby leaving the distal mandible intact. Whenever a buccal fragment shears off, the usual cause is an inadequate bone cut at the inferior border of the lateral vertical osteotomy. The split must then be completed, and as mentioned, this can be done by making a deep groove on the inferior border and connecting it with the previous osteotomy as it extends down the external oblique ridge. With gentle manipulation and prying and, when necessary, sectioning bone, the segments can be separated as originally planned. Stabilization of the distal segment with application of IMF will allow easier stabilization of the free buccal plate fragment with screws and plates.  $\square$  Figure 68.14 shows a buccal plate fracture and the main portion of the mandible is intact before completion of the split, so the free segment is stabilized with plate and screw osteosynthesis, as shown in  $\square$  Fig. 68.15. Condylar position is not difficult to establish when a proximal segment is large enough to be positioned with adequate overlap and contact with the distal segment in its new position, and bicortical screws can be used, as usual, between the areas of contact of the two segments. With a small free buccal plate fragment, it is frequently easier to place a plate on the segment on the back table and then stabilize it to the proximal segment (Fig. 68.16a and b), although a very small buccal plate fracture segment may not need to be replaced, especially if it does not occur near the inferior border that might result in an unaesthetic postoperative result with excessive antegonial notching.

# 68.9.3 Proximal Segment Buccal Plate Fracture, Complete

When the buccal plate fracture occurs more superiorly, or there is a plan for a large mandibular advancement such that there will be no contact between the proximal and the distal segments when the occlusion is corrected

(68.17), a different approach must be used. When the condyle and coronoid process are contained in the same proximal segment, owing to a horizontal osteotomy that is created too deeply on the medial ramus, and simulating a horizontal osteotomy of the mandible, control of condylar position is more difficult. The large proximal fragment should be stabilized with rigid fixa

![](images/3b946e7f835d5b6644c04a1d31efbcbac6c98708f02188204dca9d2e886f7f7d.jpg)

tion either in situ preferably or on the back table (but this would require disarticulation); the fragment should be then stabilized to the remainder of proximal segment (Fig. 68.18). This may require a percutaneous transbuccal approach for screw placement or the use of right-angled instrumentation. At this point, the proximal

segment is easier to manipulate as a complete unit, and it can be fixated to the distal segment into its planned position. This can be accomplished with the use of several plates or bicortical screws. Control of condylar position may be established by posterior, superior, and vertical pressure on the proximal segment, followed by the use of a proximal-distal clamp (e.g., Jeter-Van Sickels) before placement of bicortical screws or by using the clamp on the coronoid process to stabilize the proximal fragment before screw placement.

Another bad split that can occur is the creation of a subcondylar or condylar neck fracture with a condylar fragment separated from the proximal segment. In this case, the condyle must be rigidly fixated to the proximal segment to create a single proximal segment, and then the proximal and distal segments can be stabilized as usual for an SSO (Fig. 68.19). Correct condylar positioning is extremely difficult to achieve in this setting, especially with a small condylar stump. The use of transbuccal percutaneous incisions may assist in the placement of a plate on the condylar fragment, and then the plate can be used as a handle to manipulate the condyle until holes can be drilled in the distal segment with screw placement and application of fixation. Alternatively, an endoscope-assisted technique can be used to improve visualization and application of fixation in this confined region.

# 68.9.4 Distal Segment Lingual Plate Fracture

Fortunately, fractures of the lingual plate of the distal segment occur less frequently than fractures of the buccal plate of the proximal segment. The underlying cause is frequently an impacted third molar, or an incomplete osteotomy of the medial horizontal ramus or of the sagittal component of the SSO with the creation of a wedging effect on the medial aspect of the mandible (Fig. 68.20).

![](images/f97c7108ce35d829f6c145b1688ed17af12de3d381e9b5074f4f7a66dba0643f.jpg)  
Fig. 68.20 Lingual split/osteotomy of the distal segment in the third molar region

To prevent this type of inadvertent fracture, it is best to remove mandibular third molars at least 9 months before surgery. When an unanticipated fracture occurs, the osteotomy must be completed along the original planned osteotomy lines. Because the resultant free lingual segment is not an obstruction when the osteotomy is completed, it generally maintains a substantial muscular and vascular pedicle attached to it. The distal segment is then stabilized with the application of IMF, and the free lingual plate fragment is manipulated into an anterior position in contact with the distal segment and is fixated to the proximal segment using one or more bicortical screws. Then, one or more plates may be used on the buccal aspect of the osteotomy site for fixation of the proximal and distal segments (Fig. 68.21a and b).

# Key Points

"Bad splits" of either the proximal and distal segments should most importantly be recognized intraoperatively, and equally as important, be managed immediately. Options for management are fixation of the bad splits with monocortical plates and screws, bicortical positional screws, or treated with a period of postoperative maxillomandibular fixation.

# 68.10 Displacement of the Proximal VRO Segment

Excessive lateral displacement of the proximal segment can occur during a vertical subcondylar osteotomy. Depending on the geometry of the movement of the distal segment, the proximal, or condylar, segment may be displaced either laterally or medially. The desired position is to have the proximal segment in a lateral position

![](images/b4a1c5b832bfcf07528108df23328642140b1f4ca94b046a2e45d71c03ff11f1.jpg)

to the distal segment of the mandible. Despite moderate flaring of the proximal segment, typically considerable remodeling occurs at that allows accommodation of this position without any problems. Occasionally, however, the proximal segment will be flared excessively, especially with an asymmetrical movement of the mandible. This can be addressed intraoperatively by removing a second wedge at the sigmoid notch region to allow a more passive relationship of the proximal and distal segment without interferences that result in extreme lateral displacement of the proximal segment (Fig. 68.22). Care must be exercised when performing bony cuts in the sigmoid region because the masseteric artery, or the internal maxillary artery, can be injured. If excessive flaring is noted postoperatively either clinically or radiographically, the segment may be repositioned manually; but if this is not successful, reoperation with open repositioning may be necessary.

In some cases of asymmetry, the rotation of the distal mandible may cause the proximal condylar fragment to be displaced medial to the distal segment. There is a concern that this position may increase the incidence of nerve injury. While generally true, medial displacement of the proximal segment rarely causes a significant clinical problem. An uncommon patient complaint may be irritation of the posterior pharyngeal region due to con

$\square$  Fig. 68.22 Excessive flaring of the proximal segment by premature contact at the sigmoid notch; correction by bone wedge removal from distal segment, wider at the sigmoid region than at the inferior border

tact from the proximal segment. If this occurs, the proximal segment should be repositioned or reintoured or a significant portion should be removed, likely in the inferior aspect of the proximal segment.

Finally, the relationship of the proximal and distal segments may form a butt joint with direct contact despite posterior repositioning of the distal segment. This would result in a clockwise rotation of the condyle that typically does not cause problems, but may contribute to short- and long-term relapse if there is significant tension on the posterior soft tissues with a tendency to displace the segments anteriorly.

# 68.11 Proximal Segment Rotation

Lack of control with an SSO can have both aesthetic and functional consequences. Postoperatively, the temporalis and masseter muscles pull the proximal segment anteriorly and superiorly, while the distal segment is pulled posteriorly and inferiorly by the mylohyoid, geniohyoid, genioglossus, and suprahyoid muscles (Fig. 68.23). Therefore, this anterior and superior counterclockwise rotation of the proximal segment and clockwise rotation of the distal segment may result in an unpleasant cosmetic result with flattening of the gonial angle and notching the inferior border of the mandible in the antegonial notch region. It may cause an unaesthetic protuberance in the cheek region secondary to the lateral positioning of the proximal segment. The type of fixation (wires vs. plates and screws) has been shown to affect the position

![](images/92c9b89e15e1f461f06f3d4b76344e8ef7ed58c18ecbfe64804102f3c884a3c1.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 68.23 Diagram of relapse of mandibular orthognathic surgery, with counterclockwise rotation of the proximal segment and clockwise rotation of the distal segment

of the proximal segment both during surgery as well as in the immediate postoperative period [68].

The most ideal management of a rotated proximal segment is prevention. Several positioning appliances have been used to control the proximal segment during mandibular orthognathic surgery [69-71]. When rigid fixation is used, without positioning appliances, minimal insignificant rotation of the proximal segment may occur [68]. However, there is a tendency to rotate the proximal segment medially and superiorly as a result of large advancements [72]. This can lead to an unaesthetic result, especially if there was any discrepancy in the height of the ramus before surgery.

The exact degree of rotation of the proximal segment that will cause clinically significant decreases in muscular bite forces or unaesthetic facial changes remains unknown; however, excessive rotation of the proximal segment should be assessed with regard to functional (decreased bite force generation or hypomobility) or aesthetic (loss of the gonial angle) problems, or both. An aesthetic problem in a patient with an acceptable occlusal result may be treated with the use of an alloplastic implant. If the patient has an occlusal problem, as well as aesthetic concerns, the SSO may need to be revised with surgery. When a malocclusion and unaesthetic result are combined with a decrease in bite force and/or hypomobility of the mandible, reoperation with application of rigid fixation must be combined with an aggressive postoperative physiotherapy regimen.

After any orthognathic surgical procedure, most patients demonstrate a limitation in the degree of maximum interincisal opening. The most dramatic decreases are seen after BSSO procedures [69]. TMJ hypomobility should be restored with the use of postoperative physiotherapy. Ellis examined the range of mandibular motion after an SSO advancement osteotomy in monkeys, when either IMF or rigid osseous fixation was used [73]. Animals that did not have IMF maintained after surgery demonstrated a greater range of motion in the early postsurgical period and attained the preoperative level of mobility by 12 weeks after surgery. Animals that underwent 6 weeks of IMF showed significant decreases in range of motion when compared with the rigid fixation group at each time period after surgery. Several clinical studies have shown that, regardless of whether IMF or rigid fixation is used, with postoperative physiotherapy, a normal, or near-normal, range of motion will typically return by 2 years after surgery [67, 74].

There are several potential causes of hypomobility in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. Scar tissue induced by the surgery may play a major role in limited mouth opening. However, postoperative immobilization can compound the effects of surgical dissection and have adverse effects on the muscles, joints, and sur

rounding connective tissues. Immobilization by itself induces muscle atrophy with a marked decrease in muscle fiber diameter. This problem may be compounded if the muscle is immobilized in a position where the overall length of the muscle has been shortened. In addition, the use of IMF causes deleterious effects on the TMJ, such as a series of degenerative changes in articular cartilage and synovial membranes, leading to decreased function of the synovium, decreased production of joint fluid, and intra-articular stasis leading to fibrous changes in the TMJ with hypomobility.

Techniques used to eliminate or minimize the period of immobilization will likely decrease postsurgical hypomobility. Despite this, it is strongly suggested that all patients have routine presurgical evaluation of muscle and joint function and a systematic rehabilitation regimen as part of their postsurgical program. Mandibular ramus procedures are potentially the most harmful to the surrounding connective tissues of the jaws. Mandibular advancements, in particular, are susceptible to postoperative hypomobility. If rigid fixation is used, mild self-directed physiotherapy beginning 1-2 weeks after surgery may suffice, consisting of either active or passive jaw exercises. When a patient's progress is limited or when surgery has been associated with longer periods of IMF, more aggressive physical therapy is often required. If this is unsuccessful, intra-articular pathology may be responsible for the problem and additional steps may need to be taken to restore a normal range of motion, such as arthroscopic lysis and lavage, if indicated [75].

# 68.12 Unanticipated Maxillary Fractures

Whereas the literature has focused on the management of bad splits with mandibular osteotomies, little attention has been focused on inadvertent osteotomies encountered during maxillary surgery. With modified cuts of the maxilla (e.g., stepped osteotomy), the bone leading to the zygomatic buttress may be thin and more easily prone to fracture (Fig. 68.24). Management may be accomplished by using a plate and screws on either side of the gap or fractured segment of bone, and then reinserting the fragment behind the plate if necessary (Fig. 68.25). In many cases, a small free segment of the thin anterior maxillary wall may be scarified without any consequence, and this may be preferable to replacement as a free graft.

In addition, perhaps the most common unanticipated maxillary fracture with Le Fort surgery is the unpredictable fracture that occurs in the pterygoid plate region. Many studies using postoperative computed tomography scans have shown that the posterior

![](images/a73fe8d80fac45b9d21c3672402f7970133308fa5a28f141e6c420238000531e.jpg)

$\square$  Fig. 68.25 Rigid fixation to span defect; bone segment repositioned

osteotomy may occur in a variety of locations, including the maxillary alveolus in the area of the second molar, horizontally through the pterygoid plates, or even superiorly near the base of the skull. These inadvertent fractures may occur in these aberrant locations despite the appropriate use of the pterygoid plate osteotome in the pterygomaxillary fissure, because access to the medial aspect of the pterygomaxillary junction is limited. Typically, these eccentric fractures have little clinical consequence in the majority of patients; however, the risks of neural and vascular injury, as well as the possibility of intracranial communication, do exist.

Despite careful preoperative treatment planning, either over-impaction or under-impaction of the maxilla may occur at the time of Le Fort surgery. This complication can be avoided with the use of internal, or preferably external, reference points. One option for external reference landmarks is to place a K-wire or Steinmann pin in the nasal bones at the nasion at the commencement of surgery and to take intraoperative measurements that will ensure that the maxilla is placed in the appropriate position at the end of surgery based upon the intended degree of impaction or downgrafting [76]. If the maxilla is found to be under-impacted after surgery, very few options exist, although removal of plates and screws with placement of skeletal suspension wires in the outpatient setting has been advocated. Typically, a return to surgery to reposition and stabilize the maxilla into the correct position is warranted. When the maxilla is over-impacted, it is usually not possible to use multiple heavy vertical elastics in the early postoperative period to pull the maxilla inferiorly, and reoperation should be considered.

# 68.13 Postoperative Occlusal Discrepancies

Occlusal abnormalities may be related to a number of factors in the preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative phases of patient management. As a general rule, the majority of occlusal discrepancies between what was intended and what was obtained can be traced back to inaccuracies in preoperative patient records [77].

# 68.13.1 Anterior Open Bite Malocclusions

Anterior open bites (apertognathia) after orthognathic surgery may be the result of technical difficulties seen with both the maxilla and the mandible at the time of surgery. With the maxilla, these include posterior inter

ferences that are not recognized when IMF is applied during surgery. Essentially, the IMF will attempt to close the "open bite" present due to posterior interferences and pull the condyles out of the glenoid fossa by doing so. If the maxilla is fixated with condyles not seated passively, with dislocation out of the glenoid fossa, when the IMF is released, there will be an immediate relapse with an open bite malocclusion. Occasionally, however, the open bite is not recognized until the next day owing to muscle relaxation and edema, and depending on the severity of the open bite, a return to the operating room for repositioning may be required.

Open bites that occur after orthodontic appliances have been removed may be due to relapse of surgically or orthodontically treated maxillary transverse discrepancies. Any molar interferences created after surgery may significantly affect the development of an open bite anteriorly. Surgical and orthodontic correction of severe maxillary transverse discrepancies have been noted to be unstable, and when relapse of the transverse correction occurs, it is usually manifested by an anterior open bite malocclusion [78]. Management of late open bites will depend on their severity; they typically respond to posterior occlusal equilibration with enameloplasty of the molar interferences and rarely require reoperation. In addition, the development of an open bite in the long-term postoperative period may be due to condylar resorption with large mandibular advancements, as described previously.

In addition, anterior open bites have been noted to recur years after initial treatment with both orthodontics and surgery [78]. The stability of orthodontic therapy varies depending upon the orthodontic techniques used to manage the open bite relationship [79]. Rotation of incisors that are flared with closure of an open bite may be no more problematic than for other tooth movements. When extrusion of teeth has occurred with orthodontic mechanics, the results are less predictable, and the mechanism of this phenomenon is somewhat controversial. Tooth extrusion may have caused an increased sensitivity to external factors, such as the tongue and circumoral musculature, which may predispose the occlusion to apertognathia. Lack of stability or recurrence of the open bite is, therefore, thought to be due to the continued presence of etiologic factors (e.g., tongue thrust habit) and failure of biologic and functional adaptation. A variety of measures may be taken to correct these problems, including orthodontic cribs or appliances, to decrease the influence of external factors or surgical techniques such as a partial glossectomy, although these are not commonly performed.

# 68.14 Miscellaneous Complications

Owing to the proximity of the nasal endotracheal tube (ETT) to the maxilla and maxillary osteotomy sites, ETTs may be injured from drills, saws, or osteotomes during maxillary orthognathic surgery and, in some cases, reintubation is required, while, in others, packing around the ETT is sufficient. In order to avoid this complication, a wire-reinforced ETT may be preferable, although the rarity of this occurrence does not warrant major changes to routine.

Alar rim injuries, with alar necrosis, are due to pressure on the alar rim from a nasotracheal tube. Care should be taken when wrapping the head so that there is no pressure on the tip of the nose, alar rim, forehead, and ears from the ETT or its components.

Soft tissue emphysema in the cervical and facial regions has been noted after a variety of procedures that may be unrelated to orthognathic surgery. However, there are several reports of air in the soft tissues of the head, neck, and chest after Le Fort I osteotomies [80]. Subcutaneous emphysema of the cheeks is likely due to forceful blowing of the nose postoperatively, which allows air to escape into the surrounding tissues through the maxillary sinus ostium. Forceful coughing can allow air to pass into the retropharyngeal space and into the mediastinum. Alternatively, rupture of a perivascular bleb or traumatic introduction of air through the cervical fascia is also possible. It is imperative the patients follow appropriate sinus precautions and that positive pressure devices (e.g., CPAP) are not used in the acute postoperative phase. Subcutaneous emphysema may be managed by observation, heat, and systemic antibiotics. Therapy for pneumomediastinum consists of close observation, cardiac monitoring, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics. Chest tubes or drainage of the mediastinum may be necessary, but supplemental oxygen, as well as pulmonary physiotherapy, should be used.

# 68.14.1 Epiphora

Epiphora may be seen after Le Fort osteotomy and is frequently due to edema of the nasal mucosa. Alternatively, the nasolacrimal ductal drainage system may be injured when a concomitant partial inferior turbinectomy is performed during a maxillary osteotomy. Damage to the nasolacrimal apparatus may also occur if the bone cut for the Le Fort is placed too far superiorly along the medial wall of the sinus (i.e., lateral nasal wall). The incidence of nasolacrimal injury is

infrequent, usually transient, and resolves spontaneously. Meticulous soft tissue dissection and carefully placed osteotomies around the medial aspect of the piriform aperture may decrease the incidence of epiphora. Persistent excessive eye tearing that does not decrease after 3 weeks may need to be addressed with a dacryocystorhinostomy procedure.

# 68.14.2 Auriculotemporal Syndrome

The auriculotemporal syndrome, syndrome of gustatory sweating, or Frey's syndrome, is an unusual complication typically seen as a result of parotid gland surgery. After an injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, the symptoms are believed to be caused by a misdirected regeneration of parasympathetic fibers to denervated sweat glands, resulting in sweating of the cheek during mastication and salivation; this condition is diagnosed with an iodine-starch test. A number of authors have reported Frey's syndrome occurring after extraoral VRO and BSSO procedures, with symptoms occurring between 3 months and 3 years after orthognathic surgery [81-84]. Mild cases in which the patient may have symptoms only with spicy foods should be observed, because the symptoms may decrease with time. A variety of treatments have been suggested for more severe symptoms, including topical scopolamine patches and insertion of fascia lata or acellular human dermis matrix under the skin [85]. Because topical scopolamine has a number of undesirable side effects, there have been reports of the use of botulinum toxin as a successful treatment for this problem [86, 87].

# 68.14.3 Facial Scars

Although attempts are made to camouflage extraoral site incisions, unattractive facial scarring may occasionally occur. Egyedi et al. noted six undesirable scars in a group of 100 patients with extraoral incisions for orthognathic surgery, although the criteria used to determine what was undesirable are unknown [88]. Percutaneous incisions of  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$ , such as those used for transbuccal trocars for placement of mandibular positional screws, seldom leave significant scars, and the more common problem occurs when the epidermis adheres to the underlying fascia and muscle, with puckering or retraction of the skin. Scar revisions can improve the appearance of existing scars, although a scar will always be present. Other options for scar management include massage, injection of corticosteroids, and dermabrasion or laser resurfacing. With the use of intraoral techniques and endoscope-assisted surgery, most skin incisions can be avoided.

It should be noted that iatrogenic scarring of the cheek with skin retraction may occur during an SSO using bicortical screws placed with a transbuccal trocar approach. Whereas the majority of the skin puncture sites on the cheek heal without visible scars, there may be excessive scarring of the site, especially if the metal trocar becomes heated from the rotation of an eccentric drill bit during drilling the holes for the bicortical screws. The burn injury may require local wound care, intralesional steroid injections, or excision. Also, although the risk of salivary fistula exists through this trocar site, it would represent a rare occurrence.

# 68.14.4 Dysphagia

Persistent dysphagia after orthognathic surgery is an uncommon complication, but has been documented. Less than  $2\%$  of patients report difficulty swallowing following orthognathic surgery, but the vast majority resolve within a short period of time. In rare circumstances, placement of a nasogastric feeding tube may be indicated for prolonged dysphagia until normal swallowing function returns [89].

# 68.14.5 Salivary Gland Injuries

Injuries to the parotid gland can occur with extraoral approaches for orthognathic surgical procedures. Painless swelling, parotid sialoceles, and fistulae have been reported in the first week after surgery [90]. The treatment of sialoceles or salivary fistulae may include the use of antisialogogue (anticholinergic) medications, pressure dressings, aspiration or drainage, botulinum toxin injection, and low-dose radiation to decrease salivary flow via induction of glandular atrophy. Sialogrophy is not recommended in the acute phases of these injuries, because the contrast may extravasate into the soft tissues with inflammation or the procedure may create a larger fistula or increase the size of the current fistula. Resolution of a sialocele should be expected within 4 weeks with the appropriate use of nonsurgical therapies, and failure of these treatment options may require a more invasive surgical procedure.

# Conclusion

Complications do occur during orthognathic surgery, and the clinician must be aware of the myriad possible consequences in order to most appropriately manage or prevent these from occurring. The surgeon must also be able to adequately explain a detailed informed consent with patients and families before orthognathic surgery. In most cases, complications from orthog-

nathic surgery can be prevented with comprehensive diagnosis and treatment planning, including a thorough history, clinical and radiographic examination, dental model analysis, and a meticulous attention to detail in the treatment, planning, and perioperative phases for maxillary and mandibular surgery.
