# Learning Aims

1. Open TMJ surgery is controversial but it still fulfills a small role in the surgical management of disc derangements.  
2. Appropriate patient selection is paramount to achieve successful surgical outcomes.  
3. Most patients have improvement in signs and symptoms with time.  
4. Anatomy of the TMJ region is unique.  
5. Outcomes of open surgery for TMJ derangement are similar to arthrocentesis/arthroscopy; therefore, these minimally invasive procedures should be the first line of surgical treatment.

# 54.1 Introduction

With a multifactorial etiology and poorly understood pathophysiology, the surgical management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders is one of the most controversial and challenging topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Without randomized clinical trials comparing treatment options for TMJ disease including surgical management, medical management, and no treatment, the true value of surgery in the management of TMJ disorders may never be established conclusively. Albeit, the literature on TMJ surgery is considered suboptimal, the results cannot be ignored and current recommendations for TMJ surgery must rely on the best available evidence [1].

The term TMJ internal derangement refers to a condition in which there are damaged intra-articular tissues leading to disturbances in the biomechanical functioning of the temporomandibular joint. By itself, TMJ internal derangement should not be considered a disease but a process that represents a variety of stages of biomechanical failure of the joint tissues which can be caused by several specific pathologic entities [2]. TMJ functional disturbances, in which the articular disc plays a central role, are referred to as TMJ disc derangements. Although they are viewed as a separate category of intra-articular conditions, some authors suggest that disc derangements and osteoarthritis are intimately related as much of their clinical course overlap [3, 4].

Historically, clinicians have recognized that surgery for disc derangements should be reserved for patients with pain or dysfunction that is severe, disabling, and is refractory to nonsurgical management. These conditions still form the basic indications for TMJ surgery. However, the approach to open surgery for TMJ disc derangements has undergone a complete metamorphosis as a result of the research and clinical results of TMJ arthrocentesis and arthroscopy. At one

time, only a handful of surgeons professed the viability of function with a displaced disc and argued against surgical repositioning of the disc. Today the philosophy is reversed, and the majority of surgeons recognize that a disc derangement does not imply an ipso facto need for surgery. Furthermore, the presence of persistent symptoms in light of disc derangement does not imply that surgical correction is necessary or imminent. Surgery is indicated only if the mechanical obstruction is felt to be the primary etiology of the patient's symptoms.

This chapter discusses the pathophysiology and possible etiologic factors of TMJ disc displacement. The chapter also describes the clinical examination and imaging assessment as well as the indications and goals for surgical intervention. A brief discussion of surgical anatomic considerations is followed by a description of the classic surgical approaches to the TMJ. Finally, a review of the most common surgical techniques for TMJ disc derangements and their clinical outcomes is also presented.

# 54.2 Pathophysiology

# 54.2.1 Clinical Course

TMJ disc derangement is a commonly found condition in which the disc is usually displaced from its normal anatomic position. Several stages of progression have been identified wherein not only the disc position, but also its configuration, is altered. The belief that TMJ disc displacements follow a progressive course is based on retrospective and cross-sectional studies [5, 6]. For a disc to become displaced, the functional capability of the associated TMJ ligaments must be compromised by deterioration, elongation, or detachment [7]. Once the disc is displaced, the absence of a normal anatomic relationship between the disc, condyle, and fossa has been identified as the most important factor in the initiation of disc deformation [8]. Studies have demonstrated that reducing disc derangements have a greater tendency to progress to nonreducing disc derangements when the posterior band of the disc shows significant plastic deformation as well as a gradual flattening of the eminence [9, 10]. Yet studies have also shown that disc displacements can remain constant over the years [6, 7, 11, 12]. Other studies have demonstrated that in the vast majority of patients with disc displacement, the signs and symptoms gradually resolved regardless of the type of treatment [13-16]. Thus, a disc displacement with reduction does not necessarily progress to disc displacement without reduction.

# 54.2.2 Etiologic Factors

Many etiologic factors have been proposed to explain the occurrence of disc derangement including trauma, joint laxity, bruxism, and changes in the joint lubrication system.

# 54.2.2.1 Trauma

Trauma is probably the most common cause of disc derangement, and this includes acute injury such as blunt trauma to the jaws or whiplash injury, or chronic trauma such as habits bruxism, or occlusal trauma. The traumatic event, or series of events, usually results in soft tissue injury that elongates, tears, or detaches ligaments and disc attachments. Additionally, the traumatic arthritis that may follow produces intra-articular bleeding that can result in fibrosis and adhesions or hyperplastic tissue leading to pain and dysfunction [17].

# 54.2.2.2 Joint Laxity

Laxity of the joint ligaments, with hypermobility, has been associated with disc derangements [18]. However, the prevalence of joint laxity does not parallel the higher presence of disc derangements. Due to the female predominance of this condition, it has been suggested that hormonal factors may also play a role in the development of disc derangements [19, 20].

# 54.2.2.3 Bruxism

Bruxism has been implicated due to the compressive overloading that stimulates production of highly reactive oxidative radicals that destroy hyaluronic acid, collagen, and proteoglycans [21].

# 54.2.2.4 Changes in the Joint Lubrication System

Although the exact mechanism of joint lubrication is still unknown, it has been suggested that it is primarily dependent upon the synovial fluid. Synovial fluid provides the nutritional and metabolic needs for the articular tissues of the joint. It has been theorized that regardless of the etiologic factor, disc derangement seems to be associated with an increased intra-articular friction preventing the smooth gliding of the joint [22]. Two major components have been identified as responsible for free joint movement: surface-active phospholipids and hyaluronic acid. Surface-active phospholipids are major boundary lubricants protecting the articular surfaces [23]. Hyaluronic acid, a high-molecular-weight mucopolysaccharide, forms a film that keeps the articular surfaces separated and prevents friction. It additionally plays an indirect role in joint lubrication by adhering to surface-active phospholipids protecting them against uncontrolled degradation by phospholipase  $\mathrm{A}_2$  [24].

Joint function remains normal until its adaptive capacity is compromised [25]. Once it is compromised, joint overloading generates a hypoxia-reperfusion cycle that induces the release of free-oxygen radicals that degrade hyaluronic acid, causing a marked decrease in synovial fluid viscosity. Moreover the lack of hyaluronic acid allows the phospholipase  $\mathrm{A}_2$  to lyse surface-active phospholipids further jeopardizing the lubrication system. The absence of lubrication will lead to increased adhesiveness, friction, shear, and rupture of articular surfaces [26].

# Key Points

TMJ internal derangement is a process that represents a variety of stages of biomechanical failure of the joint tissues.  
- Most often the cause of TMJ tissue failure is joint overload.  
A collapse in the lubrication system will lead to increased adhesiveness, friction, shear, and rupture of articular surfaces

# 54.3 Diagnosis

# 54.3.1 Clinical Diagnosis

The diagnosis of TMJ disc derangement is achieved predominantly through a thorough clinical examination. A large segment of the general population has only minimal signs and symptoms associated with disc derangements. Careful recording of the chief complaint and history of present illness is imperative, with attention being paid to the details of onset and duration of facial pain and joint noise, timing of symptoms of facial tightness, inability to open or close the mouth, and distribution of headaches. The mere coexistence of muscle dysfunction and a disc derangement does not imply a causal relationship. Concomitant sources of pain need to be identified and consultations are obtained with other medical and dental specialty services including neurology, otolaryngology, psychology, rheumatology, internal medicine, and/or general dentistry, as required. The history of previous surgical and nonsurgical treatment is equally important since the literature suggests that the likelihood of improvement in function and pain management decreases after multiple surgical procedures [27]. Imaging of the joint is performed after a thorough physical examination indicates the need for further information. When a diagnostic dilemma exists, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually required to elucidate the clinical presentation. No pain and/or dysfunction is identical to one another, and consequently no evidence of disease exists.

sequently, cookbook approaches to the diagnosis and surgical management of TMJ disc derangements should not be used. Furthermore, in the surgical decision-making process, the surgeon should not take into consideration only the specific diagnosis but also the patient's perception of the problem, the effect on activities of daily living, and the patient's overall psyche.

TMJ disc derangements can be classified into four clinical settings: joint incoordination, disc displacement with reduction, disc displacement without reduction, and anchored disc phenomenon. Qualifying descriptors are sometimes included, such as the direction of displacement, degree of disc displacement, and presence of a perforation. Unfortunately, these large diagnostic rubrics fail to identify the finer stages of the disease process. Disc morphology and severity of displacement are only gross indicators of the disease process. Although more complicated classifications such as the Wilkes classification exist, the treatments applied to the diagnostic categories have been diverse, rendering specific boiler-plate recommendations unadvisable.

# 54.3.1.1 Joint Incoordination

Joint incoordination represents the earliest indication of an increase in the frictional properties of the joint. The patients may describe the need to perform a special maneuver with the mandible to achieve a normal opening or they may describe an annoying terminal jolting sensation associated with mandibular closing. Usually there is no pain, but when present, it is typically not chronic and appears to be related to the instability of the condyle-disc relationship. Most of these cases demonstrate a reducing disc displacement, in which the disc represents a mechanical obstacle and the condyle is not permanently restricted in its range of motion.

# 54.3.1.2 Disc Displacement with Reduction

Disc displacement with reduction represents a category in which the articular disc has usually moved in an anteromedial position following the shape of the condyle and anterior slope of the glenoid fossa as well as the influence of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Posterior, medial, and lateral displacements can also occur [28]. Reduction refers to the ability of the condyle to negotiate around the disc, with the ability of the disc to assume a normal position in relation to the condyle and glenoid fossa. Normally in these patients, mouth opening is accompanied by a clicking or popping sound that is produced as the condyle passes over the posterior portion of the disc and it returns to a normal position. Clicks are typically reciprocal, occurring both during mouth opening and during mouth closing. The point in the opening cycle where the click occurs (early, middle, late) may correlate with the degree of ligament damage and

disc displacement. Patients may be asymptomatic except for the popping or clicking sound, and if the condition is unilateral, the mandible may deviate to the affected side on mouth opening. MRI studies have estimated that the prevalence of disc displacement with reduction in asymptomatic individuals is approximately  $30\%$  [29, 30]. When the condition is symptomatic, patients complain of localized preauricular pain particularly while joint loading (function). In late stages of the disease, patients could also suffer from intermittent locking, headaches, and myofascial pain that are associated with chronic parafunction of the joint.

# 54.3.1.3 Disc Displacement Without Reduction

In disc displacement without reduction, mouth opening becomes limited as the mandibular condyle fails to pass over the posterior band of the articular disc. In symptomatic patients, the overloading and stretching of the highly innervated retrodiscal tissue elicit pain at the affected joint on forced mouth opening and loading. Mandibular deviation to the affected side can be observed in unilateral cases. In some patients, a prior history of clicking or popping that involves the affected joint, or disc displacement with reduction, may precede the condition of a nonreducing disc. Patients often complain of muscle dysfunction secondary to efforts to achieve a normal mouth opening by deviating or deflecting the mandible in order to negotiate over the disc displacement. In the absence of pain, many patients are able to tolerate the restriction in mouth opening that may gradually improve over several months to years with stretching of the retrodiscal tissues.

# 54.3.1.4 Anchored Disc Phenomenon

The anchored disc phenomenon is characterized by a sudden, severe, and persistent limited mouth opening that is considerably more decreased than disc displacement without reduction (10–30 mm). Since the disc is not anatomically displaced, the highly innervated retrodiscal tissue is not compressed, and pain is only experienced when the patient attempts forced mouth opening. Research has suggested that a suction-cup effect occurs, in which the disc is adherent to the articular eminence due to a vacuum effect in the joint space and the presence of increased joint viscosity [26].

# 54.3.1.5 Other Conditions

While establishing a diagnosis of internal derangement of the TMJ, clinicians must be aware of other conditions that could mimic the signs and symptoms to TMJ disc derangement such as joint sounds, limitation of mouth opening, and facial pain. Intra-articular causes include synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodu

lar synovitis, various forms of arthritis, and primary and secondary neoplasms involving the TMJ. Extra-articular conditions include pathologies such as myofascial pain, myositis, scleroderma, masticatory muscle fibrosis, hypertrophy of the coronoid process, depressed zygomatic arch fracture, parotid gland pathology, and intraoral and lateral pharyngeal tumors.

# 54.3.2 Imaging Diagnosis

Although studies have shown that TMJ arthrography has a higher diagnostic value than computer tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of TMJ disc derangements, it has the disadvantage of being an invasive imaging modality that currently is rarely performed [31]. Magnetic resonance imaging has become the study of choice when evaluating TMJ disc derangements. The standard imaging protocol consists of oblique sagittal and coronal images of the TMJ in open- and closed-mouth positions that are obtained perpendicular and parallel to the long axis of

the mandibular condyle. Disc position and morphology as well as bony structures are clearly visualized on open- and closed-mouth images. Open-mouth images are used to evaluate the function of the disc and condyle, in which the disc position is compared to the closed-mouth images, and to differentiate disc displacement with reduction from disc displacement without reduction. Additionally T1- and T2-weighted MRI studies may be required to delineate intra-articular fluid, interstitial synovial inflammation, and overall disc morphology. In the joint incoordination phase of TMJ disease, the MRI may be normal. Conversely, a closed-mouth sagittal view of disc displacement with reduction will usually demonstrate a disc with varying degrees of displacement and possible deformation. Upon mouth opening, a click or pop sound may occur, and the MRI will show the disc back in the normal relationship to the condyle (Fig. 54.1). In the case of a disc displacement without reduction, the disc is located in a position more anterior than in patients with disc displacement with reduction. However, the disc remains displaced in the open-mouth position (Fig. 54.2). With an increasing displacement

of the disc, the retrodiscal tissue comes into contact with the condyle and sustains increasing joint loading. The loading results in decreased vascularity of the retrodiscal tissue. With the reduction in retrodiscal tissue vascularity, this tissue transforms into a fibrous band or a pseudodisc. MRI of chronically displaced retrodiscal tissues demonstrates a signal intensity of the tissue that resembles the disc itself. In fact, radiologists may inaccurately describe a disc fragmentation because only a portion of the displaced disc may display its original signal intensity. The remainder, due to alterations in the glycoprotein distribution and hence the attraction of water, demonstrates a moderate signal intensity. Adhesions or disc perforations associated with disc displacement without reduction cannot be definitively identified on an MRI. However, the evolution of new technologies may allow their visualization in the future [32]. In the case of a MRI of an anchored disc phenomenon, the disc is either in a normal or displaced position but does not change position from the closed- to the open-mouth position. Again, on T2-weighted MRI images, inflammatory fluid or increased vascularity appears as a high intensity signal (Fig. 54.3).

# Key Points

After the first surgery, each new TMJ surgical procedure decreases the success rate.  
Cookbook approaches to the diagnosis and surgical management of TMJ disc derangements should be avoided.  
The prevalence of disc displacement with reduction in asymptomatic individuals is approximately  $30\%$ .  
- Appropriate patient selection is paramount to achieve a successful surgical outcome.

# 54.4 Indications, Goals, and Outcomes Assessment

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) initially developed a criteria and guidelines for TMJ disc surgery in 1984 [33]. The standards were established through a literature review and consensus. Subsequent documents have been updated

![](images/690a45c82a3d91d2f634152b6511ebe915d48086df678d335d2e7bbadb250faf.jpg)

and further established the indications, goals, and outcomes assessment for TMJ surgery. The AAOMS Parameters of Care 2017 is the latest of such documents [34].

# 54.4.1 Indications

Surgical intervention for TMJ disc derangements is indicated only when nonsurgical therapy has been ineffective and pain and/or dysfunction is moderate to severe. Surgery is not indicated for preventive reasons in patients without pain and with satisfactory function.

The AAOMS Parameters of Care 2017 [34] established the indications for surgical therapy for TMJ disc derangements as a combination of the following:

1. Moderate-to-severe pain  
(a) TMJ pain  
(b) Preauricular pain  
(c) Referred pain (e.g., otalgia)  
2. Dysfunction that is disabling and characterized by any of the following:  
(a) Restricted range of motion  
(b) Excessive range of motion  
(c) Joint noises  
(d) Abnormal masticatory function  
3. Imaging evidence of disc derangement  
4. Arthroscopic evidence of disc derangement  
5. Need for orthognathic surgery

# 54.4.2 Goals

The general goals of any surgical intervention are to return the patient to function and/or form. In the case of the surgery of TMJ disc derangements, the goal is to return the patient to a regular diet, with some limitations, and to establish an adequate functional range of motion. However, risk factors and potential complications may preclude the complete restoration of form and function. Each patient complaint must be analyzed individually, and specific outcomes must be determined for each surgical procedure. The goals for TMJ disc derangement surgical procedures should include preservation of articular tissue to permit normalization and regeneration of synovium and a restoration of the articular relations allowing the joint structures to adapt and function through an adequate range of motion. Joint function may be asymptomatic and satisfactory in the presence of various types of disc derangement. Thus, surgically returning a displaced disc to the ideal position found in a healthy joint may not be appropriate for each individual patient. To illustrate this point, it would not be prudent to reposition a disc in a joint in which the articular tissue is so severely damaged that it is incapable of healing; in this situation, removing the disc is recommended.

Specific therapeutic goals for surgery of TMJ disc displacement established by the AAOMS Parameters of Care 2017 [34] include the following:

1. Improve function and form

2. Limited period of disability  
3. Improved range of jaw motion and/or function  
4. Appropriate understanding by patient of treatment options and acceptance of treatment plan  
5. Appropriate understanding and acceptance by the patient of favorable outcomes and known risk and complications  
6. Reduction in pain  
7. Elimination or reduction of noise in the joint  
8. Improved quality of life

# 54.4.3 Outcomes Assessment

Following any surgical intervention, the surgeon should evaluate the patient response to therapy including whether the patient feels there has been a total eradication, significant reduction, or minimal reduction of the initial complaints or no change or worsening of the condition. Studies on TMJ surgery contain a wide range of definitions of surgical success criteria or symptom improvement [35]. It is unreasonable for the surgeon to evaluate the results of an operation on the basis of attainment of a normal mouth opening. Many patients are quite satisfied with a reduction in their mouth opening, as long as their facial pain is relieved. Efforts to standardize clinical outcomes and criteria for success have been reported in the literature [36].

Favorable therapeutic outcomes established by the AAOMS Parameters of Care 2017 [34] include the following:

1. Improved masticatory function and facial form  
2. A level of pain that is of little or no concern to the patient, preferably measure objectively (e.g., visual analog scale)  
3. Improved mandibular function that is compatible with mastication, deglutition, speech, and oral hygiene  
4. A stable occlusion  
5. Limited period of disability  
6. Limit further morbidity  
7. Patient acceptance of procedure and understanding of outcomes  
8. Acceptable clinical appearance (e.g., absence of motor deficits, absence of hypertrophic scar formation, etc.)  
9. Improved quality of life

# 54.5 Nonsurgical and Minimally Invasive Surgery

Nonsurgical therapies such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, soft diet, moist heat, physical therapy, splint therapy, and behavioral therapy are, in the vast majority of the cases, the first

line of nonsurgical treatment in the management of TMJ disc derangements. Surgery should be considered only when the dysfunction or pain could not be corrected to a level of patient satisfaction by nonsurgical modalities. The role of minimally invasive procedures such as TMJ arthrocentesis and arthroscopy in the surgical management of TMJ disc derangements has been well identified in the literature [37]. Both nonsurgical therapies and minimally invasive surgery are discussed in greater detail in other chapters of this text.

# Important

Surgical intervention for TMJ disc derangements is indicated only when nonsurgical therapy or minimally invasive procedures have been ineffective.

# 54.6 Open Joint Surgery

According to a meta-analysis on surgical treatment for TMJ disc derangement, open joint surgery treatments appear to provide some benefit to patients refractory to nonsurgical therapies [37]. Multiple open joint surgical procedures have been described in the literature for the management of TMJ disc derangements. They include disc repositioning, disc repair, discectomy, and discectomy with disc replacement. Studies have suggested that success rates with these types of procedures are similar to more conservative procedures such as TMJ arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, and even modified condylotomy [38-43]. Still, some surgeons have advocated open joint procedures as first-line treatment for TMJ disc derangements [44-46]. According to Dimitroulis [1], three main controversies exist in open joint surgery:

1. The role of disc repositioning in light of the results of TMJ arthrocentesis and arthroscopic lysis and lavage  
2. The necessity for disc replacement after discectomy  
3. The use of alloplastic TMJ replacement for end-stage TMJ disease

# 54.6.1 Surgical Anatomy

# 54.6.1.1 Fascial Layers

Anterior to the auricle, the auricularis anterior and superior muscles overlie the superficial temporalis fascia and the temporalis fascia. These muscles are incised in the classic preauricular and endaural approaches. The fascia superficial to the muscles is thin and a dull white color. This layer is confluent with the galea aponeurotica above and the parotideomasseteric fascia below. The temporalis fascia is a tough fibrous connective tissue layer, substantially thicker than the overlying superficial fascia. It

![](images/9ae1b2a357f38311e0f543d7f7195ecb1985875a2324c29a2efc4a7560be79f1.jpg)

is stark white and extends from the superior temporal line of the temporal bone to the zygomatic arch. The deep surface furnishes one of the origins of the temporalis muscle. Inferiorly, at a variable distance, the fascia splits into two well-defined layers (Fig. 54.4). The outer layer attaches to the lateral margin of the superior border of the zygomatic arch and the inner layer to the medial margin. A small quantity of fat, the zygomatico-orbital branch of the temporal artery, and zygomaticotemporal branch of the maxillary nerve are located between the fascial layers in this area. The splitting of the fascial layers is most noticeable at the level of the zygomatic arch. Posteriorly, superior to the glenoid fossa, the separation is not as well defined (Fig. 54.5).

# 54.6.1.2 Facial Nerve (Main Trunk and Frontal Branch)

Numerous authors have studied the anatomic relations of the facial nerve to determine clinically applicable landmarks for its main trunk, the temporofacial division, and the temporal branches. Al-Kayat and Bramley [47] noted that the facial nerve bifurcated into temporo

![](images/666e4d4fa81d46141d25e48bdd1145d9bbb6d4aa278a8759efc0794837b73c0f.jpg)

facial and cervicofacial components within  $2.3\mathrm{~cm}$  (range  $1.5 - 2.8\mathrm{~cm}$ ) inferior to the lowest concavity of the bony external auditory canal and within  $3.0\mathrm{~cm}$  (range  $2.4 - 3.5\mathrm{~cm}$ ) in an inferoposterior direction from the postglenoid tubercle. The temporal nerve branches lie closest to the joint and are the most commonly injured branches during surgery. These nerves are located in a condensation of superficial fascia, temporalis fascia, and periosteum as they cross the zygomatic arch. The most posterior temporal branches lie anteriorly to the postglenoid tubercle. Their location was measured as  $2.0\mathrm{~cm}$  (range  $0.8 - 3.5\mathrm{~cm}$ ) from the anterior margin of the bony external auditory canal (Fig. 54.6). Using a high-resolution MRI and the same landmarks as Al-Kayat and Bramley, Miloro and colleagues [48] found that the temporal branch is in a slightly less vulnerable position during a preauricular approach with a mean distance of  $2.12\mathrm{~cm}$  (range  $1.7 - 2.5\mathrm{~cm}$ ). Thus, the two potential sources of facial nerve injury are dissection anterior to the posterior glenoid tubercle where the temporal branches cross the arch and aggressive retraction at the inferior margin of the flap where the main trunk and temporofacial division are located.

The auriculotemporal nerve represents the first branch of the third division of the trigeminal nerve  $(\mathrm{V}_{3})$  after exiting the skull through the foramen ovale. It runs medial to lateral behind the neck of the mandibular condyle to give the sensitivity of the skin of the temporal and preauricular region, the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane. The other branch of this nerve descends to innervate the TMJ capsule, and it also enters the joint in a posterolateral fashion to innervate the retrodiscal tissues. Damage to this branch is inevitable during a classic open TMJ surgery but rarely gives clinical problems.

# 54.6.1.4 Superficial Temporal Vessels

The superficial temporal artery (STA) is one of the terminal branches of the external carotid artery. It normally runs with the superficial temporal vein posterior to the condylar neck approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to external auditory canal. Before it crosses the posterior portion of the zygomatic arch, the STA gives rise to the transverse facial artery that runs in an anterior direction. Then it continues all the way to the temporal fossa where it divides into two branches: frontal and parietal. The superficial temporal vessels are typically located in the superficial fascia below the auricularis anterior muscle. The vessels are often visible, invested in the superficial fascia without incising the muscle. The superficial temporal vein lies posterior to the artery and the auriculotemporal nerve immediately behind the vessels.

# 54.6.1.5 Internal Maxillary Artery

The internal maxillary artery, or maxillary artery, emerges from the external carotid artery deep and posterior to the mandible at the level of the sigmoid notch. The internal maxillary artery crosses laterally to the external pterygoid muscle in  $50\%$  of the cases and medially to the muscle in the other  $50\%$ . Additionally, according to Turvey and Fonseca [49], the internal maxillary artery exits the infratemporal fossa  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$  above the pterygomaxillary fissure. Injury to this vessel could create a considerable hemorrhage especially in cases that require osteotomy of the condylar neck.

# 54.6.2 Surgical Approaches

The classic surgical approaches to the TMJ may be classified as preauricular, endaural, and postauricular. The choice of approach is usually a matter of surgeon preference and is based on his or her ability and surgical experience. Cosmetic considerations may also influence the choice of approach.

# 54.6.2.1 Preauricular Approach

Historically, a myriad of preauricular incisions have been proposed. Many of the earlier designs afforded good access but increased the risk of facial nerve injury and compromised aesthetics. The preauricular incisions used today are essentially modifications of the Blair curvilinear or inverted-L incision [50]. This approach has become the favorite chosen by most oral and maxillofacial surgeons. The technique consists of an incision commencing from within the temporal hairline and extending inferiorly into a preauricular crease immediately anterior to the auricle. The exact length and decision to incorporate an anterior temporal extension are governed largely by the nature of the surgical procedure. For some surgeons, the approach for discectomy requires a smaller incision than that for discoplasty. The incision is approximately 3 to  $4\mathrm{cm}$  in length and consists of two limbs: a small superior curved limb  $(1 - 2\mathrm{cm})$  and an inferior vertical limb anterior to the tragus (variable distance approximately  $1 - 2\mathrm{cm}$ ) (Fig. 54.7). The junction of these limbs is the site of attachment of the superior aspect of the helix to the temporal tissue. The extent of the superior limb of the preauricular incision is dictated by the amount of access required, which may not be determined until the dissection has reached the lateral TMJ ligament and capsule. The incision is usually not extended as inferiorly as the lobule of the ear. The incision should be placed posteriorly to the superficial temporal vessels and auriculotemporal nerve and within a preauricular crease. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are incised the length of the entire incision. The deeper

Fig. 54.7 The preauricular incision

dissection is begun in the temporal region by sharply dissecting progressively through the auricularis anterior and superficial fascial layers to the stark white temporalis fascia (Fig. 54.8). A retractor is placed on the anterior flap, and tension is applied in a forward direction. The dissection over the zygomatic arch is addressed. The anatomic layers in this region are usually not clearly defined. There is a condensation of tissues consisting variably of the auricularis interior, superficial fascia, temporalis fascia, periosteum, and occasionally cartilage. This tissue is incised to the level of fibrous connective tissue. A retractor is placed in the incision opposite the tragus, and forward traction is applied to the flap. This results in the definition of a cleft between the perichondrium and cartilage of the external auditory canal and the parotideomasseteric fascia. The perichondrium is followed medially with sharp dissection (Fig. 54.9). Care should be exercised not to proceed perpendicularly to the skin surface, as the external auditory canal inclines anteromedially at approximately  $45^{\circ}$  to the surface. The dissection is continued along the outer surface of the external auditory canal until the lateral TMJ ligament is reached. When the condyle and its overlying temporomandibular ligament are palpated, the flap is reflected

![](images/85101128ffca670193d15b1543f19458855671c4858608d514b2d6eef6185c0c.jpg)  
Fig. 54.8 The preauricular incision has been carried sharply through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial temporal fascia, auricularis anterior and superior, and outer layers of the temporal fascia. The flap is reflected anteroinferiorly, revealing the inner layer of the temporal fascia

inferiorly and anteriorly forward with a combination of sharp and blunt dissections. Scissors may be used to cut some fascial attachments to the lateral TMJ ligament. The blades of the scissors are held parallel to the ligament to ensure that the joint is not violated. The flap is reflected as far forward as the midportion of the anterior tubercle. The surgeon can now see the bulging of the lateral pole of the condyle under cover of the lateral ligament and capsule. Gentle manipulation of the jaw to cause movement of the condyle helps to orient the surgeon to the location of the joint space. The deep surface of the flap and the tissues overlying the zygomatic arch may be touched with a nerve stimulator to ascertain the location of the facial nerve. Retraction is accomplished using a self-retaining retractor (e.g., Weitlaner or a Dolwick-Reich) placed between the flap and the perichondrium. A small right-angled retractor may be placed at the inferior portion of the flap (Fig. 54.10).

# 54.6.2.2 Endaural Approach

Rongetti described a modification of Lempert's endaural approach to the mastoid process for surgical improvement of otosclerosis, for approaching the TMJ [51, 52]. The endaural incisions employed today are simply a cosmetic modification of the preauricular approach in which the skin incision is incorporated over the prominence of the tragus itself (Fig. 54.11). The access obtained is equal to that achieved through the preauricular approach. Disadvantages include the potential for perichondritis and an aesthetic compromise if tragal

projection is lost or significant iatrogenic cartilage damage occurs.

# 54.6.2.3 Postauricular Approach

In the postauricular approach, the incision is made posterior to the ear and involves the sectioning of the external auditory meatus [53]. Excellent posterolateral joint space and condylar exposure is afforded with this technique. The flap, once reflected, contains the entire auricle and superficial lobe of the parotid gland. A perimeatal approach combining the preauricular and postauricular incisions has also been described [54, 55].

![](images/04b9571001816e7b7afa53c7f9ed8ddaecdd2bb5e9a670afbeb5cde18d1728c3.jpg)  
Fig. 54.10 Retraction is accomplished by using a self-retaining retractor positioned between the external auditory canal and flap and a right-angle retractor at the interior portion of the flap. The condyle (dotted line) is noted under the lateral TMJ ligament and/or simply the lateral capsule depending on the depth of the reflection

Preoperative considerations for this approach were described by Walters and Geist [56] and include the following:

1. History of normal scar formation  
2. Healthy auditory system with no infection  
3. Normal width of the external auditory canal

# 4. No TMJ infection

5. Medically compromised patient unable to tolerate long operative period

The incision in the postauricular approach begins near the superior aspect of the external pinna and is extended to the tip of the mastoid process. The superior portion may be extended obliquely into the hairline for additional exposure. The incision is made 3 to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  parallel and posterior to the postauricular flexure (Fig. 54.12). The dissection is performed through the posterior auricular muscle to the level of the mastoid fascia, which is contiguous with the temporalis fascia. A combination of blunt and sharp dissections is used to isolate the cartilaginous portion of the external auditory canal. A blunt instrument is placed in the external auditory canal to assist in the transection of the external auditory canal. The transection may be partial or complete, depending on the need for exposure. The incision should leave 3 to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of cartilage on the medial aspect to permit adequate reapproximation of the canal (Fig. 54.13). This technique helps to prevent meatal, or external auditory canal (EAC), stenosis. The incision is carried through the outer layer of the temporalis fascia, continuing inferiorly, reflecting the parotideomasseteric fascia off the zygomatic arch and lateral TMJ ligament (Fig. 54.14). A self-retaining retractor is used to maintain exposure. The advantages of the postauricular approach lie in the predictability of the anatomic exposure as well as the cosmetic superiority and the low risk of facial nerve injury. Dissection to the joint is rapid with minimal bleeding. The approach offers an alternative for a patient who has had previous procedures in this region. This approach may not be desirable in the patient susceptible to keloid formation, owing to the potential for a keloid to develop in the meatus. Meatal atresia has been reported with this technique but can be avoided with the use of moldable ear canal plugs left in place for an extended period of time to prevent EAC scarring and narrowing. The risk of facial nerve injury is reduced, but not eliminated. Paresthesia in the area of the posterior aspect of the auricle usually occurs and may last for 3 to 4 months.

# 54.6.2.4 Capsular Incisions

Once the capsule has been identified, access to the articular surfaces (superior and inferior joint spaces) can be obtained by a great variety of incisions. The most commonly used include the following:

# 54.6.2.5 Horizontal Incision Over the Lateral Rim of the Glenoid Fossa

The lateral ligament, capsule, and periosteum are reflected inferiorly en masse. Discal or posterior attachment connections, or both, to the lateral capsule are dis

![](images/494163d86ea21e74ee5a4e0a1157757cded3d062c6b297c7a5b109f23b874c86.jpg)  
Fig. 54.12 Postauricular approach. The incision is placed 3 to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  parallel and posterior to the postauricular flexure

sected sharply with scissors to the level of the condylar neck (Fig. 54.15a). Insufflation of the superior joint space with local anesthesia can help to identify the entry point. Posterior dissection is performed diligently to avoid severing the retrodiscal tissue. This portion of the dissection exposes the superior joint space (Fig. 54.15b). A Freer septum elevator may be used to define and explore the space. The posterior attachment and disc attachments are then severed sharply at the lateral pole of the condyle from within the developed flap. The Freer septum elevator is used to reflect the posterior attachment and disc superiorly off the head of the condyle to expose the inferior joint space. A periosteal elevator may be used to stretch the capsule and lateral ligament flap outward to form a pocket (Fig. 54.15c).

There is a risk of reflecting the fibrous connective tissue that lines the glenoid fossa when this approach is

used (Fig. 54.16a). The surgeon may form the incorrect assumption that he or she is stripping adhesions from the temporal bone while defining the space. The result may be a partial or total synovectomy of the superior joint space. Prearthrotomy arthroscopic examinations have alerted clinicians to this error. The ability of the pathologic joint to regenerate this synovium and fibrous connective tissue layer has not been determined.

Fig. 54.13 The external auditory canal is sectioned, leaving 3 to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of cartilage on the medial aspect to assist reapproximation of the canal

# Horizontal Incision Below the Lateral Rim of the Glenoid Fossa

A no. 11 blade may be used to puncture into the superior joint space at the level of the lateral discocapsular sulcus (Fig. 54.16b). The opening is then lengthened anteriorly and posteriorly using sharp-pointed scissors. A dissection technique, similar to that described in the foregoing approach, is used to define the superior joint space. A dissection is then carried inferiorly removing the attachment of the capsule to the disc and exposing the inferior joint space. There is less risk of injury to the retrodiscal tissue with this approach; the risk to the fibrocartilage is also reduced.

# Horizontal Incisions Above and Below the Disc

The horizontal approach above and below the disc (Fig. 54.16c) leaves some of the capsule and ligament attached to the disc or remodeled retrodiscal tissue.

# T-Shaped Incision

A horizontal incision may be joined by a vertical incision that extends over the capsule insertion over the lateral condyle to create a T-shaped incision over the midportion of the glenoid fossa (Fig. 54.16d).

# 54.6.3 Wound Closure

Closure of the capsule is often difficult to attain following open surgical procedures. Support for the lateral ligament can be obtained by rising a temporalis muscle and fascia flap, about  $2\mathrm{cm}$  in length, pedicled inferiorly, and rotated inferiorly over the lateral rim of the glenoid fossa and sutured to the lateral capsular tissue. The pedicle stabilizes the flap but has not been shown to contain nutrient vessels. Closure of the capsule and ligament after disc repositioning lends stability to the discorha

phy but may not be critical to the success of the discectomy.

# Key Points

- Anatomy of the region is well known and the surgeon must be familiar with it to avoid potential complications.  
Two potential sources of facial nerve injury are dissection anterior to the posterior glenoid tubercle where the temporal branches cross the arch and aggressive retraction at the inferior margin of the flap where the main trunk and temporofacial division is located.

# 54.7 Surgical Procedures

# 54.7.1 Disc Repositioning

The goal of disc repositioning procedures is to relocate the disc to the normal condyle-disc-fossa relationship. The repositioned disc facilitates movement of the con

dyle previously blocked by the displaced disc, provides joint stabilization, and improves articular cartilage nutrition and lubrication. Moreover, the workload of the masticatory muscles is reduced when the obstructing disc is repositioned. The literature appears to support

the successful application of disc repositioning surgery in  $80 - 95\%$  of cases [57, 58] (Table 54.1). However the role of disc repositioning surgery has significantly diminished with the success of less-invasive procedures, as well as the reported success of discectomy without

replacement. There are two main indications for disc repositioning procedures:

1. Patients with painful anterior disc displacement with reduction that has not responded to nonsurgical and minimally invasive procedures  
2. Patients with anterior disc displacement without reduction with persistent pain and limited mouth opening that has not responded to nonsurgical and minimally invasive procedures

Absolute contraindications of the procedure include infection in the surgical site and uncontrolled psychogenic disease. Relative contraindications involve medically compromised patients, lack of signs and symptoms of intra-articular disease, psychiatric disorders, and the possibility of solving the problem using minimally invasive techniques [59]. Disc repositioning can be accomplished by either of the following techniques: a partial-thickness excision in which the superior lamina of the retrodiscal tissue and posterior attachment are removed, without violation of the inferior joint space, and the lateroposterior tissues are reapproximated [60] (Fig. 54.17); a full-thickness excision in which a wedge-shaped portion of the posterior attachment is removed and the lateroposterior tissues

are approximated [61] (Fig. 54.18); or a full-thickness excision of a wedge-shaped portion of the posterior attachment with stabilization of the disc with mini-anchors [62]. The chances of a successful disc repositioning procedure increase if the disc has (1) minimal displacement, (2) near-normal length, and (3) nearnormal anatomic structure. When the disc displaces, the pathologic changes are not seen uniformly throughout the entire lateromedial extent of the joint. It is believed that a variable decrease in the vascularity of the remodeled posterior attachment occurs with an increasing duration of disc displacement and load. Disc repositioning techniques thus involve a repair in the pathologic retrodiscal tissue with a variable degree of vascularity. The primary source of nourishment to the repositioned disc appears to be through the synovium on the medial aspect of the disc and posterior recesses of the joint spaces. Thus, a critical aspect of the successful surgical repair in the retrodiscal tissue appears to be the rapid migration of synoviocytes to the area of the surgical repair. In general, the limiting factor to disc repositioning is the degree of lateral disc atrophy or resorption. Despite severe lateral atrophy, the most medial aspect of the disc may have a normal length and shape.

# 54.7.2 Disc Repositioning and Discoplasty

Deformation of the disc in all planes is an important feature to recognize when planning a repositioning procedure. When a bulge-shaped disc is of appropriate length and can be repositioned, a discoplasty may be performed to minimize the change in the occlusion. In addition, removal of the posterior attachment overlying the condyle is intended to remove a source of localized inflammation. The surgical technique for disc repositioning with discoplasty includes the exposure of the articular surfaces with any of the previously discussed surgical approaches. Once the capsule has been incised, joint distention for better visualization can be achieved by manual manipulation or placement of Wilkes retractor. A Freer elevator can be used to sweep gently across the top of the disc. Access to the medial aspect of the joint is greatly improved when the anterior attachment is released, permitting the surgeon to draw the disc outward posterolaterally while it remains pedicled to the medial attachment. The disc is then inspected for deformities, perforations. Disc mobility is evaluated by applying traction with a forceps (Fig. 54.19). Typically, the

the glenoid fossa (Fig. 54.20). The clamp greatly assists in the control of hemorrhage from the retrodiscal tissue, stabilization of the posterior attachment during tissue excision, and stabilization of the posterior attachment during suturing [63]. The design of the instrument minimizes tissue damage. A wedge of remodeled posterior attachment is excised, leaving a  $1\mathrm{mm}$  margin ante

rior to the beaks of the clamp. This permits suturing of the disc to the retrodiscal tissue without removal of the clamp. Range of motion is then verified. Tissue forceps are used to stabilize and slightly evert the disc so that the inferior surface may be sculpted (Fig. 54.21). The tissue is closed with nonresorbable suture (Fig. 54.22). Once the disc has been sutured into its new position, its lateral rim is sutured to the lateral capsule ligament. In a study by Montgomery and colleagues, postoperative MRIs demonstrated an unchanged disc position in  $86\%$  of patients 2 years after TMJ disc repositioning surgery [64]. Some authors have advocated the use of mini-anchors (Mitek) for better stabilization of the disc in a more physiologic position with success rates reported between 82 and  $91\%$  [65-69]. Long-term studies are required to further determine the stability of the technique as well as the best moment to be applied. The surgical procedure for placement of mini-anchors establishes that once the disc is properly reduced, the mini-anchor, which is a metal or a resorbable insert with a suture attached to it, is placed in the posterolateral portion of condylar head. The suture is then used to secure the lateral and posterior of the disc to the condylar head.

# 54.7.3 Disc Repositioning and Arthroplasty

Several authors have advocated combining a disc repositioning procedure with an arthroplasty of the condyle or the articular eminence [70-75]. Arthroplasty reduces the amount of posterolateral repositioning required and therefore permits an easier repositioning of an atrophic disc (Fig. 54.23). A 2 to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  condylar/eminence arthroplasty procedure can be performed with rotary or hand instruments. Hand instruments such as fine chisels are preferable to avoid heat generation (Fig. 54.24). Bone files should be used judiciously because, once the compact bony layer is interrupted, the trabeculae of bone can be easily and rapidly removed. A periosteal elevator may be used to burnish sharp edges. Care should be exercised not to exaggerate the arthroplasty in the lateral condylar regions while accessing the medial condylar region. In some cases, an arthroplasty of the eminence is essentially a lateral tuberculectomy for access and decompression of the anterior recess of the superior joint space (Fig. 54.25). Disc repositioning is then performed through the plication or excision technique. The capsule is closed in the customary fashion. Intermaxillary fixation or training elastics are used for 1 to 3 weeks to allow muscular adaptation and dental compensations to occur. The current trend, however,

is to avoid removal of any normal articular bone since the postoperative healing phase already involves some loss of bone substance, which may be additive and result in occlusal disturbances. In addition, postoperative bleeding from cut bone surfaces into the joint can result in fibrous adhesions of the disc or fibrous/bony ankylosis of the joint.

# 54.7.4 Disc Repair

Perforations rarely occur within the disc proper but rather within the lateral third of the remodeled posterior attachment [76]. When the disc is perforated, it may be secondary to a developmental rather than a pathologic process. Small perforations  $(1 - 3\mathrm{mm})$  can be treated with primary closure. The atrophic displaced disc is repositioned posteriorly to only a minor degree. If the disc is to be fully repositioned, the margins of the perforation should be excised and the posterior attachment on the posterior edge of the disc approximated to the tympanic portion of the retrodiscal tissue. Anterolateral release of the discal attachments is usually necessary to mobilize the disc posteriorly. The margins of the perforation are oversewn in a straight-line fashion with a nonresorbable material. The repaired retrodiscal tissue is

intended to maintain the shape of the articular surface and to prevent ankylosis. Repair of a perforation without repositioning the disc is successful only if the disc is atrophied and is not an obstruction to condylar movement. This procedure is performed rarely and only in those patients refractory to nonsurgical management, arthrocentesis, or arthroscopy. Condylar overgrowth often occurs in the areas of the perforations; therefore, an arthroplasty is frequently performed in conjunction with the procedure. Large perforations will require more extensive repair because the disc usually cannot be repositioned. If the disc cannot be adequately repaired, a

decision must be made to replace the disc or perform a discectomy (Figs. 54.26 and 54.27).

# 54.7.5 Discectomy

Ideally all surgical efforts should be made to retain the articular disc, but this is not always possible. Discectomy should be considered in cases in which the disc is determined to be unsalvageable due to deformation, perforation, calcification, and/or severe displacement. Partial and total discectomies have been described in the literature [77-79]. The goal of surgery is to assist the

patient to adapt to the pathology at hand by removing the physical impediment to movement. With discectomy, the surgeon transforms a joint into what more appropriately would be described as two bones in close apposition. Adult cartilage derives its nutrients solely from synovial fluid. The prolonged contact of bony surfaces following discectomy may interfere with diffusion of

Fig. 54.27 A dermal graft covers the surgically created perforation. The edges of the graft overlay the disc, retrodiscal tissue, and lateral capsule to assist in suturing

nutrients from the synovial fluid. The decreased diffusion of nutrients to cartilage may result in the eventual resorption of noncalcified cartilage. As a result, several adaptive changes rapidly occur. Agerberg and Lundberg [79] described radiographic erosion of the articular surfaces of the operated and nonoperated joints. They also concluded that the remodeling process is due to altered joint loading after discectomy but stabilization occurred after 2 years. They used the term remodeling and not osteoarthrosis to describe the radiographic changes because the osseous changes occurred in the absence of symptoms. The bony changes appear similar to those that are observed longitudinally with chronic disc displacement, suggestive of the same mechanism. The rate

of remodeling, however, is accelerated in the postdiscectomy state. After a discectomy some masticatory muscle and joint tenderness can be expected for a variable period, extending from several weeks to months. The patient at first favors mastication on the operated side. Later, when healing is advanced, mastication is performed on the nonoperated side. An opening deviation of as much as 8 to  $9\mathrm{mm}$  may occur toward the operated side. Hypermobility of the nonoperated joint may develop or increase after discectomy. Limitation of mandibular movement on the operated side appears to be responsible for the hypermobility. Physical therapy greatly assists the control of the ipsilateral deviation and hence contralateral hypermobility. Patients often report an alteration in their bite, although rarely as a major complaint. The thicker the retrodiscal tissue removed, the greater is the anticipated change in occlusion. The sensation of an altered bite usually resolves within a week to several months and occlusal equilibration is rarely indicated. There is considerable variation in the ability of each patient and joint to adapt to the postdiscectomy state. Individual factors, such as inclination of the eminence, state of preoperative symptoms, loss of molar support, and amount of postoperative remodeling, seem to play a substantial role. The mechanism of pain relief and improvement in function over the long-term following discectomy is still unknown. However long-term follow-up studies on TMJ discectomies have shown complete resolution in pain and dysfunction in almost all the patients reviewed [80-86] (Table 54.2). During discectomy without replacement, once the capsule has been incised, joint distention for better visualization can be achieved by manual manipulation or placement of Wilkes retractor (Fig. 54.28). Disc extirpation is facilitated when the disc is severed from its anterior and lateral attachments and then retracted laterally and posteriorly to complete the incisions. This approach permits the surgeon to verify the ability of the disc to be repositioned posteriorly before excision. With severe atrophy of the disc, substantial resistance to posterolateral traction is noted. A hemostatic clamp is positioned across the anterior attachment to serve as a guide plane for the knife, which is used to sever the attachment lateromedially. As the posterior attachment demonstrates a variable degree of vascularity changes, the DeBakey bulldog vascular clamp or straight mosquito clamp may be applied here before severing the posterior attachment. Next, a hemostat is used to apply outward traction to the tissue to be extirpated. A meniscus knife is used to sever the medial attachments. When the remodeled posterior attachment and disc are extirpated, the retrodiscal tissue is electrocauterized to control bleeding. Care is taken not to disrupt the fibrous connective tissue lining of the fossa and condyle. The mor

phology of the condyle and glenoid fossa often prevents excision in one piece. Incomplete excision of the posterior attachment over the lateral pole of the condyle may account for some cases of failure with discectomy. With the disc and posterior attachment removed, mandibular range of motion is checked. Joint noises, characterized as snappings, may indicate a disc remnant. Disc remnants are usually located on the medial aspect of the joint cavity (Fig. 54.29). The surgeon should remove all disc remnants that appear to impede movement.

# 54.7.5.1 Disc Replacements

Despite the reported success of long-term studies of TMJ discectomy, there is a perception among surgeons that disc replacement is required to help prevent or reduce the significant osseous remodeling, intra-articular adhesions, and recurrent pain that are seen following discectomy alone. An interpositional material was believed to decrease joint noises by dissipating loading forces on the osseous surfaces. The effectiveness of routine interpositional materials and grafts to reduce adhesions, protect the articular surfaces, and diminish pain and postdiscectomy joint noise has not been substantiated by the literature, as long-term results of discectomy alone are far superior to short-term discectomy with grafts and disc preservation procedures [87-89]. The popularity of alloplastic for TMJ disc displacement materials suffered considerably after the experience with

Silastic [90] and Teflon-Proplast [91]. Both materials while enduring continuous loading by the mandibular condyle suffered fragmentation, migration, foreign body giant cell reactions, and recurrent joint symptoms [92]. The recognition of these limitations led to the abandonment of the permanent placement of both materials [93]. The use of Silastic as a temporary disc replacement material is not supported by the literature [94, 95]. However, it is currently used as a temporary spacer to prevent TMJ ankylosis, for a 6- to 12-week period of waiting for the fabrication of a CAD-CAM-generated custom permanent alloplastic TMJ prosthesis. Additionally, the vitallium alloy (cobalt, chromium, molybdenum) fossa-eminence prosthesis is another alloplastic material used after a discectomy that has been reported in the literature with moderate success [96-100] (Fig. 54.30). The debacle of Silastic and Teflon-Proplast created an increased use of autogenous grafts [101]. Most autogenous grafts have been used to replace failed alloplastic implants, which means there are few reports of autogenous grafts placed at the time of the discectomy. In a critical review of interpositional grafts, Dimitroulis [102] suggests that the criteria for the ideal interpositional material used to replace the articular disc after discectomy should include the following:

1. Long-term safety  
2. Adequate bulk  
3. Good handling properties  
4. Easy to procure  
5. Abundantly available  
6. Survives the intrajoint environment

7. Facilitates normal joint function  
8. Prevents bone formation and joint ankylosis  
9. Protects condyle from severe remodeling

# Temporalis Muscle/Fascia Flap

The temporalis muscle/fascia is the most popular interpositional material for reasons of close proximity and ease of use. The flap may be pedicled in a variety of ways. Advantages of this technique over a free graft include its stability, owing to its connection at the base, its availability at the same surgical site, and its lack of cosmetic and functional morbidity. The disadvantages include flap necrosis, fibrosis, and similar to other TMJ surgical procedures is the risk of postoperative decreased interincisal opening. Feinberg and Larsen described a technique which a temporalis muscle flap is developed that includes the temporalis fascia and the underlying pericranium from the most inferior horizontally oriented fibers of the temporalis muscle. The flap is based anteriorly off the coronoid process and passed anteriorly around the zygomatic arch in the TMJ that pedicled the posterior temporalis muscle fibers anteriorly. The muscle is then sutured to the retrodiscal tissues [103, 104] (Fig. 54.31). Studies have reported that the muscle maintains its viability with some fibrosis [103, 105]. A procedure in which the muscle is placed over the zygomatic arch has also been described [106] (Fig. 54.32). The shape and size of the flap are outlined by incising posteriorly near the postglenoid spine of the joint through temporalis fascia muscle and periosteum. This incision is extended superiorly near the temporal line. Subperiosteal dissection elevates the amount

of flap needed from the temporal bone. A transverse incision is made at the superior portion anteriorly to create a  $3\mathrm{~cm}$  wide flap. The width should be greater than the anteroposterior coverage desired in the joint to allow flap contraction. An anterior incision is made parallel to the posterior incision. The superior aspect of the anterior incision is carried to bone in this thin area of the temporalis. Inferiorly, as the arch is approached, the muscle thickens; therefore, the dissections are not carried completely through muscle to bone. Blunt dissection is carried inferiorly to a point just medial to the arch to permit adequate mobility of the flap. Branches of the temporal artery found in this area are preserved if possible. The length of the flap is usually  $5\mathrm{~cm}$ . The flap is fully reflected off the bone, and resorbable interrupted sutures are placed in several areas on the edge of the flap through fascia, muscle, and the periosteum to keep the layers from separating. Holes are drilled in the bone of the lateral lip of the glenoid fossa posteriorly and anteriorly before placement of the flap into the joint. One suture is placed through bone anteriorly near the eminence, and a second posterior suture is placed near the postglenoid spine. Two additional sutures hold the medial edge to anterior and

Fig. 54.31 Disc replacement using temporalis muscle/fascial graft (broken line) pedicled from above the glenoid fossa and rotated inward (arrow). Lateral, anterior, and posterior sutures hold the graft in place

posterior medial tissues. These medial sutures are sometimes difficult or impossible to secure, and the sutures through lateral bone are usually adequate to hold the flap in place. A cosmetic temporal defect may result depending on the thickness of tissue harvested. The results from numerous clinical studies show a high success rate with the use of a variety of techniques involving temporalis muscle flaps of varying sizes and shapes, based either inferiorly or anteriorly [103, 106-110]. A meta-analysis of the literature from 1965 to 2001 calculated a mean success rate of  $91.4\%$  for the temporalis muscle flap [89].

# Ear Cartilage

Autogenous conchal cartilage has been described and praised as TMJ disc replacement by several authors [111-115]. Cartilage harvested from the cavum conchae results in minimal aesthetic compromise, and the graft can be tailored to fit the condyle or glenoid fossa. Notably, the quality and thickness of the aural cartilage

Fig. 54.32 a, b Disc replacement using temporalis muscle/fascial graft pedicled anteriorly and rotated anteriorly and inferiorly around (beneath) the posterior root of the zygomatic arch (arrow). The graft is sutured to the retrodiscal tissues

is variable. In some cases an iatrogenic tear in the cartilage may occur during the harvesting process. The procedure to obtain chondral cartilage as interpositional material for TMJ reconstruction has been described by Hall and Link [113]. A 3 to  $4\mathrm{cm}$  postauricular incision is made on the ear a few millimeters lateral to the auriculocephalic sulcus and is carried through to the perichondrium. The middle division of the posterior auricular

artery may be encountered and ligated or cauterized. A careful supratherichondral dissection with a fine dissecting scissors exposes the surface of the cartilage. A scalpel is used to cut through the cartilage in the shape of the desired amount of graft, usually 1.5 by  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$ . It is important not to extend to the rim of the antihelix to avoid permanent deformity of the ear. Subperichondral dissection between the skin of the bowl and cartilage permits the cartilage to be removed without tearing it or perforating the skin. The ear is packed with gauze or other material to maintain the shape of the bowl and to apply pressure to the skin. The pressure pack is maintained for 48 hours. Although mean success rates of  $82.4\%$  have been published with auricular graft as disc replacement [82], other studies have shown their tendency to fragment, proliferate, and result in fibrous ankylosis with progressive mouth opening limitation [116-119].

# Dermal Fat Graft

Georgiade originally reported the use of dermal fat graft for surgical correction of TMJ dysfunction [120]. Only a few clinical studies are published on the use of dermis grafts for disc repair [121] and disc replacement material in the TMJ [122]. Dimitroulis showed 35 joints in 29 patients that demonstrated dermis grafts were effective in reducing joint sounds, but the author conceded that dermis grafts were difficult to anchor and failed to prevent regressive remodeling of the condyle [123]. The dermal graft may be harvested from the buttock, upper lateral thigh, groin, or the inner aspect of the upper extremity [121, 124]. An elliptic wedge of epidermis and underlying dermis is harvested. The donor site wound is closed primarily and occlusive dressing placed. The underlying surface of the dermis must be defatted before being the graft is implanted. The defatted graft is trimmed and sutured to the retrodiscal tissue and the anterior and lateral capsular attachments. Unfortunately, in some cases, anchoring is difficult and the graft is simply inserted as space filler.

# Abdominal Dermis Fat Graft

Dimitroulis published the first description of abdominal dermis fat graft as disc replacement after TMJ discectomy [123]. The greatest advantage of this type of graft is its ability to be easily sculptured to fit precisely into any size cavity. Several studies by Dimitroulis and colleagues have demonstrated that abdominal dermis fat is a promising graft material that satisfies most, but not all, of the criteria for an ideal interpositional graft following discectomy [102, 123, 125-128]. They showed, in a quality of life study, that although discectomy was largely responsible for the resolution of joint pain and dysfunction, abdominal dermis fat was a safe procedure

and helps promote smooth, pain-free joint function [126]. While their studies have been largely positive, there are still concerns as dermis fat graft is not always successful, as it fails to protect the condyle from further degeneration in one-third of cases and the ultimate fate of a joint replacement in  $7\%$  of cases [127, 128].

# Tissue-Engineered TMJ Disc

The rapidly growing technologies of tissue engineering will provide in the future alternatives for TMJ disc replacement [129-135]. Tissue-engineered articular discs are at the nascent phase of development but the real challenge will come when researchers try to anchor the newly developed disc to the surrounding articular structures without compromising the normal function of the joint.

# 54.7.6 Modified Mandibular Condylotomy

Modified mandibular condylotomy is an extra-articular surgical procedure that differs from other TMJ disc derangement procedures, as it does not directly involve the articular surfaces. Essentially, the procedure consists of an intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy in which the medial pterygoid muscle is partially detached to allow for 3 to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of condylar sag. Ideally, the downward position of the condylar segment increases the joint space, reducing the load on the retrodiscal tissue and relieving the pain and dysfunction [136] The extra-articular nature of the procedure explains the observation that a joint will not be made worse by a modified condylotomy [137] The procedure carries low morbidity and significant complications are rare. It has the disadvantage that requires a brief period of maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) followed by several weeks of training elastics. The principal indication for modified mandibular condylotomy is the management of pain and mechanical symptoms in patients who have disc displacement with reduction  $(79 - 94\%)$  successful) [138-140] or patients who recently progressed to disc displacement without reduction  $(82\%)$  successful) [141]. Still, regardless of the stage of disc derangement, the increase of the joint space unloads of the retrodiscal tissues and articular surfaces, as well as relieves mechanical interferences. Thus, contrasting intra-articular procedures, no surgical joint pain occurs and joint pain is relieved nearly immediately [142]. Absolute contraindication of the procedure includes uncontrolled bruxism and relative contraindications involve risk factors for occlusal disturbances after surgery. Two interesting facts about modified mandibular condylotomy are as follows: (1) it is claimed that it can result in a more normal disccondyle relationship [140] and (2) it seems to positively

affect the progression of the disease [143]. The surgical technique to perform a modified condylotomy includes the standard instrumentation for an intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy. Once arch bars are placed and local anesthesia is given, a standard incision is made over the external oblique ridge. Periosteum is elevated from the whole lateral ramus to identify important landmarks for the osteotomy that include the sigmoid notch, the mandibular angle, and the posterior border of the mandibular ramus. Visualization is greatly facilitated with the use of endoscopy. Although the classical description of this procedure calls for the identification of the antelingula to avoid damage to the inferior alveolar nerve, Aziz and colleagues demonstrated complete concordance of the position of the lingula and antelingula in only  $11.1\%$  of the specimens studied [144]. In an anatomic study of the position of the mandibular foramen in relation to the LeVasseur-Merrill retractor, da Fontoura and colleagues [145] showed that the mandibular foramen was located within  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of the posterior edge of the mandible in only  $3.3\%$  of the rami. When properly placed, the LeVasseur-Merrill retractor was effective in avoiding the inferior alveolar nerve in  $98.9\%$  of the analyzed rami. The osteotomy is carried out in the central portion of the ramus using a  $7\mathrm{mm}$  angled oscillating saw against the LeVasseur-Merrill retractor. The inferior limb of the osteotomy is done through the inferior border of the mandible to allow for the desired condylar sag and better control of the condylar segment. The superior portion of the osteotomy is directed toward the sigmoid notch with care to avoid excessive soft tissue trauma. Once the osteotomy is completed, MMF is established and condylar sag is estimated mobilizing the segment and evaluating the step between the tip of the condylar segment and the inferior border. Medial pterygoid muscle is detached from the distal end of the condylar segment using a periosteal elevator to achieve  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of condylar sag. Wire or plate fixation of the osteotomized segments is not necessary except in the cases of excessive condylar after excessive stripping of the medial pterygoid muscle or in cases in which condylar segment mobility is inadequate after previous TMJ surgical procedures. Finally if necessary, the tip of the condylar segment can be trimmed to avoid palpation. Immediate postoperative imaging is obtained to corroborate the correct position and the sag of the condylar segment (Fig. 54.33). Postoperatively after unilateral modified condylotomy, MMF is maintained for approximately 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of training elastics (single class II canine region on the operated side and single vertical on the nonoperated side). Bilateral cases will require 2 to 3 weeks of MMF follow by 3 to 4 weeks of training elastics (bilateral class II canine region). Complications of this procedure include bleeding, excess

# Key Points

- Open TMJ surgery continues to have a small but important role in the surgical management of TMJ disc derangements refractory to medical management and minimally invasive procedures.  
- Discectomy should be considered in cases in which the disc is determined to be unsalvageable due to deformation, perforation, calcification, and/or severe displacement.  
The effectiveness of routine interpositional materials and grafts to reduce adhesions, protect the articular surfaces, and diminish pain and postdiscectomy joint noise has not been substantiated by the literature.  
- Modified condylotomy is an extra-articular procedure that aims to improve the condyle-disc relation by increasing the superior joint space.  
Literature in modified condylotomy suggests that the procedure has a positive effect in stopping the progression of the intra-articular tissues.

# 54.8 Postoperative Management

After surgery a combination of physical, pharmacological, and splint therapies are normally employed postoperatively to achieve an acceptable postoperative pain and range of motion. The positive role of physical therapy in recovery after TMJ surgery has been reported in the literature [147, 148]. It is important to weigh the contribution of masticatory muscle myalgia to the patient's chief complaint. Although joint surgery can relieve the joint pain, in many cases it may be ineffectual in controlling muscle discomfort. Nonsurgical management of the muscle disorders must continue in many patients after surgery for TMJ disc derangements. Joint surgery does not restore the joint to its prepathologic state. The patient should understand that biting force may be reduced and jaw fatigue may become apparent with heavy meals or long conversations. After primary surgery (i.e., no previous TMJ surgery), one should strive for the following passive range-of-motion parameters: maximum interincisal opening of 35 to  $40\mathrm{mm}$ , lateral excursive movements of 4 to  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , and protrusive excursive movements of 4 to  $6\mathrm{mm}$ . However, success should not be measured by the attainment of a finite

measurement. A patient's overall success should be measured by the eradication or diminution of the preoperative complaints. Surgery is rarely performed to correct purely functional complaints. Elimination of pain during function is usually the predominant concern for the patient, who is willing to accept some compromise in degree of opening and lateral excursions. Postoperative outcomes may be influenced by several factors, including concomitant facial pain from other sources, degenerative bony changes, advanced morphologic changes in the disc, perforation of the posterior attachment, poorly controlled parafunctional habits, malocclusion, psychological overlay, previous TMJ surgery, history of facial nerve paralysis or orofacial numbness, history of infection, or systemic diseases affecting the muscles, ligaments, or bone [34]. Splint therapy should be used to maintain a stable occlusal relation in the immediate postoperative phase. This is particularly important after disc repositioning. The appliance is frequently adjusted as the edema resolves and disc tissues heal. Splint therapy is routinely used as well when a large parafunctional component is present. The patient should be able to return to a normal mechanical diet with minimal dietary restrictions. Joint sounds may develop or persist, but the asymptomatic sounds should be of minimal concern to the patient. The clinician must balance the desire to rapidly and actively restore a normal range of motion with the capacity of the joint and facial muscles to adapt. Some latitude must be maintained on the part of the clinician in dealing with a patient's rehabilitation schedule. Care should be exercised in the rehabilitative process of the patient with bilateral joint disease whose operation was unilateral. Diet restrictions are important. Excessive lateral excursive movements to the ipsilateral side may contribute to the exacerbation of contralateral symptoms. There is no cookbook recipe to postoperative management of these patients. Some patients, regardless of the procedure, achieve an acceptable range of motion within 7 to 14 days, with minimal effort on their part. Others need to follow a strict physical therapy regimen. The devices such as Therabite (Atos Medical) or Dynasplint (Dynasplint) are routinely used as part of the patient's physical therapy. Additionally, the help of a physical therapist may sometimes be enlisted to regain joint mobility, especially when patient cooperation with a home exercise program is questionable. In general, some light passive opening and protrusion stretching exercises are prescribed four times a day beginning 5 days postoperatively. With disc repair procedures, the physical therapy exercises should be more gradual. Patients should be maintained on a full liquid to soft diet for the first 2 postoperative weeks. Heat may be applied before and after exercises to improve comfort.

# 54.9 Complications

As with all surgical procedures, TMJ disc surgery is not exempt from potential complications. Complications after TMJ disc surgery can be divided in perioperative and long-term surgical complications [149, 150].

# 54.9.1 Perioperative Complications

# 54.9.1.1 Vascular Injury and Hemorrhage

Hemorrhage from the retrodiscal tissue may interfere with performance of the disc repair. Temporary control may be obtained with seating of the condyle in the glenoid fossa. Electrocautery, injection of epinephrine, or application of hemostatic agents while maintaining the mandible in the closed position may be necessary. Hemorrhage from the internal maxillary artery can be problematic and difficult to control. Usually the bleeding can be controlled with pressure and vascular clips. Control via selective embolization has also been described in the literature [151].

# 54.9.1.2 Neurologic Injury

The incidence of facial nerve transient neuropraxia after open joint surgery ranges from 1 to  $25\%$ ; it is generally limited to the temporal branch and usually resolves in 3 to 6 months [149]. It is also more frequent on patients with previous open joint surgery. Rarely, the zygomatic branches and, even more rarely, the entire temporofacial division may be injured. Injury to the chorda tympani from aggressive condylar retraction in the medial aspect of the fossa may occur rarely as well. Neuropraxia of the inferior alveolar and, less commonly, the lingual nerves may result from clamp placement for joint manipulation. Auriculotemporal nerve syndrome (Frey's syndrome or gustatory sweating) has been reported after the dissection of the joint [152]. It is the result of auriculotemporal nerve damage with reinnervation of the eccrine sweat glands by parasympathetic salivary fibers.

# 54.9.1.3 Infection

Infections rarely occur. Normally they are superficial wound infections in which microorganisms cultured may originate from the skin or external auditory meatus flora. To avoid contamination ear packing is avoided as it frequently becomes dislodged during surgery. In addition, the ear is not suctioned during surgery.

# 54.9.1.4 Otologic Complications

The proximity of the TMJ to the ear increases the risk for potential damage. Lacerations of the external auditory canal (EAC) usually occur at the junction with the

bony portion of the canal due to the anteromedial inclination of the canal. If a laceration occurs, packing the EAC with iodoform gauze for 5-7 days will be enough to prevent stenosis. Alternatively antibiotic-hydrocortisone otic drops can be used to prevent infection and aid healing. Although rare, an aural-TMJ fistula may develop as long-term complication of EAC laceration. Perforation of the tympanic membrane occurs when an instrument is inadvertently passed through the membrane. Small perforations in the anterior or inferior portion of the membrane result in minimal hearing loss. Larger and injuries to the posterior region may cause hearing loss due to possible ossicle disruption. If perforation is noted, otolaryngologist consultation is warranted. Auriculitis and external otitis are more likely to occur with the postauricular and endaural approaches. Treatment consists of pain control, cleaning of the EAC, and antibiotic-hydrocortisone otic drops.

# 54.9.2 Long-Term Complications

# 54.9.2.1 Malocclusion

Significant occlusal changes can be found in some cases after aggressive open joint surgery was performed. Correction may require the services of orthodontist and/or prosthodontist and even further surgery like orthognathic surgery or total TMJ replacements [153].

# 54.9.2.2 Ankylosis

Fibrous ankylosis can form between the disc and the articular eminence if hemoarthrosis develops. Lack of patient compliance with postoperative physical therapy can also develop fibrous ankylosis. Bony ankylosis is more common after discectomy with poor postoperative physical therapy, with heterotopic bone formation, and it can also be seen in the multiple operated patient.

# 54.9.2.3 Reoperations

Unfortunately, TMJ surgeries are not always successful, and the patient's preoperative symptoms persist or may even increase after surgery. There are many potential pitfalls that can occur during any phase of the treatment that can lead to complications, less than desirable results, and short- or long-term failures. Establishing the possible causes of the unsatisfactory outcome is paramount in the reoperation planning process. Multiple causative factors have been described in the literature [146] and include the following:

1. Misdiagnosis of the original pathology  
2. Patient selection  
3. Inappropriate procedure  
4. Surgeon's experience

5. Complications  
6. Systemic disease  
7. Improper postoperative care

When contemplating surgical failure and the necessity for reoperation, the surgeon must take into account all the different variables of the disease process to select the best surgical solution with the highest probability of success.

# Conclusions

Remarkably good success has been reported with several TMJ disc procedures, which differ in their fundamental approach to the problem and their aggressiveness. Open surgical approaches to TMJ disc derangements are now relegated to a tertiary line of care following nonsurgical therapy and arthrocentesis/arthroscopy for most conditions. They do, however, have a clear indication for certain mechanical conditions directly attributed to a disc obstruction. As we increase our understanding of the pathology, open joint surgical procedures are being performed for specific well-defined conditions. However, the new TMJ surgeon will never quite appreciate the experience that comes with performance of arthrotomy procedures. Arthroscopy is developed as a consequence of this experience. Now, as we regress with progress, arthrocentesis with and without steroid injection, a procedure performed by many surgeons, years before the pathology of the joint was even elucidated, has become a mainstay for treatment. This treatment alone has significantly reduced the need to intervene via arthrotomy.
