# Learning Aims

1. Facial asymmetries are 3D deformities and most often require two-jaw surgery.  
2. Mild facial asymmetry is easily recognized by the patient and often correlates with clinical depression, neurosis, and poor self-esteem.  
3. The etiology of facial asymmetry is complex but may be defined as congenital, developmental, and acquired.  
4. Treatment of facial asymmetry requires accurate diagnosis, 3D imaging, orthodontic coordination, and a variety of surgical options of bone and soft tissue.

In the 1960s and 1970s, surgeons attempted to limit orthognathic surgery to one jaw, usually the mandible, for fear of vascular compromise with maxillary osteotomies. Mandibular ramus osteotomies, performed in conjunction with maxillary osteotomies, were complex, technically difficult, time-consuming, and unstable procedures and were associated with higher patient morbidity [1]. It is difficult to correct a maxillary occlusal cant in the nongrowing patient without adjustment of the mandibular plane of occlusion. Similarly, midline discrepancies resulting from unilateral tooth loss are more rapidly corrected by mild asymmetrical rotational changes in the maxilla and/or mandible rather than with a prolonged course of orthodontics with possible gingival and periodontal problems.

This chapter focuses on the unique characteristics of asymmetrical orthognathic deformities as an indication for two-jaw surgery. The most important concept to understand about bimaxillary surgery is not the ability to perform simultaneous maxillary and mandibular procedures but to know the indications for surgery as well as the sequential treatment plan and also how to maintain a stable reference during complex asymmetrical bimaxillary surgery. Although little information is available on orthognathic asymmetry as an indication for bimaxillary surgery, it is well recognized that an inappropriate diagnosis, inaccurate treatment planning, and lack of intraoperative surgical reference points and planes are common errors in the approach to these patients. Skeletal asymmetries require three-dimensional bony and soft tissue changes with complex skeletal movements that result in aesthetic facial changes, and facial symmetry has a high degree of correlation with perceived facial attractiveness. Even mild facial asymmetries may be easily perceived by the untrained individual, and higher degrees of asymmetry are correlated with clinical depression, neurosis, feelings of inferiority, poor self-esteem, and general poor quality of life and health-related problems [2].

# Definitions

1. Congenital anomalies are conditions acquired during in utero development and can be further subdivided into malformations, deformities, and disruptions.  
2. Developmental anomalies are conditions arising during the post uterine growth through adulthood.  
3. Acquired anomalies are clinical conditions arising from either traumatic injuries or pathologic lesions.

# 66.1 Etiology of Facial Asymmetry

Although there are multiple potential causes of facial asymmetry, the differential diagnosis can be grouped into three general classes: congenital, developmental, and acquired deformities [3, 4]. Congenital anomalies are conditions acquired during in utero development and can be further subdivided into malformations, deformities, and disruptions. Malformations are the result of an intrinsically abnormal developmental process during embryogenesis. For example, unilateral cleft lip is a type of malformation [4]. Deformities represent an abnormal form, or position, of a part of the body caused by a nondisruptive mechanical force applied during the fetal period [4]. Mandibular deformation may result from a prolonged, acute lateral flexion position of the head, with the shoulder pressed against the mandible, during late intrauterine growth. Lastly, disruptions are morphologic defects resulting from a breakdown of an otherwise normal developmental process [4]. Examples of disruption are facial clefting and limb amputation from in utero formation of amniotic banding [4]. Developmental anomalies are conditions arising during postuterine growth through adulthood, and acquired anomalies are clinical conditions arising from either traumatic injuries or pathologic lesions. Finally, the etiology of facial asymmetry may be idiopathic without any identifiable cause.

# 66.2.1 Hemifacial Microsomia

Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a craniofacial malformation resulting from defects in the first and second branchial arches that presents with asymmetrical unilateral, or bilateral, hypoplasia of the orbit(s), maxilla, mandible, ear, cranial nerves, and facial soft tissues (Fig. 66.1) [5]. Current evidence supports the theory

![](images/a00ee674092230c45ab0a02ecf8fcc14785f0e20e192de4050638b13bf980656.jpg)  
Fig. 66.1 A 16-year-old with hemifacial microsomia (HFM) type I, with maxillary cant, dental midline deviation, and facial asymmetry

that HFM results from a defect in the proliferation and migration of embryonic neural crest cells [6, 7], whereas another theory maintains that hemorrhage, or thrombosis, of the stapedial artery during fetal development leads to impaired unilateral facial growth [8, 9]. In fact, the exact etiologic factors involved in the development of HFM still remain unknown.

Two important factors need to be considered in the treatment planning of the patient with HFM: (1) the facial growth potential and magnitude of growth restriction and the effect on surrounding hard and soft tissue structures; and (2) the degree of hypoplasia of the glenoid fossa, mandibular condyle, and ramus unit [10, 11]. Appropriate classification of the extent of the HFM deformity can provide useful information in order to determine an accurate diagnosis and ideal reconstruction options and a valid estimation of prognosis. The Pruzansky classification of HFM [12], modified by Kaban and coworkers [13], currently provides a clinically useful framework to help guide the treatment plan, based upon the presence or absence of critical structures of the condyle-fossa-ramus complex [13, 14]. HFM type I deformity can be summarized as a generalized mild hypoplastic state involving the muscles of mastication,

the glenoid fossa, and the mandibular condyle and ramus units. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) functions with normal rotation, but restricted translation movements. Patients typically present with mild mandibular retrognathia and facial asymmetry. Because there is acceptable TMJ function and mild facial dysmorphology, surgical therapy is usually not indicated. HFM type IIA deformity involves a hypoplastic coneshaped condylar head that is located medial and anterior to a hypoplastic glenoid fossa. TMJ function is often satisfactory so, again, surgical intervention is usually not indicated. HFM type IIB deformity involves a moderate to severe hypoplasia of the glenoid fossa, condyle, and mandibular ramus. Unlike the type IIA deformity, these patients have no functional articulation between the temporal bone and the condyle. However, manual jaw manipulation usually reveals a posterior slope of the condyle when placed in contact with posterior slope of the glenoid fossa [15]. HFM type III has a complete absence of the mandibular ramus and condyle. No manual condylar seating or posterior stop is achievable with jaw manipulation. In contrast to types I and II, type III patients present with severe mandibular dysmorphology and often require surgical reconstruction of the fossa-condyle-ramus complex (Fig. 66.2) [15].

The treatment protocols for HFM remain an area of controversy. The treatment philosophy of using intercpective orthodontic therapy, combined with early surgical treatment in growing children, is based upon the hypothesis that HFM is a progressive deformity and that early treatment can positively affect future facial growth [10]. Alternatively, a treatment protocol based upon the theory that HFM is not progressive in nature has been well described by Posnick [11] and, with this philosophy, treatment is considered primarily later in life, during the adolescent period.

# 66.3 Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate

Patients with cleft lip and palate often present with bilateral or unilateral midface deficiency resulting in an apparent increased AP projection of the paranasal, nasal, infraorbital, and zygomatic regions, as well as at the occlusal level [16]. However, the degree and location of maxillofacial growth deficiency in children with cleft lip and palate are largely dependent upon the location and type of cleft lip and cleft palate repair performed and the patient's age at the time of repair [17-19]. Most studies show that children with a repaired cleft lip and palate have a decreased vertical and horizontal maxillary growth pattern and a decreased vertical growth of the mandibular ramus with a steep mandibular plane angle [20-22]. Ross [23] has shown that approximately  $25\%$  of patients with a repaired cleft lip or cleft palate have a midface deficiency and class III malocclusion that require skeletal orthognathic surgery in adolescence.

# 66.3.1Craniosynostosis: Plagiocephaly

The term plagiocephaly is derived from the Greek word plagios, which refers to the twisted shape of the skull when viewed from a craniocaudal perspective. The etiology of this type of craniosynostosis is often a unilateral premature fusion of the coronal or lambdoid sutures. Unilateral synostosis of the coronal suture results in an asymmetrical parallelogram-shaped forehead and brow. The affected side is usually flattened, and the contralateral side may show compensatory overgrowth with frontal bulging or frontal bossing. In addition, synostosis of the coronal suture often indirectly affects the lower facial morphology, with deviation of the root of the nose toward the affected side and chin deviation to the unaffected side, opposite to the flattened forehead. The mandible generally develops normally but may exhibit secondary dysmorphology as well [24, 25].

# 66.3.2Congenital Hemifacial Hyperplasia

Congenital hemifacial hyperplasia is a rare unilateral enlargement of the craniofacial soft and/or hard tissues. Although the term "hemihypertrophy" has commonly been used, it is inappropriate because the condition is due to tissue hyperplasia (increased number of cells) and not tissue hypertrophy (enlargement of individual cells) [26]. Pollock and colleagues [27] have hypothesized that the asymmetrical facial development results from abnormal neural crest cell migration. Yoshimoto and associates [28] found increased proliferative activity of osteoblasts in a patient with congenital hemifacial

hyperplasia and hypothesized that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its receptor signal transduction axis in osteoblasts may be selectively involved resulting in the progression of hemifacial overgrowth.

# 66.4 Developmental Facial Asymmetries

# 66.4.1 Primary Growth Deformities

# 66.4.1.1 Facial Hemiatrophy

Facial hemiatrophy (Parry-Romberg syndrome) is characterized by a progressive unilateral facial loss of skin, associated soft tissues, cartilage, and hard tissues (Fig. 66.3). The left side is more often affected than the right side. Associated clinical findings include Jacksonian epilepsy, cutaneous dyspigmentations, and ipsilateral alopecia [26]. An internet survey of 205 facial hemiatrophy patients revealed a median age of onset of 10 years with a range of 1 to 50 years. In most patients  $(71\%)$ , the facial hemiatrophy began before age 15 years [29-31]. The etiology of facial hemiatrophy remains unknown, but there have been associations established with Lyme disease, ablation of the superior cervical

Fig. 66.3 Right facial hemiatrophy (Parry-Romberg syndrome), after skin and bone grafting

sympathetic ganglia, localized scleroderma, Rasmussen's encephalitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [32-36]. Alterations in the peripheral trophic sympathetic system is one of the more commonly accepted theories of the etiology of this disorder [26]. The various treatments for the soft tissue deficiencies of facial hemiatrophy, or hemifacial atrophy, have included silicone injections, alloplastic implants, microfat injections, and microvascular free tissue transfer [37-39].

# 66.4.1.2 Hemimandibular Hyperplasia

Another developmental anomaly resulting in facial asymmetry is hemimandibular hyperplasia, which is characterized by a diffuse enlargement of the condyle, the condylar neck, and the mandibular ramus and body regions [40]. In 1986, Obwegeser and Makek [41] described the deformity as hemimandibular hyperplasia or hemimandibular elongation. In 1996, Chen and coworkers [42] proposed that all cases of hemimandibular hyperplasia actually represent a spectrum of variations in condylar overgrowth, and it was proposed that if condylar overgrowth is not arrested, it can progress into hemimandibular hyperplasia. In spite of the differences in nomenclature, no specific etiologic factor has been established. Condylar growth patterns can be evaluated by serial clinical comparisons, including serial cephalometric tracings, and bone scan techniques. However, no ideal method has been found to assess whether condylar overgrowth is active or inactive, or quiescent. Treatment for hemimandibular hyperplasia is guided by patient age and condylar growth activity; these range from orthopedic maxillary management to condylectomy. Although it is generally accepted that surgical treatment should be delayed until growth activity has ceased [40], others believe that early surgery, performed while condylar growth is still active, may cause a surgical insult and postsurgical scarring that can beneficially halt the condylar growth. Also, in some severe cases, condylar resection during active growth of the condyle may be necessary for correction of a significantly asymmetrical, or socially unacceptable, facial appearance.

# 66.4.2Secondary Growth Deformities

Sternocleidomastoid torticollis is a condition resulting from a birth trauma-induced hematoma of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that gradually undergoes fibrosis over time and leads to muscular contraction and torticollis. However, the precise etiologic factors of this entity are still unknown. If the condition is not corrected early enough with proper physical therapy or surgery for neck and sternocleidomastoid muscle mobility, malformed facial development will usually result ipsi

lateral to the side affected by the torticollis [43, 44]. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy often result in areas of decreased muscle tone, which can affect the development of facial form by limiting the amount of bone formation at sites of normal muscle attachment and function. Consequently, facial asymmetry and dysmorphology may be a clinical finding seen in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy [45].

# 66.5 Acquired Facial Asymmetries

# 66.5.1Condylar Trauma

A common cause of facial asymmetry in the growing child is trauma to the mandibular condyle, although, in many cases, neither the child nor the parent can recall the traumatic event (Figs. 66.4 and 66.5) [46]. Trauma-induced injury to the condyle can lead to a hemarthrosis that results in intra-articular scarring and restriction of condylar translation. Proffit and Turvey [47] described this clinical scenario as a functional ankylosis, or soft tissue extracapsular ankylosis, because, in most cases, condylar function is acceptable. In addition to limitation of jaw movement caused by fibro-osseous TMJ ankylosis and coronoid process elongation and temporalis tendon scarring, complete bony ankylosis of the condyle to the temporal bone and skull base may also occur after intracapsular hemarthrosis, resulting in no rotation or any condylar movement. Consequently, trauma-induced scarring or bony ankylosis of the TMJ can also result in relative degrees of restricted skeletal growth. In other words, the greater the degree of trans

![](images/2c38f89962a40c8993a965c06ca6524ba1e55cd2026a674e8fc031dcc1e6e168.jpg)

lational restriction, the greater the resultant facial deformity. A similar clinical scenario involves whether open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of a condylar fracture is required to stabilize the condylar cartilaginous growth center in skeletally immature patients. Studies in skeletally immature primates and in children have revealed that the displaced condylar segment undergoes resorption and replacement with a new condylar head with regeneration of the overlying cartilage based upon functional remodeling. Therefore, there is nothing intrinsically critical about the condylar head as a mandibular growth center, and because the condylar head in children is regenerated spontaneously, the necessity of ORIF of a displaced condylar segment is unnecessary. Moreover, the surgical procedure is not without potentially significant morbidity, and the resulting scar and possible soft and hard tissue restriction from the ORIF procedure may outweigh the benefits of surgical anatomic condylar reduction. Several studies have indicated that ORIF of condylar fractures in children should be avoided [47-49].

# 66.5.2 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

Facial asymmetry may be found in patients affected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) of the TMJ [50]. JIA is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation of one or more joints, affecting children up to the age of 18 years. The TMJ is frequently involved and can lead to facial growth disturbances, including facial asymmetry [50]. TMJ involvement may be asymmetrical and very apparent or may be mild or asymptomatic and not be clinically detectable [51, 52]. However, symptomatic TMJ involvement may not be associated with any evidence of facial growth disturbances; and conversely,

facial growth disturbances may be present without any clinical TMJ symptoms [51]. Both polyarticular-onset and pauciarticular-onset JIA have been found to have a negative impact on the form, function, and aesthetics of the face. However, the effects are more pronounced with polyarticular JIA [53, 54]. Characteristic facial features of patients with JIA include a small mandible, class II malocclusion, and anterior open bite occlusion. Patients with polyarticular JIA with TMJ involvement tend to have small, short faces with underdeveloped mandibles [55]. Currently, no effective therapeutic method is available to eliminate the progression of the disease and its effect on facial development, although methotrexate therapy has been shown to minimize TMJ destruction and craniofacial dysmorphology in patients with polyarticular JIA [56]. Corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of JIA, but their therapeutic benefit is controversial.

# 66.5.3Degenerative Joint Disease

Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is considered an end-stage result of progressive internal derangement and osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Usually, patients have bilateral involvement of the TMJ, but unilateral involvement is not uncommon. The wear and tear effects of DJD on the TMJ results in condylar glenoid erosion and decreased condylar ramus height with asymmetry. Clinically, patients often present with preauricular noise or crepitus, limitation of mandibular motion, preauricular pain, and an anterior open bite occlusion [57].

# Key Points

Diagnostic Workup

1. Careful history and review of family photographs.  
2. Panoramic, cephalometric imaging.  
3. CBCT, 3D CT.  
4. Serial photographs, and imaging.  
5. Evaluate and correlate the hard and soft tissue related to the asymmetry.  
6. Usually delay surgical treatment until after growth is complete.

# 66.6 Clinical Patient Assessment

The usual comprehensive methods of patient evaluation includes the chief complaint and, with additional information gained from the history of the present illness, the answers to pertinent questions regarding a history of facial trauma, arthritis involving other joints, and genetic or congenital malformations may be identified. A physical examination of the head and neck region in

the patient with a facial asymmetry should include the following: [58]

1. Visual inspection of the entire face, including facial subunits for symmetry in the vertical and horizontal planes  
2. Palpation of the face to differentiate between soft and hard tissue defects  
3. Comparison of dental and facial midlines with each other and with the central facial axis  
4. Inspection for gonial angle asymmetry or differences in the degree of antagonial notching  
5. Analysis of the relationship between the upper lip and the maxillary central incisors  
6. Inspection for malocclusion, occlusal cants, excessive inclination of anterior teeth, dental crowding, open bite occlusal relationships, the maximal interincisal opening, and the presence of mandibular deviation upon opening  
7. Comprehensive examination of TMJ function, including protrusion and lateral excursion movements

Following the data gathering, including the chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, family history, social history, and physical examination, radiographic and laboratory studies may be indicated, and articulator-mounted diagnostic dental casts are evaluated, a prioritized problem list and corresponding treatment plan options may be developed and presented to the patient and family.

# 66.6.1 Radiographic Assessment

# 66.6.1.1 Panoramic Radiograph

The Panorex can provide information about the relative size and shape of the mandibular condyle as well as ramus height and antagonial notching. Degenerative changes of the TMJ or asymmetrical mandibular ramus morphology may be identified with a comparative vertical measurement of the condylar head apex (condylion) to the base of the sigmoid notch and the sigmoid notch to the mandibular angle (gonion) bilaterally [58]. Also, dental and sinus abnormalities, as well as orbital and ear deformities, may be detected if the field of view includes these structures.

# 66.6.1.2Posteroanterior Cephalometric Radiograph

The posteroanterior (PA) cephalometric radiograph enables one to evaluate the magnitude of the facial skeletal deformity relative to the cranial base. Acetate overlay tracings soft and hard tissue features can be created and compared with true vertical and horizontal axes.

These reference landmarks may not be easy to determine, especially in severe deformities or where the landmark may be missing (e.g., zygomatic bone or condylar hypoplasia or aplasia). Although the most appropriate midline reference is controversial and may include a midpoint between two lateral measurements (e.g., medial aspect of the frontozygomatic suture), a consistent midline reference is the crista galli of the ethmoid bone. In cases of ear abnormalities, the ear rod on the involved side should rest against the temporal bone in the area where the normal ear should be so that horizontal references can be compared without the need to account for an abnormal head posture. Also, owing to the overlap of several skeletal structures, there are limitations to the use of the PA cephalogram in the diagnosis of facial asymmetries, but, in general, deviations of the dental and skeletal midlines, occlusal cants, orbital asymmetries, ear and external auditory canal (EAC) abnormalities, and vertical ramus discrepancies may be determined with this radiograph [58].

# 66.6.1.3Lateral Cephalometric Radiograph

A lateral cephalometric radiograph can provide an indication of vertical ramus height differences by the finding of two separate radiographic mandibular inferior border outlines. However, to determine the relative significance of the differences in dentofacial superimposition, one must know whether the EACs are level with the patient's natural head position, and as mentioned, only a single cephalometric ear rod should be used if the patient's EACs are abnormal or not located at the same level [58].

# 66.6.2 Computed Tomography

Computed tomography (CT) can provide two-dimensional localized views of the facial skeleton, or it can be developed further into three-dimensional views that can provide excellent overall detail necessary for the proper diagnosis and treatment planning of a complex facial dysmorphology (Fig. 66.6).

# 66.6.3Stereolithographic Modeling

Three-dimensional CT scans can provide information to allow the fabrication of an actual three-dimensional skeletal model via stereolithography (SLA) or computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM). These models can assist the surgeon with physical three-dimensional assessment and formulation of surgical predictions; however, owing to the high cost, these models are primarily used for planning of complex dentofacial and craniofacial deformities [59].

$\square$  Fig. 66.6 Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan of asymmetrical craniofacial skeleton (right HFM)

Most recently, three-dimensional CT treatment planning has become a popular technique for planning three-dimensional orthognathic and skeletal jaw movements, especially in cases of severe asymmetries planned for complex rotation and transverse jaw movements, and fabrication of SLA intermediate and final occlusal splints during the treatment planning process.

CT scans may be segmented to create surface textures of the patient's soft tissue. These surface scans may then be converted to surface shells and imported to a CAD-CAM software for surface-to-surface analysis of before and after changes of the soft or hard tissues. Often, these surface shells are paired together and analyzed using a "best-fit" or "Procrustes" algorithm. This mathematical technique allows areas that have no changes to remain the same and areas of changes to show up as a color map indicating positive or negative changes. This digital subtraction has been used in many applications that include soft tissue changes from orthognathic surgery, postoperative swelling, and syndromic 3D facial analysis (Fig. 66.7).

# 66.6.4Bone Scans

Radionuclide skeletal scintigraphy, including technetium  $99\mathrm{m}$  pertechnetate, gallium, and indium-labelling, as well as positron-emission tomography (PET) scans, have been shown to be sensitive diagnostic methods for identifying mandibular overgrowth in the patient with a facial asymmetry and to determine activity or quiescence of the increased growth. However, bone scan findings are nonspecific and may be the result of a variety of bone and soft tissue abnormalities, including soft and hard tissue carcinomas, sarcomas, metastatic disease, hematologic disease, infections, inflammatory processes, metabolic diseases, and trauma, including recent dental extractions [60]. In patients with asymmetrical mandibular overgrowth, nucleotide uptake is not imaged in a symmetrical fashion bilaterally and, in most cases, patients demonstrate an increased nucleotide uptake and activity on the affected side. However, caution must be exercised when evaluating an area of increased uptake in order not to

confuse condylar overgrowth with other conditions (e.g., arthritis, TMJ disorders, trauma) that can mimic nucleotide uptake activity [61]. Additional diagnostic radiographic techniques of fusing PET-CT images to high-resolution structural CT images have been shown to provide improved resolution and delineation of the precise area of bone activity [62].

# 66.7 Surgical Treatment

Some facial asymmetries may not always be apparent to the patient and family, and therefore, appropriate treatment can begin only when a proper diagnosis has been established. The face should be evaluated in all dimensions, with a careful analysis of the vertical and horizontal proportions and the corresponding facial subunits. Failure to recognize asymmetry until after surgery is complete is generally the reason for the poor final outcome. In general, treatment planning of facial asymmetry is similar to that of orthognathic surgery, except that, depending upon the specific skeletal abnormality, more emphasis is placed on the frontal, as opposed to the profile, view during the examination. As mentioned, cephalometric analysis may be grossly inaccurate owing to inappropriate ear rod positioning during lateral and PA cephalograms, and whereas these radiographs are simple screening tools, standard and three-dimensional CT scans are much more accurate. CT data can be converted by CAD/CAM imaging into an actual acrylic SLA model that can be used for predictive model surgery, customized facial implant fabrication, and design of custom distraction osteogenesis devices. Despite the available radiologic studies, the clinical examination is the most important diagnostic tool, and it should be remembered that body posture, mannerisms, and the presence of facial hair and various hairstyles may mask a facial asymmetry and may direct the treatment plan in an erroneous direction. In one study of 495 patients with facial asymmetry, the mandible was the facial bone most often affected [63]. Upper

face and midface asymmetry was found only in  $5\%$  of patients, but mandibular asymmetry with chin point deviation was present in  $75\%$  of cases. Chin deviation, usually apparent on clinical examination, is most often to the left, indicating a tendency for increased right-sided mandibular growth.

# 66.7.1Delayed Treatment

In many cases, a delayed treatment approach may be most appropriate because the management of facial asymmetry in preadolescent children is extremely complex and the results are not always predictable owing to continued facial growth. The interpretation of studies on growth modification using functional appliances have been difficult because of a variety of treatment designs with lack of standardization of treatment and control group populations and difficulties with randomization of the groups, as well as other confounding variables in the studies. Although noninvasive techniques, such as growth modification, will not cause irreversible harm to the patient, most asymmetrical craniofacial syndromes, condylar deformities, and traumatic injuries sustained at an early age do require surgery. Bite block therapy can be helpful in reorienting the plane of occlusion in children with occlusal cants, but it rarely obviates the need for surgery, and typically, bite block therapy is mainly used as an intervention for secondary growth deformities. The functional status of the TMJ is a critical component to consider in the overall treatment planning process for the patient with facial asymmetry, and mild asymmetries in the growing patient with functional TMJs should be considered for early intercognitive orthodontics only, and growth completion should be permitted to occur before consideration for surgical intervention. It is well accepted that jaw movement is critical after condylar fractures to prevent limitation of mandibular motion and the development of ankylosis and that physical therapy and rehabilitation stimulate continued condylar and mandibular growth. Lack of function usually results in an asymmetrical mandible and secondary maxillary and midface asymmetries. After condylar trauma, mandibular hypoplasia with growth retardation is seen much more frequently than mandibular hyperplasia or overgrowth. In general, mandibular hyperplasia may be accelerated after an adolescent growth spurt, whereas delayed growth with mandibular hypoplasia is more often present in the preadolescent years and childhood. Regardless of the exact etiology of the mandibular asymmetry, it is important to establish a surgical treatment plan that will achieve the most functional, stable, and aesthetic outcomes. Orthognathic asymmetries should be treated after

growth completion because this surgery will require a combination of maxillary and mandibular surgery with the application of rigid internal fixation.

# 66.7.2Orthodontic Considerations

Human facial symmetry is directly associated with facial attractiveness. It is also well documented that true symmetry is not the norm, and comparison mirroring of the right sides of a face compared with the left side reveals two completely different facial forms [64, 65]. For the typical orthodontic patient, minor facial asymmetries become a concern only when they present with aesthetic complaints. Severe asymmetries often result in cross-bites, malocclusions, cheek biting, poor masticatory forces, condylar dysfunction, myositis, tendinitis, and chronic head and neck pain. From a diagnostic standpoint, patients with asymmetries differ from the typical orthodontic patient in several ways, and the clinical examination and data gathering process should generate sufficient information for accurate diagnosis and formulation of the most appropriate treatment plan. The data should include photographs from multiple views, lateral and PA cephalometric radiographs, and facebow-mounted dental models [57-66]. Facial structures may be evaluated with a reference grid formed by the midsagittal plane and several perpendicular reference lines, according to the area being evaluated (e.g., interpupillary, subnasal, stomion). A tongue blade, or Fox plane, can be used to determine whether an occlusal cant is present, because unilateral vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetries are usually associated with an occlusal plane cant [58]; and this is the reason why most asymmetries cannot be effectively treated with single-jaw surgery. Typical orthodontic diagnostic records rely heavily on the profile view, because the lateral approach is derived from traditional diagnoses based upon cephalometric radiographs; however, patients are more aware of their aesthetic presentation from the frontal view. Additional diagnostic records may include a PA cephalometric radiograph, a submentovertex radiograph, and an accurate facebow transfer with casts mounted on a semiadjustable articulator [60-68].

The orthodontic management of patients with asymmetries does not differ a great deal from the typical orthognathic surgical patient. Good communication and a team approach during all phases of treatment are essential. Once the diagnosis and treatment plan have been established, the presurgical orthodontic phase is initiated, and basic principles of presurgical orthodontics must be observed. All tooth movements that may compromise stability should be avoided, especially if the

intended movement may be more easily accomplished with the surgical movements of bony segments (e.g., transverse maxillary expansion is more effectively managed with two-piece segmental maxillary surgery rather than orthodontic maxillary expansion, especially in the adult patient). Dentoalveolar decompensation in the maxillary arch must take into account the postsurgical position of the maxillary central incisor. Maxillary AP movements, as well as posterior impactions, have the greatest effect on the upper incisors with regard to AP positioning and dental torque, respectively. Dentoalveolar decompensations in the mandibular arch must observe the anatomic limits of the outlines of the bony symphysis. It must be remembered that the morphogenetic pattern in patients with maxillomandibular discrepancies results in variable abnormal bony architectural changes, and therefore, cephalometric norms cannot be applied to all asymmetries. In addition, there should not be any compromise in the presurgical orthodontic treatment plan that might severely limit the final orthodontic and surgical treatment outcomes. The need for extractions should be assessed and performed if indicated, and dental impressions and early model surgery can be helpful in confirming that the presurgical goals are appropriate and/or that the treatment objectives have been achieved.

Common orthodontic problems in the asymmetry patient include improper buccal root torque in the upper arch, improper arch coordination (especially when AP movements are planned), and a lack of sufficient incisor overjet that can limit placement of the jaws into an ideal class I canine and molar occlusal relationship. The decision to extract teeth is often difficult, and perhaps the first issue that must be addressed is whether there is significant dental crowding or a Bolton discrepancy. This determination is based primarily on the ideal planned final position of the upper and lower incisors in the basal bone of the maxilla and mandible. The relationships of the upper incisors to the sella-nasion (SN) (104 degrees), palatal plane (104 degrees), and nasion point A (NA) line (4 mm and 22 degrees) are excellent indicators of whether these teeth require decompensation. It must be kept in mind that posterior impaction of the maxilla decreases the torque, or protrusion, of the upper incisors, so the orthodontic treatment must take this into consideration and not retrocline the incisors because they will be further uprighted by the surgical movement. In addition, large unilateral vertical changes, such as maxillary impaction or down-grafting, will rotate the midline of the maxillary incisors. However, when this is anticipated, the upper incisors should be maintained in a slightly proclined angulation. As a surgical treatment objective (STO), the position of the upper incisor, and a point relative to N-perpendicular, can be used as reasonable cephalometric references.

Therefore, dental crowding as well as the ideal position of the upper incisors within basal bone of the maxilla will ultimately determine the need for extractions. Upper second bicuspid extractions are preferred when minimal incisor decompensation is required anteriorly; and maxillary first bicuspidis are extracted when the upper incisors require greater degrees of decompensation, such as in class III cases. If mild crowding is present ( $\leq 4\mathrm{mm}$ ) and no dentoalveolar decompensation is needed, a nonextraction approach is acceptable, and some interproximal reduction (IPR) may be required. If significant incisor decompensation is required, the cephalometric correction must be factored into the assessment of the degree of crowding. For every 3 degrees of change in the angulation between the lower incisor and the mandibular plane, it is necessary to add or subtract  $2.5\mathrm{mm}$  to the measured clinical crowding. In patients with class II malocclusions, cephalometric correction most often adds to the clinical crowding assessment because the lower incisor typically requires a more upright repositioning, whereas with class III malocclusions, cephalometric correction usually alleviates this crowding. In other words, cephalometric correction takes into account the goals for the lower incisor into the crowding assessment; moreover, it helps to decide which teeth should be extracted. When the measured crowding in the lower arch is moderate ( $5-9\mathrm{mm}$ ), mandibular second bicuspidids should be extracted, which will result in alignment of lower incisor angulation and complete closure of the extraction spaces. When crowding is severe ( $>10\mathrm{mm}$ ) after cephalometric correction, mandibular first bicuspidids should be extracted to allow alignment and proper positioning of the lower incisor. The rationale is that when two bicuspidids are extracted, an average of  $14\mathrm{mm}$  of total arch space is created. If the total crowding is  $10\mathrm{mm}$ , including cephalometric correction, then  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of space is left. This  $4\mathrm{mm}$  is used by the forward movement of the posterior teeth as lost anchorage during the alignment and retraction of the lower incisors. Maximum decompensation is often required with minimal clinical crowding, therefore, requiring first bicuspid extractions. If crowding exceeds  $14\mathrm{mm}$ , extractions alone are not sufficient to alleviate the crowding and achieve an ideal position of the lower incisors. IPR may help to create another 3 to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of total arch space to accomplish these goals simultaneously.

Patients with hyperdivergent facial forms who present with an asymmetry may require differential maxillary impaction; in such cases, there is a need to flatten the curve of Spee in both arches before surgery. The curve of Spee is often different from left to right, and flattening the curve allows for maximum intercuspation to be achieved between the anterior teeth and the bicuspid teeth, with the creation of minimum posterior open

bites. If the posterior maxilla is intentionally overim- pacted when relapse is expected, the result will be a posterior open bite, and no vertical elastics are placed distal to the bicuspidis for the first 8 weeks after surgery. The goal should be to achieve maximal intercuspation, although in the patient with a facial asymmetry, the occlusion on one side may be more open than on the other; it is usually the hypoplastic side that remains slightly open, and generally teeth can be extruded with vertical elastics postsurgically. An open bite of  $2\mathrm{mm}$  or less is acceptable, and occasionally desirable, because some settling and relapse occur after surgery; and in general, no orthodontic forces should be applied in the direction of the potential surgical relapse. Patients with hypodivergent asymmetrical faces typically require mandibular advancement with an increase in the lower anterior facial height. The original malocclusion is often characterized by an excessive overbite, overjet, and accentuated curve of Spee, which may be different from side to side. The maxillary curve of Spee should be flattened and the ideal position of the upper incisors achieved. No attempt should be made to level the lower curve of Spee because forward movement of the mandible to an ideal overbite and overjet will increase the lower anterior facial height and the curve of Spee is maintained. If the lower mandibular plane angle has been maintained during mandibular advancement, this may result in a posterior open bite in the bicuspid or molar region. The increased interocclusal space with this postsurgical tripod occlusion will allow leveling of the mandibular curve of Spee with minimal effort after surgery, using a flexible braided wire in the lower arch as vertical intercuspation elastics are applied to extrude the lower posterior teeth and close the posterior open bite. A class II or class III vector may be incorporated in the postsurgical period in order to achieve optimum occlusal intercuspation. The maxillary arch should be stabilized with a heavy rectangular arch wire. Postsurgical orthodontic procedures are usually completed within 6 to 8 months after surgery if all other phases of treatment have been successful. Vertical elastics may be directed by the orthodontist depending on the occlusion and the unique differences of the hyperplastic or hypoplastic side of the face. Severe orthognathic asymmetries are often difficult from an orthodontic standpoint owing to the presence of unilateral differences in a hyperplastic jaw, with a contralateral hypoplastic dental and skeletal compensation.

# 66.7.3Surgical Options

In rare cases, facial asymmetries may be treated in a single jaw, although generally, asymmetrical growth results in compensation of the teeth, alveolus, and the

other jaw and the rest of the facial skeleton and soft tissues. Furthermore, this compensation may be significantly different from side to side and will require different orthodontic mechanics. Facial asymmetry may be improved from an aesthetic standpoint without standard orthognathic surgery, using a variety of techniques, including an inferior border ostectomy or recontouring procedure, inferior border augmentation, and genioplasty procedures. The aesthetic impact of an asymmetry involves both the hard and the soft tissues, and commonly, the zygoma and periorbital and nasal structures may be involved, as well as the adjacent soft tissues, such as the salivary glands, muscles, and adipose tissue, with quantitative differences from side to side. The expectations of the patient as well as the surgical possibilities should be discussed at length, because asymmetrical deformities can rarely be corrected completely. Most patients notice horizontal or transverse facial discrepancies more often than vertical asymmetries (e.g., maxillary occlusal cants are difficult to detect clinically). Horizontal asymmetries resulting in maxillary dental midline, chin, and nasal deviations are typically very obvious clinically. Asymmetries in vertical facial height are less apparent clinically, and in severe cases, such as HFM or other syndromes, soft tissue augmentation and even free vascularized tissue may be necessary for correction.

The oral and maxillofacial surgeon should make a note of even minor anatomic asymmetries such as orbital, nasal, and upper lip position; maxillary dental midline position; smile arch; amount of gingival display on each side of the midline; cheek mass and malar prominence; the presence of dimples or clefts; mandibular dental midline position; mandibular deviations on opening or protrusion; TMJ articulation, rotation, and translation; gonial angle position; and cervical and neck anatomy. All of these should be documented. The surgical procedure should be selected based upon the etiology of the asymmetry with a healthy concern for stability and relapse in these patients. For example, when correcting a maxillary cant, vertical impaction is more stable than vertical down-grafting, and often the discrepancy may be corrected by a combination of both types of vertical maxillary movements. Severe asymmetries with a short mandibular ramus height may require an extraoral inverted-L osteotomy with bone grafting and rigid internal fixation. This technique releases the pterygomasseteric sling and provides excellent access to the hypoplastic ramus for bone grafting and application of rigid fixation. Vertical changes of less than 6 to  $8\mathrm{mm}$  may be treated via an intraoral approach with a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) and rigid fixation. Rotational movements of the mandible produce proximal segment flaring on the side that the mandible rotates

away from and ramus collapse on the side that the mandible is rotating toward. Proximal segment flaring may require bony modification within the SSO site to allow a more appropriate relationship of the proximal and distal segments. Some surgeons prefer a unilateral vertical oblique ramus osteotomy (VRO) (on the side that the mandible rotates toward) combined with a unilateral SSO (on the side that the mandible rotates away from). This combination surgery usually requires intermaxillary fixation, which may be beneficial in asymmetrical cases. With current techniques, monocortical plate and screw fixation can be applied to a VRO, using intraoral right-angle instrumentation, a transbuccal trocar technique, or an extraoral, or endoscope-assisted, approach. Conversely, intermaxillary fixation is often necessary, and even beneficial, because alignment of the segments with rigid fixation is not always possible and the soft tissue tension will attempt to retract the mandible to the original asymmetrical position.

As mentioned previously, a treatment plan should be established with an accurate clinical examination, cephalometric analysis, and model surgery, and the surgical procedure should be executed efficiently and with minimal patient morbidity, and the issues of relapse, stability, and mode of fixation should be determined before surgery and discussed with the patient. The first, and perhaps most important, treatment plan decision the surgeon must make is the ideal position of the maxillary central incisor. This is a critical decision and will essentially determine the three-dimensional position of both the maxilla and the mandible. The surgeon must consider dental midline discrepancies, incisor proclimation or retraction excesses, occlusal plane abnormalities, smile arch aesthetics, dental/gingival display at rest and upon smiling, and upper and lower lip support. An intermediate splint is useful in repositioning the maxilla, assuming that an accurate facebow transfer and model surgery have been performed. The intermediate splint is only one method used to align the maxilla and correct the asymmetry, although surgical experience and a thorough appreciation of aesthetics and facial symmetry are often more valuable tools for the surgeon. The maxilla must be placed in the proper and most symmetrical position, and then consideration should be given to the occlusion in relation to the uncut mandible; this position should be evaluated in relation to the overall treatment plan. The maxillary position can best be measured using a combination of an external landmark reference (nasal bone pin), Fox plane, upper lip position, as well as internal reference marks on the anterior maxillary wall. The intermediate splint helps to position and maintain the maxilla in the correct position during application of rigid fixation. The concept of an intermediate splint is based upon proper condylar position, which is difficult

to simulate because functional condylar position in an awake, upright patient is not the same as it is in a supine, paralyzed patient. Furthermore, asymmetrical problems often originate from abnormal condylar (TMJ) disorders, and many patients with facial asymmetries do not have bilateral symmetrical condylar rotation and, therefore, exhibit a great deal of muscular compensation during jaw posturing. If an intermediate splint does not seem to position the maxilla properly in all three dimensions, the surgeon should consider other references to determine facial symmetry; however, no specific measurements can replace surgical experience. In bimaxillary surgery, the osteotomies are performed in the mandible first, without completion of the osteotomy until after maxillary surgery is complete and rigid internal fixation has been applied to the repositioned maxilla. This surgical sequence prevents the creation of excessive forces on the new maxillary position via vibration of the drill or saw used for the mandible with a bite block in position and the forces transmitted to the maxilla. In addition, some surgeons believe that this sequence seems to expedite the overall surgery. An alternative surgical sequence completes the mandibular surgery with rigid fixation before the maxillary surgery, with the premise that it is more appropriate to reposition a mobile structure (the mandible) to a more stable structure (the maxilla and cranium), but this plan requires the precise predetermination of both the mandibular and the maxillary positions.

Mandibular ramus surgery is often difficult in cases of asymmetry because the ramus and body of the mandible are usually deformed and may be hypoplastic with a limited range of motion. Limited surgical access and a smaller soft tissue envelope create a difficult surgical challenge. If the mandible is cut first but not split, the osteotomies are made and a moist sponge is packed into the wound for hemostasis while the maxillary surgery is completed. The mandible is later split and moved to the proper position with the maxilla and held in the proper occlusion with an occlusal wafer, or final splint, with intermaxillary fixation wires. Rigid fixation of the mandible can be achieved with either bicortical positional screws or monocortical plates and screws, assuming that condylar position is appropriate. In large horizontal rotations of the mandible, bicortical screws cannot be placed as true compression screws (lag screws) without significant torque placed on the condyles. Modifications of the lingual cortical plate, and selective

grinding of the bony interferences, can be helpful to increase the bony contacts. In most cases, monocortical plates and screws provide adequate stability, without compression of the inferior alveolar nerve, or torqueing of the condyles; these can be placed transorally without the need for a transbuccal trocar used with bicortical screw fixation.

Adequate surgical mobilization of the maxilla and mandible is a key step that must be performed during bimaxillary surgery. The mandible and maxilla should be mobile enough to be positioned passively without tension on the soft tissues. This can be a significant concern because jaw repositioning can create tension and restriction in the pterygomasseteric sling, and if the mandibular segments are stretched into position under tension, long-term stability may be compromised. A balance must be achieved between adequate reflection of periosteum and loss of vascularity and maintenance of an adequate connective tissue envelope. Therefore, in severely hypoplastic mandibles with only rudimentary condyles, considerations for condylar reconstruction should include extraoral procedures of the mandibular ramus with costochondral grafting, or in some situations, distraction osteogenesis may be more appropriate in order to achieve soft tissue expansion with the gradual bony movements. Adjunctive simultaneous soft tissue procedures may be considered after bony repositioning of the maxilla and mandible and occlusal correction orthognathic surgery and internal rigid fixation. Alignment of the chin, nose, and malar complex should be performed after the functional anatomy of the maxilla and mandible has been established. Although simultaneous hard and soft tissue surgery has multiple advantages, it may not always be feasible, and some surgeons choose to wait to see the unpredictable soft tissues changes after bimaxillary surgery before addressing the soft tissue asymmetries.

# Tips and Tricks

1. Take advantage of CBCT and VSP technology, but trust your aesthetic evaluation and clinical impressions.  
2. Use both internal and external surgical reference points.  
3. Consider slight overcorrection of the asymmetry.  
4. Consider both hard and soft tissue augmentation.

# 66.7.3.1 Facial Asymmetry Case Examples

# Case 1

This is a 20-year-old woman with facial asymmetry resulting from trauma who required bimaxillary surgery (Fig. 66.8). She has a chief complaint of difficulty eating and chewing, with a history of chronic myofascial pain and masticatory dysfunction. She sustained a jaw fracture as a young child without treatment, and she has experienced the development of gradual facial asymmetry. She had an orthodontic consultation and it was determined that orthodontic treatment alone or single-jaw surgery would be insufficient to correct her asymmetry.

The physical examination revealed the obvious facial deformity, more pronounced from a basal view, which can often better demonstrate the deformity; also, upon biting on a tongue blade, occlusal cant can be demonstrated (Fig. 66.9). She was normocephalic and asymmetrical, with a short face and a jaw deviation to the right (Fig. 66.10). The TMJ articulation, rotation, and translation function was normal without clicking or popping. The maximum incisal opening was  $56\mathrm{mm}$  with a deviation to the right. The mandibular midline was  $7\mathrm{mm}$  to the right, the overjet was  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , the overbite was  $2\mathrm{mm}$ ; there

was excessive lower incisor dental display. She had a right buccal cross-bite, an anterior cross-bite, maxillary hypoplasia, a canted maxilla, and a short mandibular condyle (Fig. 66.11).

The presurgical workup included a three-dimensional CT scan, cephalometric and panoramic radiographs, and facebow mounting for fabrication of an accurate intermediate splint and predictive model surgery (Figs. 66.12, 66.13, and 66.14). The Erickson model block was used to measure the vertical changes in the maxilla and to fabricate an intermediate splint to assist in positioning the maxilla (Figs. 66.15 and 66.16). The surgical plan included a Le Fort I advancement of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  with a differential maxillary down-grafting of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  on the right side (Fig. 66.17). The resultant maxillary osteotomy gap was grafted with allogeneic tibial bone that was mortised in place and fixated. This surgical plan was determined with model surgery to level the cant of the maxillary occlusal plane. A Steinmann pin was placed in the nasal bones as an external vertical reference point; in addition, a Fox occlusal plane was used to evaluate the level of the maxilla in relation to the infraorbital rims

during surgery (Fig. 66.18). Multiple methods of evaluating symmetry are helpful in achieving a good result, and intermediate splints, internal and external reference landmarks, and careful clinical inspection from different views are all valuable surgical skills for bimaxillary jaw surgery in the patient with a facial asymmetry. The unsplit, intact mandible is also a key reference for determining any changes in maxillary position. In this case, after the maxilla was correctly positioned and the occlusal plane leveled, the mandible was split and repositioned to the corrected plane of occlusion. A bilateral SSO was cut before the Le Fort procedure but was not split and, as mentioned, this is a common sequence for most surgeons. Consideration was given toward a VRO on the left, but the rotation seemed favorable and the fixation was more stable than anticipated. Most patients with facial asymmetry have horizontal as well as vertical mandibular hypoplasia and require lower facial advancement more often than reduction. A genioplasty was

performed to advance the chin point  $4\mathrm{mm}$  and to level the deviation of the symphysis region. After the orthognathic phase of surgery, intraoperatively the endotracheal tube was switched from a nasal to oral intubation for the performance of a simultaneous rhinoplasty procedure. A standard internal rhinoplasty was performed to narrow the nose, refine the tip, and reduce the nasal dorsum. Often, facial asymmetry affects multiple facial subunits, and the nose may appear to be asymmetrical or deviated in relation to the maxilla, mandible, and chin, so attention to detail is required in order to create overall midface symmetry. Current technology utilizing cone beam CT, and laser scanning with virtual surgical treatment planning have essentially replaced traditional model surgery with improved accuracy.

At 3-month follow-up, the postoperative results were satisfactory to the patient and surgeon (Fig. 66.19), the occlusion was aligned and stable, and finishing orthodontics were completed without difficulty.

This is a 17-year-old young man with a large open bite and right laterognathism, with posterior vertical maxillary excess, dental crowding, a class III molar relationship, dentofacial asymmetry, and a mandibular prognathism (Figs. 66.20, 66.21, 66.22, and 66.23). He complained of lip incompetence; difficulty eating, chewing, and biting food; nasal obstruction; and xerostomia. His father had a history of mandibular prognathism as well. He denied previous facial trauma, and the orbital rims were symmetrical, but the right ear was slightly lower than the left. The TMJs articulated well and there was no facial pain. The mandibular midline was  $6\mathrm{mm}$  to the right of the facial midline, and the chin was excessive vertically and  $6\mathrm{mm}$  to the right of the mandibular midline. Also, there is a mild transverse deficiency of the posterior maxilla and a wide posterior mandibular dimension.

The treatment plan began with extraction of teeth numbers 1, 16, 17, 18, 2, 4, 13, 21, and 28 before presurgical orthodontics, which was performed to level, align,

and decompensate the dentition in preparation for a possible segmental Le Fort I osteotomy with posterior expansion, a bilateral SSO, genioplasty with vertical reduction and rotation, and possible midline mandibular osteotomy with mandibular narrowing. Presurgical records included mounted dental models, a facebow transfer, and detailed radiographs. A three-dimensional CT scan would have also been valuable. The surgery consisted of a bilateral SSO that was cut, but not split until after the maxilla was positioned, and the anterior midline mandibular osteotomy was performed. The maxilla was advanced  $6\mathrm{mm}$ , using an intermediate splint to position the maxilla, which was fixated rigidly with a  $6\mathrm{-mm}$  prebent advancement plate at the piriform rims, and two additional plates in the posterior maxillary buttress regions. During surgery, both internal and external references were used to properly position the maxilla vertically, and the use of prebent plates assisted in the proper AP positioning of the maxilla. Model surgery

had been performed with a midline mandibular osteotomy with plans to narrow the excessive mandibular width and correct the mandibular asymmetry. The chin was also extremely long and deviated to the right side; therefore, a vestibular incision was used and vertical reference marks were made in the symphysis bone. A low geniotomy wedge resection was performed and a midline osteotomy was created between the mandibular central incisors (Fig. 66.24). The SSO segments were then separated, and the mandible was secured into the customized splint. The occlusion was placed into intermaxillary fixation. The anterior midline osteotomy was first fixated with a four-hole noncompression titanium miniplate. These four screws were placed apical to the anterior tooth roots (Fig. 66.25). A 5-mm wedge of bone was then removed and the chin point was repositioned with two cross-shaped titanium plates. The inferior chin point repositioned  $5\mathrm{mm}$  to the left, and then the SSO was fixated with monocortical plates bilaterally. The teeth articulated into the splint well, and then the nasal septum was sutured to the anterior nasal spine and an alar base cinch suture technique was performed; finally,

the anterior maxillary vestibular incision was closed in a V-Y fashion.

The postoperative course was without complication, and at 1 month, the splint was removed. The occlusion remained stable at 1-year follow-up, and the facial symmetry was excellent (Figs. 66.26, 66.27, 66.28, 66.29, and 66.30). This case is an example of severe developmental, nontraumatic orthognathic asymmetry, which can be

challenging for the orthodontist and surgeon because the orthodontic preparation may be different for the left and right sides. If the asymmetry is mild, it is tempting to inappropriately manage the problem with single-jaw surgery. Many such facial asymmetries are often undertreated,

when in fact they may require overcorrection to account for some relapse potential. In fact, each case must be treated individually because each asymmetry is unique and requires careful attention to detail in the diagnostic and treatment phases of management.

# Case 3

This is a 17-year-old man presenting with facial asymmetry resulting from a prognathic mandible and deficient maxilla. He required presurgical orthodontics, followed by bimaxillary surgery (Fig. 66.31). He has a chief complaint of not liking his strong jaw and difficulty eating and chewing. He did not present with TMJ problems. He had an orthodontic consultation and it was determined that orthodontic treatment alone or single-jaw surgery would be insufficient to correct his asymmetry and prognathic mandible.

The physical examination revealed a class III skeletal and dental pattern. He had a deficient maxilla and a prognathic mandible. There was an obvious deviation of the mandibular midline to the left side of the patient. The TMJ articulation, rotation, and translation function was normal without clicking or popping. The maximum incisal opening was  $60~\mathrm{mm}$ , with a deviation to the left. The mandibular midline was  $3.5~\mathrm{mm}$  to the left, the overjet was  $-6\mathrm{mm}$ , the overbite was  $-4\mathrm{mm}$ . He had an asymmetrical smile pattern showing more gums on his right maxillary quadrant.

Before orthognathic surgery, the patient was orthodontic prepared using lingual braces. These braces were

carefully worked up to complete level and alignment of the maxillary and mandibular dentition. This step allowed the oral and maxillofacial surgeon to maximally move the jaws to create the best desired aesthetic outcome. The presurgical workup included a three-dimensional CT scan, cephalometric and panoramic radiographs. 3D virtual surgical planning was carried to determine the necessary jaw movements (Fig. 66.32). Before the actual surgery, conventional orthodontic brackets without wires were bonded to the labial surfaces of the teeth to help the surgeon fixate the splints. These labial brackets also helped the surgeon place the necessary rubber bands for postsurgical settling after surgery was complete.

The postoperative results were satisfactory to the patient (Fig. 66.32), the occlusion was aligned and stable, and finishing orthodontics were completed without difficulty. The total treatment time was 24 months and the final facial and dental aesthetics were favorable and successfully achieved (Fig. 66.33).

# Case 4

This is a 40-year-old man with a significant facial asymmetry and mild obstructive sleep apnea (Fig. 66.34). His chief complaint was that he wanted to fix his bite and face before he got married. He presented with a skeletal and dental class III malocclusion with a significant crossbite on the left buccal segment. There was a mild transverse deficiency of the posterior maxilla and a wide posterior mandibular dentition. His lower dental midline was  $9\mathrm{mm}$  to the left side of the maxillary mid-sagittal plane. The TMJs articulated well and there was no facial pain. A technetium bone scan proved inconclusive for active TMJ hyperplasia. In addition, there was a mild maxillary cant of the occlusal plane. He appears clinically to have right condylar hypertrophy.

In the interest of time (his wedding plans), presurgical orthodontics using a customized 3D set-up for optimal bracket position was prescribed. This technique used an indirect bracket position set-up from a library of virtual

brackets. These virtual brackets were carefully placed on the 3D representations of teeth and all the set-up was carried out in an orthodontic lab. This method of bracket bonding is in contrast to a direct method of bracket placement at chairside and in theory reduces bracket position errors and enhances efficiency, resulting in quicker leveling, alignment, and decompensation of the dentition in preparation for surgery. The total presurgical orthodontics before surgery was 10 months.

3D virtual planning was performed before the surgery.

The postoperative recovery occurred without complication and, at 6 weeks, the maxillary splint was removed. Postorthodontic settling of the occlusion was done for 4 months and the patient was debanded. The occlusion remained stable at 1-year follow-up, and the facial symmetry was excellent (Figs. 66.35 and 66.36).

# Conclusion

1. Facial asymmetries often require surgery of both the maxilla and the mandible.  
2. Facial asymmetries require accurate 3D imaging and, today, medical modeling and custom plating is often an advantage.  
3. Skull base asymmetries, and soft tissue deficiencies are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve perfect symmetry.  
4. Patient success depends on accurate diagnosis establishing reasonable expectations.

Correction of asymmetrical orthognathic deformities often requires surgery of both the maxilla and the mandible. Combining osteotomies of the maxilla and the mandible is more complicated than single-jaw surgery and is perhaps associated with increased morbidity, but the surgical options are more extensive and

the postoperative results are improved with less potential relapse. Bimaxillary jaw surgery does not result in twice the morbidity of single-jaw surgery and is typically tolerated as well as single-jaw surgery with similar periods of postsurgical convalescence. The indications for bimaxillary surgery include severe facial asymmetries and deformities that cannot be adequately managed with one-jaw surgery, skeletal deformities of both jaws, unfavorable planned surgical movements that are prone to relapse, and complex three-dimensional movements for which single-jaw surgery would represent a functional and cosmetic compromise. Skeletal dentofacial asymmetries may develop from a primary etiologic event, but they usually present with secondary compensations of both the hard and the soft tissues of the face; such an asymmetry is an excellent indication for bimaxillary surgery. Current surgical techniques have reduced the morbidity and hospital length of

stay and have improved the overall functional and aesthetic surgical outcomes. In addition, the use of three-dimensional imaging and computerized treatment planning has recently been used to improve accuracy and predictability of the diagnosis and treatment plan; this reinforces the concept that comprehensive facial analysis and attention to detail in the treatment of facial asymmetries are critical to a successful outcome.
