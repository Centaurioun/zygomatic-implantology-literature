# Learning Aims

1. Craniosynostosis can be associated with some major complications to include intracranial hypertension, visual impairment, limitation of brain growth, and neuropsychiatric disorders.  
2. Premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures halts skull growth perpendicular to the affected sutures and results in a predictable craniofacial deformity.  
3. Treatment objectives include removal of the affected suture and correction of abnormal head shape.  
4. The mortality rate for craniosynostosis repair is less than  $1\%$ , and the overall complication rate is  $\sim 10\%$  of which are mostly minor concerns.

# 48.1 Introduction

In its basic form, craniosynostosis represents premature cranial suture fusion. The term was first coined by Virchow in 1851 to describe the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures resulting in an abnormal head shape, but was previously described by Hippocrates in 100 B.C. and Otto in 1830 [1-3]. Due to this stenosis, growth perpendicular to the suture line is restricted with compensatory overgrowth at the remaining patent suture lines [4, 5]. It occurs in approximately 1 per 1000 live births in the United States [6]. Craniosynostosis may be classified as nonsyndromic or syndromic. Most forms of craniosynostosis are isolated and not associated with any other conditions usually associated with the five major craniosynostosis syndromes—Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Saethre-Chotzen, and Carpenter—and are therefore designated as nonsyndromic [7]. Syndromic craniosynostosis will be discussed in another chapter.

The pathogenesis of craniosynostosis is complex and probably multifactorial. Numerous theories have been proposed. Moss's functional matrix theory proposes that craniosynostosis, such as seen in Apert and Crouzon syndromes, results from abnormal tensile forces transmitted to the dura from an anomalous cranial base through key ligamentous attachments [6, 8]. This hypothesis fails to explain craniosynostosis in patients with a normal cranial base configuration. Another common theory is the dura theory, which proposes that the dura acts as an internal periosteum and regulates both suture fusion and skull growth [9]. More recent investigations by Oppenheimer et al. support transduction of mechanical forces across suture lines in utero inducing paracrine signaling and resulting in premature suture fusion [10, 11]. The possible causes of craniosynostosis have also been postulated to be the result of either primary suture abnormalities, sufficient extremes of forces

that overcome the underlying expansive forces of the brain, inadequate intrinsic growth forces of the brain, or various genetic and environmental factors [12]. Cranial vault growth achieves approximately  $80\%$  of the adult size at birth and definitive size by 2.5-3 years of age [6, 13]. Four major sutural regions make up the cranial vault. The coronal and lambdoid sutures are paired, and the metopic and sagittal sutures are single sutures. Patency of the cranial sutures allows for head expansion as well as deformation to accommodate passage through the birth canal [13, 14]. Recall that posterior fontanelle closure (3-6 months) generally precedes anterior fontanelle closure (9-12 months), but variations in closure time are not concerning as long as the child maintains skull growth along their previously plotted growth curve and is developing a normocephalic head shape.

# 48.2 Functional Considerations

The major functional problems associated with craniosynostosis are intracranial hypertension, visual impairment, limitation of brain growth, and neuropsychiatric disorders [15]. In general, the functional problems increase as the number of sutures involved increases [15]. These functional abnormalities are gradual in their development, difficult to detect, and often irreversible in nature. Visual impairment related to craniosynostosis may include atrophy of the optic nerve, strabismus, ocular motility disorders, or direct trauma to the globe. An important consideration as of late is that children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis have increased rates of cognitive and/or behavioral abnormalities compared to the general population, even when surgical intervention is considered. For this reason, it is important to have long-term follow-up, at least yearly, to screen for and treat speech, cognitive, and/or behavioral impairments [16, 17].

# 48.2.1Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension is defined as a pressure of greater than  $15\mathrm{mmHg}$ . Studies by Marchac and Renier have demonstrated a  $13\%$  incidence of intracranial hypertension with single suture stenosis and up to a  $42\%$  incidence in multisuture-stenosed children [18]. Hydrocephalus can be present in  $10\%$  of children with multiple suture synostosis. The clinical symptoms of intracranial hypertension include headaches, irritability, papilledema, nausea/vomiting, and difficulty sleeping. Chronic findings are optic and cerebral atrophy. The radiographic signs may include cortical thinning or a lückenschädel (hammered metal) appearance of the

inner table of the skull; these clinical and radiographic signs are relatively late developments. If intracranial hypertension goes untreated, it affects brain function; if persistent, this may necessitate early operative intervention during the first few months of life. Intracranial hypertension most likely affects those with the greatest disparity between brain growth and intracranial capacity and may occur in as many as  $42\%$  of untreated children with more than one suture affected. Currently, intracranial volume is measured using computed tomography (CT) scans, a noninvasive method appropriate for use in children with craniosynostosis [19]. It might be possible to identify individuals who are at a greater risk for developing intracranial hypertension and would benefit the most from early surgery. As demonstrated by Hayward and Gonzalez, children with complex craniosynostosis can experience increased intracranial pressures (ICP), considerably lower cerebral perfusion pressures (CPP), and episodes of respiratory obstruction. These increases in ICP and reduction in CPP may contribute to the neurological, cognitive, and visual impairments these children can face [20] (Fig. 48.1).

# 48.2.2Visual Impairment

# 48.2.2.1Visual Acuity

When considering vision loss, intracranial hypertension, if left untreated, may lead to disc edema and papilledema, typically acute [21]. After chronic intracranial hypertension, eventually optic atrophy develops, which results in complete or partial blindness. In a study of 290 children with craniosynostosis at Birmingham Children's Hospital,  $3\%$  of the children were found to have vision failure secondary to increased ICP [22]. An additional study by Baranello et al. found that visual acuity can be reduced in nonsyndromic, single suture craniosynostosis, with metopic the least effected, followed by sagittal, and unilateral coronal synostosis the most commonly effected [23]. Improving vision loss with cranial vault expansion is dependent on the severity of the damage present preoperatively. Children presenting with optic atrophy have poor surgical outcomes related to improvement in vision, whereas children present with disc edema often have resolution of papilledema along with return of visual acuity [22]. Through Positron Emission Topography (PET) scanning techniques, children with craniosynostosis have been found to have increases in glucose metabolism in the posterior occipital region of the brain, responsible for visual development and spatial coordination, following corrective surgery for single-suture synostosis [24]. Manifestations of decreased glucose metabolism and possible impaired brain function in the area of visual development and spatial coordina

tion may not become apparent till a child is school aged. Considering the numerous findings listed above, children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis need to have long-term follow-up, even following surgical correction, that includes screening for visual field impairment.

# 48.2.2.2Ocular Motor Disturbances

Ocular motor disturbances, such as strabismus, are very common among patients with craniosynostosis with an overall incidence of  $70 - 75\%$  for craniofacial patients, with exotropia the most common form identified [25]. In unilateral coronal synostosis, the deformation of the orbit and displacement of the pulley systems and extraocular muscles create a severe exotropia on upward gaze that decreases on downward gaze. In these children, strabismus can lead to amblyopia and high refractive errors with eventual vision loss if left untreated [25]. Numerous studies have shown that the strabismus that occurs mainly impacts the side ipsilateral to the coronal fusion, though a few studies have reported impairment of the contralateral side as well [26]. Also controversial is the role of fronto-orbital advancement and its impact on strabismus. Very few studies have shown improvement of strabismus following fronto-orbital advancement, and numerous studies have found no improvement of even induction of strabismus (ranging from  $17\%$  to  $46\%$ ) following cranial vault reconstruction [26].

Ocular motility disturbances are also common in metopic suture synostosis cases, with  $67\%$  showing abnormal ocular movements [27]. This is likely associated with the orbital deformation and hypotelorism found with this condition. In patients with scaphocephaly, deficits in visual attention shift are not uncommon. This is theorized to be a result of compression of the parietal lobes where visual attention is controlled [27] (Fig. 48.2).

Regardless of the suture involved, it is important for patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis to have a preoperative ophthalmologic evaluation and close follow-up postoperatively. It is recommended that a child be re-evaluated approximately 2 months following craniofacial surgery. Fronto-orbital advancement does disinsert the trochlea with periosteal stripping, and though it is generally well accepted, it will spontaneously reactach and create no change in alignment [25, 26]. If strabismus surgery is warranted, it is advisable that it be performed early to create normal ocular alignment, hopefully preventing future vision loss.

# 48.2.3 Limitation of Brain Growth

Brain volume in the normal child almost triples during the first year of life. By 2 years of age, the cranial

capacity is four times that at birth. If brain growth is to proceed unhindered, open sutures at the level of the cranial vault and base must spread during phases of rapid growth for marginal ossification.

In craniosynostosis, premature suture fusion is combined with continuing brain growth. Depending on the number and location of prematurely fused sutures and the timing of closure, the growth potential of the brain may be limited. Surgical intervention can provide suture release and reshaping to restore a more normal intracranial volume. In general, this does not completely reverse craniosynostosis, and diminished volume is often the end result.

# 48.2.4Neuropsychiatric Disorders

Neuropsychiatric disorders are believed to be secondary to cerebral compression. Disorders range from mild behavioral disturbances to overt mental retardation [17]. There is much controversy in the literature whether or not children with single-suture craniosynostosis have higher rates of long-term cognitive, behavioral, or speech-related disorders. Cognitive and/or behavioral disorders in children with single-suture craniosynostosis may not be evident early on, but develop over early childhood [16, 17, 28-30]. It appears that many of these children suffer delays in both mental and psychomotor development [31]. Several explanations include possible intracranial hypertension that goes unrecognized, an organic abnormality of the brain related to the specific synostosed suture, obstruction of cerebral blood flow, or alteration in CSF dynamics [16] [17]. Numerous studies have shown that cranial vault surgery may improve psychomotor function, but may not reverse the mental developmental delays that have already occurred. In a series of scaphocephaly by Virtanen, auditory shortterm memory and language development impairment persisted following cranial vault reconstruction [32]. Although Cohen found that neuromotor development has been shown to improve with surgery [33], there is also some evidence to show that surgery may prevent continued decline of mental function in these patients [31, 34].

The higher rate of neuropsychiatric and learning disorders found in children with single-suture craniosynostosis may not be evident until the child reaches grade school. Therefore, the American Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Association recommends yearly standardized assessment by a licensed child psychologist as the child transitions through grade school to evaluate and treat for neurodevelopmental, behavioral, speech-related, and learning disorders [35, 36].

# Key Points

Increases in ICP and reduction in CPP may contribute to the neurological, cognitive, and visual impairments.  
Ocular motor disturbances, such as strabismus, are very common.  
- Patent sutures are necessary for brain growth.  
Children require screening for neuropsychiatric and learning disorders.

# 48.3 Diagnosis/Preoperative Data Collection

One should suspect craniosynostosis in any infant with an abnormal head shape. The most critical data collected during the preoperative period are obtained from the history and physical examination. The basic data should include a thorough medical history, previous surgeries, family history, medication profile, allergies, and issues with previous anesthetics for the patient or their family. Definitive diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic evaluations.

# 48.3.1 Physical Examination

In nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, there are very characteristic head shapes determined by the suture(s) involved. The overall head shape and position and symmetry of the ears should be inspected. Next, the head circumference should be measured and plotted on the appropriate growth curve. Restricted head growth or a patient that has fallen off the growth curve should be investigated for an organic cause. One cause of restricted head growth may be craniosynostosis, and this is more common when multiple sutures are involved. During physical examination, the skull should be palpated for patency of both the anterior and posterior fontanelle, along with all suture lines. The posterior fontanelle typically closes by 6 months of age and the anterior fontanelle by 12 months [37]. Premature closure of the fontanelle may be one clue that there is premature closure of one or more sutures. Normal fontanelles should feel soft and flat. Bulging and/or tense fontanelles may be an indication of increased intracranial pressure. Following palpation of the anterior and posterior fontanelle, all suture lines should be palpated for patency and ridging. Patent sutures should demonstrate a small amount of mobility of the cranial bones along the suture line. Both the bony orbit and projection of the globes should be examined. When viewing the skull from the superior aspect, the superior bony orbit should have adequate projection to protect the globe of the eye.

Quantitative measurements of the superior orbital rims, relative to the most anterior aspect of the cornea, also may help in planning treatment for superior orbital rim advancements. Any exorbitism should be noted. If there are any indications of possible intracranial hypertension such as multiple suture synostosis, bulging fontanelles, engorged scalp veins, or widened unaffected cranial sutures, one should pursue an ophthalmology consult for a visual examination and consider other adjuncts to monitoring ICP [37-39].

# 48.3.2Laboratory and Radiological Studies

Most children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis are healthy and require only basic preoperative laboratory evaluations. Though cranial vault remodeling has been shown to be safe, it is still an invasive procedure for such a young infant [40, 41]. Basic laboratory tests should include hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, type and screen, and coagulation studies [42]. These laboratory values can then assist in monitoring fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and can serve as trigger levels for the implementation of transfusion protocols. The presenting authors often use blood gas samples drawn from the arterial line to vigilantly monitor for possible acidosis and the need for transfusion once all osteotomies are complete. At this point, a majority of the blood loss has occurred,

making it an appropriate time to address any fluid, electrolyte, hemoglobin, or coagulation abnormalities.

Radiographic evaluation of craniosynostosis is used to define quantitatively aberrant anatomy, plan surgical procedures, and, most importantly, provide a means to demonstrate to the parents the difference between stenosed and nonstenosed sutures. Conventional skull radiographs should include skull films and lateral cephalograms. These films are inexpensive, expose the infant to a limited amount of radiation, and are easily accessible. Most cases of synostosis can be demonstrated on plain skull films. Normal or patent cranial sutures manifest as a radiolucent line. The absence of a radiolucent line in the normal anatomic position of a suture may suggest craniosynostosis [1].

Currently, CT scans provide improved hard tissue imaging. The definition of these elements of the bony facial structures on high-resolution CT images with or without three-dimensional reconstruction is unmatched by other imaging techniques (Figure). The development of CT scanning, particularly three-dimensional reformating, and the maturation of readily available means of craniofacial surgery have led to a close dependence on CT scanning for preoperative surgical planning. If Virtual Surgical Planning is to be employed, then preoperative CT scans are imperative. CT scanning also has been used to document surgical changes in vivo and to follow developments longitudinally [3, 43-49].

# Key Points

Any infant with abnormal head shape should be screening for craniosynostosis.  
- Inspect for ridging of suture lines, restricted head growth, early closure of fontanelles, and exorbitism.  
- Both skull x-rays and CT are acceptable modalities for diagnosis.

# 48.4 Classification

The classification of craniosynostosis is based on the shape of the skull, which usually reflects the underlying prematurely fused suture or sutures [50, 51]. The major cranial vault sutures that may be involved include the left and right coronal, metopic, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures.

# 48.4.1 Sagittal Synostosis/Scaphocephaly

Sagittal synostosis is the most common form of craniosynostosis. It represents  $\sim 50\%$  of all craniosynostosis cases in the United States and has an overall prevalence of 1 in 5000 live births [1, 52]. Sagittal synostosis is 4 times more common in males, and only  $2\%$  are considered familial [1, 3]. Sagittal synostosis is rarely associated with intracranial hypertension [6]. Clinical features include ridging of the sagittal suture, elongation of the skull in the anteroposterior dimension, biparieto-temporal narrowing, and possible premature closure of the anterior fontanelle [3]. The term for this cranial vault deformity is "scaphocephaly," meaning "boat shaped." Usually, the midface and anterior cranial vault sutures are not affected.

# 48.4.2 Unilateral Coronal Synostosis/ Anterior Plagiocephaly

Unilateral coronal synostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. It represents  $\sim 20\%$  of all craniosynostosis cases in the United States and occurs in 1 in 10,000 children [6, 52]. Two thirds of unilateral coronal synostosis cases occur in females, and  $\sim 10\%$  are familial [3]. Clinical features include ridging or obliteration of the affected coronal suture, flattening of the frontal bone on the ipsilateral side, recession of the supraorbital and lateral orbital rim on the ipsilateral side, and significant bossing of the contralateral forehead [6]. These deformities result in nasal deviation and constriction, hypoplasia of the zygomatic arch, and a "Harlequin eye deformity" on the affected side. This "Harlequin eye deformity" is

created by an orbital dystopia due to posterior and superior displacement of the bony orbit [3]. The term used to describe unilateral synostosis is "anterior plagiocephaly." One should rule out infant molding or positional plagiocephaly. One distinguishing difference is when the skull is viewed from the superior aspect, and unilateral synostosis has an overall trapezoidal appearance, whereas positional plagiocephaly has a parallelogram shape. In anterior plagiocephaly, the anterior skull base is also affected resulting in absence of the frontoethmoidal, frontospheniod, and sphenoethmoidal sutures [53]. This results in a continued long-term deformity in many patients, even following cranial vault remodeling with removal of the affected suture. This can also create future mandibular deviation and facial asymmetry requiring later correction (Fig. 48.3).

# 48.4.3Metopic Synostosis/Trigonocephaly

Metopic synostosis accounts for  $\sim 10\%$  of the isolated craniosynostosis cases in the United States and occurs in 1:15,000 children [6, 53]. This condition is more common in males, and  $\sim 5\%$  of cases are familial. It is believed that up to  $1/3$  of metopic cases may be syndromic; therefore, genetic evaluation is warranted in children presenting with other congenital malformations [3]. Clinical features of metopic synostosis include ridging of the metopic suture, posteriorly sloped forehead, bitemporal narrowing, posterior-inferior recession of the lateral orbital rims, associated hypotelorism, and often overcompensated growth of the posterior cranial vault. The decrease in bitemporal width and constriction of the forehead results in abnormal shape and decreased volume of the anterior cranial vault. The overlying forehead is sloped posteriorly to approximately the level of the coronal sutures. This results in an overall triangular shape to the skull and is termed "trigonocephaly" (Fig. 48.4).

# 48.4.4Bilateral Coronal Synostosis/ Brachycephaly

Bilateral coronal synostosis is the most common syndrome-associated craniosynostosis and represents  $\sim 20\%$  of the isolated craniosynostosis cases in the United States. It is also the most common cranial vault suture synostosis pattern associated with Apert, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes. The term nonsyndromic is used to describe bilateral coronal synostosis without midface deficiency or other known associated malformations [1, 6, 54]. Nonsyndromic bilateral coronal synostosis is more common in females by a ratio of 2:1 and is associated with advanced paternal age. It is believed that  $\sim 14\%$  of nonsyndromic cases are familial [54]. Clinical features include recession of the frontoparietal region, posterior and superior displacement of the supraorbital rims and eyebrows, and widened palpebral fissures. Much like unilateral coronal synostosis, the lesser wing of the sphenoid is displaced superiorly

![](images/0313b0506e9a66c51145c988c2ff5b184eb16d721ebe939850f44640360106d4.jpg)

resulting in bilateral "Harlequin eyes" [54]. In addition to the recessed supraorbital bones and "Harlequin eyes," the forehead appears to be lower, and there is sagittal shortening of the skull [1, 54]. The term for this cranial vault deformity is "brachycephaly." The upper orbits and anterior cranial base is short in the anteroposterior dimension and wide transversely. The overlying cranial vault is high in the superior-inferior dimension, with anterior bulging of the upper forehead that results from compensatory growth of the patent metopic suture [1, 54] (Fig. 48.5).

# 48.4.5 Unilateral Lambdoid Synostosis/ Posterior Plagiocephaly

Unilateral lambdoid synostosis accounts for  $\sim 3\%$  of isolated craniosynostosis cases in the United States and occurs in 1:150,000 live births [1, 53]. Clinical features

include ridging or obliteration of the affected lambdoid suture, retrusion of the ipsilateral parieto-occipital region, retrusion of the forehead on the ipsilateral side, and superior-posterior displacement of the ipsilateral ear. The term for this cranial vault deformity is "posterior plagiocephaly." Lambdoid synostosis is extremely rare, and when suspected, a noncontrast CT scan of the head should be performed for diagnosis. Of critical importance is ruling out posterior positional plagiocephaly. With positional (or deformational) plagiocephaly, the head takes on a parallelogram shape in comparison to the trapezoidal shape encountered in lambdoid synostosis. In positional plagiocephaly, there is flattening of the contralateral forehead and anterior displacement of the ipsilateral ear. It is important to ensure proper diagnosis, as lambdoid synostosis is treated through surgical reconstruction, and positional plagiocephaly is treated with conservative management such as "tummy time" or cranial remodeling orthosis [1, 53] (Fig. 48.6).

# 48.5 Principles of Management

# 48.5.1Multidisciplinary Team Approach

The standard of care, according to the American Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Association, for children suffering from craniosynostosis includes a multidisciplinary team approach [35, 36]. A well-organized craniofacial team should include audiology, craniofacial surgery, genetics, neurology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthodontics, pediatrics, pediatric anesthesiology, pediatric critical care, psychology, and social work [35, 36]. All these team members have integral roles at various times in the child's development [55, 56]. The idea of the team approach was developed in response to the failures that commonly occurred when various aspects of care were not coordinated and when the relationships among coexisting problems were not known. The members work together in order to diagnoses not only the conditions, but any related deformities or symptomatology [49].

The objectives of this approach are diagnosis, formulation, and execution of treatment plans and longitu

dinal follow-up for patients with craniofacial deformities; the team should meet at least monthly for regular outpatient evaluations. Transcripts of these evaluations are forwarded with recommendations to primary care providers and appropriate agencies. Children under the age of 5 years are usually evaluated annually, whereas children over 5 years of age are seen at least every other year. The frequency of evaluation varies with the stability of the deformity and its consequences.

# 48.5.2Virtual Surgical Planning

Virtual surgical planning is rapidly gaining popularity within many facets of head and neck surgery, from orthognathic surgery to distraction osteogenesis, temporomandibular joint reconstruction, trauma reconstruction, and guides for resection and free tissue transfer [57-60]. These virtual plans are devised through computer-aided design and modeling (CAD/CAM). One drawback to traditional techniques in total cranial vault reconstruction is that the widening and advancement of the fronto-orbital bandeau, along with overall skull size and shape, is somewhat subjective. In other words, the size, shape, and fronto-orbital advancement are determined by the surgeon intraoperatively, based on the appearance of the vault. Though craniofacial surgeons have been able to visualize deformities of the skull and face in the pediatric population since the mid-1990s, they have been unable to employ the CAD/CAM technology or 3D printing to aid in normalizing skull shape due to a lack of normative models [61, 62]. In 2011, Saber and colleagues closed that gap by extracting computed tomography (CT) data from 103 normocephalic individuals aged 8 to 12 months. They then used that data to make averaged, age-appropriate, normative three-dimensional (3D) models for the shape and size of the skull and supraorbital region [62]. This data can then be used to create stereolithic models for study, design-standardized, age-appropriate templates for fronto-orbital bandeau reconstruction, or 3D-printed patient-specific cutting guides and reconstruction templates for total cranial vault remodeling (TCVR) [58, 63, 64].

# 48.5.3Airway Management

Airway evaluation should be performed on all craniofacial patients to help plan the safest anesthetic technique. It is important to investigate whether the child has undergone previous anesthetics and if they had any difficulty with the anesthesia. Children born with craniofacial syndromes, such as Apert and Crouzon, may present with severe midface hypoplasia that can make mask ventilation, intubation, or extubation challenging. These

children may benefit from airway maneuvers and oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways during mask ventilation. If intubation is expected to be challenging, one may consider the use of direct laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope or fiberoptic intubation. Following intubation, it is necessary to check for equal bilateral breath sounds once the patient is appropriately positioned. It is also essential to ensure the endotracheal tube is not at risk of being kinked or moved because it is not easily accessible once the procedure begins [65]. At the author's institution, the patient is intubated orally utilizing a reinforced endotracheal tube that is secured through the chin to the periosteum of the mandibular symphysis with a silk suture. The position of the tube and proper ventilation is then rechecked prior to sterile preparation and draping.

# 48.5.4Intravenous Access

Due to the risk of hemorrhage during craniofacial surgery, it is necessary for patients to have at least two large bore peripheral intravenous (IV) lines. These IV lines should be 22- to 20-gauge catheter lines. If two IV lines are not attainable, then a central venous catheter should be placed in order to initiate massive transfusion protocols if necessary [42, 66].

# 48.5.5Monitoring

Standard monitoring according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists should be employed. This includes end tidal  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  monitored continuously through capnography, capnometry, or mass spectroscopy. Blood oxygenation should be monitored continuously as well through pulse oximetry. In craniofacial surgery cases, it is necessary to place an arterial line to continuously monitor blood pressure and detect hypotension [42, 65, 67].

In young patients, it is vital to monitor the patient's core temperature. Children undergoing craniofacial procedures are at an increased risk for hypothermia due to the surface area of a child's head, administration of intravenous fluids, and blood loss. Hypothermia can impair coagulation and increase bleeding. In order to prevent hypothermia, the operating room should be kept warm while the patient is being positioned and undergoing induction of anesthesia [42, 66, 67]. Once the patient is prepped and draped, active warming should occur. At the author's institution, a core-temperature foley catheter is placed to monitor closely for hypothermia and a forced air convection blanket is used during the surgical procedure.

# 48.5.6Patient Positioning and Eye Protection

Careful attention should be paid to proper patient positioning and preparation of the eyes in order to prevent inadvertent damage to the extremities or the globes. For most cases of scaphocephaly, the patient is positioned in the prone position. When prone positioning is required, it is important to remember to place a chest roll to help keep the neck in a neutral position and prevent compression of the thorax and abdomen to allow for ventilation. The Mayfield headrest should be positioned to give adequate head and neck support as well, and the endotracheal tube should freely exit straight down without tension on the line. A hip roll is also necessary to prevent pressure on the iliac crest and genitalia. In male patients, attention must be paid to the genitalia to ensure that it can hang freely without compression or torsion, and the foley catheter exits straight down between the legs. Any areas prone to pressure ulcers such as the acromion processes, patellaes, or toes should be padded with egg-crate as well. The patient's arms can be properly positioned alongside the patient [68].

If the supine position is required, it is important to remember a small shoulder roll may be necessary to prevent compression on the scapulae, and the Mayfield should be positioned to give adequate, neutral support to the head and neck [68]. The authors recommend use of a gel roll on sandbag taped in place just inferior to the buttocks and under the thighs to prevent the child from sliding inferiorly when placed in reverse trendelenburg. All areas at risk for pressure ulcers or neurologic injury, including the olecranon, thoracic vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, and calcanea, should be properly padded [68].

In regards to protection of the eye, the authors recommend placement of ophthalmic ointment and tarsorrhaphies with silk suture for procedures in either the supine or prone position. Patients undergoing procedures in the prone position should have appropriate padding around the eyes. When using a Mayfield headrest, one should ensure that the headrest is not placing any pressure on the globes, and padding around the orbitals may be necessary [66, 68].

# 48.5.7Transfusion Protocol

To be safe, teams should be prepared to transfuse if necessary. Actual transfusion protocols, along with the use of erythropoietin and cell salvage, are controversial and often institution dependent [69]. Numerous studies have shown that children undergoing craniofacial surgery can lose, on average, anywhere from  $21\%$  to  $65\%$  of estimated blood volume [70] At the author's institution, the

average blood loss for craniosynostosis repair was  $42.7\%$ ; therefore, all patients are typed and crossmatched for blood products, and families are given the opportunity to be direct donors, if possible. Transfusion is begun at the time of incision to coincide with a majority of blood loss. Blood loss is most common during two periods: (1) at initial scalp incision and reflection of periosteum and (2) during skull osteotomies [69]. It is vital for communication to occur between the surgeon and the anesthesia team because children at this age and weight can easily become under resuscitated [42, 66, 69]. In order to minimize the amount of blood to be transfused and the number of exposures from different donors, institutional transfusion protocols should be implemented. These protocols are often dictated either by hemodynamic parameters, such as arterial blood pressure, during times of blood loss, or by laboratory values such as hemoglobin/hematocrit  $(\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{H})$ , prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT), and platelet count during times of hemodynamic stability [42, 69].

# Key Points

- Multidisciplinary team approach is a standard of care.  
- Communication between the surgeon and the anesthesia team is vital to ensure proper airway management, continuous monitoring, and proper resuscitation.  
Due to age and weight, it is easy to under resuscitate.

# 48.5.8Current Surgical Approach

The goals of craniosynostosis suture release are twofold. The first goal is to allow the brain to grow and expand without restriction. The second goal is to establish a more normal contour to the forehead, supraorbital ridges, and skull [72-74]. In most cases, an intracranial approach is used for cranial vault and orbital osteotomies, with reshaping and advancement of bony segments for ideal age-appropriate bony morphology. When planning the time and type of surgical intervention, one must consider the functions, future growth, and the development of the craniofacial skeleton and the maintenance of normal body image. Simple craniosynostosis can be managed successfully with frontocranial remodeling.

Although the timing of craniosynostosis repair remains controversial and individualized, we prefer early surgical repair between the ages of 4 and 8 months [75, 76]. Early surgical repair allows for rapid frontal lobe growth, which supports the forehead and supraor

bital ridge advancement. At this age, the cranium is highly malleable and therefore easier to contour; a positive effect on facial growth may be achieved, and future deformities may be lessened. Also during this period of rapid growth, residual bony defects heal more rapidly. In severe forms of craniosynostosis, additional revision of the cranial vault and orbit is necessary during infancy or early childhood to increase intracranial volume further, which allows for continued brain growth and avoids or reduces the likelihood of intracranial hypertension.

A craniotomy is performed by a pediatric neurosurgeon to remove the deformed section of cranium and provide access for the additional craniofacial osteotomies. The skeletal segments are reshaped and replaced into position and stabilized with the use of resorbable plates and screws. These plates, which are composed of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, are completely resorbed by hydrolysis within 9-14 months while maintaining tensile strength for initial stabilization [77]. As a result, growth restrictions are minimized, as is the potential for transcranial migration.

# 48.6 Surgical Considerations

# 48.6.1 Sagittal Synostosis

Historically, when premature closure of a sagittal suture was recognized in early infancy, most neurosurgeons believed that simple release of the sagittal suture through a strip craniectomy without simultaneous skull reshaping was adequate treatment [6, 14, 77, 78]. Our results using this technique alone have been less than favorable, and a residual cranial vault deformity usually results. If improvements in cranial vault shape are to be achieved, most cases require a formal total cranial vault reshaping at the age of 4-8 months. In our center, a recent trend toward earlier surgery ( $\leq 4$  months) involving removal of the stenosed suture along with extensive barrel-staving and postoperative helmet-molding is gaining popularity. Early results using this protocol have shown promising outcomes with less blood loss and shorter operative times. In recent years, some centers have employed endoscopic techniques at this early age to the reduce intraoperative blood loss and overall operative time. Variations in the degree of the scaphocephalic deformity are common, depending on the extent of sagittal suture stenosis. When the posterior half is fused, the patient is treated in the prone position with the posterior two-thirds of the cranial vault reshaped. When the anterior half is fused, the patient is treated in the supine position with the anterior two-thirds of the cranial vault reshaped, with

or without superior orbital rim reshaping. When the entire suture is fused, a combination of both approaches may be necessary. Unless a significant concomitant supraorbital deformity exists, we prefer to treat full sagittal suture stenosis (anterior and posterior) at one oper

ative setting in the prone position via a total cranial vault reshaping. For older children (older than 1 year) or children with a need for upper orbital reconstruction, we prefer the supine position at one operative setting or, rarely, in two stages, with posterior reconstruction pre

ceding anterior and orbital reconstruction by 4-6 months. Other centers have reported good results when routinely staging full sagittal synostosis.

# 48.6.2Unilateral Coronal Synostosis

Multiple surgical approaches for the correction of unilateral coronal synostosis have been described [79-81]. Good long-term results are obtained when treatment of coronal synostosis includes suture release along with cranial vault and orbital osteotomies for reshaping and

advancement in infancy. At our center, unilateral orbital rim advancement and frontal bone reshaping are ideally performed at 6-8 months of age. Other centers have reported good results when treatment is provided between the ages of 2.5 and 3 years. To achieve optimal symmetry, we prefer to use a bilateral surgical approach. Symmetry of the cranial vault and orbit must be achieved during surgery, because results generally do not improve over time. Stabilization is achieved by using direct intraosseous wires or resorbable plates and screws.

# 48.6.3Metopic Synostosis

Surgical treatment of metopic synostosis involves metopic suture release, simultaneous bilateral orbital rim advancements, and lateral widening via frontal bone advancement. These procedures are usually performed at 6-8 months of age [82]. Orbital hypotelorism is corrected by splitting the supraorbital ridge unit vertically in the midline and placing autogenous cranial bone grafts to increase the intraorbital distance. Stabilization is achieved with direct transosseous wires

or resorbable microplate fixation. The microplate fixation is usually placed at the inner surface of the cranial bone. The abnormally shaped bone that has been removed is cut into sections of appropriate shape for the new forehead configuration. The anterior cranial base, anterior cranial vault, and orbit are given a more esthetic shape, and the volume of the anterior cranial vault is increased, which allows the brain adequate space. Autogenous bone may be taken from the posterior cranium, when required, to enhance frontal reconstruction.

# 48.6.4Bilateral Coronal Synostosis

The treatment of bilateral coronal synostosis requires suture release and simultaneous bilateral orbital rim and frontal bone advancements [83]. Surgery is performed when the patient is between 6 and 8 months of age. Other centers have reported good results with children treated between the ages of 2.5 and 3 years of age.

The osteotomies for the bilateral orbital rim advancement are made superior to the nasofrontal and frontozygomatic sutures and extend to the squamous portion of the temporal bone. Stabilization is achieved with direct transosseous wires or resorbable plates and screws. The more normalized shape provides the needed increase in intracranial volume within the anterior cranial vault.

# 48.6.5Unilateral Lambdoid Synostosis

Many surgeons consider simple strip craniectomy of the involved suture or partial craniectomy of the region to be adequate treatment. More extensive vault craniectomy and reshaping are generally necessary. If improvements in cranial vault shape are required after 10-12 months of age, formal posterior cranial vault reshaping is performed.

# 48.6.6Complications

Craniosynostosis repair is a safe and reliable procedure considering the invasiveness. Nguyen and colleagues utilized the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Kids Inpatient Database (KID) for 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 in order to look at the complication rates associated with cranial vault remodeling. They identified 3426 patients undergoing craniosynostosis repair, and a majority of these procedures  $(98\%)$  were performed in teaching centers in urban areas. They found a mortality rate of less than  $1\%$  nationwide and an overall complication rate of  $10\%$  across all age groups. The mean hospital stay was 4.2 days, and the two most common complications were hematoma/hemorrhage and airway/respiratory failure

[70]. At the authors' institution, a similar study was conducted on 100 consecutive craniosynostosis repairs showing good long-term results with a low complication rate. Out of 100 patients, most of the complications were mild and included 2 hematomas, 2 wound infections, 1 subgaleal abscess, 6 dural tears, 3 patients requiring reoperation for residual deformity, 4 cases requiring coronal scar revision, and 1 sagittal sinus bleed. Out of the 100 cases, there was 1 intraoperative death due to intraoperative cardiac pacemaker failure. Other recent studies demonstrate comparably low complication rates, between  $3.2\%$  and  $6.81\%$ ,  $0.8\%$  mortality, and  $7.4\%$  to  $22.9\%$  incidence of major reoperation [41, 84, 85].

The most common complications associated with craniosynostosis repair during the operative, early postoperative, and late postoperative periods are listed in Table 48.1.

# Key Points

Correction prior to 1 year of age is ideal.  
Sagittal synostosis can often be corrected by 4-6 months of age.  
Unilateral coronal, bilateral coronal, and metopic synostosis require orbital bandeaus.  
- Most complications following repair are minor and occur in the early postoperative period.

# 48.7 Summary

In approximately 1 in 1000 live births in the United States, an infant has some variant of a craniofacial deformity. If cleft lip and palate deformities are included, the incidence is even greater. Surgical management of these patients has been advocated to occur from the first few weeks after birth until well into the second decade. Many of these patients require multiple, staged procedures that involve movements of the bone and soft tissue from both the intracranial and extracranial approaches. The surgical approach to most of these congenital deformities was radically changed by techniques introduced to the United States by Paul Tessier of France in 1967. From his imaginative intracranial and extracranial approaches, numerous advances have been made that have improved the management of these complex pediatric craniofacial deformities (Figs. 48.7, 48.8, 48.9, and 48.10).
