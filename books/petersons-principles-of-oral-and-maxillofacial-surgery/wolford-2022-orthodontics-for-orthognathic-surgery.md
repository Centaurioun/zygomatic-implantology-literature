# Learning Aims

1. Identify common dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal issues that may require orthodontic preparation prior to orthognathic surgery.  
2. Select orthodontic preparation techniques that are stable and predictable for specific dental and dento-alveolar factors.  
3. Specific orthodontic dentoalveolar factors can be addressed by orthodontic treatment modalities and/or surgical intervention.  
4. Orthognathic surgery can correct the sectional aspects of the maxillary and mandibular dental arches and provide major skeletal reconstruction.

# 60.1 Introduction

Proper diagnosis, treatment planning, and execution of orthodontics and surgery can lead to highly predictable and optimal results relative to function and aesthetics.

Moderate to severe occlusal discrepancies and dentofacial deformities in adolescents and adults usually require combined orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to obtain optimal results. The basic treatment goals are to (1) satisfy the patients' concerns, (2) establish optimal functional outcomes, (3) provide good aesthetic balance, and (4) pain-free results. To accomplish this the orthodontist and the oral and maxillofacial surgeon (OMFS) must be able to correctly diagnose existing dental and skeletal deformities, establish an appropriate treatment plan, and properly execute the recommended treatment. The orthodontist is limited, to a great extent, by growth, and although the orthodontist can move teeth and, to some degree, the alveolar bone, he or she does not have any appreciable effect on the basal bone of the jaws. The orthodontist's role is to align the teeth relative to the maxillary and mandibular jaws. The OMFS is responsible for surgically repositioning the jaw(s) and associated structures.

# 60.1.1 Sequencing

There are options in reference to the sequencing of orthodontics and surgery for the correction of dentofacial deformities: Perform the majority of orthodontics presurgery followed by the surgery or perform the surgery first with the majority of orthodontic treatment post-surgery. These 2 approaches were originally described by Fish et al. in 1978 [1] and in the past few years, the surgery first approach has increased in popularity. The following orthodontic treatment considerations can be adopted to either the orthodontic first or surgery first approaches.

# 60.2 Orthodontic Goals

The basic orthodontic goals for orthognathic surgery, are as follows: (1) align and position teeth over basal bone, (2) avoid excessive intrusion or extrusion of teeth, (3) decompensate teeth, (4) avoid unstable expansion or narrowing of the dental arches, (5) avoid Class II and Class III mechanics (unless required for dental decompensation correction in the arches; and (6) perform stable and predictable orthodontics.

The combined coordination treatment by the orthodontist and OMFS is to establish good facial balance and function. Although there are numerous cephalometric analyses available, the author uses a simple analysis that can be used as a guide in developing a comprehensive treatment plan (Figs. 60.1 and 60.2) [2].

# 60.2.1Incisor Position

Relative to the final position of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, the ideal orthodontic goals whether performed presurgery or post-surgery are as follows:

1. Position the long axis of the maxillary central incisors approximately  $22^{\circ} \pm 2^{\circ}$  to the nasion point A (NA) line, with the labial surface of the incisors  $4\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to the NA line relative to a normally positioned maxilla and normal occlusal plane angle (OPA) (Fig. 60.2).  
2. The aesthetic crown angle is a line drawn tangent to the facial aspect of the maxillary central incisor crown extending through the Frankfort horizontal plane. The angle created should be at  $90^{\circ} \pm 2^{\circ}$ . This places the crown into the best aesthetic position (Fig. 60.2).  
3. Position the long axis of the mandibular central incisors  $20^{\circ} \pm 2^{\circ}$  to the nasion point B (NB) line with the labial surface of the incisors  $4\mathrm{mm}$  anterior to that line relative to a normally positioned mandible and normal occlusal plane angle (Fig. 60.2).  
4. Satisfy arch length requirements (crowding or spacing) [2].

Using the ideal position of the maxillary and mandibular incisors to the NA and NB lines, respectively, with a normal occlusal plane angle (OPA) (Figs. 60.1 and 60.2), is the most convenient and practical method to establish the orthodontic goals for the incisor positions. However, these orthodontic goals may be different if the occlusal plane angle is to be altered surgically. An exact orthodontic treatment plan, including the specific mechanics and anchorage requirements necessary to position the teeth to satisfy the orthodontic goals, must be developed and executed.

# Cephalometric Analysis

# 60.2.2Occlusal Plane Angle (OPA) Surgical Alteration

Optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes may require surgical alteration of the maxillary and mandibular OPA (Fig. 60.3). Patients with low occlusal plane angle (LOP) facial morphology (brachycephaly) may

benefit from increasing the (OPA  $\square$  Fig. 60.4), whereas patients with high occlusal plane angle (HOP) facial morphology (dolichocephaly) may benefit from decreasing the OPA (Fig. 60.5) [3-6]. The angulation change of the incisors will equal the change of the OPA (Fig. 60.3). For example; increasing the OPA 10 degrees will decrease the maxillary incisor angle 10

# Occlusal Plane Alteration

Surgical alteration of the Occlusal Plane Angle can change the function and esthetics of the jaw structures

Fig. 60.3 The occlusal plane angle (OPA) is an important factor in establishing good function, occlusion, and aesthetics. The normal OPA to FHP is  $8^{\circ} \pm 4^{\circ}$ . OPA can be increased, decreased, or remain the same, depending on the presenting facial morphology and treatment goals

$\square$  Fig. 60.5 Patients with high OPA facial morphologies may benefit functionally and aesthetically from counterclockwise rotation of the maxillo-mandibular complex. With this rotation, the maxillary incisors increase in angulation and the mandibular incisors decrease in angulation to the same degree that the OPA changes

$\square$  Fig. 60.4 Patients with low OPA facial morphologies may benefit functionally and aesthetically from clockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex. With this rotation, the maxillary incisors decrease in angulation and the mandibular incisors increase in angulation to the same degree that the OPA changes

pated OPA change needs to be factored into the presurgical orthodontic planning so that the posttreatment incisors angulation will be optimized.

# 60.2.3 Dental and Periodontal Treatment

Any indicated periodontal or general dental care related to maintaining teeth or improving dental health should be performed prior to orthodontics and surgical intervention. The objective is to maintain as many teeth as possible and maximize the health of the periodontium. Temporary crowns and bridges should be placed where necessary for the orthodontic and surgical phases of the treatment. Permanent crowns, inlays, and bridges should be constructed and inserted after the surgery and orthodontics have been completed.

degrees while increasing the lower incisor angle 10 degrees. Conversely, decreasing the OPA 10 degrees will increase the maxillary incisor angle 10 degrees, while the lower incisor angle will decrease 10 degrees. The antici

and developing treatment objectives will aid in selecting the appropriate treatment.

However, this section on management of specific dental problems will be presented using traditional orthodontic mechanics without surgical corticotomy assistance.

# 60.3.1 Adjustment for Tooth-Size Discrepancy (TSD)

A tooth-size discrepancy (TSD) causes incompatibility of the dental alignment and can occur in the anterior teeth, premolars, and molars. Bolton's analysis correlates the widths of the maxillary and mandibular anterior six teeth. The summation of the mesiodistal widths of the maxillary anterior six teeth divided into the combined width of the mandibular anterior six teeth, yields a value called the intermaxillary (Bolton's) index. The average index (percentage) is  $77.5 \pm 3.5$  [7, 8]. A simple conversion of this factor would be to measure the width of the mandibular anterior six teeth and multiply that sum by 1.3. This results in a calculated ideal maxillary arch width. The difference between the calculated and the actual maxillary arch width values determines the TSD so appropriate orthodontic adjustments can be made for correction (Fig. 60.6). TSDs can also occur in the premolar and molar areas (normally the same maxillary and mandibular teeth are similar in size)

![](images/8430e2820d9aa0c1c29bc2e99b9b5038f77793214b7f33c988ed9c45379775e8.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 60.6 Bolton's analysis determines the presence or absence of tooth size discrepancies between the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth. Successive holes are punched into a tablet for each of the anterior six teeth for each arch. Then measuring from the first hole to the last hole will give the summation of the mesiodistal widths of the anterior six teeth in each arch. Multiplying the summation of the mandibular anterior six teeth (LA) by 1.3 yields the calculated arch width for the maxillary anterior six teeth (UA). Subtracting the actual maxillary anterior arch width from the calculated width yields the tooth-size discrepancy. In this example, the TSD is about  $1 \mathrm{~mm}$

where the mandibular teeth may be significantly larger than the maxillary teeth.

Commonly, TSDs occur because of small maxillary lateral incisors, making the combined mesiodistal width of the maxillary anterior six teeth too small to fit properly around the mandibular anterior six teeth, so that when the teeth are properly aligned and spaces closed, an end-on Class II cuspid relationship will result (Fig. 60.7). The following are treatment options that can be used to correct TSDs.

# ■ Slenderizing Teeth (Interproximal Tooth-Size Reduction)

This technique reduces the mesiodistal dimension of the involved teeth. Since most TSDs involve larger mandibular anterior teeth compared to the maxillary anterior teeth, slenderizing the mandibular anterior teeth can address the issue (Fig. 60.8). Approximately 10 to  $12\%$  of the mesiodistal width can be safely removed from each tooth with  $50\%$  of the interproximal enamel remaining (3). Up to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of reduction can usually be safely achieved in the mandibular anterior arch.

# Creating Space in the Arch

Opening space around the small maxillary lateral incisors can be accomplished by placement of coil springs between the cuspid and lateral incisors and if needed between the lateral incisors and central incisors (Fig. 60.9). At the end of treatment, the lateral incisors can be built up by bonding, veneers, or crowns. Performing 3-piece maxillary osteotomies with interdental cuts between the cuspid and lateral incisors will

$\square$  Fig. 60.7 This patient has well-aligned and leveled teeth in each arch. Maxillary lateral incisors are small creating a tooth-size discrepancy (TSD). Note that with the best possible fit, the patient has an end-on Class II occlusal relationship secondary to the TSD

permit opening space at surgery to correct TSD. The incisors can also be angled to decrease or increase the axial angulation. A maximum  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of spacing (1.5 mm on each side) can usually be safely acquired.

# 60.3.2 Correct Over-Angulated (Proclined) and/or Crowded Maxillary or Mandibular Anterior Teeth

Over-angulated and/or crowded maxillary or mandibular anterior teeth are most commonly seen in patients with maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia.

![](images/ed159b2c40429452307f5ef079cf1ad36583eed910547df9cd328e9532f61c81.jpg)  
Fig. 60.8 Mandibular anterior teeth can be slenderized using diamond strips (illustrated) or by thin cylindrical diamond burs or discs, to reduce the width of the teeth at the contact level. Spacing generated can then be closed with orthodontics

The following treatment methods can be used to correct this type of situation.

# - Slenderizing and Retraction

This technique involves the removal of tooth structure at the contact points and is applicable when there is a TSD with either arch. Usually, up to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of tooth structure can be safely removed from the contact areas of the anterior six teeth.

# Extraction and Retraction

First or second bicuspid can be extracted depending on the amount of crowding, the anchorage requirements, and the amount of retraction of the incisors necessary. Every  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of incisor retraction will require  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of space on each side of the arch. To retract the incisors by  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , requires  $6\mathrm{mm}$  of arch space ( $3\mathrm{mm}$  on each side). Extracting first bicuspid will result in greater incisor retraction, compared to extracting second bicuspid that will result in less incisor retraction. The occlusal plane angle will also affect the posterior anchorage. Low occlusal plane angle (LOP) cases will have greater posterior anchorage stability, whereas high occlusal plane angle (HOP) cases will have less posterior anchorage stability, so the incisors will retract less with HOP patients.

# Distalizing Posterior Teeth

This objective can be accomplished using pendulum-type appliances, headgear, Class II or Class III mechanics, osseo-integrated dental implants or TADs (i.e., implants posterior to molars, zygomatic implants, palatal implants, or buccal or lingual cortex implants or plates to act as anchors). Another option is to distalize one tooth at a time on each side of the

![](images/d1511b53df6e1b24abf087fd6ee0912b3b56894f6ed142214088f6d46e6c40f4.jpg)  
Fig. 60.9 Placing coil springs between the maxillary cuspid and lateral incisors and if necessary, between the lateral incisors and central incisors can open up spacing around the lateral incisors to cor

rect a TSD. Posttreatment, the lateral incisors can be built up by bonding, veneers, or crowns

arch, beginning with the second molars (2 teeth moved against 12 anchor teeth).

# Anterior Segmental Osteotomies

This technique permits up-righting of the anterior teeth but will cause the apical base of the segment to shift forward relative to the incisor edges unless teeth are extracted to reposition the incisal edges of the anterior teeth posteriorly. The interdental osteotomies should be done between the lateral incisors and cuspidas as this offers the best control in up-righting the anterior segment (Fig. 60.10), vertical leveling the segments, correcting arch asymmetry, and also allow opening of space between the lateral incisors (up to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  with  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  per side) that can be used for correction of crowding or TSD [6].

# Maxillary Expansion by Orthodontics, Orthopedics (Rapid Palatal Expansion), and Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (SARPE)

These techniques will increase arch length and may allow retraction of the anterior teeth. However, they will

![](images/c4741eaab51d21dc7d4d45cc9029f483695bb306e5f18a9267f3d6f120be5701.jpg)  
Fig. 60.10 An anterior maxillary segmental osteotomy can be used to upright the maxillary incisors. However, the dentoalveolar at the apical base will rotate anteriorly compared to the incisal tips, if no teeth are extracted. Since this may affect the position of the nose and upper lip, careful evaluation of facial aesthetics is necessary to determine if this approach is appropriate. The dashed line represents the original position of the maxilla at the osteotomy level and the solid line represents the new positioned maxilla

also increase the curve of Wilson as the transverse width of the maxillary arch increases because the crowns of the posterior teeth will expand three times as much as the palate expands (Fig. 60.11). In addition, with SARPE, the palate moves inferiorly. The expanded arches may not be as orthodontically stable, requiring long-term or permanent retention [2].

# Mandibular Symphysis Distraction Osteogenesis

This technique, usually performed with a midline vertical osteotomy, will allow expansion of the dentoalveolar and widening of the mandibular arch, providing room to retract and/or align the teeth. This is an excellent treatment method to gain space for major arch length discrepancies. However, it is done as a prerequisite surgery to achieve the orthodontic goals prior to the major orthognathic surgery. Orthodontic preparation may be necessary prior to performing the midline vertical osteotomy. The roots of the central incisors (or the adjacent teeth, wherever the osteotomy is to be performed) must be tipped away from each other to make room for the interdental osteotomy. If a tooth-borne distraction device is used, orthodontic treatment on any other teeth should not be initiated until adequate healing of the distraction area has occurred (approximately 4 months from initiation of the distraction). Otherwise, it may result in developing dental mobility and orthodontic instability, with the teeth expanding more than the basal bone. Bone-borne devices are not affected by pre-distraction orthodontics [6].

Fig. 60.11 Maxillary expansion by orthodontics, orthopedics, or surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) will cause an increase of the curve of Wilson. Even with SARPE, the occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth will expand three times as much as the palate will expand, thus increasing the curve of Wilson

# 60.3.3 Correct Under-Angulated (Retro-Inclined) Maxillary or Mandibular Incisors

Under-angulated maxillary incisors are most commonly seen in Class II Division 2 malocclusions or with missing teeth in the arch. Under angulated mandibular incisors are more commonly seen in patients with prognathic mandibles or with missing teeth. The following approaches can be used to correct this type of condition.

# Correct Crowding

Crowding of the maxillary anterior teeth can accompany vertically inclined teeth. Therefore, correcting the crowding will increase the incisor angulation.

# Open Space

In Class I and Class II patients, under-angulated incisors may be present because of previous extractions (i.e., bicuspids), congenitally missing teeth, previous trauma resulting in loss of teeth, or small maxillary anterior teeth (i.e., small maxillary lateral incisors). In Class III patients, under-angulated mandibular incisors may be present due to compromised compensatory orthodontic treatment, small teeth, or an excessive amount of alveolar bone compared with the size of the teeth. Opening space around the small anterior teeth for later placement of bonding, veneers, or crowns, or opening a larger space to add teeth are also options. Opening space in the bicuspid areas, if the problem exists because of previous extractions, can correct this problem and provide additional dental units for a more complete occlusal result. The use of coil springs usually works well for this situation, but distraction devices can also be effective. If the problem is in the lateral incisor area, opening space can help correct the TSD as well as increase the incisor angulation (Fig. 60.9).

# Inter-arch Mechanics

The use of Class III mechanics (i.e., plastics) can increase maxillary incisor angulation. However, the Class III mechanics can be detrimental by overloading the TMJs. The use of Class II mechanics (i.e., plastics, Herbst's appliance) can increase mandibular incisor angulation. However, long-term Class II mechanics can be detrimental to outcome stability and results, because of the potential untoward effects on the TMJs.

# - Interdental Osteotomies

An anterior maxillary subapical osteotomy or segmentalized Le Fort I osteotomy or mandibular subapical or bilateral anterior bony osteotomies, will permit rotation of the anterior teeth to increase their angulation.

However, significant room must be created between the roots of the adjacent teeth (lateral incisors and cuspid) at the osteotomy areas. Since bone removal between the roots may be required, there is an increased risk of damage to the adjacent teeth. If the maxilla requires surgical expansion, then segmentalization between the lateral incisors and cuspid will allow the anterior segment to rotate posteriorly between the expanded posterior segments with fewer requirements for bone removal, if required at all.

# 60.3.4Correct Excess Curve of Spee: Maxillary Arch

This condition is most often seen with anterior openbite situations and high occlusal plane facial types. Careful assessment of the curve of Spee is important because using only orthodontic mechanics to correct this condition may not be stable. The condition can be addressed by the following treatment options.

# Extrude Anterior Teeth

Conventional orthodontics with straight wire techniques will tend to extrude the anterior teeth, and as a by-product will tip the molars buccally, increasing the curve of Wilson. These dental changes may be unstable and fraught with relapse potential.

# Intrude Mid-buccal Teeth

This is a very difficult technique, unless high-pull headgear, osseo-integrated implants, or TADs are used to provide intrusive forces. Placing TADs palatally and buccally would provide the best force vector for the intrusion of these teeth.

# Extraction and Retraction

Extraction of maxillary first or second bicuspidis with retraction of the anterior teeth will usually decrease the curve of Spee, providing the incisors are over angulated, to begin with.

# Orthodontic, Orthopedic, or SARPE with Incisor Retraction

Expansion of the maxillary arch by any of these techniques will increase the arch length, create space between the anterior teeth, and allow some retraction of the anterior teeth with a downward and backward rotation. In late adolescence or adulthood, SARPE may provide better stability than the other two techniques. However, note that the curve of Wilson will increase because the expansion at the occlusal level compared with the palate will be a 3:1 ratio [6] (Figs. 60.12, 60.13, and 60.14).

another approach to aligning teeth at separate independent levels to avoid extrusion or intrusion of teeth as seen in this maxilla. However, the use of sectional wires may decrease positional control of the teeth adjacent to the ends of the cut wire, adversely affect the post-surgery occlusal relationship, as well as making the surgery more complex

mandibular vertical body osteotomies will permit leveling of the excessive curve of Spee without shortening the vertical height of the mandible and is indicated when the mandibular anterior dental height is normal or even slightly short vertically. This basic technique can also be used to correct a reverse curve of Spee by elevating the anterior segment

# Surgical Correction

The maxillary teeth can be orthodontically aligned in segments by aligning the four incisors at an elevated level, compared to the cuspid and posterior teeth, to

avoid extrusion, intrusion, and buccal tipping of teeth. Placing compensating vertical steps in the arch wire between the lateral incisors and cuspidis (see

Fig. 60.12a) will accomplish the alignment at different

levels. For some cases the vertical positional difference may occur between the cuspid and bicuspid or could occur asymmetrically on one side of the arch compared with the other side. The step in the arch would then be made between the appropriate teeth. Another technique involves cutting the arch wire into two or more segments and aligning groups of teeth in individual units (Fig. 60.12b). However, it may be more difficult to control rotations and root position, particularly of the teeth adjacent to the ends of the segmented wires, compared with using a continuous wire with compensating vertical steps. If a segmental arch wire is used, the cuspid crowns tend to tip palatally presurgery and may require surgical expansion of the cuspid to a greater extent than using a continuous arch wire with a vertical step. The three-piece Le Fort I osteotomy, with interdental osteotomies performed between the lateral incisors and cuspid, will permit repositioning of the anterior segment independent of the posterior segments (Fig. 60.10). The anterior segment can be reoriented vertically, anteroposteriorly, and the axial inclination of the incisors can be changed to correct the curve of Spee and achieve the best interdigitation of the segments [6].

# 60.3.5 Correct Accentuated Curve of Spee: Mandibular Arch

An accentuated curve of Spee in the mandibular arch most often occurs in anterior deep-bite relationships.

# Intrude Mandibular Anterior Teeth

Intrusion mechanics can predictably inferiorly position mandibular anterior teeth approximately  $2\mathrm{mm}$ . Beyond

![](images/f82237735faab3a99b16924bdbce690142209f195c7c69b9c58300c2b615eda1.jpg)  
roots in this position could result in severe periodontal compromise and possible loss of teeth. b Adequate space (arrow) for an interdental osteotomy can be created by selective bracket placement on the adjacent teeth

2 mm the vertical relapse approaches  $60\%$ . With an accentuated curve of Spee the contact area of the teeth is at a lower level where the teeth are narrower, below the normal contact level. Therefore, for every  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of leveling of the mandibular arch, the mandibular incisor edges will move forward approximately  $1\mathrm{mm}$  as the contact points align. Any crowding of the arch will further contribute to flaring of the incisors. Intruding teeth will decrease the anterior mandibular vertical height and must also be taken into consideration so that the anterior mandibular height is not excessively shortened.

# Extrude Mid-buccal Teeth

Extrusion of mid-buccal teeth may be more stable than intrusion of anterior teeth. However, this technique is difficult to perform without special considerations. If the patient's malocclusion has the bicuspidis and first molars in occlusion, extrusion will be virtually impossible. However, constructing a splint or application of turbos on the incisors and molars that will open the bite and engage only the mandibular anterior teeth and second molars, with the bicuspidis and first molars out of contact, will permit extrusion of the mid-buccal teeth. Another alternative would be to correct the accentuated curve of Spee after the mandible and occlusion are surgically repositioned, placing the incisors and molars into proper contact, and then extrude the mid-buccal teeth post-surgery. With this approach, the molars may tip distally and the arch may widen.

# - Interdental Osteotomies

An anterior subapical osteotomy (Fig. 60.13a) or bilateral anterior body osteotomies (Fig. 60.13b)

will permit downward repositioning of the anterior teeth, with very stable results when the surgery is properly performed. If the anterior vertical height of the mandible is excessive, then the subapical osteotomy would be indicated since it will shorten the anterior mandibular height by the amount that the incisors are lowered. Bilateral anterior body osteotomies would be indicated when the vertical height of the anterior mandible is normal or less, so that the anterior height remains unaltered while the curve of Spee is corrected [6].

# 60.3.6Correct Reverse Curve of Spee: Maxillary Arch

Reverse curves of Spee are more commonly seen in Division 2 malocclusions and in vertical maxillary deficiencies with an anterior deep bite. The maxillary incisors are commonly in a decreased axial inclination. Crowding may or may not be present.

# Correct Crowding or Division 2 Relations

Eliminating crowding and Division 2 dental positions will tip the incisors forward, increasing the incisor axial angulation and decreasing the reverse curve of Spee. These movements will usually fill out the upper lip but may decrease the maxillary tooth-to-lip relationship. Maxillary incisors may become intruded with a straight wire technique.

# Extrude Mid-buccal Teeth

This technique is difficult if the mid-buccal teeth are in occlusion with mandibular teeth. However, the bite can be opened with a splint or turbos that affords contact on only the maxillary second molars and anterior teeth, with the maxillary mid-buccal teeth out of contact with the splint. The mid-buccal teeth (bicuspidis and first molars) can then be extruded into position to improve the curve of Spee.

# Open Spaces

If the reverse curve of Spee is related to missing teeth or TSDs, then spaces can be opened to aid in increasing the axial inclination of the incisors and decreasing the reverse curve of Spee. These spaces can then be eliminated by bonding, crown and bridge, or dental implants and crowns.

# - Interdental Osteotomies

Multiple maxillary osteotomies can be performed so that the maxilla can be repositioned in segments, enabling leveling of the arch. Presurgical orthodontics should be designed to align the teeth at different

vertical levels to facilitate the surgery and minimize orthodontic relapse potential. It is usually easiest and most applicable to make the osteotomies between the lateral incisors and cuspidis. This may particularly be indicated when the maxilla must be repositioned anyway and maxillary expansion is also required. Performing a three-piece segmented maxillary osteotomy will then allow vertical alteration between the anterior and posterior segments to level the curve of Spee.

# 60.3.7 Correct Reverse Curve of Spee: Mandibular Arch

This condition is most commonly seen in patients with macroglossia, habitual tongue posturing, or tongue thrust, with an associated anterior open bite. The following techniques can be used to correct this type of condition.

# Extrude Anterior Teeth

Extrusion of anterior teeth may not be very stable in the long term, and without permanent retention, could result in re-intrusion and redevelopment of an anterior open bite.

# Intrude Mid-buccal Teeth

This technique may be accomplished with osseointegrated implants or TADs placed as anchors in the buccal and lingual cortical bone of the dentoalveolar. However, no studies support the stability in the long term.

# Extract and Retract

If the mandibular incisors are significantly over angulated, with or without crowding, bicuspid extractions can be performed and the incisors retracted, which will decrease the reverse curve of Spee.

# Bonding the Mandibular Anterior Teeth

This technique can be used to level the arch by building up the incisors, increasing the crown height. However, care must be taken not to exceed a safe crown-root ratio and/or create an aesthetic compromise.

# - Interdental Osteotomies

Anterior subapical (Fig. 60.13a) or anterior bilateral mandibular body osteotomies (see Fig. 60.13b) can be used to elevate the anterior teeth. If the anterior mandibular height is short, then the subapical osteotomy can also be used to increase the anterior height of the mandible. If the anterior mandibular height is normal, then the bilateral anterior body osteotomies will permit

elevation of the anterior teeth and chin, maintaining the anterior height of the mandible.

# 60.3.8 Anteroposterior Arch Asymmetry (Maxilla or Mandible)

Anteroposterior arch asymmetry, when the cuspid on one side of the arch is anterior to the cuspid on the opposite side of the arch, is fairly common in patients with dentofacial deformities. Arch asymmetries can be related to developmental abnormalities, missing teeth, or ankylosed teeth. Dental midlines may not align with the facial midline.

# Extract Unilaterally

In some cases, unilateral extraction and retraction will correct the problem. The decision must be made as to which tooth to extract. Extraction of a first bicuspid will allow greater anterior retraction compared with extracting a second bicuspid. This extraction would only be indicated if there were significant over angulation of the incisors, crowding, and/or significant midline dental shift.

# Open Space Unilaterally

This technique would be indicated if a tooth is missing, there is significant decreased angulation of the incisors, and/or the midline is significantly deviated to the involved side. Interdental space can be created, and the space eliminated by dental implant and crown, bridge, or surgical removal of the space to advance the posterior dental segment forward on the involved side.

# Inter-arch Mechanics

This technique can be effectively used by incorporating Class II mechanics on one side and Class III mechanics on the opposite side. Anterior cross-arch elastics can also be helpful. If only one arch is involved, then maximizing anchorage in the other arch is very important so that an asymmetry does not develop in the normal arch. Osseo-integrated implants or TADs can be used as anchors to correct asymmetry in an arch without having to use inter-arch mechanics.

# Osteotomies

Osteotomies can be used in the maxillary arch by segmenting the maxilla and advancing one side more than the other side. Osteotomies in the mandibular arch to correct arch asymmetry can become somewhat complex. Anterior subapical osteotomies with the removal of a unilateral tooth can correct some large discrepancies (6 to  $9\mathrm{mm}$ ). However, the subapical osteotomy may need

to be combined with ramus sagittal split osteotomies and a unilateral or bilateral body osteotomy, with or without extraction, to shift the occlusion into a symmetric position [6]. These types of movements require a high degree of surgical skill but can provide high-quality outcomes.

# 60.3.9Divergence of Roots Adjacent to Interdental Surgical Sites

When interdental osteotomies are planned it may be necessary for the orthodontist to tip the adjacent tooth roots away from the area of the planned osteotomy to prevent damage to the teeth. If the roots are too close together, postsurgical periodontal problems may develop with possible loss of interdental bone and teeth. Creating interdental space between the roots significantly improves the margin of safety (Fig. 60.14) [9-11]. This can be easily achieved by selective bracket placement. For the tooth mesial to the osteotomy, the bracket is slightly rotated so that the mesial aspect of the bracket is positioned slightly more gingivally compared with the distal aspect of the bracket. Conversely, the distal tooth bracket is positioned so that the distal aspect of the bracket is placed slightly more gingivally compared with the mesial aspect of the bracket. With a straight wire technique, the roots will diverge (Fig. 60.15) [2]. Postsurgically, periapical radiography may be necessary for the orthodontist to check for rebonding the adjacent teeth

![](images/7166f508fe42cc99a176e62e6690936a406a0051f11966596b4b7eddbae520b4.jpg)  
Fig. 60.15 Selective bracket placement can create adequate interdental space for osteotomies. On the tooth mesial to the osteotomy, slightly rotate the mesial aspect of the bracket gingivally, and on the distal tooth, slightly rotate the distal aspect of the bracket gingivally. A straight wire will then diverge the roots

brackets to ensure proper root angulation at completion of treatment.

# 60.3.10 Coordination of Maxillary and Mandibular Arch Widths

In some cases, transverse arch width discrepancies can be corrected with stable and predictable orthodontic movements, but in other cases, orthodontic correction may be very unstable and fraught with relapse. It must be determined whether to correct width problems by orthodontics, orthopedics, SARPE, or surgical expansion (Fig. 60.11). These expansion techniques usually create space in the anterior arch. Patients with reverse curves of Wilson in the maxillary arch may benefit more from these techniques, but those with a pretreatment accentuated curve of Wilson may have unfavorable results, with subsequent difficulty getting the buccal cuspids to interdigitate. The following predictable changes will occur with maxillary arch expansion by orthodontic, orthopedic, or SARPE procedures. (1) The bite may open anteriorly but will decrease as the incisors are retracted and spacing closed. (2) Buccal tipping of the maxillary posterior teeth may increase the curve of Wilson, making it difficult to properly interdigitate the buccal cusps orthodontically. (3) Long-term or permanent retention may be necessary to counterbalance the significant orthodontic relapse potential. (4) In late adolescent and adult patients, SARPE may be necessary to expand the maxilla orthopedically since the mid-palatal suture may be closed [2].

Surgical expansion of the maxilla at the time of the Le Fort I procedure using multiple segmentation of the maxilla, stabilization with bone plates and palatal or occlusal splints, and autogenous bone or hydroxyapatite synthetic bone grafting along the lateral maxillary walls can provide a good outcome. This technique when properly performed is very stable, allows alteration of the curve of Wilson, and eliminates the orthodontic relapse potential inherent with the other techniques [6].

# 60.3.11Additional Orthodontic Issues

# Missing Teeth

Teeth can be missing from the arches for a number of reasons such as congenital absence, non-eruption, previous orthodontic extractions, extractions for periodontal or dental pathology, and trauma. In some cases (i.e., congenital absence of maxillary lateral incisors, previous inappropriate bicuspid extraction) opening space to accommodate replacement teeth may be indicated.

When conditions permit, opening space for replacement teeth can be accomplished by appropriate mechanics to achieve the required space. Surgery can also be used to create spacing in some areas. Distraction osteogenesis can be used to create space. The missing teeth can then be replaced with dental implants, bridges, or partial dentures for example.

# Correction of Rotated Teeth

Bracket placement and arch wire adaptation are the primary keys to correcting rotated teeth and it is usually best to achieve these corrections presurgery. However, if the malrotations do not interfere with the establishment of the desired dentoskeletal relationship, then the rotations can be corrected post-surgery. Severe rotations may require supracrestal fiberotomy to prevent relapse and improve permanent retention. This can often be done at the time of orthognathic surgery.

# Management of Short Roots

The two most common causes of short roots are developmental or conditions causing root resorption. When these conditions are present presurgical, orthodontic mechanics must be designed to place minimal forces on the teeth and minimize tooth movement with no extrusion, intrusion, or bodily reposition as these forces may increase root resorption [2]. Surgical management may require segmentation of the maxilla and/or mandible so that sections of the maxillary and mandibular teeth can be moved independently to achieve a good dental interrelationship and minimizing pre- and postsurgical orthodontic forces. The interdental osteotomies should have no adverse effect on root resorption [6].

# Management of Ankylosed Teeth

Treatment of ankylosed teeth depends upon: (1) whether the tooth is primary or permanent; (2) the surrounding dentition; (3) the eruption status; (4) tooth position and orientation; (5) the time of onset and diagnosis; (6) the age of the patient, and (7) the treatment goals.

# Ankylosed Primary Tooth

Can impede development of the alveolar ridge and eruption of the permanent successor. If a primary tooth has a permanent successor, treatment is immediate extraction followed by space maintenance until the permanent tooth erupts. If no permanent successor and ankylosis occurs early in jaw, growth and development treatment includes extraction and space maintenance [20]. If the ankylosis occurs late with no permanent successor, restorative dentistry may provide aesthetics and function with perhaps many years of service [12, 13].

# Ankylosed Permanent Tooth

An unrecognized ankylosed permanent tooth, tied into the arch wire can result in a significant malocclusion (Fig. 60.16). If ankylosis of the permanent tooth has an early onset during eruption, the tooth should be luxated allowing for further eruption. If repeated luxation proves ineffective the tooth should be extracted to prevent submergence. If the onset of ankylosis occurs late, in the normal eruption pattern, the tooth should be luxated and orthodontics immediately initiated. If the attempt is unsuccessful and the tooth does not submerge, it may be vertically restored upon growth maturity [14]. An unerupted ankylosed tooth can have surgical uncovering, luxation, application of orthodontic bonding, and tension forces applied to direct the tooth into occlusion. However, if the tooth re-ankylosis the orthodontic forces will intrude the adjacent teeth. A deeply unerupted ankylosed tooth may be left undisturbed unless it is infected, alters the alveolar bone growth potential, or constitutes an immediate threat to the occlusion or adjacent teeth, or would impede the placement of an osseo-integrated implant. Other treatment options include extraction followed by reimplantation, osseo-integrated implant, or prosthetic replacement [23]. Replacement with an implant should be delayed until after alveolar growth is complete as an implant will

have the same adverse effect on alveolar bone growth as an ankylosed tooth [15, 16].

# Orthodontics for Surgical Management of Ankylosed Teeth

Presurgical orthodontics may be indicated to create adequate space (minimum of 2 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$ ) between the roots of the adjacent teeth to safely accommodate interdental osteotomies around the malpositioned ankylosed tooth. The ankylosed tooth is left out of the arch wire, and all other teeth are properly aligned in the traditional manner. Following surgery, orthodontic mechanics are initiated immediately to help get the mobilized dental segment with the ankylosed tooth, into the best possible position [2]

# Osteotomy

Performing single tooth osteotomies or sectional arch osteotomies with mobilization of the segment, will permit immediate repositioning of the ankylosed tooth (Fig. 60.17), or facilitate repositioning by distraction osteogenesis [17]. In select cases where a mandibular ankylosed primary molar is present, without a successor, a treatment option is to remove the ankylosed tooth and eliminate the extraction space by performing a vertical body ostectomy in conjunction with a mandibular

# 60.3.12 Corticotomies to Accelerate Orthodontic Movement

Corticotomies are an adjunctive surgical procedure that can accelerate and increase stability of orthodontic tooth movement. This technique can be applied to most of the following dental issues and orthodontic mechanics to be discussed. The technique requires a preliminary surgery where corticotomies are performed between and around teeth, as well as further bone aggravation generated by placing additional osseous holes in the cortical

tioning the ankylosed tooth with a single tooth osteotomy coupled with a multiple segmented maxilla. The single tooth dentoosseous segment is being repositioned into occlusion

bone. This creates an increased bone overturn and metabolism that allows more rapid tooth movement and thus significant accelerated rate of tooth movement [18, 19]. However, there is only about a 4-6-month window where the treatment is advantageous for tooth movement. After that time, the teeth will move at the normal rate. The advantages are; accelerated tooth movement with improved stability. The disadvantages are; an additional surgery, only a 4-6 month working time, and the risk of dental ankylosis.

# 60.3.13Final Presurgical Preparation

As presurgical orthodontic treatment progresses, new diagnostic records (lateral cephalograms, panograms, dental models) are taken to determine the feasibility and

![](images/81c50dd58f33fda6fff9809b3a35df97e2c0bd2142e377291595d25f13089724.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 60.18 Since maxillo-mandibular fixation is usually required during surgery, fixation devices attached to the brackets or arch wires are quite helpful. a Ball hooks built onto the brackets (blue arrows) are preferred, followed by "K" hooks applied to the brackets

timing of the surgical procedures. This will also aid the orthodontist in identifying specific areas that may need to be addressed in completing the presurgical orthodontic goals (i.e., sectional leveling of the arch segments, marginal ridge alignment, vertical dental alignment, buccal surface alignment, additional TSD correction).

During surgery, the jaws are usually wired together once or twice, as each jaw is independently mobilized and stabilized with rigid fixation. To facilitate wiring the jaws together as well as providing a means of using postsurgical elastics if required, fixtures attached to the brackets or arch wires are usually necessary. Fixtures attached to the brackets are dependent on the manufacturer but may include ball hooks built onto the brackets, T pins, and K hooks, (Fig. 60.18a). Fixtures attached to the arch wire include crimped-on hooks and soldered pins (Fig. 60.18b). Hooks built onto the brackets are preferred, followed by the other hooks placed on the brackets (T pins, K hooks). The least preferred are the hooks on the arch wire. The reason is that if post-surgery elastics are required for an extended time, the elastics and hooks on the arch wire will activate the arch wire, possibly creating unwanted orthodontic forces and movements (i.e., tipping the crowns lingually and the roots buccally). This undesirable torquing occurs to a much lesser degree when the hooks are directly on the brackets.

When the maxilla or mandible is to be segmentalized, it may be better for the orthodontist to section the arch wire (▶ Fig. 6.12b) and bend the ends inward at the predetermined osteotomy areas immediately prior to surgery, or the surgeon can cut the wire at surgery.

The best type of arch wire to place prior to surgery is a rectangular stainless-steel wire that fills the bracket slot. For example, with an 18 slot, a  $17 \times 25$ -gauge wire is recommended, and for a 22 slot, a  $21 \times 25$ -gauge wire

![](images/535cc9002a8470ff58a74645a399695d3fd8b9fda5f75d131c66b85d954c1d99.jpg)  
(white arrows). b Crimped-on hooks or soldered hooks are helpful, but less desirable, since post-surgery elastics, particularly if needed long-term, may activate the arch wire creating undesired dental movements

is indicated. This will help stabilize the individual dental units together as a whole arch or in segments when segmental surgery is required. The final wire should be placed 2 to 3 months prior to surgery [2].

# Key Points

- Accurate diagnosis of presurgical dental, dental osseous, and skeletal issues must be identified prior to implementing treatment.  
It is important to understand the orthodontic treatment options for the specific dental and dento-alveolar situations, so appropriate stable orthodontic techniques can be implemented.  
Presurgical orthodontic techniques must be selected that will provide stable orthodontic dental movements.  
Surgical procedures, such as dentoalveolar osteotomies, for some dental and dentoalveolar problems may augment the orthodontic preparation and improve stability and predictability of outcomes.  
- Appropriate orthodontic preparation and accurate orthognathic surgery should lead to highly predictable and stable outcomes.

# 60.4 Postsurgical Orthodontics

# 60.4.1 Surgical Stabilizing Devices (Splints)

At the completion of surgery, a surgical stabilizing splint may be present and wired to the upper teeth and light elastics  $(3\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{oz})$  are usually placed between the upper and lower arches in the cuspid and molar areas, and/or elsewhere if indicated. If the occlusion is good, then elastics may not be necessary if appropriate rigid fixation

was used at surgery. Surgical stabilizing splints are indicated to providing the following: (1) Stability in multiple segmental surgery of the maxilla or mandible. (2) Transverse stability when the maxilla and/or mandible have been expanded or narrowed. (3) Occlusal support when key teeth are missing (i.e., first, second, and third molars are missing in a quadrant). (4) A means to interdigitate the occlusion if teeth are severely worn or missing. There are two basic types of maxillary splints for orthognathic surgery; the palatal splint (Figs. 60.19

![](images/db30724541b5965ace637e36ff0922dd5ca1dbef85cdb5bf505d45d9bb41daa5.jpg)

Fig. 60.19 a The palatal splint provides great transverse stability, does not cover the occlusal surfaces, is attached with circum-dental wires around the first molars and bicuspids, easier to clean, and allows early initiation of post-surgery orthodontics. b The splint allows visualization of the occlusion, can remain in place for several months if necessary, and can be adapted as a temporary retainer if need

and 60.20) and the occlusal coverage splint (Fig. 60.21). If the maxilla and mandible are single pieces and the teeth can be appropriately interdigitated, then a final splint is usually not necessary in single or double jaw surgery [20, 21].

# Palatal Splint

This horseshoe-shaped splint (Fig. 60.19) is preferred by the author because of the following: (1) It provides excellent stability. (2) The occlusal interrelationship can be maximized and observed (the teeth and occlusal relationships are not covered and hidden by the splint). (3) It is easier to keep the teeth and splint clean. (4) Orthodontic treatment can be performed with the splint in place, including arch wire changes. (5) It can be left in place for an extended time (2 to 3 months or longer if necessary). (6) After removal, the splint can be modified to function as a retention splint by adding clasps. When making the splint, the palatal tissues beneath the splint must have wax relief of about 1 to  $2\mathrm{mm}$  on the dental model so the splint does not impinge on the soft tissues (Fig. 60.20 a-c). If the splint is constructed to sit against the soft tissues, a major risk of vascular compromise to the maxilla could occur resulting in a potentially disastrous outcome. The splint is stabilized to the maxilla with light, 28-gauge stainless steel wire placed through the splint and circumferentially around the first molars and first bicuspidis (second bicuspidis if the first bicuspidis are missing) and wires twisted on the labial side of the teeth (Fig. 60.19). The anterior teeth are not tied into the splint since the anterior segment could become displaced because of the cingulum morphology that will displace the segment superiorly and posteriorly. At surgery, the anterior segment is stabilized with bone plates [20, 21].

# Occlusal Coverage Splint

The occlusal coverage splint is the most common type of maxillary splint used and has the following advantages:

![](images/dc11161ceb98a225301742a497a9af951c70e82cd985dc06e76ab85105509bd2.jpg)

(1) easy to construct, (2) provides transverse stability, and (3) it can "lock-in" the occlusion perhaps better than the palatal splint (Fig. 60.21). However, the occlusal coverage splint presents the following possible complicating factors: (1) The clinician cannot see the occlusal interrelationship of the teeth with the splint in place. (2) An occlusal interference caused by the splint could result in a malocclusion. (3) Postsurgical orthodontics can be much more difficult. (4) Cannot change the arch wire with the splint in place. (5) Cannot perform orthodontics with the splint in place. (6) Oral hygiene is more difficult to maintain. (7) Can cause discoloration, decalcification, and caries of the teeth where covered by the splint. The splint is usually stabilized to the maxillary arch with wires placed through the buccal flange of the splint and around the adjacent orthodontic brackets on the teeth [20, 21].

# Mandibular Splint

Mandibular splints may be indicated for the following reasons: (1) Assist in stabilizing the mandible and segments following body, subapical, symphysis, and sagittal split osteotomies. (2) Provide transverse stability if the mandible is expanded or narrowed by osteotomies or distraction osteogenesis. (3) Temporarily replace missing teeth. Splints for providing transverse stability can be constructed to fit around the lingual aspect of the

Fig. 60.21 a, b The occlusal coverage splint is usually fixated to the maxillary arch wire and brackets. It is difficult to evaluate the post-surgery occlusion, as the teeth are hidden by the splint and the teeth are separated, and orthodontics cannot be initiated until after the splint is removed

mandibular crowns, similar to the maxillary palatal splint. Therefore, these splints can be maintained in position for an extended time (2 to 3 months or longer) if required. The splints can be secured to the mandibular arch by placing retention wires through the splint and circumferentially around the first molars and first bicuspids (second bicuspids if the first bicuspids are absent). Using this splint design, orthodontic arch wire changes and mechanics can progress with the splint remaining in place. Clasps can be placed on the splint following removal of the surgical retention wires so that the splint can be used as a removable retainer [20, 21].

# Splint Removal

This process requires cutting and removing the retention wires and then removing the splint. For most cases, the palatal or occlusal coverage splints can be removed at 1 to 2 months post-surgery. An exception is in large maxillary expansions ( $>3$  to  $4\mathrm{mm}$ ), where the palatal splint can remain in position for 2 to 3 months or longer if required. Following removal of the splint, a trans palatal arch bar, removable palatal splint, or heavy labial arch wire followed by post-orthodontic retainers, can be used to maintain the maxillary expansions for an extended time period.

# 60.4.2Postsurgical Orthodontic Management

# - Appointments

The surgeon and/or orthodontist should see the patient on a weekly basis, or more often if indicated, for the first 1 to 2 months post-surgery to check the occlusion, patient progress, and make any indicated changes in the elastic or orthodontic mechanics to maximize the occlusal interrelationship. If the occlusion fits properly, then elastics may not be necessary. Then, as long as the occlusion remains stable, the time span between appointments can be increased. The surgeon and orthodontist must coordinate this postoperative patient management.

# Patient Position at Assessment

Patient position is important when evaluating postorthognathic surgery occlusal relationships. Patients should be in an upright or slightly reclined position; not in a horizontal position as used for routine orthodontic treatment. The mandibular condyles may set more inferior and posterior than usual, particularly shortly after surgery. If there was preexisting TMJ pathology that was not corrected, patients may "splint" by holding the mandible forward to decrease pressure on the TMJs altering the centric relation occlusion. Of particular

concern is when TMJ surgery has also been performed at the same operation as the orthognathic surgery. The capsular ligaments have been cut and in a reclined position the condyles can slide posterior and inferior to a false centric relation position yielding a Class II end-on occlusal relationship. Setting the patient in an upright or only slightly reclined position and pushing gently upward at the angles of the mandible should seat the condyles into a centric relationship to more accurately evaluate the occlusal interrelationship.

# Aggressive Postsurgical Orthodontics

If the occlusion is not "perfect" initially post-surgery, then the surgeon and/or orthodontist must aggressively apply the appropriate elastic mechanics. Relatively light strength elastics (3/16 inch,  $3\frac{1}{2}$  oz) will usually be adequate to correct the situation. However, occasionally heavier elastics may be necessary. This can be accomplished by doubling up the  $3\frac{1}{2}$  oz. elastics or using a stronger elastic. Delays in addressing postsurgical occlusal imbalances will result in much greater difficulties correcting the problem at a later time. If the occlusion was good at the completion of surgery, but a shift has occurred or open bite developed, this is often due to minor posterior occlusal interferences or TMJ edema/ hematoma. If light elastics do not re-approximate the occlusion, then placing heavy elastics in the appropriate direction for 30 minutes to an hour may settle the occlusion into position so that light elastics can then be used again. Although heavy strength elastics are occasionally necessary, it is unusual to require them when the surgery has been properly and accurately performed. Occasionally, equilibration of the teeth may be necessary to settle the occlusion into position. If there is a major postsurgical malocclusion, then assessment of postsurgical lateral cephalogram, TMJ tomograms, and CBCT scans may help determine if it is a correctable problem orthodontically or if additional surgical intervention is required. If required, the sooner the surgical intervention is performed, usually the better situation for the patient and surgeon [20, 21].

# Elastics

Postsurgical inter-arch elasticities are indicated for the following reasons: (1) Maximize the occlusal fit. (2) Provide orthodontic forces to correct postsurgical occlusal discrepancies. (3) Take stress off the muscles of mastication to improve patient comfort immediately post-surgery. (4) Finalize the occlusion. (5) Minimize edema in the bilaminar tissues if simultaneous TMJ surgery was performed. Controlling the occlusion post-surgery can generally be accomplished using elastics with one or more of the following vectors depending on the situation (i.e.,

Class II, Class III, vertical, box, triangle, trapezoidal, rhomboidal, cross arch, anterior tangential, etc.). Usually only light force elastics of  $3 \frac{1}{2}$  oz. with sizes of  $1/8$ ,  $3/16$ ,  $1/4$ , and  $5/16$  are needed because teeth and bone segments (maxilla particularly) will move faster post-surgery. When TMJ surgery is simultaneously done with the orthognathic surgery, using light Class III directional elastics for a few days post-surgery will minimize TMJ edema. If postsurgical TMJ edema develops, then the occlusion can shift toward a Class III end-on relationship. Class III elastics will then be necessary to reapproximate the occlusion into a Class I relationship. It is usually easier to minimize the TMJ edema immediately after surgery with Class III elastics than to recapture the occlusion later [20, 21].

# Vertical Elastics

Anterior and posterior vertical elastics as well as Class II or III vector elastics may be necessary to maximize the occlusion post-surgery. The use of only anterior vertical elastics must be closely monitored. Although often necessary initially post-surgery to provide vertical support to the jaws to decrease masticatory muscle tension and to maximize the occlusal fit, these elastics can also create unwanted dentoalveolar changes. Holding the jaws apart for extended periods of time with only anterior vertical elastics on, can extrude the anterior teeth, increase anterior alveolar bone height, and intrude the posterior teeth (Fig. 60.22). Also, a degree of distraction osteogenesis may occur in the maxilla. These changes may result in the development of posterior open bites, premature contact of the incisors, increased upper tooth-to-lip relationship, and increased mandibular and maxillary anterior vertical height. Avoiding

![](images/9a0d1e5034694ffd73e6d152682b38ecab91a7249252949a30d6138d9f68e7ab.jpg)  
Fig. 60.22 When anterior vertical elastics are necessary, it is usually important to also use posterior vertical elastics. When only anterior vertical elastics are used, the anterior teeth can extrude, increase anterior alveolar bone height, increase upper tooth-to-lip relation, and intrude the posterior teeth, creating posterior open bites

these factors may include one or more of the following: (1) perform stable presurgical orthodontics and accurate surgery to decrease requirements for vertical elastics; (2) discontinue vertical elastics as soon as possible; (3) decrease daily time requirements for wearing elastics particularly during activities where the jaws will function in an open position; (4) use light vertical therapeutic clenching to minimize adverse vertical forces; (5) correct nasal airway obstruction and sleep apnea issues by performing the appropriate surgical procedures so the patients can breathe through their noses instead of requiring mouth breathing; and (6) consider placing TADs, bone screws, orthodontic retraction plates, etc., to the maxilla and mandible to provide better vertical skeletal support instead of using only the teeth. An indication for using only anterior vertical elastics is when there is premature posterior contact with a tendency toward or overt anterior open bite.

# Change Arch Wires

Segmental osteotomies in the maxilla or mandible commonly require the arch wire to be cut into sections. Crimping the wire ends or placing a bead of acrylic over the ends or using wax post-surgery to cover the cut ends of the wire, are techniques to protect the lips and cheeks from trauma caused by the cut wire ends. Generally, the arch wires can be changed at about 4 to 6 weeks post-surgery. It is usually too uncomfortable for patients to tolerate the arch wire change prior to that time. If a palatal splint is present, it can remain in place as it

should not interfere with the arch wire change and the splint can continue to help with maxillary transverse stability. Occlusal coverage splints usually require removal before the arch wire can be changed.

# Power Chains

Avoid the use of power chains, particularly in the upper arch post-surgery. The use of power chains is a relatively common technique in the orthodontic finishing phase of treatment. However, power chain forces can create increased torque on the incisors, tipping the incisor edges posteriorly and the root tips anteriorly, extruding the incisors, and intruding the molars. This can cause premature contact of the incisors with subsequent end-on incisor relationship and development of posterior open bites (Fig. 60.23). This can be a major problem, particularly in patients where spacing was created in the maxillary anterior arch around the lateral incisors to compensate for the tooth size discrepancy, as closure of the spacing will further contribute to premature contact of the incisors and posterior open bites. When this problem develops, the power chain should be removed immediately, and mechanics reversed to tip the incisor edges forward and the root tips posteriorly, reopen the spaces between the lateral incisors and cuspidis that may have been closed, as well as intrusion of the maxillary incisors and posterior vertical elastics to aid in extrusion of the posterior teeth. The reopened spacing around the lateral incisors can be eliminated postorthodontically with bonding, veneers, or crowns on the

orly, extrude the incisors, and intrude the molars. This can cause premature contact of the incisors with subsequent end-on incisor relationship and development of posterior open bites

lateral incisors. TADs placed in the maxilla may provide a means to re-intrude the incisors to aid in closing the posterior open bites in conjunction with posterior vertical elastics [20, 21].

# Dental Arch Spacing

The correction of significant anterior tooth size discrepancies may require the creation of space in the upper arch between the lateral incisors and cuspid, and/or lateral incisors and central incisors to assure a good Class I occlusal fit with proper overjet/overbite relationship [9] (Fig. 60.24a). It is very important in the postsurgical patient management phase that the space is maintained for subsequent bonding, veneers, or crowns (Fig. 60.24b). DO NOT CLOSE THE SPACE! as this can result in malocclusion. A common post-surgery orthodontic practice is to close interdental spaces. This can create major occlusal problems by downward and backward retraction of the maxillary incisors resulting in an end-on incisor relationship, posterior open bites, downward and backward rotation of the mandible, increased stress on the TMJs, and pain. If this situation occurs where the spaces have been closed, the spaces need to be opened again with forward rotation of the incisors to improve the occlusal fit with subsequent restorative dentistry to eliminate the spaces with bonding, veneers, or crowns.

# Tooth Movement

Teeth move more rapidly for about the first 6 months post-surgery as compared to presurgery. Relative to tooth movement, the orthodontist can usually accomplish in 2 to 3 weeks post-surgery that took 2 to 3 months to achieve presurgery. This is because the bone metabo

lism and bone "turn-over" increases substantially after surgery allowing more rapid bone resorption and apposition in response to orthodontic forces, so the teeth move more quickly. In addition, with segmental maxillary surgery, the individual bone segments can also move some, providing increased flexibility of the teeth and bone segments.

# Finishing Orthodontics

It is important for the patient to keep the orthodontic appliances on for a minimum of 4 to 6 months postorthognathic surgery, when appropriate rigid fixation techniques are used, to allow for initial bone healing as well as finish aligning, leveling, and stabilizing the occlusion. It usually takes 4 months to complete the initial postsurgical bone healing phase to where the maxilla and mandible should be skeletally stable.(3,4) However, it takes a full year to complete the bone healing process. If inadequate rigid fixation was used or the maxillary bone was exceptionally thin, or uncontrolled clenching/bruxism is present, then orthodontic appliances may be required for a significantly extended time. The greater and more complex required surgical movements and presurgical orthodontic treatment mechanics, generally the longer the time requirements for the postsurgical orthodontic management. The orthodontist will determine when the occlusion is maximized, stabilized, and the patient is ready for debanding and retainers.

# Retainers

For patients who have undergone orthognathic surgery, rigid retainers (Hawley or wrap-around types) without occlusal coverage (Fig. 60.25a) are

proper overjet and overbite relationship. (b) It is very important in the postsurgical patient management phase that the spacing is maintained for subsequent bonding, veneers, or crowns

Fig. 60.25 (a, b) Hawley type retainers are recommended to provide post orthodontic retention for the maxillary and mandibular arches because of good transverse stability and occlusion interdigitation

![](images/8a675ef5774a44ebf55fc8639b2b36ffdae5c3db669cace47d6fded62ffab5e9.jpg)

recommended to provide transverse support to the width of the maxillary and mandibular dental arches, maintain the dental alignment, and allow for maximal interdigitation of the occlusion. Occlusal coverage retainers (e.g., Essex type retainers) (Fig. 60.26) should not be used because of vertical separation of the occlusion as this can create a malocclusion, usually with open bite situations anteriorly or posteriorly, unilaterally or bilaterally. In addition, occlusal coverage retainers are often flexible and do not provide adequate transverse stability resulting in transverse relapse in cases of surgical or orthodontic expansion or narrowing of the dental arches that can result in anterior open bite and posterior cross-bite relationships.

# 60.4.3Orthodontic Instability

Orthodontic instability and relapse can also cause changes and is particularly related to transverse or vertical relapse of the orthodontically expanded maxilla or unstable dental extrusions or intrusions. Transverse collapse of the maxillary dentition will usually cause posterior crossbites and dental interferences, as well as an anterior open bite. Transverse stability is paramount to provide predictable treatment outcomes. Also, inappropriate orthodontic closure of spaces created for correcting tooth size discrepancies is another orthodontic factor contributing to unwanted postsurgical occlusal changes. Performing careful stable orthodontics, providing good surgical results, no indiscriminate closing of spaces, and appropriate retention should prevent these

![](images/f522c84e36937db3d25f6fa3082a0107a71a683ee0cb71e27fdd4413016839ea.jpg)

Fig. 60.26 (a, b) Essix type retainers with occlusal coverage are not recommended for post surgery orthodontic retention related to poor transverse arch stability and greater risk of developing malocclusion including openbites

types of problems, providing that the TMJs are healthy and stable.

Postsurgical orthodontic patient management is a very important aspect of the treatment for providing optimal patient outcomes. Immediate postsurgical orthodontics should be approached aggressively to maximize high-quality occlusal results in the shortest time frame. However, orthodontic appliances should remain for a minimum of 4 to 6 months post-surgery to get through the primary bone healing phase. This will help minimize orthodontic and surgical relapse potential. Splints play an important role in providing stability for the segmentalized maxilla at surgery and post-surgery. Palatal splints can usually be maintained in position for 2-3 months or longer for large arch expansions.

# TMJ Effects on Stability

The TMJs are a vital component of orthognathic surgery but are often ignored. Failure to diagnose and properly treat preexisting TMJ conditions, or those that develop as a result of the orthognathic, can result in orthodontic and orthognathic surgery relapse, unsatisfactory results relative to functional and aesthetic outcomes, as well as development of pain and headaches. Proper management of TMJ pathology can provide highly predictable treatment outcomes with usual significant reduction in pain and improved jaw function [22-25].

# Key Points

Multiple segment maxillary osteotomies or mandibular osteotomies may require surgical stabilizing appliances inserted at surgery and maintained post-surgery for one to several months to maximize stability.  
Maxillary palatal splints are preferred over occlusal splints as they provide better transverse stability and can be maintained for a longer time period post-surgery if necessary.  
Postsurgical orthodontic management may require an aggressive interaction to maximize the occlusal fit and function.  
- Avoid power chains in the post-surgery orthodontic phase as they can create incisor extrusion, premature incisor contact, and posterior open bites.  
Use Hawley or wraparound type of appliances to stabilize the maxilla following removal of orthodontic appliances. Avoid the use of Essex type of retainers as they can create posterior open bites and transverse instability in segmental maxillary surgery.

# Conclusion

Pre- and post-surgery orthodontics play a vital role in producing predictable and stable outcomes. In the presurgical stage, it is important to perform stable orthodontic preparation, eliminating mechanics that are unstable and can contribute to poor occlusal and functional outcomes. Postsurgical orthodontics is usually straight forward directed to refinement and retention of the orthodontic and surgical result. However, postsurgery orthodontics if inappropriately performed, can turn a great surgical result into an undesirable outcome. On the other hand, a surgical result that is compromised may be salvaged by application of aggressive orthodontic mechanics. Preexisting TMJ disorders and pathologies are the most common causes of orthognathic surgery relapse. Orthodontists and surgeons must be cognizant of preexisting TMJ conditions and manage appropriately to assure a predictable and high-quality outcome.
