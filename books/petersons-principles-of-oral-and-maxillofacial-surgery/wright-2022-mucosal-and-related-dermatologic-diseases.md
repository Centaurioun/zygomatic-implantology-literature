# 38.1 Introduction

A myriad of conditions can cause inflammation of the oral mucosa (stomatitis). In general, these can be divided into those caused by pathogenic microorganisms (infectious stomatitis) and those not infectious in etiology (noninfectious stomatitis). Additionally, this chapter will address pigmented lesions, a common clinical manifestation of a variety of conditions.

# 38.2 Infectious Stomatitis

Infections of the oral mucosa are commonly encountered in clinical practice. In general, they can be divided into bacterial, viral, and fungal.

# 38.2.1 Bacterial Infections

# 38.2.1.1 Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is caused by an acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Approximately, a third of the world's population is infected, and the World Health Organization estimates just over 10 million new cases each year. In 2017, there were 9015 cases of tuberculosis reported in the United States, a decrease of  $1.6\%$  from the previous year. Only approximately  $13\%$  of these new cases were attributable to recent transmission. Most cases today in the United States are in immigrants and most represent reactivation of latent disease. TB was reported last year in all 50 states [1].

Oral involvement from TB is rare, and most often occurs secondary to pulmonary disease. Most frequently, oral lesions present as enlarging ulcers or periodontal involvement. The body reacts to the organism with granulomatous inflammation, and the granulomas are typically necrotizing. The organism can be identified with an acid-fast stain but false negative stains are com

mon, and identification can be facilitated by PCR amplification of the DNA of the organism. Effective multidrug protocols are available today for treatment.

# Key Points

Oral tuberculosis is rare, usually secondary to pulmonary disease and produces nonhealing areas of ulceration. The body reacts to the organism by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation.

# 38.2.1.2 Syphilis

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a bacteria Treponema palladium.

There are approximately 12 million worldwide cases of syphilis but it is listed as a "rare disease" by NIH, and there were 101,567 cases documented by the CDC in the United States in 2017 [2].

Undiagnosed syphilis characteristically evolves through three clinical stages. Patients initially develop primary syphilis through intimate physical contact with an infected person. The primary lesion is an ulcer or chancre which occurs at the site of inoculation. Most chanres occur genetically, but the oral cavity is the most common extragenital site affected. Chanres tend to be asymptomatic and most lesions heal without treatment within a couple months. Many patients then progress within months to secondary syphilis which is disseminated and characterized by constitutional symptoms and a generalized maculopapular rash of the skin, commonly affecting the palms and soles. Symptomatic whitish plaques develop intraorally and are known as mucous patches. These sometimes affect the commissures and are known as split papules. Occasionally, verrucous or papillary lesions develop in secondary syphilis and are known as condyloma lata. Secondary syphilis also spontaneously resolves within months. Patients then enter a latent period, and a small number evolve years later into tertiary syphilis. Tertiary syphilis significantly affects the systemic vasculature and CNS. Some patients develop large areas of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation known as gummatus necrosis or a gumma. The dorsal tongue may undergo atrophy with keratosis known as syphilitic glossitis.

Today syphilis is diagnosed by serology. FTA (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption) and hemagglutination assays are sensitive and relatively specific. The incidence of syphilis has markedly declined as the infection is amenable to antibiotic regimens, particularly benzathine penicillin G.

# Key Points

Syphilis is a venereal disease that typically progresses through three stages, each with characteristic oral findings.

Primary:Chancre (ulcer)

Secondary: Mucous patch

Tertiary: Gumm

# 38.2.1.3 Gonorrhea

Gonorrhea is a STD caused by the gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Worldwide approximately 60 million are affected. In the United States, incidence has decreased dramatically, due in part to a national gonorrhea control program, but 555,608 new cases were reported to the CDC in 2017 [3].

Like most STDs, infection occurs through direct contact and most signs and symptoms occur genetically. "Oral" involvement tends to affect the oropharynx which is characterized by pharyngitis, sometimes with pustules or ulcers. The diagnosis can be made from smears or culture, and uncomplicated infection responds well to a single dose of ceftriaxone  $125\mathrm{mg}$  IM [4].

# 38.2.2 Viral Infections

The most important viral infections of the oral mucosa belong to the herpesvirus family of DNA viruses. Most viral infections induce neutralizing antibodies and the immune system destroys the virus. The herpesviruses are somewhat unique in that once they enter the body, they

are not destroyed but they are characterized by latency where they remain dormant but have the ability to be reactivated, producing recurrent patterns of infection.

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV): HSV is ubiquitous, and most people are eventually exposed. It is important to note that patients do not need to be exposed to another person with active lesions to contract the infection, rather  $70\%$  of the population asymptotically shed HSV into their saliva periodically over time. At any given point in time, approximately  $6\%$  of healthy patients have HSV in their saliva by routine detection methods, and this number increases to  $30\%$  with PCR HSV DNA amplification. There are two serotypes of herpes simplex: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Type one causes predominantly oral disease and type two predominantly genital disease. With the increasing frequency of orogenital sex, crossover is common but the clinical manifestations of infection are not significantly altered by the type.

A small percentage, generally fewer than  $10\%$ , of initially exposed patients become clinically ill. Because these patients have no prior immunity, the primary infection is severe and the primary target is the oral cavity. This is known as primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. The primary infection is acute and explosive in its onset, characterized by a generalized and somewhat symmetrical stomatitis. Technically, the infection is vesiculobulous in nature but intact vesicles are rarely seen since the roof of the vesicles is very thin and invariably ruptures once formed. The resulting reaction is characterized by multiple individual superficial ulcers that are well marginated and tend to coalesce (Fig. 38.1a, b). Lesions can affect any mucosal surface, are very painful, and patients are invariably febrile with symptomatic adenopathy. The infection resolves spontaneously in 7-10 days but the pain, particularly in children, makes eating and drinking a problem, and dehydration can be a significant medical complicating factor.

Once exposed to HSV, whether the patient develops the primary infection or not, the virus is neurotrophic and travels up the trigeminal nerve to the ganglion where it remains latent. The virus has the ability to be reactivated and travels down the nerve to produce recurrent bouts of infection. Because the patient has been previously exposed to the virus and has some immunity, the recurrent or secondary infection tends to be milder and much more localized. In most instances, it affects the lips, most commonly at the junction of the vermilion and skin. Most patients have a prodrome burning or tingling sensation when viral replication begins. This results in small vesicles (Fig. 38.2) which quickly break, ultimately dry and crust, and heal without scarring in 7-10 days. This is known as recurrent herpes labialis or cold sores or fever blisters.

Much less commonly, there is a form of recurrent intraoral herpetic infection. In healthy patients, involvement is site-specific and tends to only affect masticatory mucosa or mucoperiosteum, hard palate, or attached gingiva. There may also be a prodrome with an outbreak of a cluster of multiple small well-marginated erosions or ulcers (Fig. 38.3). Intraoral outbreaks tend to be more painful but resolve spontaneously. Recurrent intraoral herpetic infection is often confused with aphthous ulcers, but aphthous ulcers occur almost exclusively on lining mucosa, not mucoperiosteum, and tend to be larger and fewer in number [5-9].

# Tips and Tricks

Recurrent herpetic infection can be distinguished from aphthous stomatitis by site specificity with HSV affecting mucoperiosteum intraorally or the external lip, often at the junction of the vermillion and skin. Aphthae affect lining mucosa only.

Fig. 38.3 Recurrent intraoral herpetic infection

The infection is communicable, and historically prior to the routine use of gloves and protective eyewear, occupational hazards for dentists were the development of herpetic conjunctivitis and recurrent infections of the hands (herpetic whitlow). It is important to remember that many dentists contract their infections from patients who asymptomatically excrete HSV into their saliva and not from actively infected patients [10].

The diagnosis of herpetic infections can generally be made on the clinical features alone. If doubt exists, however, culture is reliable but inefficient and the diagnosis can be confirmed by cytologic smear. The vesicles/ulcers should be scrapped with a blunt instrument like a tongue blade and spread on a glass slide. The cells must then be fixed before mailing to the laboratory. Commercially available fixatives can be purchased. Alternatively, a few drops of alcohol can be placed on the slide and allowed to air dry. Hair spray is usually a viable alternative to commercial fixatives. Virally infected keratinocytes are markedly enlarged (ballooning degeneration), and the nucleus will contain numerous eosinophilic viral inclusions giving the nucleus the appearance of multinucleation (  $\square$  Fig. 38.4).

Herpetic infections are self-limiting and often require no treatment, but effective antiviral therapy is available. Sunscreens can reduce the frequency of herpes labialis. The literature is mixed on the efficacy for topical antiviral therapy but for therapy to be effective, it must start at prodrome when viral replication is beginning. Topical acyclovir, penciclovir, and docosanol OTC are available. When treating topically, it is imperative for patients to be instructed to apply the medication with a covered finger in order to prevent herpetic whitlow. There is some evidence that topical penciclovir is superior to acyclovir. Efficacy is also proven for systemic antiviral therapy. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir have shown therapeutic benefit. Valacyclovir is metabolized into a

more bioavailable form of acyclovir and is effective at  $500\mathrm{mg}$ , bid for 5-7 days [11-13]. There is a tendency today for higher dosage, and shorter treatment and efficacy has been documented for valacyclovir  $2\mathrm{g}$  q12h PO for 1 day and famciclovir  $1500\mathrm{mg}$  PO as a single dose.

# Key Points

Herpetic infections are frequently seen in private practice. They typically have characteristic clinical features and can and should be managed with appropriate antiviral medications.

Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV): Initial infection with the VZV causes varicella or chickenpox which produces a generalized vesiculopapular eruption on the skin and occasionally oral mucosa. Chickenpox is self-limiting, but once infected, the virus is neurotrophic and travels up sensory nerves to remain latent in sensory ganglia. Reactivation causes herpes zoster or shingles, which is characterized by a vesicular eruption of the affected skin along the distribution of the nerve, characteristically stopping at the midline (Fig. 38.5). The eruption is painful, and most often affects the trunk, but trigeminal distribution is the second most frequent. Herpes zoster frequently affects the elderly or those immunocompromised. Herpes zoster of the external auditory canal with auditory symptoms and facial paralysis is known as James Ramsay Hunt syndrome. VZV infections, particularly of the maxilla, can cause pain simulating a toothache and the intrabony disease can devitalize teeth and cause bony necrosis. Following

Fig. 38.5 Herpes zoster of V5

an outbreak of VZV infection, about  $15\%$  of affected patients develop postherpetic neuralgia which causes persistent pain that usually resolves within a year but can persist longer. CDC recommends chickenpox vaccine for children but the vaccination is a live attenuated virus which can become latent. Accordingly, the CDC recommends Shingrix vaccination for those 50 or older.

Epstein Barr Virus (EBV): EBV is the cause of most cases of mononucleosis. Infection is typically through physical contact. Infection in young children tends to be asymptomatic, but in older children, teens, and young adults, it tends to produce pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and fever. Prodromal palatal petechiae are present in many patients. On CBC, patients have a leukocytosis because of significantly increased lymphocytes, many of which are cytologically atypical. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the Paul-Bunnell test which detects heterophil antibodies. More sophisticated immunofluorescent or ELISA tests are also available. Mononucleosis tends to be self-limiting. The virus has an affinity for B lymphocytes, and some variants of B cell lymphomas or leukemias are EBV-related, especially Burkitt's lymphoma. EBV has a close association with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in parts of

the world. EBV is the cause of hairy leukoplakia which is seen in immunocompromised patients, especially AIDS patients. It is characterized by white plaques on the lateral tongue bilaterally.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV tends to produce the most significant disease in neonates or those immunosuppressed. In immunocompetent patients, infection tends to be asymptomatic or produce mild flu-like symptoms. A variety of cells have receptors for CMV, including salivary gland ductal epithelium where viral inclusions produce the characteristic owl eye appearance histologically.

Coxsackievirus: Coxsackie viruses are enteroviruses which tend to produce epidemic outbreaks in children. The group A viruses produce herpangina, hand, foot and mouth disease and lymphonodular pharyngitis. There is significant clinical overlap among these infections, and they are not always caused by distinct strains of the virus. Herpangina is febrile and tends to produce flu-like symptoms with sore throat and pharyngitis characterized by erythema with vesicles and shallow ulcers. Similar outbreaks with involvement of the hands and feet are known as hand, foot and mouth disease. Other outbreaks produce hyperplasia of the small lymphoid aggregates in the palatal mucosa known as lymphonodular pharyngitis. Treatment tends to be symptomatic.

# 38.2.3 Fungal Infections

Most fungi are of relatively low virulence and tend to produce opportunistic infection when alterations of host or environment provide a favorable setting for fungal growth. In general, fungal infections can be divided into those that remain superficial and those that are deep.

# 38.2.3.1 Candidosis

Candidosis is the most common of all the intraoral fungal infections. Candidiasis is used synonymously but we prefer the term candidosis. Most disease is caused by  $C$  albicans, although other strains can be pathogenic in humans. Candidosis is usually not spread as a communicable disease. Candidal species can be cultured from the mouths of healthy patients approximately  $50\%$  of the time. The historical assumption was that the other  $50\%$  did not harbor the organism. With more sophisticated methods of identifying the fungus such as PCR, it has now been documented that almost all healthy patients harbor candidal species as a commensal organism as part of their normal oral flora. Candida are biphasic and exist in two forms. The yeast form is considered the nonpathogenic commensal, and the hyphae is pathogenic.

Because most patients normally harbor candidal species and because of its low virulence, it does not commonly produce disease in healthy patients. Rather, it is one of the prototypical opportunistic infections. Predisposing factors include age, denture wear, broad spectrum antibiotics, any condition or medication producing immunosuppression, xerostomia, diabetes, and any generally debilitating disease.

Candidosis tends to produce characteristic tissue changes which have led to clinical subclassifications of the infection but oftentimes there is clinical overlap among the patterns.

The most characteristic of all the clinical patterns is acute pseudomembranous candidosis. Because Candida tends to infect the surface of the mucosa, if the infection is sufficiently severe, it will produce necrosis of the superficial keratinocytes. Normally, these necrotic cells would desquamate but they are held together by the hyphae of the organism (Fig. 38.6). This produces a buildup of necrotic cells on the surface which appear white, and because they are necrotic, they can be scrapped off; hence pseudomembrane. The base of the pseudomembrane is erythematous representing the body's inflammatory reaction to the infection. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis is usually symptomatic and often generalized with the characteristic multiple slightly raised whitish curd-like plaques that scrape off (Fig. 38.7).

# Tips and Tricks

The most common and characteristic manifestation of candidosis is the pseudomembranous form because the superficial whitish plaques scrape off with lateral pressure.

Acute atrophic candidosis is a clinical variant that typically follows broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and is characterized only by erythema. It is usually

![](images/136c3b83a6babf285ce6c74f0b5d1feab49651d52ad61196845c2f0e3194dcc5.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 38.6 Pseudomembranous candidosis where the pseudomembranes consist of necrotic surface keratinocytes

symptomatic and often affects gingivae and produces tongue depapillation.

Two chronic forms of atrophic candidosis exist. The most common is limited to the denture-bearing tissues of maxillary denture wearers. This is known as chronic atrophic candidosis, denture stomatitis, or denture sore mouth, although patients can be asymptomatic. Patients invariably wear their dentures  $24\mathrm{h}$  a day, and the infection is limited to the tissues under the denture. With a good palatal seal, there is minimal salivary clearance under the denture. Additionally, it is dark, warm, and moist and an ideal environment for growth of the organism. This form rarely produces pseudomembranes, but only erythema as the host reacts to the growth of the organism (Fig. 38.8). Older texts discuss palatal erythema as an allergic reaction to the denture. While hypersensitivity to plastic has technically been documented, it is exceedingly rare, and currently, palatal erythema confined to the denture-bearing areas of the maxilla should be assumed to be candidosis until proved otherwise.

Fig. 38.8 Chronic atrophic candidosis

A second clinically distinct form of chronic atrophic candidosis is known as median rhomboid glossitis or central papillary atrophy. Originally speculated to be developmental, investigators were not able to find examples in large numbers of children examined. It is unknown why the middorsal tongue preferentially colonizes Candida but the organism can be recovered from the surface of the lesion in most patients. Lesions can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, located on the middorsal tongue and typically atrophic with or without redness (Fig. 38.9). They are sometimes firm on palpation and occasionally nodular [14, 15].

One of the rarest and most controversial forms of infection is chronic hyperplastic candidosis. This produces a thickened white plaque-like lesion that does not rub off (Fig. 38.10). It has a predilection for tongue and commissure. Because the lesions have no clinically distinguishing features, they are usually indistinguishable

![](images/4e05c50555f6d1d097a946a5b3837b3cf23c70c5c9a2ae2689b55fc95c57c7e5.jpg)

from leukoplakia. Accordingly, they are also known as candidal leukoplakia. The diagnosis can only be rendered following biopsy as they have unique histologic features characterized by epithelial hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and numerous yeasts and hyphae within the surface keratin. One of the controversies with this lesion is there is some evidence documenting that chronic hyperplastic candidosis should be considered a premalignant lesion since cases progressing to carcinoma are documented. It is known that Candida can secondarily colonize any mucosa that is metabolically altered, including routine leukoplakia and lichen planus. The difficulty lies with the pathologist's ability to distinguish chronic hyperplastic candidosis from a routine leukoplakia secondarily colonized by Candida. The candidal organism has been shown to be capable of inducing epithelial hyperplasia experimentally. The controversy is further fueled by the fact that not all cases of chronic hyperplastic candidosis respond to antifungal medication, and this is particularly true in those patients who continue to smoke [16].

Angular cheilitis is characterized by cracks and fissures at one or both commissures (Fig. 38.11). Many are symptomatic. In as many as  $80\%$  of cases, this is due to candidal infection, and it can be the only manifestation or it can occur with any of the intraoral forms of infection. Occasionally, it is due to bacteria, strep, or staph [17].

Mucocutaneous candidosis is a rare group of immunologic disorders, some with endocrinopathy, characterized by severe mucocutaneous candidosis affecting the mouth, skin, nails, and other mucosae.

The diagnosis of candidosis can generally be made from the clinical features alone, particularly if the predisposing factors can be identified. If uncertain, cytologic smear is the easiest and most efficient way to

![](images/b5855a08544a1e69e4bc9a902afb2b9e5d59c25ab44247f5a7679de52ba7f04b.jpg)  
Fig. 38.11 Angular cheilitis

confirm the diagnosis. Culture is usually not practical since half the population will be positive without having candidosis. Cytology has the added advantage of testing an area of clinically suspected infection and the ability to identify the organism in its pathogenic hyphal form (Fig. 38.12).

There are a variety of effective antifungal medications. Identification and correction of predisposing factors will facilitate efficacy. Nystatin oral suspension or pastilles are effective and relatively inexpensive. The pastilles have an objectionable taste to many. Nystatin works topically and can be expectorated or swallowed since it is very poorly absorbed from the GI tract and it has minimal side effects. Clotrimazole is available in a  $10\mathrm{mg}$  troche which can be dissolved slowly in the mouth five times daily. Ketoconazole  $100\mathrm{mg}$  tabs have been available since the 1970s but hepatotoxicity and life-threatening side effects with terfenadine, astemizole, and cisapride have been reported. Fluconazole  $100\mathrm{mg}$  tabs have been shown to be more effective than ketoconazole at a dosage of two Tables  $(200\mathrm{mg})$  initially and then one Table  $(100\mathrm{mg})$  daily. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported as a serious side effect when given to patients taking one of the cholesterol-lowering statins. Itraconazole and amphotericin B are available as oral suspensions [18].

# Key Points

Candidosis is the most common intraoral fungal infection seen in practice. It can produce white plaques that rub off, white plaques that do not rub off, erythematous mucosa and angular cheilitis.

# 38.2.3.2 Deep Fungal Infections

Deep fungal infections include histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, and zygomycosis. These produce ulcerative granulomatous

![](images/40ec1ea6de1006a7dbb542fab31e46917b56b19284f28edfd712e4b7b7970d07.jpg)

lesions but are sufficiently rare to preclude detailed discussion. Histoplasmosis is the most common and is seen histologically as small, round intracellular spores within phagocytic macrophages. Cryptococcosis is usually seen in a setting of immunosuppression, particularly AIDS. Mucormycosis, one of the zygomycosis, is a particularly invasive and destructive infection that tends to affect the sinonasal mucosa in immunosuppressed or diabetic patients.

# 38.3 Noninfectious Stomatitis

Noninfectious stomatitis is a group of immunological disorders affecting the oral cavity. Many of them are mucocutaneous diseases which affects skin, oral mucosa, and mucosa of other anatomic sites such as conjunctiva, genital mucosa.

# 38.3.1 Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (Recurrent Aphthous Ulcerations; Canker Sores)

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is an immunological disorder causing recurrent single or multiple ulcers in the oral cavity.

RAS is one of the most common oral mucosal diseases, and it affects about  $20\%$  of the general population [19]. The word "aphtha" means ulceration. RAS is characterized by recurrent single or multiple ulcers that are covered by a yellow-white fibrinous exudate and surrounded by an erythematous halo (Fig. 38.13). RAS typically

![](images/5b2a3bc69896633c7991b331f73a36e7209d01e8d69fe7462213f88382702e8f.jpg)  
Fig. 38.13 Aphthous ulcer

affects nonkeratinized oral mucosa and rarely found in gingiva, palate, dorsal tongue, or vermilion border of lips. The onset of RAS is usually during childhood, especially in adolescence.

RAS appears to be a T-cell-mediated immunologic disorder [20]. Although the cause for RAS is still unknown, several factors have been implicated. These factors include genetic predisposition (HLA-B12, B51 and Cw7), nutritional deficiencies, immunologic diseases (cyclic neutropenia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), hormonal influences, infectious agents (L form of streptococci), trauma, stress, and food allergies.

Based on clinical features, RAS is classified into three different types: minor, major, and herpetiform aphthous ulcers. Major/minor apthae represent a spectrum of severity. Minor aphthous ulcer is the most common form of RAS. Patients often experience prodromal symptoms of burning, itching, or stinging with the development of one or more erythematous macules. The macules then develop into round- to oval-shaped ulcers, without vesicle formation. The ulcers are typically  $3 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter. They are present most often on buccal and labial mucosa, followed by ventral tongue, mucobuccal fold, floor of mouth and soft palate, and rarely affect mucoperiosteum. Major aphthae are larger, deeper, last longer, and have a strong tendency to affect the posterior part of the mouth, especially soft palate, pharyngeal wall, or tonsillar fauces. Herpetiform aphthous ulcers are the least common type and consist of numerous small  $(1 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter) ulcers which may coalesce into large irregular ulcers, resembling herpes viral infection. However, herpetiform aphthae usually occur on movable mucosa.

Occasionally, atypical presentations of what appear to be RAS occur secondarily to systemic diseases. The systemic diseases that have been reported to be associated with RAS include: Behçet's syndrome, nutritional deficiencies (folate, zinc, iron, and vitamin B deficiency), immunocompromised conditions (IgA deficiency, cyclic neutropenia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, MAGIC syndrome (mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage), PFAPA syndrome (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), Reiter's syndrome, Sweet syndrome, and ulcus vulvae acutum.

The diagnosis of RAS is usually made by clinical history and presentation. No laboratory test provides a definitive diagnosis. The histological features for RAS are not specific. A biopsy is not necessary unless exclusion of other similar ulcerative diseases that are in diagnostic consideration is desired.

There is no standard management for RAS, and the therapeutic goal is to reduce pain and facilitate

healing. Numerous therapies have been used for treating RAS. Most patients with RAS can be managed by mouthwashes (sodium bicarbonate in water, chlorhexidine, or benzylamine) or topical application of corticosteroids (fluocinonide, betamethasone, or clobetasol propionate gel). For ulcers not responding to topical treatment, systemic corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents, such as dapsone, azathioprine, levamisole, may be used. It also may be helpful to investigate possible triggering factors. For adult patients who suddenly develop persistent aphthous-appearing ulcers, it is essential to consider the possible association with underlying systemic disorders.

# Tips

RAS typically affects nonkeratinized oral mucosa, in contrast to recurrent herpes infection which affects keratinized mucosa.

# 38.3.2 Erythema Migrans (Geographic Tongue; Benign Migratory Glossitis: Wandering Rash of the Tongue: Erythema Areata Migrans: Stomatitis Areata Migrans)

Erythema migrans is a common inflammatory condition that primarily affects the tongue. The etiology is still unknown. It occurs in  $1 - 3\%$  of the population and appears to affect females more often than males by a 2:1 ratio [21].

Clinically, erythema migrans is characterized by multiple well-demarcated red areas surrounded at least partially by a slightly raised, yellow-white, scalloped border (Fig. 38.14a, b). The lesions most often occur on the dorsal and lateral borders of the tongue. They typically appear quickly in one area, heal in a few days, and then develop in a different area. Most patients are asymptomatic, although some patients may complain of a burning sensation when eating hot or spicy food. Severe or constant soreness is rarely associated with erythema migrans.

The diagnosis of erythema migrans is based on the typical clinical presentation and history. Biopsy is not necessary.

For asymptomatic lesions, no treatment is needed and patients should be assured that the condition is innocuous. For patients who experience burning sensation or soreness, topical corticosteroids may be used.

The diagnosis of erythema migrans is based on the typical clinical presentation and history, and biopsy is not necessary.

# 38.3.3 Oral Lichen Planus

Oral lichen planus is defined as lichen planus (LP) affecting the oral cavity.

LP is a chronic, T-cell-mediated immunological disorder that mostly affects the skin and mucosa. It affects mostly middle-aged adults, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:2 [22]. The skin lesions of LP are typically described as purple, pruritic, and polygonal papules which often occur on the flexor surfaces of the extremities. The surface of the papules characteristically shows a fine, lace-like network of white lines called Wickham's striae. Besides the skin, sites of involvement

include the glans penis, the vulvar mucosa and the nails, as well as the oral cavity.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is one of the most common oral mucosal diseases, and affects approximately 0.1-  $2.2\%$  of the population [22]. It is characterized by multifocality which presents in five different forms: reticular, erosive (ulcerative), plaque-like, bullous, and papular, but individual patients can have multiple forms, either synchronously or over time. The reticular form is the most characteristic and appears as a network of lacy, white striations, occurs most often bilaterally in the buccal mucosa and is usually asymptomatic (Fig. 38.15). The erosive form is usually symptomatic and presents as generalized erythema or ulceration and commonly affects gingiva, a condition described as desquamative gingivitis (see Autoimmune blistering diseases) (Fig. 38.15b, c). The plaque-like form presents as white, non-wipeable plaques which may be associated

with redness (Fig. 38.15d) and commonly affects dorsal tongue. The bullous form appears as fluid-containing vesicles but is exceedingly rare. The papular form presents as numerous small white papules which may coalesce to form the reticular form. The symptoms of OLP typically wax and wane over time, and it is not uncommon for patients to present with more than one of these clinical forms.

Histologically, OLP is characterized by a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial lamina propria, exocytosis, hydropic degeneration in the basal cells of the epithelium, and thickening and dissolution of the basement membrane. Apoptotic basal keratinocytes presenting as colloid bodies (hyaline or Civatte bodies) may be seen.

Diagnosis of OLP requires clinic-pathologic correlation, and a biopsy is required [23]. Sometimes, if a

patient shows variations in clinical appearance, biopsies of multiple sites may be considered for adequate sampling. As many as nine other oral mucosal diseases can mimic OLP clinically and/or histopathologically, including oral lichenoid drug reactions (OLDR), oral lichenoid contact hypersensitivity reaction (OLCHR), lupus erythematosus (LE), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV), chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CUS), lichen planus pemphigoides, and proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL). PVL is a subset of leukoplakia that is associated with higher malignant transformation rate than that found in leukoplakia without verrucous surface change. It is often associated with a lichenoid pattern on histopathology, and the verrucous architectural change may not be prominent in its early stage. Distinction of these diseases from OLP requires clinical correlation, direct immunofluorescent study, and/or long-term follow up, in addition to a biopsy for histopathologic evaluation. In order to achieve an accurate diagnosis, the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology (AAOMP) proposed a set of diagnostic criteria which included both clinical and histopathologic elements (Table 38.1) [23]. Clinical correlation is essential for the diagnosis of OLP. To assure that all pertinent clinical information is included for oral pathologists to evaluate biopsy material and rule out other OLP mimics, a clinical checklist was also recommended (Table 38.2).

The etiology of OLP is essentially unknown, although stress, dental materials, medications, food allergens, hepatitis C or chronic liver diseases, and autoimmunity have been suggested as causes or contributors to the onset. Because the cause is still unclear, there is currently no cure, and the goal of management is for symptomatic relief. For asymptomatic reticular lesions, no treatment is needed. For patients with symptomatic lesions, topical corticosteroids such as fluocinonide, betamethasone, or clobetasol gel are usually sufficient for controlling symptoms and initiating the healing process. Oral candidiasis is a common complication of topical steroid usage, and during treatment the patient should be monitored for this possible side effect. Other topical therapies such as locally injected or systemic corticosteroids, doxycycline, topical retinoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors; tacrolimus; pimecrolimus; cyclosporine; methotrexate; psoralen-UVA; photodynamic therapy and biological agents (e.g., efalizumab, rituximab) are also occasionally used for persistent erosive lesions.

The question of whether or not OLP is premalignant is controversial and unresolved. Findings from several clinical studies have suggested that patients with OLP

meta-analysis study [24, 25]. However, research on several surrogate end points did not show convincing or consistent evidence of malignant potential as demonstrated in epithelial dysplasia. This issue is also complicated by the fact that a lichenoid chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate can sometimes be seen in epithelial dysplasia as a host reaction to the atypical epithelial cells, and it may not be distinguishable histologically from OLP, especially in early stage of proliferative verrucous leukoplakia [26, 27]. Many authors believe that some of the reported cases of malignant transformation were not true OLP but rather misdiagnosed dysplastic leukoplakias with a secondary lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate.

For the possible increased risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma, continued clinical follow-up for all OLP patients at least once a year even when the lesions are asymptomatic has been recommended [28]. Clinical follow-up has also been emphasized in the diagnostic process of OLP, because that some OLP mimics, such as CUS, LPP, and early-stage of PVL, may not be able to be diagnosed based on one initial biopsy. However, these diseases can manifest with time, and an additional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence study and/or his

topathological evaluation may be necessary in order to reach a final diagnosis [23].

# Key Points

- OLP is a multifocal disease process in the oral cavity and often shows bilateral involvement.  
At least nine other oral diseases can look like OLP clinically and/or histologically, which can create difficulty in diagnosis in some cases.  
Diagnosis of OLP requires histopathologic correlation.  
- Continued clinically follow-up is needed, even when the patient is asymptomatic.

# 38.3.4 Oral Lichenoid Drug Reaction and Oral Lichenoid Contact Hypersensitivity Reaction

Oral lichenoid drug reaction (OLDR) is a drug side effect causing lichenoid lesions in the oral cavity.

Oral lichenoid contact hypersensitivity reaction (OLCHR) is a topical allergic reaction in which lichenoid lesion(s) develop at the oral mucosa in direct contact with the eliciting agent.

Some local and systemic conditions are known to induce lichenoid reactions that are similar to lesions seen in OLP, clinically and histologically. OLDR refers to oral lichenoid reaction caused by certain medications, and OLCHR represents allergic reaction to some dental materials or cinnamic aldehyde, a flavoring agent in food or dental hygiene products. There is no reliable histological features to differentiate OLDR and OLCHR from OLP, and the differentiation is based on clinical correlation [23].

Numerous medications have been reported to induce OLDR (Table 38.3) [29-31]. The most common medications that may elicit OLDR are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and gold salts. Although OLDR can be indistinguishable from OLP, it tends to be predominantly ulcerative and may occur at sites not frequently affected by OLP, such as the ventral tongue. The possibility of OLDR should be considered when there is a correlation between the onset of the oral lesions and the administration of a new medication. Consultation with the patient's physician(s) is required to see if a suitable alternative drug can be used on a trial basis to confirm the diagnosis.

OLCHR can be caused by many different dental restorative materials as well as cinnamon-containing products [32]. Amalgam is the most common dental material associated with OLCHR, although gold and palladium chloride have also been reported as causes. If the lichenoid lesions occur only on the mucosa adjacent to dental restorations, hypersensitivity should be considered as a possibility, as removal of the offending dental materials results in remission of the oral lesions in  $50 - 90\%$  of such cases. Questions about the patient's consumption of cinnamon-containing products, such as chewing gum, soft drinks, mints, or tartar-control toothpaste, should be asked for all patients with oral lichenoid lesions.

# Key Points

There are no reliable histological features differentiating OLDR and OLCHR from OLP, and the diagnosis of these two conditions requires clinical correlation.

# 38.3.5 Lupus Erythematosus

Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple organ systems and characterized by photosensitive skin rashes.

LE is a fairly common autoimmune disease that affects more than 1.5 million people in the United States [33]. Based on clinical features, LE is classified into three forms: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), discoid (chronic) lupus erythematosus (DLE), and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE).

SLE predominantly affects females between 15 and 40 years of age. SLE affects multiple organ systems such as skin, oral cavity, heart, joint, lung, central nervous system, and kidney. The patients usually experience fever, malaise, weight loss combined with arthritis and skin rash. The characteristic butterfly-shaped rash on the malar skin and nose occurs in about half of the cases. Photosensitivity is typically described for the skin lesions. Pericarditis is the most common finding when SLE affects the heart. Kidney involvement (glomerulonephritis) occurs in about  $40 - 50\%$  of SLE patients and is the most serious complication, as it may lead to kidney failure and death. Oral lesions develop in  $9 - 45\%$  SLE patients. They appear as erythematous, hyperkeratotic, ulcerative, or lichenoid lesions. The oral lesions are often found in the buccal mucosa, palate, and vermilion border of lower lips (lupus cheilitis).

DLE is a less aggressive form of LE, and it typically involves only skin and oral mucosa. Patients with DLE usually have no systemic symptoms or signs. The skin lesions are often on the face and scalp, and they usually heal with scarring and hypo- or hyper-pigmentation. Approximately  $3 - 20\%$  of DLE patients develop oral lesions. Similar to SLE, the oral lesions of DLE appear lichenoid, and may be indistinguishable from erosive lichen planus clinically. However, oral lesions of both DLE and SLE are rarely seen without the presence of the skin lesions.

SCLE presents with clinical features intermediate between SLE and DLE.

Many medications can induce a lupus-like reaction known as drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) [34].

DILE shows clinical and serological findings similar to idiopathic LE. However, it resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug. Many medications have been reported to be associated with DILE, especially the antihypertensive drugs (thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors,  $\beta$ -blockers). Other medications that can induce DILE include piroxicam, neproxene, terbinafine, griseofulvin, bupropion, tamoxifen, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, infliximab, etanercept, efalizumab, and adalimumab.

The diagnosis of LE is based on clinical, histological, serological, and immunological findings. The histological features of the oral lesions of LE show hyperkeratosis, degeneration of the basal cells, and a lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper lamina propria. These features are also seen in OLP and can be indistinguishable from OLP. However, LE lesions tend to have prominent subepithelial edema, a diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrate that often shows a perivascular pattern, and patchy deposition of a periodic-acid Schiff (PAS)-positive material in the basement membrane zone. Direct immunofluorescent study (DIF) can differential LE from OLP, and the lesional tissue demonstrates shaggy or granular deposition of immunoglobulins (most often IgG and IgM) and/or C3 at the basement membrane zone. The lupus band test is the DIF of normal-appearing skin tissue, and it shows positive staining of IgG, IgM, and/or complement deposition for most LE patients. However, a positive lupus band test is not specific, as the same finding can also be seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. Serological titres for serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) is a sensitive diagnostic test for SLE. More than  $90\%$  of SLE patients are positive with the ANA test. However, the ANA test is not specific for SLE, as the positive ANA finding can also be seen in patients with other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome. The anti-double-stranded DNA antibody test is a more specific test for SLE and a positive result is found in about  $70\%$  of SLE patients.

Depending on severity, the management for SLE includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prednisone, and/or other immunosuppressants. Antimalarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, or sulfones are also sometimes used. Patients should be advised to avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. The prognosis for SLE varies depending on the organs involved. Renal failure is the most common cause of death. The treatment for DLE is usually topical corticosteroids and the prognosis is usually good.

# Key Points

Oral lesions of LE are rarely seen without the presence of the skin lesions.

# 38.3.6 Graft Versus Host Disease

Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a complication that develops in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients [35]. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant has been used increasingly in recent years for treating hematological disorders such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and disseminated metastatic disease. Although the major histocompatibility loci are matched between the donor and the recipient, differences still may exist in the minor histocompatibility loci. These differences can trigger an immune response by the transplanted donor hematopoietic stem cells, causing them to attack the host cells and tissues, resulting in host tissue damage and organ failure.

The severity of GVHD varies and appears to be influenced by several factors. Patients who have a better match in histocompatibility loci, have received umbilical cord blood, are younger and are female tend to have milder disease. The clinical signs of GVHD also vary, depending on the organs involved and whether it has an acute or chronic onset. Traditionally, the distinction between acute and chronic GVHD is based on whether the onset of the disease is within 100 days after the bone marrow transplant. The new guideline, recommended by the National Institute of Health and based on studies conducted in 2004 and 2005, emphasizes the clinical manifestations rather than time of onset [36]. Oral involvement is seen in about half those with acute GVHD and between  $72\%$  and  $83\%$  of chronic GVHD.

In the oral cavity, the graft vs. host response can damage both oral mucosa and minor salivary glands [37]. The oral manifestations of GVHD are similar to those seen in OLP, with diffuse symptomatic erythema with white striations, plaques/papules, and ulceration (Fig. 38.16). The tongue, buccal mucosa, and labial mucosa are the common sites for these lichenoid lesions. Xerostomia is also a common complaint of the patients.

The diagnosis of GVHD is often based on clinical findings. When the clinical presentation is not typical, biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Histologically, GVHD shows features similar to OLP.

It is known that patients with allogeneic bone marrow transplants have a higher risk for developing malignant neoplasms. Most of these malignancies are

![](images/ff6b7cfdb4be9c715f87e5b66759477f5237fe85befb90ad6e16f351079658ac.jpg)  
Fig. 38.16 Graft versus host disease

hematologic neoplasms. However, the incidence of solid tumors such as oral carcinomas is also slightly increased in this group of patients [38]. Therefore, for oral lesions that do not show lichenoid features, a biopsy is necessary to exclude the possibility of malignant or premalignant changes.

The management of oral lesions of GVHD is similar to the management of the oral lesions in autoimmune diseases. The goal is to achieve symptomatic relief, with topical corticosteroids and topical anesthetic agents being the most commonly used treatments. Topical tacrolimus has been reported to be effective for treating oral ulcerations caused by GVHD. Close follow-up for possible development of oral candidiasis is required. If significant xerostomia is present, topical fluoride should be prescribed, and oral hygiene should be emphasized for preventing development of caries. Pilocarpine and cevimeline also have been used to stimulate salivary flow.

The prognosis of GVHD mainly depends on whether the condition can be controlled. The survival rate has varied from  $15\%$  to  $70\%$  at 6 years after transplantation.

# Key Points

If multiple oral lichenoid lesions are found in patients with a history of GVHD, these lesions most likely represent oral manifestation of GVHD but not OLP.

# 38.3.7 Chronic Ulcerative Stomatitis

Chronic Ulcerative Stomatitis (CUS) is an immunological disorder that affects mainly the oral mucosa and occasionally the skin [21]. It was first described by Jaremco et al. [39] in 1990. Both the clinical and the histological features of CUS are indistinguishable from those seen in OLP. The definitive diagnosis of CUS requires a DIF, and it is very possible that CUS may be misdiagnosed as OLP if DIF is not performed [40]. However, differentia

tion of CUS from OLP is important, because CUS typically does not respond to topical or systemic corticosteroid as well as OLP does, but often can be effectively managed by hydroxychloroquine. Although it may not be financially feasible to perform a DIF on every patient showing clinical features of OLP, this test should be considered for persistent erosive OLP that does not respond well to topical corticosteroid therapy.

The DIF is essential for the diagnosis of CUS, and it reveals autoantibodies, mostly IgG, in the nuclei of the basal and parabasal keratinocytes. These stratified epithelial-specific antinuclear antibodies (SES-ANA) are directed against a  $70\mathrm{~kd}$  nuclear protein,  $\Delta \mathrm{Np}63\alpha$ , an isoform of p63 [41, 42]. These SES-ANA are also present in the patient's serum and contribute to a positive indirect immunofluorescent study (IIF) result.

Hydroxychloroquine has been reported to be the most effective medication for CUS. However, this medication has significant potential side effects such as retinopathy, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and neuromyopathy. Therefore, close follow-up to monitor for retinopathy and periodic hematologic evaluation during therapy are necessary.

# 38.3.7.1 Pemphigus Vulgaris

Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases, and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is the most common disease in this group.

The term pemphigus is derived from the Greek word Pemphix which means bubble or blister.

Pemphigus is characterized by blister formation in skin and/or mucosa. It is further classified into six subtypes: pemphigus vulgaris (PV), pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus herpetiformis, IgA pemphigus, and paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) [43]. PV is the most common. The term vulgaris is Latin which means common. Among these six subtypes, PV and PNP are especially important for oral health care providers because these two types frequently affect the oral cavity, and often oral lesions are the earliest clinical manifestation of the disease.

PV is a rare, potentially life-threatening disease with an incidence of about 0.1-0.5 cases per 100,000 people per year [44]. Although all ages can be affected, PV occurs most often in middle-aged individuals. Both sexes are affected equally.

The pathogenesis of PV is known to be due to the production of autoantibodies targeted to desmoglein 1 and 3, the transmembrane proteins that are responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion among squamous epithelial

cells. Once these proteins are damaged, the cell-to-cell adhesion is lost and the epithelial cells fall apart, which results in epithelial separation and blister formation.

A subset of PV patients develops mucosal dominant PV, in which mucosal lesions develop without skin involvement. These patients are found to have developed autoantibodies primarily targeted to desmoglein 3. On the other hand, patients who develop autoantibodies against both desmoglein 3 and 1 tend to have widespread skin and mucosal lesions, and show more severe disease activity.

Although the pathogenesis is known, the exact cause or triggering factor for PV is still unclear. Genetic predisposition, diet, medications, and other environmental factors have been suggested to play a role. Several medications have been reported to induce pemphigus-like drug reactions. These medications include penicillamine, rifampicin, diclofenac, phenol drugs, and ACE inhibitors such as captopril.

PV can affect essentially all mucosa – including oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal, ocular, nasal and anal and genital mucosa. However, it affects oral mucosa most often and sometimes can be the only sign of the disease [21]. More than  $50\%$  of PV patients have oral lesions before the development of skin lesions. Clinically, it often presents as multiple erosions and ulcerations in the oral cavity. Sloughing tissue may be seen. Because the damage to the adhesion proteins is within the epithelium, the blisters are often ruptured easily and are rarely observed clinically. Orally, the palate, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, and gingiva are most often affected. When PV affects the gingiva, it often presents as desquamative gingivitis (Fig. 38.17a). The skin lesions usually appear as vesicles that soon rupture to leave a red denuded surface (Fig. 38.17b). Severe cases can be fatal where large areas of skin slough result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and secondary infection.

The diagnosis of PV is based on histological and DIF findings. Histologically, PV is characterized by suprabasilar epithelial separation, where the amount of desmoglein 3 is most abundant. The spinous cells adjacent to this separation often appear to fall apart and become round in shape, a process called acantholysis. The histological findings are confirmed by DIF, which shows IgG, IgM, and complement C3 deposited in the intercellular spaces among the epithelial cells. IIF is sometimes used to measure the titer of the patient's circulating autoantibodies, which is typically correlated with disease severity and can be used for monitoring therapeutic results.

Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention play a pivotal role in prognosis, as control of the disease is easier to achieve. The treatment is typically systemic corticosteroids (prednisone), which may or may not be

combined with other immunosuppressant agents, such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, or intravenous immunoglobulin [21, 45]. Rituximab has also been reported to be effective for patients whose disease had not responded to prednisone or patients who could not tolerate it [46]. Topical corticosteroids are often used for treating oral lesions. PV is usually managed by physicians who are experienced in treating it, as long-term corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy may be needed, with required monitoring for systemic side effects. Before the development of corticosteroid therapy, the mortality rate for PV was  $60 - 90\%$ . With modern therapies, the mortality rate has been dramatically improved and is reported to be  $10\%$  or less.

# Key Points

Most PV patients have oral lesions before the development of skin lesions, and early diagnosis plays an important role in prognosis.

# 38.3.7.2 Paraneoplastic Pemphigus

Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a rare subtype of pemphigus that is associated with an underlying malignant neoplasm.

PNP is most often associated with a lymphoid neoplasm or lymphoproliferative disorder, such as Castleman disease, although thymoma and some solid tumors have also been reported [21]. Although the pathogenesis is not totally known, it is believed to represent an autoimmune reaction of the patient, with autoantibodies generated targeting tumor antigens that cross-react with adhesion molecules in the epithelium and at the basement membrane zone. The patients develop autoantibodies not only to desmoglein 1 and 3 but also to the plakin family proteins, including desmoplakins, desmocollins, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BP230), plectin, enoplakin, and periplakin [43]. A protease inhibitor  $\alpha 2$ -macroglobulin-like 1 was also found to be an autoantigen in PNP patients [47, 48]. The involvement of multiple autoantigens contributes to the various clinical, histological, and DIF findings.

PNP typically develops in patients with a history of a previous malignancy. However, about one third of the reported cases have shown clinical symptoms and signs of PNP before the underlying malignancy was diagnosed. Clinically, PNP can present as multiple blisters in skin and mucosa [21]. In some patients, the skin lesions appear papular and pruritic, resembling skin lichen planus lesions. Involvement of mucous membranes is a dominant feature in all reported cases. The oral cavity is frequently involved, with the lesions appearing as widespread erosions and irregular ulcers. Lesions also may be found in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Bloody crusting is often seen on the vermilion border of lips, a feature resembling erythema multiforme (EM). About  $70\%$  of the patients have conjunctival lesions which result in scar formation, a feature resembling mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP). Involvement of vaginal and anogenital mucosa is also seen.

The diagnosis of PNP is based on clinical, histological, DIF, IIF, and immunoprecipitation findings. Histologically, PNP shows lichenoid mucositis, acantholysis, and both intraepithelial and subepithelial separation. DIF shows intraepithelial and/or basement membrane zone deposition of IgG and C3. The standard protocol of IIF for PNP requires using rat bladder epithelium as the substrate, and it shows a unique pattern of intercellular staining. Immunoprecipitation is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing PNP,

and it shows the presence of autoantibodies to the autoantigens mentioned earlier.

The treatment of PNP typically starts with systemic corticosteroids, and may combine with other immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and ciclosporin [49]. Rituximab, ibrutinib, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, alemtuzumab, and daclizumab have been used with some success [49, 50].

The prognosis depends on the underlying malignancy/neoplasm and is typically poor, with a mortality rate about  $75 - 90\%$  [43]. The lesions of PNP may initially respond to immunosuppressant agents which often contribute to the progression of the malignant neoplasm. The patients often die of complications of blistering (secondary infection or bronchiolitis obliterans), complications of immunosuppressant treatment, or the progression of the malignancy [43].

# 38.3.7.3 Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid (Cicatricial Pemphigoid)

Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is an autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by predominant mucosal involvement and scar formation.

MMP is a type of pemphigoid diseases, which are a group of autoimmune blistering diseases with target antigens located at the basement membrane zone of skin and mucosa [51]. MMP is characterized by chronic vesiculobullous eruptions, predominantly on mucous membranes but occasionally on skin [21]. "Cicatricial" is derived from the Latin word cicatrix which means "scar," because the disease is characterized by scar formation after the blisters heal, but oral scarring is rare. MMP can affect any mucous membrane and may cause serious complications, such as blindness and stenosis.

MMP typically occurs in elderly people with an average age of 60 years. It affects females more often than males. The oral cavity is the most common site for MMP, accounting for  $83 - 100\%$  of the MMP cases reported. The oral cavity is also often the site of onset and the only manifestation of the disease (oral pemphigoid). MMP usually begins with vesicles or bullae that subsequently rupture, resulting in ulceration or erosion. Although MMP is characterized by scar formation after blisters or erosive lesions are healed, scaring is less common for oral lesions. MMP can affect any oral site but gingiva is affected most often, accounting for more than  $90\%$  of the oral cases. Desquamative gingivitis is a very common oral presentation for MMP (Fig. 38.18).

![](images/389adc1893f4b1858194134816de6dbe0e89c62f900aa97f5133b4ce62582a71.jpg)  
Fig. 38.18 Mucous membrane pemphigoid as desquamative gingivitis

Certain medications can induce a drug related form of pemphigoid [52]. Several medications, such as lisinopril, methyldopa, D-penicillamine and indomethacin, have been reported to induce MMP with oral lesions [53]. Other medications, including practolol, clonidine, sulfadoxine, and topical agents such as echothiophate iodide, pilocarpine, demecarium bromide and glaucoma medication, have also been reported to induce ocular, vulval, or anal MMP.

The pathogenesis of MMP is found to be autoantibodies targeted to the various proteins in the basement membrane zone. These autoantigens include BP180, BP230,  $\alpha 6\beta 4$  integrin, laminin 332, and laminin 311 [51]. BP180 is the predominant autoantigen found in patients with MMP. These proteins are responsible for the adhesion of the epithelium to the underlying connective tissue. Once the proteins are damaged by the autoimmune response, the adhesion weakens, causing the epithelium to separate from the underlying lamina propria, which leads to blistering.

The diagnosis of MMP is based on histological and DIF findings. The histological features of MMP show chronically inflamed mucosa and sub-basilar epithelial separation at the basement membrane zone. The DIF is essential for confirming the diagnosis, and it shows a linear deposition of immunoglobulins (primarily IgG; less commonly IgM and IgA) and C3 in the basement membrane zone.

There is no generally accepted treatment for MMP and the goal is symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids are often used to control localized MMP, such as oral pemphigoid. Systemic corticosteroids and other medications such as dapsone, cyclophosphamide, and tetracycline or minocycline combined with niacinamide have been used for more severe cases [21]. As the most serious complication of MMP is blindness, all patients

should be referred to ophthalmologists for evaluation once the diagnosis is established.

The prognosis of MMP varies. Some patients may have limited disease and no scarring. Others have significant scarring that impairs the function of the affected organs. Although MMP is a chronic incurable disease, it is rarely fatal. The prognosis for oral pemphigoid is usually good.

# 38.3.7.4 Bullous Pemphigoid

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a pemphigoid disease that primarily affects skin but rarely mucosa [21, 51]. It typically affects the elderly and oral involvement has been reported in  $8 - 39\%$  of the cases. The oral lesions are indistinguishable from MMP.

The pathogenesis of BP is similar to that of MMP except that patients with BP develop autoantibodies against only BP230 and BP180, with BP230 being the predominant autoantigen.

The diagnosis of BP is based on clinical, histological, and DIF findings. Treatment approach is similar to MMP, with topical steroid therapy for mild or localized lesions and systemic immunosuppressant therapy for severe cases. The prognosis is usually good [21].

# 38.3.7.5 Lichen Planus Pemphigoides

Lichen planus pemphigoides (LPP) is a member of pemphigoid family that shows clinical and histopathological features of both lichen planus and pemphigoid (MMP and BP).

LPP is a mucocutaneous blistering disease and always arises in the background of lichen planus [51, 54]. The time from development of lichen planus lesions to vesiculobullous lesions of LPP varies from concomitant to 17 years [55], with a mean duration of 8.3 months [54]. The onset of LPP in some cases has been linked to medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins), Chinese herbal medicine, psoralen-ultraviolet A therapy, and viral infection (varicella zoster virus) [54, 56-62]. Association with internal malignancies also has been reported [63].

LPP occurs most often between the fifth and sixth decades, and the male-to-female ratio is 4:5 [54]. About  $24\%$  of LPP patients have oral lesions [54], and oral LPP without any skin or other mucosal involvement has been reported [55, 64]. Clinically, lesions of oral LPP cannot be distinguished from OLP. They can present as multifocal white striations, papules, plaques with erosion or ulceration, or desquamative gingivitis with or without vesicles or bullae [55]. Histopathologically, LPP shows

features of OLP, MMP, or both. DIF shows the same findings as those seen in MMP (linear deposition of immunoglobulins, most often IgG, and C3 at BMZ). IIF showed immunoglobulins deposited at BMZ in about  $81\%$  of the cases [54]. BP180 and BP230 are the autoantigens found in LPP so far [54]. The diagnosis of LPP is based on clinical, histopathological, and immunofluorescence studies, and DIF is essential for this diagnosis.

Because LPP is a disease arising in lichen planus, it is not surprising that a patient could be diagnosed first as OLP, then the disease evolves into LPP, and the diagnosis of LPP was established later by repeated biopsy with DIF during the follow-up period [55].

# 38.3.8 Erythema Multiforme and Related Disorders

Erythema multiforme (EM) and related disorders are a group of mucocutaneous diseases characterized by variable degrees of cutaneous and mucosal blistering and ulceration.

EM is believed to be an immunological disorder. Although the cause is still unclear, in about half of the cases, EM is associated with a preceding infection, especially herpes simplex or Mycoplasma pneumonia, or exposure to certain medications. The infectious agents and medications that have been reported to be associated with development of EM and related disorders are listed in Table 4 and 5, respectively [65].

Depending on the clinical presentation and extent of involvement, EM can be divided into four subcategories: EM minor, EM major, Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [21]. Recent studies have suggested that EM minor and EM major may represent a distinctive entity from SJS and TEN [21]. EM minor occurs most often in young adults (20-30 year old). It is typically acute onset, and an episodic or recurrent pattern has been observed clinically. Many patients experience prodromal symptoms, including fever, malaise, sore throat, and cough, developed about a week prior to onset of the disease. It is characterized by lesions showing concentric circular erythema rings (targetoid lesions) in skin, typically in the extremities, and oral erythema, ulceration, or erosions. The targetoid lesions can develop into bullae or show necrosis in the center. The oral lesions usually start with edema and erythema of the lips and buccal mucosa, followed by eruption of multiple vesicles and bullae that quickly

Fig. 38.19 a Erythema multiforme with hemorrhagic crusting of vermilion. b Erythema multiforme with panoral stomatitis

rupture and result in ulcerations or erosions (Fig. 38.19a, b). Ulceration and hemorrhagic crusting of the vermillion border of the lips is a common and characteristic feature. Nikolsky's sign is negative. Occasionally, EM minor affects the oral mucosa exclusively [66]. The mucocutaneous lesions usually exist for 1-3 weeks and heal without scarring.

EM major is a more severe form than EM minor. In addition to skin and oral lesions, other mucosa such as genital mucosa and/or conjunctiva is also affected. The skin lesions are widespread and the mucocutaneous lesions last for 2-6 weeks. The mucosal lesions sometimes heal with scar formation which may result in symblepharon of the conjunctiva or laryngeal and/or vaginal strictures.

SJS and TEN are the rare, severe forms of the EM-related disorders and are almost always triggered by medications. The distinction between SJS and TEN is based on degree of skin involvement. SJS involves less than  $10\%$  of the body surface area while TEN involves more than  $30\%$  of body surface area [21]. Clinically, they typically start with erythema in skin of trunk, then

evolve into bullae and diffuse sloughing of skin. Eventually all patients develop mucosal involvement, with oral mucosa being the most common site. Other mucosal involvement includes oropharynx, esophagus, conjunctiva, and genitalia. These lesions are often preceded by flu-like prodromal symptoms (fever, sore throat) and skin tenderness.

The diagnosis of EM and related disorders is often based on the clinical findings and the exclusion of other vesiculobullous diseases. Histologically, the perilesional mucosa in EM often shows subepithelial or intraepithelial vesicles or bullae combined with epithelial necrosis and apoptotic keratinocytes. The inflammatory infiltrate is a mixture of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and often eosinophils. A perivascular inflammatory infiltrate is sometimes seen. The histological features are not specific and DIF is not helpful except to exclude other vesiculobullous disorders.

If a causative medication can be identified or suspected, it should be discontinued immediately. For idiopathic cases, the management is to provide symptomatic relief and supportive therapy. Topical or systemic corticosteroids are often used for EM major and minor, especially in the early stage of the disease. Mouth rinse containing local anesthetic and mild antiseptic agents may help to relieve oral symptoms. In patients with HSV-associated EM minor, antiviral therapies have been reported to be beneficial, especially in preventing recurrence. For SJS and TEN, a multidisciplinary systemic management strategy is necessary and hospital-based supportive and/or intensive care are often needed. Whether systemic corticosteroid should be used for SJS and TEN is controversial, due to the reported adverse effects to the patients such as prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of infection. The current consensus is that systemic corticosteroids should be avoided for patients with TEN, because that any risk of infection outweighs the potential benefit of systemic corticosteroid therapy [67].

The prognosis for EM minor and major is good, and they typically heal in 2-6 weeks. However, SJS and TEN can be life-threatening, and are associated with mortality rate of  $1 - 5\%$ , and  $25 - 30\%$ , respectively.

# 38.4 Pigmented Lesions of Oral Mucosa and Skin

Pigmented lesions involving the oral mucosa, the vermilion border of the lips, and the skin surfaces of the head and neck region are commonly encountered. They may appear as a single, isolated lesion or as a multifocal and

sometimes diffuse process. The majority of pigmented lesions will present as a macular discoloration, without surface elevation, and palpation of the lesional area typically fails to reveal a subcutaneous or submucosal component to the lesion. Elevated, papular to nodular lesions are also encountered with some frequency, and the differential diagnosis for this group is more limited. There are a variety of potential mechanisms that result in the development of pigmented lesions. Localized areas of increased melanin production are a very common cause. Intravascular blood as well as the breakdown products of extravasated blood can also account for many of these lesions. Pigmented foreign materials implanted into the connective tissue, either accidentally or purposefully, also are a cause for some of these lesions, particularly intraorally, where they are more commonly referred to as tattoos. On occasion, extrinsic pigmented materials will become adherent to the surface mucosa intraorally, simulating a pigmented lesion. For this reason, pigmented lesions should be wiped with dry gauze to rule out this possibility.

Identification of the etiology of a pigmented lesion is important as it may dictate treatment decisions. A lesion that can be confidently diagnosed clinically as either a tattoo or due to extravasated blood products normally requires only routine clinical follow-up. Lesions identified as being caused by increased melanin production or intravascular blood will more often result in a biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis. In many instances, the clinical color of the lesion will be quite helpful in determining the etiology. Lesions produced by increased melanin production typically present as light to dark brown areas of pigmentation. These lesions will not blanch when pressure is applied. Lesions produced by extravasated blood typically present as red to reddish purple macules. While they also will not blanch when pressure is applied, they can present with mild pain on palpation, as they represent nothing more than a bruise. Lesions produced by increased quantities of intravascular blood also will present as red to reddish purple areas. In many cases, however, these lesions will blanch with the application of surface pressure as the intravascular blood is forced into the surrounding capillary networks. Tattoos may, sometimes, be identified by the unusual color of the pigmented area. They often present as slate gray to blue lesions, and they never blanch with applied pressure. The quantity of pigment, regardless of origin, may complicate clinical determination of the etiology of a pigmented lesion. As the quantity of melanin, blood and blood products, or foreign material increases, the more similar the lesions may appear, producing dark purple to indigo to black areas of pigmentation.

# 38.4.1 Localized Pigmented Lesions

Ephelis, commonly known as a "freckle," is a pigmented lesion that presents in childhood and often affects the skin of the face. It is due to increased melanogenesis, not an increase in the number of melanocytes. Ephelides often darken with increased sun exposure.

# 38.4.1.1 Ephelis (Freckle)

The ephelis is an exceedingly common lesion of the skin of the face, and once recognized requires no treatment [68]. It typically presents in childhood as a small, well-circumscribed area of uniform macular pigmentation that may vary from light to dark brown. Classically, ephelides will darken with increased sun exposure and lighten when sun exposure decreases [69]. The number of lesions tends to increase into adulthood but then regresses with advancing age [68]. The ephelis is caused by an increased production of melanin by melanocytes in the basal cell layer of the epithelium, which is subsequently transferred to the adjacent keratinocytes. While there is increased melanogenesis, there is no evidence of an increase in the number of melanocytes.

# 38.4.1.2 Lentigo

Lentigo is a lesion of skin that clinically resembles an ephelis [70]. Lentigo can be further subdivided into lentigo simplex and solar lentigo [71]. Lentigo simplex is of unknown etiology and usually occurs in children. Lesions are typically small, uniformly pigmented, and sharply circumscribed with a smooth border. Unlike ephelides, however, the depth of color of the lesions does not change with increased sun exposure [70]. Solar lentigo, also referred to as senile lentigo, is best known by the lay terminology of "age spot" or "liver spot." It is an extremely common lesion in elderly white individuals, being present in more than  $90\%$  of individuals over the age of 70 [68]. It is only rarely encountered under age 40. The etiology is thought to be due to chronic sun exposure, with some speculation that these lesions represent a precursor to seborrheic keratoses [72]. Genetic alternations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), both of which have been found in seborrheic keratoses, have been observed in a small number of solar lentigines [72]. This lends some support to the idea that these lesions may be within the same pathologic spectrum. Interestingly, lentigo simplex has shown no evidence of these genetic alternations in some of the studies performed thus far, further supporting

their distinction from solar lentigo [73]. As with lentigo simplex, the lesions show no change in pigmentation with increasing sun exposure. Unlike lentigo simplex, however, multiple lesions are typically seen and they tend to have an irregular border [68]. The skin of the face and the vermilion border of the lip are common sites of involvement. The histologic features of lentigo simplex and solar lentigo are nearly identical. Both show slightly elongated rete ridges, increased melanin production, and a normal to slightly increased number of melanocytes in the basal cell layer. They often can be differentiated by the presence of solar elastosis (sun damage) in the dermis in solar lentigo.

# Key Points

Lentigo simplex may resemble an ephelis clinically but will not darken with increased sun exposure.  
Solar lentigo, while similar in clinical appearance to lentigo simplex and the ephelis, are seen in older individuals and are rare under the age of 40.

# 38.4.1.3 Melanotic Macule

Melanotic macule is similar to an ephelis of the skin and represents an increase in melanogenesis, without an increase in the number of melanocytes. It is not associated with sun exposure.

The melanotic macule is the intraoral counterpart of the skin ephelis and is quite common [74]. Clinically, the lesions present as small, well-demarcated, round to oval macules that are uniformly pigmented [75] (Fig. 38.20). The color normally is described as light to dark brown, with occasional lesions being blue to black [74]. Unlike the skin ephelis, however, there is no association with

![](images/582203ba166af6c80e66937622c4ac1d47f775ab701321e97c4ff19069c4c13b.jpg)  
Fig. 38.20 Multiple melanotic macules of the gingiva

sun exposure [75]. While any oral mucosal surface may be affected, the vermilion surface of the lower lip is the most common site of occurrence. The buccal mucosa, palate, and gingiva are other commonly affected areas. Melanotic macules may be seen at any age. Women tend to be affected twice as often as men. Lesions are most often single but multiple sites of involvement can occur. They do not tend to regress and disappear [75]. Microscopic examination reveals increased melanin in the basal keratinocytes, analogous to the skin ephelis. Melanin incontinence is also often noted, however, with melanin pigment found in macrophages in the lamina propria, a feature not typically seen in the ephelis. No treatment is necessary in most instances, but removal of the lesions for aesthetic reasons, particularly when the lower lip is involved, is fairly common.

Transformation of what was initially diagnosed as a melanotic macule into intraoral melanoma has been documented in at least one instance however [76], and many cases of intraoral melanoma have been reported to arise from a preexisting pigmented lesion [77, 78]. For this reason, melanotic macules are worthy of clinical follow-up and lesions that show any evidence of continued growth or other worrisome features of melanoma should be removed [78].

# 38.4.1.4 Post-inflammatory Melanosis

Pigmented lesions clinically identical to the melanotic macule are occasionally encountered following traumatic injuries or other inflammatory processes. The inflammation induces overproduction of melanin by the melanocytes in the affected area, resulting in a macular area of increased pigmentation. Unlike the melanotic macule, post-inflammatory melanosis resolves with loss of the inflammatory stimulation and healing.

# 38.4.1.5 Oral Melanoacanthoma

The oral melanoacanthoma is a relatively rare lesion, and is theorized to be reactive in nature [79]. A source of irritation to the lesional area can be identified in many instances. It typically presents as a macular-pigmented area although occasional lesions may appear slightly elevated [80] (Fig. 38.21). They are normally dark brown to black in color and may show considerable variability in the degree of pigmentation within the lesion. While often well circumscribed, the border may be somewhat irregular [79]. Disturbingly, oral melanoacanthoma often shows very rapid growth, enlarging to several centimeters in diameter within a short period of time. Thus, melanoma is often considered high in the clinical differential diagnosis. Lesions are seen almost exclusively in blacks with a strong female predilection. Young adults are the primary population affected. The buccal mucosa is the most common site, and while it

![](images/c420dd32ca8c686e521c41e2ccedce7f593d49b8622c2daaad939f68781d1e69.jpg)  
Fig. 38.21 Melanoacanthoma in the buccal mucosa of a young Black female

typically presents as a solitary isolated lesion, multifocal lesions are occasionally seen [79]. Despite its rapid growth, the process is favored to be reactive and lesions have shown spontaneous regression with removal of the irritating stimulus or following incisional biopsy [80]. Histopathologic findings reveal numerous dendritic melanocytes throughout all levels of the epithelium. Melanocytes in the basal cell layer are also increased in number. While the histologic findings are specific in the correct clinical context, similar features have been reported in cases of pigmented lesions showing progression to melanoma [78]. Therefore, follow-up to monitor the clinical behavior of the lesion is recommended.

# Key Points

Oral melanoacanthoma is thought to be a reactive process with a predilection for young Black females.  
The lesion shows clinical resolution with removal of the offending stimulus.

# 38.4.1.6 Melanocytic Nevi

The melanocytic nevus is generally referred to and perhaps more widely recognized as a "mole" or "birthmark." They are extraordinarily common lesions of the skin with nearly  $100\%$  of light-skinned individuals having at least one melanocytic nevus [68]. They are less common in the dark-skinned races. The skin of the face is a frequent site of occurrence. The lesions are considered by many as developmental malformations

produced by a proliferation of neural crest-derived cells (nevus cells), either specialized melanocytes or melanocyte precursors [68]. Recent studies have illustrated that nevi show a mutation in the proto-oncogene BRAF, which is thought to play a role in nevus cell proliferation and differentiation [81]. Skin lesions on occasion are congenital but more commonly develop in early childhood, and nearly all lesions are present by early adulthood. Newly developing melanocytic nevi after age 35 are distinctly unusual and should be viewed with suspicion [68]. With advancing age, the lesions tend to involute, and by the eighth to ninth decade they virtually disappear.

Nevi are subclassified histologically according to the location of the proliferating nevus cells relative to the overlying epithelium [68]. In junctional nevi, the nevus cells are in intimate contact with the epithelium, and the lesions are macular clinically (Fig. 38.22). Intradermal nevi have nevus cells located separate from the epithelium in the upper dermis, and produce elevated, domeshaped nodular masses that may be sessile or polypoid. Compound nevi show nevus cell nests in both the epithelium and the upper dermis, and typically present as slightly elevated nodules. Blue nevi are characterized by spindled to oval nevus cells that are found in the deeper dermal tissues; they tend to produce elevated, flattopped nodules with a distinctive blue color. Numerous other subtypes are also known to exist.

One important subtype is the dysplastic nevus. Dysplastic nevi may be a precursor to melanoma, particularly when the lesions are multiple and occur in a familial, autosomal dominant pattern. Patients with multiple lesions must therefore be closely monitored. The relationship between a solitary dysplastic nevus and development of melanoma is less clear. Clinically, the lesions simulate melanoma, being somewhat larger than typical nevi and showing irregular and indistinct borders and a variation in color. Dysplastic nevi are known to occur intraorally [68].

![](images/90fa25d46600b74c68c0fb328ea84cca21ca48ce187962104a0c4f7d81528a48.jpg)  
Fig. 38.22 Junctional nevus of the upper lip

Most cutaneous nevi are largely innocuous lesions that require no treatment. Clinical changes in a preexisting nevus may herald development of melanoma and should prompt removal. Excision is also often performed per patient desires for cosmetic reasons.

In contrast to skin lesions, intraoral nevi are decidedly uncommon [82, 83]. The palate is the most common site of occurrence, but lesions may be seen in almost any area of the oral cavity [83]. The lips, gingiva, and mucobuccal vestibule are other relatively common sites of occurrence [83]. The dorsum of the tongue is an extraordinarily rare site of involvement, with no well-documented cases ever having been reported. Intramucosal nevi, the mucosal counterpart of intradermal nevi, are the most common subtype, accounting for more than half of all lesions [83] (Fig. 38.23). Blue nevi are the second most common subtype seen intraorally. Intraoral lesions tend to be less deeply pigmented than skin lesions, with more than  $20\%$  lacking melanin pigmentation entirely, presenting instead as normal-colored nodular masses [82, 83]. Because of the concern for continual irritation of the lesions when they occur intraorally, and because clinical separation from melanoma is not possible with good certainty, lesions provisionally diagnosed as intraoral nevi are typically excised.

# 38.4.1.7 Seborrheic Keratosis

Seborrheic keratosis is a common pigmented lesion seen primarily in the elderly. Clinically, they may resemble nevi, and thus should be included in the differential diagnosis with nevi. They commonly do not begin to appear until age 30, a helpful contrasting feature to nevi, and they become more prevalent rather than less prevalent with increasing age [68]. They typically present as elevated pigmented lesions with a rough surface (Fig. 38.24). They are often described as having a "greasy" surface and "stuck on" appearance, also helping to separate them clinically from nevi. While the exact pathogenesis remains somewhat unclear, the process does appear to be multifactorial with chronic sun exposure and heredity playing a role, as an autosomal dominant familial pattern is seen in many affected individuals [68]. Additionally, mutations involving FGFR3 and PIK3CA have been found in seborrheic keratoses and are speculated to play a role in their development [84]. Lesions do not occur intraorally [74]. For the most part, seborrheic keratoses are innocuous lesions that seldom require removal except for cosmetic reasons. However, rarely an eruption of pruritic seborrheic keratoses can be the herald of internal malignancy; a phenomenon known as the Leser-Trelat sign.

# Tips and Tricks

A sudden eruption of pruritic seborrheic keratoses could be a sign of internal malignancy (Leser-Trelat sign).

# 38.4.1.8 Melanoma

Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from cells of melanocytic origin. It is the most aggressive and deadliest of all the skin cancers. Morbidity and mortal

![](images/92cabd08e38a3940868a6fa2c885a6f1281cbae6af554e687e7bea46de10467f.jpg)

ity are increasing with this disease due to its increasing incidence. The number of skin cases has been growing approximately  $5\%$  per year [68]. The majority of melanomas are believed to arise de novo from melanocytes in the basal cell layer of epithelium. However, melanoma arising in the setting of a nevus is also observed, and has been investigated at the genetic level with lesions showing numerous specific genetic mutations in the variable benign and malignant-appearing compartments of the same lesional specimen, suggesting a pattern of evolution [85]. It is estimated that more than  $35\%$  of nodular and superficial spreading melanomas arise within the background of a melanocytic nevus [68]. Most cases of melanoma are diagnosed in middle-aged and older individuals. The etiology is likely multifactorial, with race and genetic factors having a strong influence. Sun exposure certainly plays a role, and the incidence of melanoma in susceptible individuals is known to decrease with increasing living distance from the Earth's equator. The incidence of most types of melanoma corresponds best with excessive sunburning early in life, and the lifetime risk of developing melanoma is not believed to increase significantly after the third decade of life [68]. Individuals at greatest risk for sunburning are therefore more likely to develop the neoplasm. This group includes individuals with fair complexion and blue eyes, often with red hair. These individuals burn easily and tan poorly and often show mottled skin pigmentation with excessive freckling [68]. Dark-skinned races have a much lower incidence of melanoma.

Early diagnosis of melanoma is critical in attempting to control the disease [86]. Melanomas tend to show two different growth patterns: a radial growth phase and a vertical growth phase. During the radial growth phase, melanoma cells grow along the epithelial/connective tissue interface but do not invade into the deeper dermis where access to blood vessels and the potential for distant metastasis is greater. Melanomas may remain in the radial growth phase for long periods of time. Once a lesion enters the vertical growth phase, however, vascular invasion and perineural spread are commonly seen, and metastasis to distant sites is common. Thus, diagnosis of melanoma during the radial growth phase carries a far more favorable prognosis, and the thickness of a lesion becomes the most important prognostic factor. Cutaneous melanomas less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness and not ulcerated have a 5-year survival rate of  $95\%$  if metastasis is not already present [68]. The presence of ulceration in a lesion is often a later finding and adversely affects prognosis. Patients with documented metastatic disease at a time of diagnosis have a 5-year survival under  $20\%$  [86].

Four histologic subtypes of melanoma are recognized. Lentigo maligna melanoma is considered an in situ disease (Fig. 38.25). It presents as a macular

radial growth phase and is not as strongly associated with sun exposure. It typically presents as a rapidly growing, ulcerated, darkly pigmented mass that is deeply invasive at the time of initial diagnosis. Metastasis is common and the prognosis is poor. Acral lentiginous melanoma is the rarest subtype of melanoma, but is commonly seen in Black individuals. It is an aggressive type that tends to metastasize early. It begins as a macular area of irregular dark pigmentation. The palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and underneath the nails are common locations. Intraoral melanomas often present as this subtype, and are sometimes referred to as mucosal lentiginous melanoma.

Clinical features worrisome for melanoma that are quite helpful in recognizing lesions in the earliest stages of development utilize the ABCDE algorithm [87].

# Important

Asymmetry: asymmetrical growth of the lesion

Borders: irregular borders of the lesion

Color: variation in color of the lesion that can vary from pink, tan, brown, blue, black or even areas of depigmentation

Diameter: a size greater than  $6\mathrm{mm}$

Evolution: changes in size, shape, and/or color of the lesion over time

Incisional biopsy of large lesions to establish a diagnosis is acceptable.

Treatment of melanoma consists of assured surgical excision with a wide margin of surrounding normal tissue. Sentinel lymph node dissection is often performed to assess for regional metastasis. Radiation therapy is unusual as it is found to be generally ineffective against melanoma. Chemotherapy, immune system modulation therapy, and genetically directed treatment modalities are also being used with greater frequency, particularly as our understanding of the targetable molecular and genetic changes of the neoplasm increases [68].

Intraoral melanoma luckily is a rare occurrence. Most patients are over the age of 50 at initial presentation. Clinically, intraoral lesions often begin as irregular macules that represent the radial growth phase of the lesion, the so-called mucosal lentiginous type of melanoma [87]. A nodular invasive growth pattern soon develops within the area of macular pigmentation and ulceration is frequent. The hard palate and the gingiva are the most commonly affected sites [87]. Extension of the melanoma into the underlying bone is often noted and heralds a particularly poor prognosis. The prognosis for oral melanoma is poor even in the absence of bone involvement. Average 5-year survival in oral melanoma is approximately  $15\%$  [88]. Given the poor prognosis

brown lesion with irregular borders and spotty areas of darker pigmentation. It occurs on sun-exposed areas in elderly individuals, often on the face. These lesions have been shown to remain in the radial growth phase for as long as 15 years before demonstrating nodular change and progressing to invasive melanoma. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common form, representing approximately  $70\%$  of cutaneous lesions. It occurs in non-sun-exposed areas with some frequency, showing a propensity for the upper back in men and the lower legs in women. Clinically, the lesions are irregular in outline and show a variation in pigmentation. Areas of depigmentation within the lesion may be seen (Fig. 38.26). The surface may also be irregular with nodular foci and/or ulceration developing within an otherwise macular lesion. As the name would indicate, superficial spreading melanoma shows radial growth primarily but progresses to the vertical growth phase more quickly than lentigo maligna and carries a poorer prognosis. Nodular melanoma shows prominent vertical growth early in its development without a significant

and variable histologic findings, additional criteria for the clinical evaluation of pigmented lesions in the oral cavity have been proposed; these include multiple recurrences of any pigmented lesion as well as involvement of high-risk sites such as the hard palate and gingiva [78]. Nonetheless, most mucosal melanomas present with advanced clinical disease and surgical treatment is often aggressive.

# Key Points

- When faced with a pigmented lesion, utilizing the "ABCDE" criteria provides an objective guide for evaluation.  
Given the poor prognosis of mucosal melanoma, additional parameters should be utilized in evaluation of pigmented lesions in the oral cavity, despite benign or nonspecific histologic findings.

# 38.4.2 Vascular Lesions

Vascular lesions normally present as red to reddish purple areas and are, therefore, usually easily recognizable as vascular in origin. As the quantity of blood increases, the lesions will darken in color and may be confused with lesions produced by melanin. Three mechanisms are possible in the production of vascular lesions. The normal blood vessels in an area may be markedly dilated, there may be an increased number of blood vessels present in an area, or blood may be spilled from the vessels into the connective tissue compartment. Lesions produced by dilation of existing blood vessels or proliferation of new blood vessels may blanch with applied pressure over their surface, clearly identifying the intravascular nature of the blood. Lesions produced by blood spillage can be mildly painful on palpation and do not blanch.

# Tips and Tricks

Certain vascular lesions, those with an increased number of blood vessels or those with dilation of vascular spaces, can be clinically distinguished from other pigmented lesions, as they will typically blanch when pressure is applied.

# 38.4.2.1 Telangiectasia and Varix

Telangiectasia represents a dilation of the capillary vasculature in an area. It usually presents as multiple, small, bright red lesions and can involve any soft tissue site. The lesions may be flat to slightly elevated. They are asymptomatic and require no treatment in most instances. A varix is a dilated vein. It can be found at any age but is

seen with increased frequency in older individuals [89]. The lips, floor of mouth, and ventral tongue are common sites [89]. Varices often are reddish purple to blue in color due to the quantity of blood present in the dilated vessel (Fig. 38.27). They are soft on palpation and will blanch with pressure unless thrombosed. No treatment is necessary although thrombosed varices are often biopsied because of their firm nature on palpation and the clinical concern to rule out melanoma.

# 38.4.2.2 Hemangioma

Hemangiomas represent a proliferation of blood vessels. Some debate remains as to whether they represent developmental anomalies or true neoplasms [90]. Spontaneous regression occurs on occasion suggesting at least some are truly developmental anomalies [90]. The head and neck area is commonly involved, and intraoral lesions are frequent [91]. They are seen most often in children and are sometimes congenital. The quantity of blood vessels and their location within the tissue determine the clinical presentation. Lesions may be flat or produce enlargement of the involved area. Intraorally, hemangiomas are red to blue in color, soft to palpation, and usually blanch with applied surface pressure. The color of the lesion is determined by the size of the blood vessels in the lesion. Capillary hemangiomas are normally red; cavernous hemangiomas tend to be blue to purple.

Fig. 38.27 Varix of the upper lip

Thrombosis within the lesional blood vessels is not uncommon and will produce lesions with a firm, sometimes multinodular character. While any area of the oral mucosa may be involved, the lips, buccal mucosa, and tongue account for a large number of cases [91]. Hemangiomas are typically diffuse and poorly delineated clinically, making surgical removal problematic at times. Incision through a lesion may cause extensive bleeding. Other treatment options include embolization, cryotherapy, and laser surgery [90, 91]. Sclerosing agents have also been utilized but tend to produce less reliable and predictable results. Recent studies utilizing betablockers, such as Propranolol, in infantile lesions are promising showing significant reduction in lesional size [92]. Treatment may not be necessary unless the lesion may be subject to trauma or it becomes a functional or cosmetic problem for the patient.

# 38.4.2.3 Angiosarcoma and Kaposi Sarcoma

Angiosarcomas represent a malignant proliferation of blood vessels. They are very rare lesions overall. The skin in the scalp and forehead area is a common location [93]. They tend to be aggressive lesions with a poor prognosis and are treated with radical surgical excision and radiotherapy [93]. Angiosarcoma involving the oral mucosa is decidedly rare. Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a subtype of angiosarcoma linked to Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) in the setting of Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV), is more often seen intraorally. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, KS was commonly encountered, but with the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of KS has fallen dramatically [94]. KS is also encountered in immunosuppressed patients secondary to organ transplantation. When the oral mucosa is affected, the hard palate and gingiva are most often involved (Fig. 38.28). Lesions may begin as macular reddish lesions that subsequently enlarge and become

$\square$  Fig. 38.28 Multiple lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma affecting the palate

nodular, often ulcerating. Pigmentation increases with increasing size and can produce dark brown to black lesions [94]. The lesions may or may not blanch with applied pressure. Treatment for KS may not be necessary. In patients with AIDS, treatment with antiretroviral therapy may result in regression of the lesions [94]. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have also been utilized.

# Key Points

Angiosarcoma is a malignant vascular neoplasm that is often seen affecting the skin of the scalp and is rarely seen in the oral cavity.  
Kaposi Sarcoma when related to the oral cavity is often in the setting of immunosuppression, particularly HIV and AIDS, and is a process driven by HHV8.

# 38.4.3 Lesions Produced by Extravasated Blood

Petechia, Purpura, and Ecchymosis: These lesions all represent a form of bruising with the size of the lesion being the differentiating factor. Petechiae are defined as pinpoint areas of hemorrhage and are typically associated with breakage of capillary blood vessels. Purpuras are slightly larger, measuring up to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in diameter and are often associated with smaller caliber vessels. Ecchymoses are larger than  $1\mathrm{cm}$  and are typically associated with larger caliber vessels. They may be mildly tender to palpation but do not produce palpable evidence of a deep component. Trauma is the usual cause but any condition producing vascular fragility may produce these lesions. No treatment is typically necessary.

# Key Points

- Petechiae represents the breakage of capillary vessels, and will clinically present as an area consisting of pinpoint hemorrhaging.  
Purpura represents hemorrhage due to damage of smaller caliber blood vessels and measures up to  $1\mathrm{cm}$  
Ecchymosis represents hemorrhage due to damage of larger caliber vessels and is greater than  $1\mathrm{cm}$

# 38.4.3.1 Hematoma

A hematoma is a nodular swelling due to pooling and subsequent coagulation of blood within the soft tissue.

A hematoma is the result of bleeding into deep tissue spaces. Trauma to the area is a consistent etiologic finding. A large quantity of blood is present, which subsequently clots, producing a deep component to the lesion on palpation. Pain on palpation may be significant. The tongue and buccal mucosa are common sites, owing to the frequency of associated trauma in these areas. Treatment is not necessary and the lesions resolve slowly over time.

# 38.4.3.2Tattoos

Tattoos are frequently encountered oral lesions [95]. They are produced by implantation of foreign materials into the subepithelial connective tissues. Amalgam is the most common culprit [95] (Fig. 38.29). Other metals, graphite, and ink have also been identified as a source. Any area of the oral mucosa may be affected, but the gingiva is the most common site [95]. The lesions are typically macular and discovered on routine examination. Occasional lesions are elevated. The color will vary depending upon the nature of the implanted material. Amalgam often produces a slate gray to blue to black discoloration. If large metal fragments are implanted, radiographic studies may verify the clinical impression and negate the need for treatment. A large number of tattoos do not show up on radiographic examination, however. Treatment is sometimes necessary for cosmetic reasons but more commonly when the clinical differential diagnosis includes other more worrisome lesions.

# Tips and Tricks

Amalgam tattoos may show radiographic evidence of implanted metal fragments, which if present can aid in clinical distinction.

# 38.4.4 Generalized Pigmented Lesions

In contrast to localized pigments, generalized pigmented lesions normally signal a systemic etiology for the process. This may be due to hereditary factors, metabolic disorders, endocrine abnormalities, or the effects of medications. Lesions produced tend to be macular brown pigments involving a diffuse area of the mucosa. A symmetric distribution to the lesions may be seen. Generalized pigmented lesions linked to genetic factors include physiologic (racial) pigmentation, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Neurofibromatosis I, and McCune-Albright syndrome. Endocrine and metabolic disorders may also produce generalized pigments. These include pulmonary disease, heavy metal intoxication, Addison disease, pregnancy, and menopause. Perhaps the most common cause for generalized pigmented lesions is secondary to the effects of medications. Antimalarials, birth control medication, minocycline, phenothiazines, and some cancer chemotherapeutic agents are most often implicated.

# Key Points

When you encounter generalized pigmentation, whether multifocal or diffuse in its pattern, evaluate the individual extensively to rule out an underlying systemic cause.

# Conclusion

The most common forms of infectious and noninfectious stomatitis, as well as pigmented lesions most likely to be seen in an oral and maxillofacial surgical practice are reviewed with emphasis on clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and management.
