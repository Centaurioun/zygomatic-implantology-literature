# Learning Aims

1. Anatomy of the frontal sinus and naso-orbitoethmoid region has aesthetic and functional implications.  
2. Appropriate evaluation of frontal sinus injury, nasofrontal outflow tract patency, and anatomic integrity of the NOE complex is critical in establishing the correct operative intervention.  
3. Operative intervention is necessary in cases of NFOT obstruction and medial canthal tendon disruption in NOE fractures.  
4. Long-term monitoring is necessary for delayed complications.

# 25.1 Introduction

The frontal bone and naso-orbitoethmoid (NOE) complex have central aesthetic and functional roles. Thankfully, fractures in this region are infrequent, occurring among only  $2 - 15\%$  of patients with facial fractures [1-4], because when these fractures do occur, they can cause devastating complications because of their proximity to the brain, eyes, and nose. Complications include blindness or other forms of visual disturbance, orbital cellulitis or abscess, meningitis, brain abscess, and facial deformation. Although reports of the surgical management of the damaged frontal sinus have existed for more than 100 years [5], no consensus has yet been reached on ideal patient care after traumatic injury [5-7].

Most frontal sinus and NOE injuries (44-85%) are sustained in a motor vehicle or motorcycle collisions [1, 3, 7-21], with young males most commonly affected (66-91%) [1, 7-17, 22-27]. NOE fractures can occur in isolation, but they generally occur in association with other midface fractures [20, 28]. As many as  $60\%$  of patients with NOE fractures also have associated nonfacial injuries [21, 23-25]. As much as 800-2200 lbs of force is necessary to fracture the frontal bone, so the index of suspicion for other concomitant injuries should be high and a thorough exam performed [7].

NOE fractures, often involve supraorbital rim and frontal sinus fractures. The published frequency of fractures of the anterior wall, the posterior wall, and the floor of the frontal sinus varies widely:  $43 - 61\%$  of reported patients had anterior table fractures only;  $19 - 51\%$  had both anterior and posterior table fractures;  $2.5 - 25\%$  had injuries to the nasofrontal duct; and  $0.6 - 6\%$  had posterior fractures only [2, 3, 8]. Appropriate management is guided by multiple factors including the degree of displacement, patency of the outflow tract, as well as aesthetics.

# 25.2 Anatomy and Physiology

# 25.2.1 Embryology of the Sinus

The frontal bone is an intramembranous bone that develops from two paired structures that begin to ossify at the 8th or 9th week in utero [9, 29]. The ossification begins in the frontal processes of the squamous regions, progresses to the orbital and squamous regions, and reaches the frontal and temporal regions by the 12th week. The metopic suture in the midline closes during the second year of life [30]. The forehead is displaced anteriorly by sutural growth, inner table resorption, and outer table deposition [31].

The frontal sinus is a small outpouching at birth and undergoes almost all of its development thereafter. The sinus may develop from one or several different sites: as a rudiment of the ethmoid air cells, as a mucosal pocket in or near the frontal recess, as an evagination of the frontal recess, or from the superior middle meatus [17]. Initial pneumatization begins during the fourth month in utero. Secondary pneumatization begins between the ages of 6 months to 2 years and develops laterally and vertically. The sinus is radiographically identifiable by the time the child reaches the age of 6 years [32]. Most pneumatization is completed by the time the child is 12-16 years old but continues until the age of 40 [5, 17, 29, 33]. The configuration of the sinus and the position of the septa are extremely variable between individuals.

# 25.2.2 Physiology of the Sinus

The entire surface area of the frontal sinus is covered with respiratory epithelium ranging in thickness from 0.07 to  $2.0\mathrm{mm}$  [34]. The mucosa consists of pseudostratified ciliated epithelium, mucus-producing goblet cells, a thin basement membrane, and a thin lamina propria that contains seromucous glands [34]. When the mucosa is healthy, a blanket of mucin overlies the epithelium. The cilia flow at 250 cycles/min and push the mucin blanket in a spiral fashion and in a medial to the lateral direction. The flow is slowest at the roof and fastest at the nasofrontal duct [35] where the mucin empties at a rate of  $5.0~\mathrm{g / cm^2}$ . The physiologic characteristics of the sinus and the status of the nasofrontal duct dictate the treatment of the frontal sinus in trauma [36]. Although described as the "nasofrontal duct," a true duct is seen in only  $15\%$  of people, with most having only a recess draining into the middle meatus. Some authors prefer to use the term nasofrontal outflow tract (NFOT) to describe the drainage system. Recognition of the vari

ability in duct size and shape is important in the management of impaired drainage after injury [37].

# 25.2.3 Osteology

The frontal bone is shaped as a concave disk with a horizontal table forming the orbital rim. From the nasion, the bone extends approximately  $12.5\mathrm{cm}$  superiorly,  $8.0~\mathrm{cm}$  laterally, and  $5.5\mathrm{cm}$  posteriorly. Two frontal tuberosities are noted lateral to the midline and superior to the supraorbital run. The thickest area of the bone is the supraorbital rim, running from the frontozygomatic process to the nasal bones. The ethmoid plate is bound on three surfaces along the floor of the frontal bone in the midline. As the floor of the frontal bone extends laterally, it becomes concave and forms the orbital roof. The supraorbital and frontal foramina are located at the most superior portion of the orbital rim. The supratrochlear foramen is located medial to the supraorbital foramen or notch and lateral to the nasal bones. A spine or concavity exists on the frontal bone along the medial anterior

orbital roof and forms the attachment for the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle [38, 39] (Fig. 25.1).

Paired triangular sinuses are found within the frontal bone. These sinuses are asymmetrical and are separated by a frontal septum. The average height of the sinuses is  $32\mathrm{mm}$ , and their average width is  $26\mathrm{mm}$  [32, 39]. The surface area within is approximately  $720\mathrm{mm}$  [2, 35]. The frontal bone is thinnest in the region of the glabella at the anterior wall and floor of the sinus. The duct of the frontal sinus empties into the ethmoid air cells of the middle meatus of the nose.

The internal concave surface of the frontal bone forms the anterior cranial fossa that houses the brain. The floor of the frontal bone outlines the roof of the orbit. The convex outer table is bounded by the scalp and the frontalis, orbicularis, and procerus muscles. The osseous structures that abut the frontal bone are the lacrimal and ethmoid bones inferiorly, the sphenoid inferiorly and posteriorly, the parietal posteriorly and superiorly, the zygoma laterally, the nasal bones anteriorly, and the maxilla anteriorly and inferiorly. The ethmoid air cells and nasal apparatus are situated inferiorly.

The nasal part of the frontal bone extends inferiorly deep to the nasal bones and the frontal process of the maxilla, adding support to the NOE complex. The nasal bones and the maxilla make up the piriform rim. The articulation of the nasal bones forms a crest posteriorly and inferiorly. This crest articulates with the frontal bone, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid (forming the upper third of the nasal septum), and the septal cartilage. The NOE region is supported structurally by a vertical buttress (the frontal process of the maxilla) and two horizontal buttresses (the supraorbital and infraorbital rims) [40].

The medial walls of the orbit begin behind the frontal process of the maxilla. The thin lacrimal bone and a frail lamina papyracea in the anterior are weak and susceptible to fracture. Higher up, the frontoethmoid suture delineates the level of the cribriform plate and crista galli.

# 25.2.4 Neurovascular Structures

The arterial blood supply to the frontal sinus is from the supraorbital and anterior ethmoid arteries. Two foramina are present along the suture line: the anterior ethmoid foramen, through which course the nasociliary nerve and the anterior ethmoidal artery, and the posterior ethmoidal foramen, through which pass the vessel and nerve of the same name. Further posterior along the medial orbital wall, the optic nerve exits through the body of the sphenoid bone,  $3.5 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  behind the posterior ethmoidal foramen in a line parallel to the two foramina.

The frontal bone is supplied by the supraorbital, anterior superficial temporal, anterior cerebral, and middle meningeal arteries [30, 38, 39]. Venous drainage is transosseous through the anastomosis of vessels of the subcutaneous, orbital, and intracranial structures. The primary venous drainage is through the supratrochlear, supraorbital, superficial temporal, frontal diploic (veins of Breschet), superior ophthalmic, and superior sagittal sinuses [30, 38]. The relationship of the diploe to the anterior cranial fossae is important to understand because these structures are sites of the imbrication of sinus mucosa, which may give rise to mucoceles and can become a conduit for the spread of infection if not removed.

# 25.2.5 Interorbital Space

The nasofrontal suture is the continuation of the frontoethmoid suture and corresponds to the plane of the base of the skull or frontal sinus. The interorbital space is bounded laterally by the medial wall of the orbits. In the

middle is the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and nasal septum. The anterior wall is composed of the paired nasal bones, the frontal processes of the maxilla, and the nasal processes of the frontal bone.

The ethmoid air cells within the interorbital space occupy the upper half of the wall lateral to the nasal fossa. The dimensions of the anterior end of the ethmoid labyrinth are approximately  $2.5\mathrm{cm}$  vertically and  $1\mathrm{cm}$  transversely. The pyramid-shaped sinus measures between 3.5 and  $5\mathrm{cm}$  from front to back.

The ethmoid air cells drain into the middle meatus, as does the NFOT. The nasofrontal outflow is located in the posterior medial floor of the frontal sinus at the junction of the ethmoid and nasal portions of the floor, and it courses through the anterior ethmoid in the middle meatus, or just anterior to the middle turbinate. The length of the duct, if present, may vary from a few millimeters to a centimeter or more (Fig. 25.2).

# 25.2.6 Medial Canthal Tendon

The orbicularis oculi muscle has three portions: orbital, preseptal, and pretarsal. The pretarsal portions of the upper and lower lids unite at the canthus to form the medial canthal tendon (MCT).

The MCT may be subdivided into a superficial portion and a deeper portion with the lacrimal sac between them. The superficial portion has two "legs" and inserts into the frontal process of the maxilla, providing support to the eyelids and maintaining the integrity of the palpebral fissure [40, 41]. The anterior leg attaches to the posterolateral surface of the nasal bones, and the superior leg inserts at the junction of the frontal process of the maxilla and the angular process of the frontal bone. The deeper portion (also known as Horner's muscle or the pars lacrimalis) attaches to the posterior lacrimal crest.

NOE injuries may cause avulsion of the tendons from the bone or, more commonly, fractures of the bone that contains the attachment of tendons. This portion of the orbital rim is an important anatomic region with regard to the reconstruction of NOE fractures [40].

# 25.2.7 Lacriminal Apparatus

The lacrimal drainage system is intimately related to the NOE region and can be damaged during trauma to, or reconstruction of, this area. The system removes any excess tears that accumulate after lubrication of the surface of the globe. The superior and inferior lacrimal canaliculi drain the lacrimal lake. The puncta of the canaliculi open just lateral to the lacrimal lake and are surrounded by Horner's muscle. The orifice of the upper

punctum faces downward and backward, and the orifice of the lower punctum faces upward and backward. The superior punctum is approximately  $3\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the inferior punctum. The two canaliculi pierce the lacrimal fascia and enter the lacrimal sac at or very near a common point. The canaliculi lie mostly behind the medial palpebral ligament and are surrounded by the pars lacrimalis [42, 43]. The lacrimal canaliculi are lined with nonkeratinized and non-mucin-producing stratified squamous epithelium. The epithelium is  $75 - 150~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  thick and consists of a few layers of squamous cells, polyhedral cells, and a basal cell layer [43].

The lacrimal sac lies in a fossa on the anteromedial wall of the bony orbit. It is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium and is approximately  $12\mathrm{mm}$  long [43]. The apex of the sac ends blindly in a superior fundus, and the sac continues inferiorly into the nasolacrimal duct, which is housed in a bony canal. The duct empties into the inferior meatus in the nasal cavity [42].

# Key Points

The frontal sinus pneumatizes and enlarges until adulthood.  
The frontal sinus lining produces mucous which requires a patent NFOT for drainage.  
The NFOT drains into the ethmoid air cells of the middle meatus in the nose.  
The vertical buttress (frontal process of the maxilla) and horizontal buttresses (supraorbital and infraorbital rims) provide structural support to the NOE region.  
The medial canthal tendon (MCT) is an important structure supporting the eyelids and integrity of the palpebral fissure and its position is an important landmark to reconstruct in NOE fractures.  
The nasolacrimal duct and bony canal empty into the inferior meatus in the nose.

# 25.3 Patient Evaluation

# 25.3.1 Clinical Findings

Periorbital ecchymosis and pain are the most common signs and symptoms associated with fractures of the frontal bone [5, 44-48]. Disruption of the periosteum and bleeding from the fracture site allow leakage of blood into the adjacent facial planes, resulting in periorbital ecchymosis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage may occur via the same mechanism. The finding of subconjunctival hemorrhage is sufficient for the diagnosis of frontal bone fracture if the nose and zygomas are unaffected. Fractures of the NOE complex can produce the following signs: nasal deformity, edema, and ecchymosis of the eyelids, subconjunctival hemorrhage, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, hyposmia, traumatic telecanthus, increased canthal angles, and blindness [20, 49] (Fig. 25.3).

Soft tissue lacerations in the region of the glabella and the supraorbital rims are also commonly found in

association with frontal bone fractures and may be associated with anesthesia or paresthesia in the distribution of the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves [5, 44-48]. Depression of the bone with flatness and cosmetic deformity is noted if the patient is examined soon after injury. Examination of a patient with NOE fractures detects mobility of the nasal bones, traumatic telcanthus, depression of the radix, a wide and flattened nasal dorsum, and an upturned nasal tip (  $\square$  Fig. 25.4). From 1 hour to 5 days after injury, there may be enough edema to hide the contour depression. Palpation may reveal crepitation and tenderness over the fracture site [44-48].

Fractures involving the posterior table of the frontal sinus or the cribriform plate may cause CSF leakage [44-47, 50]. Confirmation of the presence of CSF can be made by collecting as little as  $0.1\mathrm{mL}$  of this fluid and comparing glucose and chloride levels in the fluid with the patient's serum levels. High chloride and low glucose concentrations in fluid compared with serum indicate the presence of CSF. In addition, the presence of beta-2 transferrin in fluid confirms the presence of CSF [51] (Table 25.1).

The depression of bone fragments into the orbit may cause exophthalmos, proptosis, or ptosis. A depressed injury also causes restricted ocular movement if the superior rectus muscle, the superior oblique muscle, or the trochlea is damaged [47, 48]. The medial orbital wall fractures associated with NOE fractures can also cause enophthalmos.

A thorough examination is important to distinguish between a nasal fracture and an unstable NOE fracture. The examiner should place the thumb and index finger over the medial canthus bilaterally. Mobility of these fragments may vary, but any movement implies instabil

ity and requires open reduction and stabilization [40]. A ruler or caliper should be used to measure the intercanthal distance. The normal distance is between 28.6 and  $33.0\mathrm{mm}$  for adult women and is between 28.9 and  $34.5\mathrm{mm}$  for adult men. Increased widths suggest an NOE fracture.

Two tests that can aid in the diagnosis of instability of the medial canthus are the "bowstring" test and the bimanual examination. The bowstring test involves pulling the lid laterally while palpating the tendon area to detect movement of fracture segments [52, 53]. The bimanual examination requires placing an instrument (e.g., Kelly clamp) high into the nose, with its tip directly beneath the MCT. Gentle lifting with the contralateral finger palpates the canthal tendons and allows an assessment of the instability of the tendon attachment and the necessity for open reduction [54]. The Furnas test may also be performed by grasping the skin overlying the medial canthus with a small tissue forceps [52] (Fig. 25.5). A lack of creasing or resistance by the underlying bone is indicative of an underlying fracture [55]. These injuries are associated with significant energy transfer and associated neurologic injuries must be looked for and excluded, as must other injuries of the facial skeleton.

# 25.3.2 Imaging

Adequate imaging is key to assessing NOE and frontal sinus fractures and planning good treatment to prevent poor outcomes after the treatment. Previously, Waters' projections, reverse Towne's projections, lateral skull films, and laminar tomograms were used to visualize midface and upper face fractures. Today, computed tomography (CT) scans are the gold standard for imaging these fractures [5, 9, 23, 40, 56-60] (Fig. 25.6).

The plane of choice for frontal sinus imaging is the axial view, preferably with slice thicknesses of 1.0 or  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  [19, 29, 33]. The high degree of detail required for imaging NOE fractures necessitates axial and coronal views with slice thicknesses of 1.0 or  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  [28, 40]. Indeed, it has been shown that for severe fractures of the NOE region, two- and three-dimensional CT scans pro

vide the most information about the medial orbital wall, the medial maxillary buttress, and the piriform aperture [40, 61].

# 25.3.3 Patency of the NFOT

Although the newest CT scanners provide exceptional views and can often provide slices through the NFOT, evidence of their reliability in detecting obstruction of the outflow is scant [58, 59]. Obstruction should be suspected with fractures involving the medial supraorbital rim or the frontal bone with nasal ethmoidal component fractures, and it should always be considered when a CSF leak is present [26]. In these situations, an open or intraoperative evaluation of patency is indicated. This evaluation is important because the condition of the nasofrontal outflow has the most influence on the health

of the frontal sinus [17, 19, 26, 36, 58, 62-66-70] (Fig. 25.7). Recent studies showed that up to  $98.5\%$  of complications involved NFOT injury and blockage [24].

# 25.3.4 Classification of NOE Fractures

As with all fractures, NOE fractures are classified as unilateral or bilateral, open or closed, and simple or comminuted. Three types of NOE fractures have been well described [28, 40, 42, 71]. A type I fracture maintains the attachment of the MCT to a large single nasoethmoidal fracture segment. Repairing this type of fracture is straightforward. A type II fracture shows more comminution yet maintains the attachment of the medial can

thus to a sizable bony segment. Type III fractures display severe comminution with possible avulsion of the MCT from its bony attachment (  $\square$  Fig. 25.8).

# 25.3.5 Classification of Frontal Sinus Fractures

Traditional fracture classifications can be used with reference to frontal bone fractures (e.g., open or closed). Numerous other classification schemes have been proposed in the surgical literature in an attempt to simplify surgical decision-making. Although these schemes are well intended, some are so complex that they actually complicate decision-making and are of no value. Consideration must always be given to the condition of the anterior table, the posterior table, and the nasofrontal outflow and the presence of comorbid intracranial injury and concomitant craniomaxillofacial injuries [5, 8, 11, 17, 67-72]. The simplest and most helpful classification schemes distinguish possible complications and treatments on the basis of types of fractures.

Treatment of isolated anterior table fractures is indicated to prevent cosmetic deformities. Posterior table fractures, alone or in combination with anterior table fractures, should be treated so that neurologic sequelae, including meningitis and brain abscess, can be avoided. Combinations of fractures that compromise the NFOT should be treated so that the development of mucoceles and pyoceles can be prevented. These fracture combinations include fractures of the anterior table and the pos

terior table, fractures of the anterior table and the NOE, and fractures of the anterior table and the medial superior orbital rim.

# Key Points

Clinical findings of mobility of nasal bones, depression of the radix, traumatic telecanthus, and a wide flattened nasal dorsum are indicative of an NOE injury.  
Disruption of the posterior table may result in CSF leakage, detected by high  $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ , and low glucose concentration, or presence of  $\beta$ -2 transferrin.  
Positive bowstring test or mobility of medial canthus-bearing fragments on bimanual palpation requires open reduction and stabilization.  
- NOE injuries are associated with significant energy transfer and require examination for associated neurologic injuries.  
Maxillofacial CT scans with thin cuts and 3D reconstruction are important diagnostic tools in frontal sinus and NOE fractures.

# 25.4 Treatment

# 25.4.1 Treatment Goals

The primary goals of treating frontal sinus fractures are the creation of a safe sinus so that the risk of long-term complications is minimized and protection of the brain. Cosmesis is a major secondary goal and in NOE fractures involves the restoration of orbital volume, eyelid function, lacrimal drainage, and overall cosmesis. Identification of these goals is important in planning treatment, because it is important to achieve the functional goals while at the same time ensuring that the cosmetic goals are not compromised.

# 25.4.2 Surgical Access

Adequate exposure is essential to allow accurate reduction and fixation of fractures as well as any adjuvant procedures such as bone grafting. The coronal approach provides the best access to the frontal bone and sinus and produces the most desirable cosmetic results [5, 9, 19, 65]. Although lacerations may be considered as an approach to access the fracture, their size and shape rarely provide enough access without undue and unsightly extension. Gull-wing or spectacle incisions result in unattractive scars that are highly visible because of their prominence on the brow and the resulting reflec

tion of light. These scars can be camouflaged only with wide-rimmed glasses. The "open sky" approach is equally deforming, leaving an H-shaped scar over the brows and nasion, and like the gull-wing incision, is best avoided.

Although the coronal approach has been well described [73], the preparation required for a coronal incision varies. If a neurosurgical procedure is anticipated, the hair may be shaved and the skin degreased with alcohol and then prepared using an antimicrobial skin preparation agent, preferably povidone-iodine solution. If a neurosurgical procedure is not anticipated, the hair should be parted coronally from the preauricular region to the preauricular region. Water-soluble lubricant is helpful in maintaining the part. The hair may then be braided in multiple pigtails and gathered anteriorly and posteriorly on either side of the part.

Local anesthetic with a vasoconstrictor is used to aid in scalp hemostasis. Electrocautery should not be used for the initial incision because it may damage hair follicles. The incision is made to the depth of the loose aponeurotic layer. The flap is undermined along this plane and above the periosteum in an anterior direction. Historically, Raney clips have been used to help with hemostasis. However, hemorrhage may occur when these clips are removed, and electrocautery may need to be used carefully at the end of the procedure. There are also concerns that Raney clips may cause crush injuries to the follicles and compromise scar camouflage.

The flap is elevated to within  $2.0\mathrm{cm}$  of the fracture or within  $3.0\mathrm{cm}$  of the supraorbital rims. The pericranium is then incised, and the reflection of the flap continues deep to the pericranium so that the branches of the facial nerve can be protected. Further reflection can be obtained with greater exposure by extension of the preauricular incision, galeal splitting (if a vascularized galeal flap is not anticipated), or release of the supraorbital nerve from its foramen or notch. If a pericranial flap is likely to be required, the coronal flap should be planned to allow the pericranial flap to be designed and elevated during the exposure.

# 25.4.3 Osseous Recovery and Access

Recovery of bony fragments in comminuted fractures is best undertaken during the reflection of the coronal flap. Fragments of the anterior table should be released from the periosteum and removed one at a time. Some method of organizing the fragments should be used. For example, the fragments could be numbered and their positions recorded on a map. They should be arranged in the same order on a back table. If contaminated, segments of bone may be cleansed with copious irrigation, scrub

bing, and even povidone-iodine solution, before being used for reconstruction as free grafts [74]. Once the anterior table has been removed, access should be adequate for sinus exploration, posterior table inspection, and sinus floor (nasofrontal outflow) evaluation.

If a more extensive neurosurgical procedure is anticipated, osseous recovery may be performed in concert with a craniotomy bone flap. Before small fragments are recovered, the osseous flap design should be mapped out on the frontal bone (with care taken to avoid the sagittal sinus). Bur holes are created at three or four corners of the frontal bone. The tenuous and adherent dura is released through the bur holes, and a craniotome is used to connect the bur holes. The dura is carefully reflected as the bone flap is removed. Recovery of the rest of the osseous fragments can then be completed.

A perimeter-marking technique can be used for the removal of the anterior table that is unfractured [68]. The removal of the entire anterior table is important when obliteration of the sinus is anticipated because this procedure requires thorough removal of sinus mucosa. One side of a hemostat or pick-up instrument can be inserted into the sinus, and a small bur hole can be made at the tip of the superficial arm of the instrument. Fixation plates can be adapted before the removal of the remaining anterior table segment.

# 25.4.4 Intraoperative Evaluation of the NFOT

After access has been obtained and osseous exploration and recovery have been performed, the condition of the frontal sinus floor and the nasofrontal outflow can be assessed by direct visualization (see Fig. 25.7). The relative patency of the system can then be evaluated by placing an angiocatheter into the nasofrontal duct and introducing an appropriate fluid medium so that flow can be assessed. A  $3.8\mathrm{-cm}$  (1.5-inch) 18-gauge angiocatheter is the best instrument for this purpose. Patency can be confirmed by introducing normal saline and observing its emergence from beneath the medial turbinate or its collection in the posterior pharynx (Fig. 25.9). Because of its dramatic hue, methylene blue dye has been offered as an appropriate fluid for evaluating patency. However, this blue dye can disrupt the visualization of the surgical field because completely removing the dye is difficult during a surgical procedure (Fig. 25.10). Fluorescein is an excellent alternative because it is clear, colorless, water-soluble, and radiolucent [76]. However, its visualization sometimes requires using an ultraviolet light source and then dimming the operating room lights. Radiopaque dye has been suggested for use as a diagnostic medium for nasofrontal

duct fractures, but its visualization requires a C-arm fluoroscopy unit [64]. Moreover, any spilled radiopaque dye must be completely cleared before additional radiographs or CT images are obtained. Other fluids can be used to check for patency, including propofol, sterile baby formula, or indigo carmine dye, but Congo red should not be used as it is neurotoxic.

# 25.4.5 Anterior Table Fractures

The thinnest area of the frontal bone is the region of the glabella, the anterior wall of the frontal sinus, and this region is highly susceptible to fracture. These fractures may seem straightforward but still deserve careful attention. Simple greenstick or nondisplaced anterior wall fractures do not require operative treatment [77]. Displaced anterior table fractures typically require reduction. Displacement greater than the thickness of the anterior table is an often-used rule of thumb to indicate the need for reduction. The surgeon should closely inspect the sinus floor, the posterior wall, and the patency of the nasofrontal duct. If the posterior wall and the floor are free of injury, the pieces of the anterior wall may be fixated with low-profile bone plates [37, 72, 74, 75, 78-81]. Any void remaining in the anterior wall after reconstruction can be closed by placing titanium

mesh, methylmethacrylate, or other bone substitutes. The soft tissue injuries may then be repaired.

# 25.4.6 Posterior Table Fractures

Fractures to the posterior table of the frontal sinus are more concerning because of the proximity to the anterior cranial fossae (Fig. 25.11). Posterior table fractures can be subclassified into three categories:

nondisplaced, displaced, and displaced with gross neurologic injury. Each of the subclassesifications is invariably associated with anterior wall penetration. Each is treated differently, and each requires neurosurgical consultation or joint management with a neurosurgeon. Antibiotic coverage is particularly important in preventing infection with these fractures [13].

The surgeon should check carefully for any displacement of the fracture, CSF leak, entrapment of sinus membranes, or dural tears. If the injury is not substantial and the nasofrontal duct is patent, the anterior table is replaced and fixed and the soft tissue injuries are repaired. Comminution of the posterior table, penetrating injury, CSF leak with extensive dural damage, or frontal lobe damage requires frontal sinus cranialization. This involves complete removal of the posterior table, thereby effectively increasing the size of the anterior cranial fossa [5, 17, 62, 63, 66, 72]. In one review of cases, as many as  $16\%$  of patients undergoing frontal sinus surgery required a cranialization procedure [5]. In such a case, the posterior table is gently removed, with either a diamond bur or rongeurs. Care should be taken in the area of the sagittal sinus to avoid violation of it, which can result in severe bleeding. All irregularities of the sinus are smoothed with a bur. After bone removal,

the dura should be repaired with primary closure, a fascia or synthetic patch, or a galeal/pericranial flap [5, 72].

The wound is closed in layers. Strict attention must be given to meticulous removal of all of the mucosal elements from the walls, cul-de-sacs, and septa of the sinus and from all bone fragments [82-84]. Failure to remove such elements may result in a mucocele or pyocele. The mucosa is then reflected down into the nasofrontal outflow, and the orifice is obstructed by local bone or muscle, and often a pericranial flap. Finally, the anterior table is reassembled and restored as would be done for a simple anterior wall fracture.

It is important to note, that more recent data with large patient cohorts published over the last 10 years have been favoring more conservative approaches, even in cases with a CSF leak, and no significant posterior table displacement. CSF leaks observed for several days postinjury resolve in most cases. In many cases the burden of other injuries may favor an expectant approach with close observation [25, 67-70].

# 25.4.7 Orbital Roof and Supraorbital Bar Reconstruction

Once the posterior wall and the sinus floor have been explored, inspected, and evaluated for damage, any orbital roof and supraorbital bar fractures may be reconstructed. After these procedures have been completed, the sinus is ready to be obliterated and the nasofrontal outflow obstructed. The free osseous fragments that have been recovered, mapped, and arranged on a back table should be rigorously cutted for removal of any respiratory epithelium that could become trapped between them during reconstruction. Every remnant of respiratory epithelium should be removed from every crevice and cul-de-sac so that the possibility of future mucocele formation is minimized. This procedure is followed with local ostectomy with a no. 8 round diamond bur and copious amounts of saline. The arranged bone fragments should be consolidated with titanium microscrews  $(1.0 - 1.3\mathrm{mm})$  and with appropriate plates, mesh, or both [85, 86]. Mesh has an advantage in that it provides support and consolidation of the segments in three planes of space [85, 86] (Fig. 25.12). Titanium mesh has been shown to be compatible with soft tissue, undergoing incorporation with indigenous cells [87]. Resorbable technology continues to show promise, even though resorbable systems currently available are not as versatile as titanium mesh in their ability to be contoured or to stabilize small bone fragments. Before final placement of the consolidated titanium and bone segments, the sinus should be copiously irrigated and hemostasis achieved [88].

# 25.4.8 Nasofrontal Outflow Tract (NFOT) Obstruction

NFOT obstruction should not be confused with sinus obliteration. Sinus obliteration is the elimination of dead space by the introduction of another material. Obstruction is one of the methods of isolating the sinus

(or brain) from nasal contamination, basically by plugging it with another material.

As stated previously, the condition of the NFOT is the most important factor in maintaining the health of the frontal sinus [17, 19, 26, 36, 58, 62-66]. This outflow permits the exit of mucin, seroma, or hematoma after injury. If the outflow tract is obstructed, complications including sinusitis, meningitis, or osteomyelitis may develop. The condition of the outflow should be considered in the evaluation of fractures involving the NOE complex, the supraorbital rim, or the sinus floor. In recent studies, correlation of CT findings and operative findings demonstrated the presence of three preoperative CT criteria including fracture of the frontal sinus floor, fracture of the medial aspect of the anterior table, and outflow tract obstruction, significantly correlated with a damaged NFOT [1].

If the outflow is not patent, obliteration of the sinus is indicated and is performed through removal of every possible remnant of sinus mucosa by curettage [17, 62, 76, 83, 84]. This procedure should be carried out as previously described, using copious amounts of irrigation and with the aid of magnification. Any remaining remnants of the nasofrontal mucosa are then inverted into the nose.

A number of materials can be used to obstruct the nasofrontal outflow. Temporal fascia, temporal muscle, or both can be harvested from the adjacent temporal region. Tensor fascia lata is another alternative, but it may produce morbidity at the second surgical site. Estimating the surface area to be covered is an important technical point. A suture package is a good template for measurement of required size and recording those measurements. Because fascia shrinks, it is important to harvest approximately  $20\%$  more graft material than is indicated by the template. Bone graft material to use for tract closure can be harvested from the sinus septum, the inner table, or elsewhere on the cranium [89].

Commercial tissue sealants prepared from human plasma and containing bovine-derived aprotinin are available. These sealants have been shown to be effective tissue adhesives and hemostatic agents [90-92]. Autologous platelet gel and autologous fibrin glue have also been used for similar indications [93-94]. Whatever products are chosen, the organization and arrangement of the obstructive media are important. For example, a tissue sealant may be placed after the inversion of the sinus mucosa. Fascia or muscle may then be introduced into the remnants of the outflow tract to block passage of nasal contaminants, followed by inertable cranium or remnants of septal bone from the sinus, followed by another layer of tissue sealant. Tissue sealants can be used effectively to seal off the sinus from the nasal cavity when they are applied layer by layer as described previously.

# 25.4.9 Sinus Obliteration

NFOT obstruction is necessary to seal off the frontal sinus from nasal contaminants. Sinus obliteration adds one more layer to the seal but also eliminates the "dead space" or air within the sinus that may permit fluids to accumulate to cause a seroma or a hematoma. Historically, sinus obliteration has been accomplished in a number of ways, including inserting no substance or object (theoretically permitting bone fill after curettage) or by insertion of another material. Historically use of materials such as hydroxylapatite, glass wool, bone, cartilage, muscle, absorbable gelatin sponge, absorbable knitted fabric, acrylic, and fat has been reported, with most practitioners favoring fat obliteration [13, 83, 84, 96-102]. Fat has been the most commonly reported substance in recent literature over the last two decades, with a trend towards more conservative approaches. In many instances, a pericranial flap or galeal flap can be used for the obliteration of the sinus (Fig. 25.13). These flaps are raised from the coronal approach and are pedicled flaps that can be very versatile for isolating intracranial contents. They are vascularized and robust and have the advantage of not requiring a second surgical site for harvest [88].

The use of fat has been reported most frequently, and this method historically has provided the most desirable results. Harvesting fat is simple and may be performed by liposuction or an open approach [99]. With the traditional open approach, a transverse semilunar incision is made within the "bikini" line,  $5.0~\mathrm{cm}$  superior to the symphysis pubis (Pfannenstiel's incision). The incision is carried through the skin and subcuticular tissue to the fat. The fat is grasped with an Allis clamp and retracted. Scissors are used to dissect the fat subcutaneously, moving laterally, inferiorly, superiorly, and caudally to the fascia overlying the abdominis rectus muscles, which are then connected, releasing the fat. Irrigation and meticulous attention to hemostasis are important before the closure of the incision to avoid hematoma and infection. A  $2\mathrm{cm}$  periumbilical incision offers the most cosmetic scar for fat graft harvest with harvest occurring from a plane  $1\mathrm{cm}$  deep to the skin to yield  $15 - 20~\mathrm{mL}$  of fat for use in the sinus. However, it is important to note that more recent studies have shown increased rates of complications as high as  $22\%$  in cases of obliteration using fat [24]. Complication rates in cases treated surgically using obliteration or cranialization have been reported in the range of  $9 - 16\%$  [24, 69]. Cranialization has been traditionally reserved for the most severe injuries involving the posterior table. Delay for more than 48 hours in patients requiring operative intervention has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections [103, 104].

# 25.4.10 Endoscopy in the Management of Frontal Fractures

Increased experience in endoscopy and the desire to optimize cosmesis by minimizing cutaneous scars has led some surgeons to apply the use of endoscopic techniques to the treatment of frontal sinus fractures [105]. Endoscopic techniques have been described for the reduction and fixation of anterior table fractures and for the management of the frontal sinus drainage system. Endoscopy can also be used for the secondary management of contour defects of the frontal bone [105]. In recent studies as many as  $61\%$  of surgeons felt that endoscopic surgery has changed the management of frontal sinus fractures, and  $36\%$  favored endoscopic management of uncomplicated displaced frontal sinus outflow tract fractures. Recent advancements in endoscopic techniques, instrumentation, and intraoperative navigation have allowed for the preservation of sinus function after trauma [67, 68]. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery with navigation is likely to play an increasing role in future management [105].

# 25.4.11 NOE Reconstruction

Early surgical management is important in the reduction of NOE fractures [28, 42, 49]. The deformities that result from unrepaired NOE fractures are severe and difficult to correct. Correction often requires NOE osteotomies and grafting and satisfactory results are rarely achieved.

In addition to the coronal approach, complete exposure of the NOE area often necessitates lower eyelid incisions (transconjunctival or subciliary) and a maxillary vestibular incision [37]. These approaches aid in the treatment of displaced infraorbital rims and maxillary antrum or piriform rims.

Type I fractures can at times be reduced transnasally and treated without fixation. More often, single-segment NOE fractures are reduced through a coronal incision and secured at the nasofrontal junction, the maxillary buttress, and the infraorbital rims [40, 42].

Transnasal wiring historically has been recommended for fractures graded as Markowitz type II or higher [19]. In spite of the improvements in rigid fixation (bone plates and screws), complete reduction of

the NOE area and reattachment of the MCT, or replacement of a small bone segment, never seem to be adequate with microplates alone. For NOE fractures including avulsion of the MCT or in which the MCT is attached to a small bone segment, transnasal wiring should be considered. Recently, techniques have been developed to allow easier capture of the medial cantal apparatus and improved fixation of the medial canthus. The point of fixation of the wires should be directed posterior and superior to the lacrimal fossa so that the medial canthal distance is decreased and widening of the nasal bones and blunting of the medial canthal area can be avoided [19]. Wires must be passed through the medial orbital bone and the superior nasal septum or the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. Their passage can be facilitated with the use of a spinal needle or a wire-passing awl. Drill holes can also be used to aid in wire passing. Some clinicians have advocated temporary removal of the nasal bone for identification of the "canthal-bearing bone" and for facilitation of the passage of transnasal wires [19, 40]. The MCT and its bony segment can be incorporated into the transnasal wire fixation or an avulsed MCT can be attached to the transnasal wire with sutures. Slight overcorrection of the medial canthal distance is desired. In cases in which fracture comminution prevents an adequate fixation of the MCT to a bone segment, stabilization with fixation to a calvarial bone graft has been advocated [40]. In cases in which sufficient medial orbital wall remains, placing a microplate and screw for attachment of the MCT behind the lacrimal crest has been suggested [42].

Bone grafting may often be necessary in cases of severe comminution of the nasal bones or the medial orbital walls. Onlay of cranial bone grafts to maintain dorsal height and nasal tip projection can be performed through a coronal incision, and these grafts should be fixed rigidly.

# 25.4.12 Medical Therapy of the Sinus Postoperatively

Saline solution nasal spray can reduce symptoms of rhinosinusitis [106]. This therapy can prevent crusting of the nasolacrimal duct as well as the frontonasal duct and the ostia of the maxillary sinus. Because this treatment is inexpensive and involves little or no risk, it can reasonably be made a part of postoperative care regimens.

There have been no clinical trials related to posttraumatic medical treatment of the sinus. However, for patients in whom the frontal sinus has been left intact, there may be at least a temporary decrease in function of the mucociliary apparatus [107, 108], which may be com

pounded by postsurgical edema. Mucolytics have been advocated for use in patients with rhinosinusitis to thin the mucus secretions and to improve clearance [106, 110]. During the posttraumatic or postoperative period, the use of mucolytics such as guaifenesin may be beneficial.

Decongestants may also be considered in the immediate postoperative period. Decongestant medications (e.g., pseudoephedrine or oxymetazoline hydrochloride) act by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. This action causes vasoconstriction in the respiratory mucosa, thereby shrinking the mucosa and increasing the size of the airways or ducts [10, 106, 109]. Topical agents have fewer systemic side effects but are known to have a rebound potential and should be used for no more than 3 days.

Because there is no consensus regarding the use of postoperative antibiotics, their use should be based on the individual patient and type of injury. The extent of soft tissue injury, presence of wound contamination, a concomitant CSF leak, and other associated injuries should all be considered. Current recommendations regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics for head and neck injuries include a duration of therapy of no more than 24 hours [111, 112]. In cases of contamination by a foreign body, antibiotic treatment may be continued for 10 days. In the absence of gross contamination of the wound, a limited number of postoperative antibiotic doses can be considered, or no antibiotics can be given [114]. Antibiotics currently used to treat acute rhinosinusitis include amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, cefpodoxime proxetil, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole [106]. Penicillin is still the drug of choice for treating facial fractures [113]. Delay of more than 48 hours in operative management in patients requiring intervention has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections [103].

The goal of NOE fractures is the restoration of orbital volume, eyelid function, and lacrimal drainage, while maintaining cosmesis  
In NOE reconstruction, MCT disruption should be repaired by fixation with transnasal wire posterior and superior to the lacrimal fossa  
The coronal flap provides the best surgical access, and best cosmetic results  
- Anticipation of cranialization requires careful flap design and preparation with neurosurgery consultation

- Displacement greater than the thickness of the anterior table typically requires reduction to restore aesthetics  
Displaced posterior table fractures require neurosurgical consultation and evaluation for CSF leak and antibiotic coverage  
- Comminution of the posterior table, penetrating injury, CSF leak with extensive dural damage, or frontal lobe damage are indications for cranialization  
- When obliterating the frontal sinus, all mucosa elements must be removed to prevent mucocele formation

Medical treatment using saline nasal spray, mucolytics, and decongestants is an important aspect of posttraumatic treatment, with antibiotics having a role in contaminated cases

# 25.5 Complications

Complications of frontal bone injury vary in severity and may occur many years after the injury. The principal types of complications are those that occur directly at the time of injury, those of an infectious nature, and those that are chronic problems.

The most devastating complications are neurologic problems resulting from displacement or penetration of the frontal bones into the brain. These injuries can result in a concussion, severe brain injury, or death. Displacement of the floor of the frontal bone can cause orbital damage and the most frequent ocular complication is diplopia. Damage to the superior oblique muscles or trochlea may result in a limited range of motion of the eye globe. Severing of the supraorbital nerve by the injury or during reflection of the osteoplastic flap leaves a permanent anesthesia in the distribution of the forehead [115]. Trauma to the floor of the frontal sinus or displacement of the medial supraorbital rim may cause a CSF leak. Generally, reduction of the fractures corrects this problem. If it is persistent, however, the neurosurgical repair is indicated.

Infectious complications most frequently arise from occlusion of the nasofrontal duct or contamination of the sinus by penetrating foreign bodies. The most fre

sequently encountered infection is meningitis [98]. If the nasofrontal duct is occluded, blood may accumulate in the sinus, creating an environment that is conducive to the growth of anaerobic bacteria [24, 107]. Frontal sinus abscess is spread by direct extension through small fractures of the frontal bone or transosseous anastomotic vessels [63]. The result of this extension of infection is brain abscess, meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or (if the abscess is long term) osteomyelitis.

Mucoceles are the most common chronic problems [116-118]. Respiratory mucosa trapped between fracture segments or left behind during obliteration procedures may continue to grow. This continued growth may lead to the formation of mucoceles or pyoceles. The size of the growth determines how much damage occurs to adjacent bone and neurologic tissue. Frontal sinus imaging (CT or magnetic resonance imaging) should be ordered to detect a postoperative mucocele or pyocele. Imaging studies should be performed at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery or whenever symptoms appear [119]. Complications can occur as late as 20 years postoperatively, and patients should be encouraged to have routine yearly follow-ups [63].

Pain and headache may be chronic and may persist without an identifiable cause [27]. Cosmetic deformities such as contour deficits and irregularities stem from several causes. Bone loss at the time of injury may not be noticed for months. Osteomyelitis with subsequent débridement leaves voids in bone. Even if the fractures are properly treated at the time of injury, remodeling may leave irregularities.

Anosmia, the loss of the sense of smell, and hyposmia are known complications of NOE fractures and can occur in as many as  $38\%$  of patients with high central midface fractures [120]. In addition,  $23\%$  of patients with high midface fractures report a decreased sense of taste (hypogeusia) [37, 120].

# 25.5.1 Dacryocystorhinostomy

Impairment of the lacrimal drainage system after NOE fractures can give rise to epiphora, which may give rise to significant symptoms. Identification of the site of the obstruction can be helpful in treatment planning. Although CT scanning might demonstrate injuries likely to cause impaired drainage, it does not show the functional state of the lacrimal system. Jones tests can be used to assess the patency of the lacrimal system.

There are two components to the Jones tests. In the Jones I (primary dye) test, fluorescein dye is instilled into the inferior cul-de-sac of the eye. After 5 minutes, a cotton-tipped applicator is placed under the inferior turbinate of the nose. The failure to retrieve any fluores

cein from the inferior meatus implies that a blockage is present. The site of the blockage can be determined using the Jones II (secondary dye) test. The Jones II test begins by irrigating the inferior cul-de-sac to remove any residual fluorescein. The lacrimal punctum is anesthetized, and an irrigation catheter is inserted to allow some saline to be washed through the system. If it is then possible to detect fluorescein at the inferior meatus, the obstruction is incomplete. If no fluid at all is detected, the obstruction to the lower system is complete. If saline only is collected, this indicates an obstruction of the upper collecting system, because the dye is not collected into the system but it is possible to irrigate saline through. Impaired drainage may be due to edema and be self-limiting. Persisting epiphora may require a formal repair of the drainage system. Gruss and coworkers [121] reported that the majority of patients with NOE fractures demonstrate adequate drainage with only  $17\%$  requiring a formal repair of the drainage system.

Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the repair of the lacrimal drainage system through the creation of a new "ostomy" or tract from the lacrimal canaliculi to the nasal cavity. Techniques that have been described include open (external), endonasal, and soft tissue conjunctivorhinostomy [122-124].

Perhaps the best-described technique is the open DCR. This procedure is performed through a  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  vertical incision placed  $10 - 12\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the medial canthus of the affected eye. Blunt dissection is then used to approach the lacrimal crest. A periosteal incision is followed by careful dissection of the lacrimal sac away from the bony fossa, and an osteotomy is placed posterior to the lacrimal crest. The deep surface of the bone in this region is lined with nasal mucosa, which should remain intact during the osteotomy. Placement of a lacrimal probe can facilitate visualization of the lacrimal sac. After the sac has been freed, it is incised on its medial surface, and superior and inferior releasing incisions are made on the superficial side of the sac (posterior flap). This procedure is followed by a vertical incision of the nasal mucosa and anterior releasing incisions (anterior flap). At this point, Crawford tubes are used to intubate both the superior and the inferior canalulii. When intubation is complete, the ends of the Crawford tubes are visible in the lacrimal sac and can be inserted through the lacrimal osteotomy and retrieved intranasally inferior to the middle turbinate. These ends are then cut to extend to the nasal vestibule and are sutured in place to the lateral nasal wall [43, 123] (Fig. 25.14).

Closure is then begun with anastomosis of the lacrimal sac and the nasal mucosa. The anterior flap of the nasal mucosa is closed to the posterior flap of the lacrimal sac. Often, this is technically challenging, and an

alternative is to suture the anterior lacrimal sac flap to the periosteum to maintain the opening between the lacrimal sac and the nasal mucosa. Care should be taken to avoid suturing the retained polymeric silicone tubing during flap closure. The remainder of the incision is closed in two layers. The tubing is left in place for 4-6 months, and patients should use saline nasal sprays to prevent crusting of the tubes (Fig. 25.15).

The endonasal approach is conceptually the same procedure, except that the dissection is performed from inside the nose with the aid of endoscopic instruments and a fiberoptic light, which are introduced into the sac through the canaliculi. The nasal mucosa is incised and reflected over an area transilluminated from above. The illuminated area is most commonly seen beneath the middle turbinate, which may need to be displaced medially so that appropriate exposure can be obtained. The transilluminating light can be seen most readily through the lacrimal bone posterior to the frontal process of the maxilla. The frontal process can be removed with a Freer elevator or a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur. The lacrimal sac is then gently lifted free from the lacrimal bone with a Freer elevator. The thin lacrimal bone overlying the sac is then removed. An opening is then made into the lacrimal sac, and the Crawford tubing is inserted as before. Polymeric silicone tubes are left in place for 1 month, and saline spray and lacrimal irrigation are recommended [124].

# Key Points

Anatomic violations resulting from fractures include brain injury, CSF leak, or globe injury  
- Mucoceles are the most common chronic complication and can occur many years postinjury, necessitating regular follow up  
Obstruction of NFOT can lead to infection including meningitis  
Jones tests check the patency of the lacrimal drainage system  
Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) restores lacrimal system drainage into the nasal cavity

# 25.6 Correction of Posttraumatic Deformity

Six months to 1 year after the initial surgical correction, secondary deformities of the frontal bone may be addressed. Contour defects result from failure to fully elevate depressed fractures, from voids in bone loss at the time of the trauma, and from infection. A multiplicity of materials has been used to correct contour defects, including bone from the adjacent calvaria, ileum, or rib; cartilage; titanium or stainless steel; polymeric silicone,

methylmethacrylate, hydroxylapatite granules, silver, a cobalt-chromium alloy, polytef, polyethylene terephthalate fiber, nylon, polyethylene, and aluminum [125, 126]. The procedures for correcting such defects involve one-stage indirect prosthetic techniques, two-stage techniques, single-stage direct techniques, or computer-generated single-stage techniques [127-129].

The one-stage indirect technique requires that an impression be taken of the defect through the skin. The impression negative is then filled with plaster to form a

positive image on which an onlay prosthesis may be fabricated. Acrylic, polyethylene, tantalum, titanium, and cobalt-chromium prostheses may be fabricated with this technique. A full-thickness flap is then reflected, and the prosthesis is secured.

The single-stage direct technique requires that a full-thickness flap be reflected beyond the margins of the defect. Onlay cartilage or bone grafts then may be secured if an autograft is desired. Otherwise, an acrylic resin may be used. The bone is moistened, and acrylic is

mixed and placed on a glass or polytef slab and rolled to a uniform thickness. The acrylic is placed directly over the bone and covered with a sheet of separating foil. The full-thickness flap is replaced to ensure proper contour and then is again reflected. A copious amount of saline is used to irrigate the area so that the material does not cause thermal damage to the skull. The flap is then replaced and sutured.

Improvements in computer design and technology now enable the fabrication of prostheses for one-stage reconstructions. The patient undergoes a three-dimensional CT before the operative procedure is performed [127]. A computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) protocol is then used to create a model of the frontal bone and defect. A prosthesis may be created from polymeric silicone, acrylic, cobalt-chromium alloy, or hydroxylapatite-coated metals. During the operative procedure, the prosthesis is inserted as described previously.

In cases complicated by multiple infective episodes, removal of the infected tissue and recruitment of vascularized tissue using free-tissue transfer and vascularized flaps can provide an elegant solution [37, 104].

# Conclusion

Frontal sinus and NOE fractures are relatively infrequent and most occur as a result of high energy motor vehicle collisions in younger patients, and have the potential for high morbidity. Anatomic violations resulting from fractures of the buttresses of the face include brain injury, CSF leak, or globe injury. Clinical examination of patients must evaluate for NFOT

obstruction, the status of the medial canthal tendon, and lacrimal function. Obstruction, posterior table displacement, CSF leak, cosmetic defect, orbital volume distortion, and MCT disruption, are operative indications, with the coronal flap often granting the best access. NFOT obstruction is the most important factor in determining the need for sinus obliteration, and MCT status for NOE repair and reestablishment of the proper anatomic relationship and function. The goal of NOE fractures is the restoration of orbital volume, eyelid function, and lacrimal drainage, while maintaining cosmesis. Appropriate surgical intervention will correct posttraumatic deformity and minimize infectious complications and mucoceles. Technological improvements and 3D capabilities make the management of frontal sinus and NOE trauma much more predictable.
