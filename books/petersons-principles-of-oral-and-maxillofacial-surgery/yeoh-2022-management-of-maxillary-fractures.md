# 22.1 Introduction

The maxilla is situated between the cranial base superiorly and the dental occlusal plane inferiorly. Due to its intimate association with the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the orbits contained adjacent and within, it makes the maxilla a functionally and cosmetically vital structure. When the maxilla is fractured, making a timely diagnosis and repair of the fracture can prevent the injury from being potentially life threatening as well as disfiguring. This chapter reviews and discusses the etiology, anatomic patterns of fracture, and the complexity and nuances of repair and complications.

# 22.2 History

Although maxillary fractures are commonly classified according to the Le Fort system, these fractures were described and treated thousands of years before René Le Fort was born. The first clinical examination of a maxillary fracture was recorded in 2500 BC in the Smith Papyrus [1]. Many other early records describe treatments for traumatic maxillary fractures or the iatrogenic

fracture of the maxilla for therapeutic purposes. For example, Charles Fredrick William Reiche provided the first detailed treatise of maxillary fractures, entitled De Maxillae Superiors Fractura, in 1822 [1]. During the following year, Carl Ferdinand van Graefe described the use of a head frame for treating a maxillary fracture [1]. His device was as technically complex as those currently in use. In 1859 Bernhard R. K. Von Langenbeck reported a technique for the osteoplastic resection of the maxilla [2]. Eight years later, David Cheever discussed the complete mobilization of the maxilla with the use of chisels for the removal of a nasopharyngeal tumor [3]. In 1893 Otto Lanz also described the creation of an iatrogenic maxillary fracture for access to a tumor.

In Garretson's 1898 treatise, the primary method of treating fractures of the maxillae was to construct a bandage or dressing that elevated the mandible into occlusion and secure it in place [4]. A number of materials were used to add stability to these bandages, including plaster of Paris, wood, gutta-percha, and vulcanized rubber. In addition to splinting the jaws, Garretson advocated the use of interdental splints, stating "As a means of dressing in any complicated jaw fracture, the interdental splint is as invaluable and reliable as it is simple of construction and easy of application" [4].

It was not until 1901 that René Le Fort reported his landmark works, a three-part experiment using 32 cadavers that were either intact or decapitated [5-7]. The heads of the cadavers were subjected to various types of trauma; the soft tissue was then removed, and the bones were examined. Le Fort noted that, generally, if the face was fractured, the skull was not. He then stated that fractures occurred through three weak lines in the facial bony structure: those that protect the cranial cavity, those that circumscribe the midface, and those that cut across the face. From these three lines, the Le Fort classification system was developed (Fig. 22.1).

Blair gave a very good description of the anatomy of maxillary fractures and of the examination for diagnosis [8]. He noted that mandibular bandages were insufficient to stabilize maxillary fractures and advocated a maxillary splint, quoting an authority of the day, Dr. John L. Marshall:

Impressions of the upper and lower teeth were taken with the modeling compound by first molding it upon the upper teeth and while it was yet soft forcing the lower jaw upward until a correct occlusion of the teeth was obtained. This impression was trimmed to the desired shape; a one-eighth-inch steel wire was imbedded in the sides on a line with the ends of the teeth, then bent backward upon itself opposite the cuspid teeth. From this was constructed a hard-rubber splint, with the wires attached.... The splint is held in position by means of double elastic straps attached to the wire on each side and buckled to a close-fitting leather or net cap, which is reinforced with leather and laced firmly on the head. ... The object of [the splint] was to furnish a sure guide to the normal position of the superior maxillae. Without this the correctness of the adjustment of the bones could not have been verified. Its importance therefore cannot be overestimated [8].

Similar treatment modalities were presented by Brophy in 1918; he presented illustrations of the splints as well as preoperative and postoperative images of a patient [9].

# 22.3 Le Fort Classification System

In his description of maxillary fractures, Le Fort considered several factors: the vector of force overcoming the inertia of the face; the thickness of the bone and buttresses counteracting the mass, velocity, and point of application; and the maxilla, which he noticed was unaffected by muscle pull, unlike the long bones. These considerations resulted in a classification of three levels of fracture.

# 22.3.1 Le Fort I Level

Maxillary fractures at the Le Fort I level traverse the lateral antral wall, lateral nasal wall, and lower third of the septum; these fractures separate at the pterygoid plates. Thus, the entire mobilized segment consists of the maxillary alveolar bone, palatine bones, lower third of the nasal septum, and lower third of the pterygoid plates. The superior two-thirds of these bones remain associated with the face.

# 22.3.2 Le Fort II Level

Maxillary fractures at the Le Fort II level involve most of the nasal bones, maxillary bones, palatine bones, the lower two-thirds of the nasal septum, the dentoalveolus, and the pterygoid plates. Unlike the Le Fort I fracture, which has a notable horizontal separation, the Le Fort II fracture is pyramidal. The fracture extends below the nasofrontal suture through the nasal bones along the maxilla to the zygomaticomaxillary suture and includes the medial inferior third of the orbit. The fracture continues along the zygomaticomaxillary suture to and through the pterygoid plates. The septum is also separated superiorly. The nasomaxillary complex may be intact below the Le Fort II line of fracture, but it is most often comminuted.

# 22.3.3 Le Fort III Level

Fractures at the Le Fort III level involve the nasal bones, zygomas, maxillae, palatine bones, and the pterygoid plates. These fractures essentially separate the face along the base of the skull. The fracture line extends from the nasofrontal suture along the medial wall of the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The fracture line then extends along the inferior orbital fissure and the lateral orbital wall to the zygomaticofrontal suture. The

zygomaticotemporal suture is also separated. The fracture then continues along the sphenoid bone, separating the pterygoid plates. The septum becomes separated at the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The Le Fort III fracture is most often associated with comminution. If a highly comminuted fracture occurs, the patient may sustain fractures at more than one level. Combinations of Le Fort I, II, and III fractures are possible on either side of the face.

# Key Points

Lefort I - horizontal separation involving the lateral antral wall, the lateral nasal wall, the lower third of the septum, and the pterygoid plates.  
Lefort II - Pyramidal separation involving the nasal bones, the maxillary bones, the palatine bones, the lower two-third of the nasal septum, the dentoalveolus and the pterygoid plates.  
Lefort III - separation of the midface along the base of the skull. It involves the nasal bones, zygoma, maxilla, palatine bones and pterygoid plates.

# 22.4 Anatomy

The two maxillae are paired structures connected by a midline suture; the bones together compose a five-sided pyramid. The anterior surface slopes downward from its superior contact with the frontal and nasal bones at an angle of approximately  $15^{\circ}$ . The most prominent point

at the anterior surface is the anterior nasal spine. Several protuberances formed by the alveolar base and origins of the small facial muscles exist on the maxilla. The lateral surface of the maxillae attaches to the zygoma and forms both the infratemporal fossae and buccal vestibule. Most of the superior surface forms the majority of the orbital floor.

The medial surface of each maxilla forms the midline suture and lateral nasal walls. This includes the nasal concha and sinus ostia. The ostium of the nasolacrimal duct is located beneath the inferior concha. The ostia of the maxillary sinus and middle ethmoids, as well as the opening of the nasofrontal duct, lie beneath the middle concha.

The inferior border composes the palatal vault and alveolus, which contain the teeth. The posterior border abuts the sphenoid bone and the pterygomaxillary suture [10]. Within the maxilla is the maxillary sinus. This  $34 \times 33 \times 25 \mathrm{~mm}$  air cavity is responsible for the weakness of the maxilla. The sinus is present at birth but does not pneumatize to its mature extent until the patient reaches 14-15 years of age. Minor changes in the sinus continue throughout life [11]. The strong buttresses of the maxilla are the lateral piriform buttress, the zygomatic buttress, the greater palatine buttress, and the floor of the nose.

The palatine bones are L-shaped and abut the posterior maxilla as a paired structure. These bones assist the maxilla in forming the posterior sinus, the posterior lateral nasal wall, and the pterygomaxillary suture. When joined to the maxilla, the four bones represent one unit (Fig. 22.2) [10].

![](images/5e78524079beb409dbc0dc0d1ec9e1783441daf11844062b486136761cb20c62.jpg)  
Fig. 22.2 Disarticulated midfacial skeleton demonstrates the anatomy of the maxilla, the zygoma, the nasal bones, and the nasal septum

The nasal bones are paired structures that abut the frontal bone superiorly, the maxilla laterally, the septum posteriorly and medially, and each other anteriorly and medially. The bones are thicker superiorly; therefore, fractures at the Le Fort II level may occur inferior to the nasofrontal suture. The nasal septum is a thin trapezoidal bone lying perpendicular to and joining the maxillae and palatine bones. The superior border is thick and articulates with the ethmoid bone [10].

The ethmoid bone is cuboidal and extremely pneumatized; therefore, it can be easily fractured and comminuted. The cribriform plate of the ethmoid composes the roof of the nasal cavity and communicates with the anterior cranial fossae through multiple foramina for the olfactory nerves. Lateral to the crista galli is a slit through which dura mater is exposed. Posterior and superior movements of the midface can easily comminate this bone, thus disrupting the dura mater and resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid leak [10].

The zygoma abuts the frontal bone at the frontozygomatic suture and the temporal bone at the zygomaticotemporal suture. The maxilla and zygoma form two-thirds of the orbital rim and, along with the palatine bones, one-third of the walls and floor of the orbit.

The infraorbital nerve traverses the orbital floor and exits through the infraorbital foramen. The maxillary bone, along with the zygoma, forms the inferior orbital fissure. Through this fissure run the maxillary nerve, the infraorbital vessels, and the ascending branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion. The frontal process of the maxilla contains the lacrimal apparatus, which is housed between the medial canthal ligaments.

The blood supply to the maxillae and palatine bones is through the periosteum, the incisive artery, and the greater and lesser palatine arteries. The internal maxillary artery, a source of potentially devastating hemorrhage, lies posterior to the maxillae and palatine bones and anterior to the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid [12]. The blood supply to the nasal septum and the lateral nasal walls is provided by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries, the sphenopalatine artery, and the greater palatine and superior labial arteries [10].

# 22.5 Diagnosis

# 22.5.1 Clinical Examination

Advanced trauma life-support protocols should be followed for all patients who have suffered trauma. Detailed examination of maxillofacial fractures is com

pleted in the secondary survey, after the primary survey and successful resuscitation have been completed. As has been done historically, the clinical examination should begin with the initial observation of the patient, followed by palpation of the facial skeleton [8, 13]. As was written by Blair in 1914, "...In all cases of injury of the face the dental arches and the palate should be inspected, and the facial bones outlined digitally" [8]. Lacerations, abrasions, and ecchymotic areas should be recorded. Periorbital ecchymosis and facial edema should be noted and are very typical of maxillofacial fractures. Epistaxis with any evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage should be identified. Intraorally the examiner may see fractured teeth, vestibular ecchymosis and edema, palatal ecchymosis, mucosal lacerations and bleeding, steps or diastema in the maxillary teeth, and malocclusion (Fig. 22.3).

![](images/821e8ad9789b0250ef5a8f2147258317ca3d9f2591f8a6b1d208a0afd021a6b6.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 22.3 Patient with Le Fort fractures, facial laceration, and avulsion of tissue at the time of presentation

The skeletal framework of the face should be carefully palpated. With respect to the maxilla, the alveolus should be palpated and any fractures or mobility noted. The examiner should also observe the maxilla for movement as a unit, while palpating the forehead, the nasal bridge, and the zygomaticofrontal sutures. A nasal speculum should be used to identify compound fractures of the septum or septal hematoma. Both hands should be used to palpate the orbital rims and in particular the zygomaticomaxillary suture.

Abnormal occlusion with an anterior open bite and posterior prematurities should be noted and, if possible, correlated with pretraumatic occlusion on the basis on information from family members, photographs, or dental records. The most obvious sign of maxillary fracture is a mobile maxilla; this mobility can be observed when the anterior maxilla is grasped with thumb and forefinger and the bone is moved while the patient's nasal bridge is stabilized with the opposite hand (Fig. 22.4).

![](images/3c2d8b21b8fd2eb11b1971954db8fc13412e1d3c3e1fd62584f452c6654232f9.jpg)

holds the bridge of the nose while the other hand manipulates the maxilla. Movement at the nasofrontal suture suggests a Le Fort II or III fracture

# 22.5.2 Imaging

Fractures are identified clinically and confirmed radiographically. In the past, the Waters' view and lateral facial radiographs were used in identifying maxillary fractures and may still be used today in remote areas without access to computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 22.5). The standard for diagnosing facial fractures is axial and coronal CT (Fig. 22.6). If clinical evidence (e.g., midface mobility and malocclusion with intact mandible) strongly indicates maxillary fracture, then CT is a confirmatory test. Important indications for CT are suspected orbital floor fractures (best diagnosed in the coronal view) and surgical planning. CT can also demonstrate the soft tissue differences of a hematoma or edema of the subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and fat. For severe midface trauma or maxillary displacement, three-dimensional CT is a valuable tool (Fig. 22.7). A recent advancement in CT technology allows intraoperative CT that serves in both diagnostic imaging and in postoperative imaging confirmation.

# Key Points

- Examination is conducted in the secondary survey after completion of primary survey and resuscitation.  
Clinical exam includes careful palpation of skeletal framework extraroall and thorough intraoral exam observing for mobility or fracture segments.  
Radiographic exams can be performed with Computer Tomography Scans. In remote areas without computer tomography, lateral facial and Waters view radiographs can be used.

# 22.6 Treatment

As is true for all injuries, initial attention should be directed at establishing an airway and controlling any hemorrhage. The most frequent cause of hemorrhage in any Le Fort level fracture is a fractured septum. This bleeding may be addressed by packing the nasal cavity with one of a variety of materials, such as gauze packing, Merocel packing (Medtronic Xomed), Rhinorocket (Shippert Medical Technologies Corp.), or Epistat (Medtronic Xomed). Bleeding from sites of laceration or abrasion may be controlled by tamponade. In the setting of maxillary trauma, nasal bleeding that is not immediately controlled by adequate nasal packing indicates the need for consultation with interventional radiology. Exsanguinating hemorrhage with a facial fracture is rare; however, the occasional occurrence of this type of hemorrhage due to the laceration or rupture of the internal maxillary artery has long been noted [9]. Should uncontrollable bleeding be encountered, the patient should undergo angiographic evaluation with embolization of the injured artery, if indicated [14-18].

Maxillary fractures isolated to the bony dentoalveolar process should be manually reduced and rigidly fixated with arch bars and ligature wires. If the segment is too large to be stabilized with arch bars alone, acrylic can be added to the facial surface of the arch bar, or an occlusal splint can be constructed and secured in place with circumdental or skeletal wires. Complications include bone resorption, ankylosis of teeth, external root resorption, and tooth loss [19, 20].

In more extensive injuries, the sequence of treatment of maxillary fractures depends largely on the associated injuries. Nasotracheal intubation is preferred when it is not contraindicated by the need for complicated repair of nasal or nasoethmoidal injuries. In such cases a submental intubation technique or tracheotomy is indicated [21-25] (Fig. 22.8).

![](images/97986a46f61a0b2cc987a526c1f6ce5a518b9b6419a36bd6f0e7ae6600671cf4.jpg)  
$\square$  Fig. 22.8 The protection of a patient's airway by a submental intubation technique

The initial step in maxillary fracture reduction and fixation is the surgical placement of arch bars. If teeth are deemed unsalvageable, they should be removed at the beginning of the operation. The sequence of treatment depends on the surgeon's philosophy and the presence of other facial fractures. Whether the surgeon prefers to work from the "bottom up" or from the "outside in," the anterior projection of the maxilla is most easily obtained when the mandible is intact. For this reason, strong consideration should be given to the repair of any mandible fracture before the maxilla is stabilized. Intermaxillary fixation (to an intact mandible) is the most reliable technique for establishing the anterior projection of the maxilla (Fig. 22.9).

![](images/fab1173d0889a119949becf121b7978b45c068c0087989e76f4e4acf097c25b3.jpg)  
Fig. 22.9 Arch bars and intermaxillary fixation

Although many wiring (closed reduction) techniques have been described in the past, rigid internal fixation remains the standard of care [13, 26-29]. The maxilla should be stabilized to the next highest (most superior) stable facial structure, which varies with Le Fort fracture level. At the Le Fort I level, fixation plates are placed along the vertical buttresses of the maxilla at both the piriform and zygomatic buttresses. At higher Le Fort levels, the fractures may require fixation to the nasal bones, the orbital rims, or the zygomaticofrontal sutures. Although Le Fort levels are frequently mentioned in discussions of patient treatment, high-quality CT images and widespread use of rigid fixation have led to the treatment of multiple facial fractures as separate units. For example, a Le Fort I or II fracture would be treated as a Le Fort I fracture, a left orbital fracture, or a left zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture. In these cases it is advisable to restore midface projection by repairing the orbital or zygomatic fractures before implementing fixation of the maxilla.

Contemporary bone plates and screws are made of titanium alloy. For maxillary reconstruction these plates must be of sufficient rigidity to overcome the effects of gravity; the forces of mastication are resisted primarily by bone contact. For this purpose, screws with an outer diameter of  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  are adequate. In areas such as the orbital rim or nasal bone,  $1.3\mathrm{-mm}$  or  $1.0\mathrm{-mm}$  systems

may be used. In cases in which bone contact is decreased because of comminution,  $1.7\mathrm{-mm}$  or  $2.0\mathrm{-mm}$  systems may be used.

If resistance is encountered during the mobilization of the maxilla, the Rowe disimpaction forceps may be used to help in reducing the fracture (Fig. 22.10). The paired forceps are placed with the fat end in the nose and the bowed end on the palate. The surgeon stands over the patient's head and, in an inferior-anterior movement, disimpacts the maxilla. Further assistance may be provided with the Hayton-Williams forceps used in conjunction with the Rowe disimpaction forceps. Once the maxilla is mobile, a single Rowe disimpaction forceps may be used to free the second hand to reduce the maxilla and to perform bimanual palpation.

Fig. 22.10 a Rowe disimpaction forceps. b Application of the forceps

If the maxillary fracture is incomplete (e.g., a greenstick fracture), the surgeon may have difficulty in mobilizing the maxilla. The fractured hemimaxilla may be impacted or telescoped, and this impaction or telescoping may cause severe malocclusion with minimal mobility. In a case such as this, the severe difficulty with disimpaction can be easily overcome

by completing the fracture with an osteotomy. This concept was described in 1914 when Blair wrote, "... if the impaction cannot be broken up ... resort may be had to a small, sharp chisel" [8]. After downfracture, the maxilla can easily be moved into appropriate occlusion and stabilized without further difficulty (Fig. 22.11).

![](images/0a4a7d731bfc152c491847b730a85b89fa8c844e1125f1cc2de64947164da776.jpg)

Immediate bone grafting has been advocated for the severely comminuted maxillary antrum [30]. This treatment prevents prolapse of the facial soft tissue into the maxillary sinus. Titanium mesh also works well for this procedure; this mesh is malleable, can be quickly fixated, resists the pressure of the facial soft tissues, becomes osseointegrated, and allows regrowth of the native tissue (e.g., ciliated respiratory epithelium, goblet cells, or squamous epithelium) (Fig. 22.12) [31].

# Key Points

Initial attention should be directed at establishing an airway and control of any hemorrhage.  
Rigid internal fixation is the standard of care.  
Maxilla should be stabilized to the next highest or most superior stable facial structure which varies with the LeFort fracture level.  
A surgical splint can be considered to help in difficult cases of gross comminution, periodontal disease or inadequate partial dentition.

# 22.6.1 Surgical Splints

In the most difficult cases of gross comminution, periodontal disease, or inadequate partial dentition (fewer than three occluding teeth per sextant), occlusal wafers or palatal splints may be helpful. These splints are fabricated after traditional impressions or contemporary digital impressions made by intraoral 3D scanning have been taken and model surgery has been completed on plaster or virtually. When an occlusal wafer is fabricated, it should cover the occlusal surfaces and the heights of contour, but it should not encroach on the soft tissues. Holes should be placed between occlusal surfaces in the splint so that it may be ligated separately to the arch bar, as might be done with an orthognathic surgical splint.

The Gunning's splint has been used to establish intermaxillary fixation for edentulous patients; this splint is essentially a denture baseplate fabricated to the existing edentulous or partially edentulous ridge that has arch bars or suspension brackets attached to the facial and buccal surfaces [33]. This splint or the patient's own dentures, if present, can be secured to the jaws with bone screws or with circummandibular/maxillary (skeletal) wires, after maxillo-mandibular fixation is accomplished.

# 22.6.2 Special Considerations

High-Force or Avulsive Injuries High-caliber high-velocity gunshot wounds, blast injuries, and high-speed motor vehicle accidents with unrestrained victims cause most avulsion injuries associated with maxillary fractures. The priority in treating these injuries is to preserve as much of the remaining tissue as possible. Consideration and administration of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic directed at oral and nasal (respiratory) contaminants, as well as tetanus prophylaxis, are priorities in treating patients with these injuries. As is true for all injuries, these wounds should be thoroughly evaluated to detect bleeding or foreign bodies and to determine the extent of damage. Extensive irrigation with pulsed fluids should be used to remove debris (Fig. 22.13a-h).

Life-threatening hemorrhage should be addressed early for homeostasis and for airway management [34]. Any hemorrhage that cannot be controlled by local measures such as packing (anterior and posterior nasal) and electrocautery is an indication for angiography and embolization of the injured artery or arteries. Because of the collateral blood supply of the face, most tissues remain viable with only a small isthmus of blood supply. Fractures should be repaired with rigid fixation. Voids in bone should be addressed with a secondary reconstruction at a later date. Multiple lacerations with com

minuted fractures will be associated with edema and substantial venous congestion. This tissue may provide satisfactory blood supply to existing segments but not to large bone grafts. To address soft tissue lacerations, advancement flaps should be used only to cover exposed bone or to correct oronasal or oroantral fistulas. If too little soft tissue exists, flaps should not be advanced; such repairs should be addressed during a secondary reconstruction. Consideration should be given to the use of vascularized free flaps in this situation [14] (Fig. 22.14).

For cases of avulsion, implant reconstruction should be considered, regardless of the use of free flaps. Implants with obturators can be used, as is often seen in partial maxillectomy after tumor resection. Implant restorations can also be placed in bone from composite flap reconstructions [35].

Injuries to Geriatric Patients The geriatric maxilla has more pneumatized antra and less vasculature, less alveolar bone, and less dense trabeculation. Should reduction and fixation be required, existing dentures may be modified by relining and affixing arch bars or intermaxillary fixation buttons. A Gunning's splint may also be fabri

cated. Such a splint may be fixed to the zygoma, the anterior nasal spine, the piriform rim, or the palate, either with wires or with cortical bone screws. In severely atrophic maxillae, the splint may be secured by transcutaneously introduced skeletal wires around each zygomatic arch.

Additional medical illnesses and disabilities may increase the risk of morbidity due to anesthesia for geriatric patients with maxillary fractures. The surgeon should exercise judgment when morbid medical conditions coexist with minimally displaced fractures in edentulous patients. A new prosthesis may be more effective than reduction and fixation of the fracture.

Pediatric Maxillary Fractures Pediatric maxillary fractures are infrequent, and children are almost 5 times less likely to have facial fractures than are adolescents ([28, 36, 37] 2-13). Because the pediatric sinuses are not highly pneumatized, these fractures tend to be less comminuted in children than in adults. One large review of more than 3000 cases of craniomaxillofacial trauma in children reported 615 facial bone fractures in 389 pediatric patients [36]. Midface fractures accounted for  $64.5\%$  of the fractures, and fractures associated with the maxilla accounted for approximately  $20\%$  of the fractures (defined as one of the following: Le Fort I, Le Fort II, Le Fort III, maxilla right, maxilla left, maxillary process right, maxillary process left).

Another study from 2008 reviewed 291 pediatric patients with craniomaxillofacial fractures (Wymann, JOMS, 2008). In this report most fractures were in the skull vault, and  $6\%$  of the fractures were either maxillary sinus or Le Fort fractures. The most common cause of trauma varied among regions and changed in relation to the mean ages of the patient subpopulations.

Skeletal fixation is indicated for mobile, displaced maxillary fractures in pediatric patients. It is not known whether any maxillary growth alterations occur after a pediatric maxillary fracture. Avoidance of the permanent developing tooth buds is desirable in the placement of fixation devices. The use of occlusal splints and skeletal fixation should be considered. Metal fixation systems carry theoretical complications of translocation, extrusion, and growth restriction, and consideration should be given to the removal of hardware in the growing patient [38].

Resorbable plating systems have been advocated for use in pediatric patients to avoid potential complications of translocation, extrusion, and growth restriction [38, 39]. These plates are made of poly-L-lactic-polyglycolic copolymer (PLLA-PGA). Extensive experience with resorbable plating systems in pediatric patients has been described, and although the specific use of such plates in maxillary fractures is relatively uncommon (primarily because of the uncommon nature of these injuries), experience with the material, especially in craniofacial surgery, lends strong justification to the use of resorbable materials for this indication (Bell, 2006, JOMS) (Eppley 2005, JOMS; Eppley 2004, PRS).

# 22.6.3 Complications

Complications associated with maxillary fractures and their repair are listed in  $\triangleright$  Box 22.1. Several of these complications may not be readily apparent until weeks or months after the injury occurred, but the potential for their occurrence should be borne in mind during the evaluation and treatment of the patient.

# Box 22.1 Complications Associated with Maxillary Fractures

Infraorbital nerve paresthesia  
Enophthalmos  
Infection  
- Exposed hardware  
- Deviated septum  
- Nasal obstruction  
Altered vision  
Nonunion  
Malunion or malocclusion  
Epiphora  
Foreign body reactions  
Scarring  
Sinusitis [40]

Adapted from Haug et al. [41]

Perioperative and postoperative airway obstructions are unusual in cases of maxillary fracture alone. However, these conditions may occur in association with extubation while the patient is obtunded, with a septal hematoma or nasal packing, and with excessively edematous soft tissues that do not allow breathing through the nasal airways. Patients with intermaxillary fixation and complete dentition may have difficulty breathing during this time. Reintubation, opening nasopharyngeal airways, or merely removing the intermaxillary fixation material may be effective in resolving the obstruction. Uncorrected nasal septal fractures can lead to postoperative airway obstruction that remains after all of the soft-tissue edema has resolved. Acute sinusitis can result from prolonged nasotracheal intubation [42]. Acute or chronic sinusitis may also occur in the ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal, or maxillary sinuses because fractures may obliterate or obstruct the sinus ducts or ostia.

Postoperative hemorrhage occurs if arterioles and veins are not ligated when lacerations are repaired, if inadequate bone reduction allows continued oozing of blood, if an aneurysm is present, or if an artery is partially transected. Lacerations should be reexplored so that hemorrhage can be controlled. Hematomas should be drained. Oozing of blood from bone requires re-reduction or the use of bone wax. Hemorrhage from a major artery requires emergency tamponade; if the source cannot be identified, then arteriography and embolization are indicated. Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are complications of maxillofacial trauma but rarely occur as the result of isolated maxillary fractures. They can also result in postoperative bleeding and are indications for angiography and embolization [43].

Because of the proximity of the maxilla to the orbits, complications associated with vision can occur. Blindness is rarely associated with midface fractures

and is most often seen in fracture patterns involving the orbit, frequently as a result of a severe mechanism of injury [44]. Immediate postoperative blindness can be a complication of the reduction of high Le Fort fractures (Le Fort III or fractures involving the orbits) and is due to increased intraorbital hemorrhage or pressure, a retinal artery spasm, a retrobulbar hemorrhage, or the impingement of bone fragments on the optic nerve [45]. An undiagnosed or inadequately treated orbital floor fracture (alone or in combination with a zygomatic component) can lead to enophthalmos and diplopia.

The most obvious postoperative complication is misplacement of bone segments or fixation devices. This type of complication may present as malocclusions and is readily identified by clinical examination or postoperative radiographic examination. A second surgical procedure will correct such a complication. Other complications related to rigid internal fixation include palpability, infection, extrusion or exposure, translocation, stress shielding, cortical osteopenia, and nonunion [46, 47]. Nonunion of the fractured segments can result from an inadequate blood supply, inaccurate position, movement of segments, infection, or nutritional deficiency [48]. Infections may be caused by contaminated soft-tissue lacerations or foreign bodies, hematomas, or odontogenic infections from previously diseased or fractured teeth. Injury to teeth can occur from the original trauma or from the placement of fixation screws. Infection around bone plates and screws can occur years after their placement.

Malunion of maxillary fractures can obstruct the nasolacrimal ducts. This obstruction causes epiphora and may lead to episodes of dacryocystitis. If identified early, nasolacrimal duct obstruction may be treated with a dacryocystorhinostomy at the same time as the original maxillary reduction. Bone segments from fractured or improperly reduced maxillary fractures can also impinge on the infraorbital nerve, causing numbness of the distribution of the second division of the trigeminal nerve.

Although the reduction and fixation of maxillary fractures may at times seem straightforward, the proximity of complicated anatomic structures and the consequences of inaccurate repair make it incumbent on the surgeon to follow sound surgical principles in the management of these fractures.

# Key Points

Complications may include but are not limited to vision issues, epiphora, malocclusions, misplacement of bone segments or fixation devices, and malunion of bony segments.  
Complications associated with maxillary fractures and their repair may not be apparent to weeks or months after the injury.

# Conclusion

Maxillary fractures often happen in conjunction with other facial fractures and associated injuries such as overlying soft tissue injuries, neurologic injuries, and bodily orthopedic injuries. A thorough physical and radiographic examination should always be performed to detail the injuries. Timely diagnosis and subsequent repair of the maxilla is important to prevent long-term functional and cosmetic deficits.
