# Clinical results of osseointegrated implants supporting fixed prostheses in edentulous jaws

R. Adell, D.D.S., Ph.D.*

University of Göteborg, Göteborg, Sweden

The osseointegration method for achieving fixed, electively removable dental prostheses in edentulous patients has been thoroughly reviewed in a series of articles. Both the rationale for and the proposed mechanism of osseointegration have been discussed in detail. Treatment indications, patient selection considerations, methods, complications, and clinical results over a 15-year period have also been reported. The following is an update of material and results from the Göteborg clinical data on osseointegration.

# MATERIAL

The material comprised a total of about 4,100 implants installed in 650 jaws of 600 patients, most of whom were treated in Göteborg, Sweden (Table I). About 900 of these fixtures were inserted in 150 jaws at several other centers in Scandinavia and abroad where the osseointegration method is now used regularly.

Patient characteristics did not differ from those described earlier. The mean age was 53 years at the time of implant installation, with a range of 20 to 77 years of age and a slight predominance of women by about  $60\%$ . Removable dentures were present in opposing jaw in  $60\%$  of the patients. Most jaws were severely resorbed (Fig. 1), often with inverted spatial relations in the sagittal plane.

The patients were selected mainly according to their degree of suffering from their edentulous state as judged by the team of examining medical and dental specialists. Selection was not made to fulfill any desired optimal jawbone anatomy.

The material was divided into the following observation groups:

1. The development group, observed for 10 to 17 years
2. Routine group I, observed for 6 to 10 years
3. Routine group IIa, observed for 5 to 6 years
4. Routine group IIB, observed for 1 to 4 years

In the following presentation of results, three parts of the clinical material were excluded: (1) fixtures that had been prosthesis loaded for less than 1 year, (2) fixtures placed in bone grafts, and (3) fixtures belonging to the development group.

The routine groups, which were statistically analyzed, consisted of almost 2,000 implants that had been inserted in 300 jaws (Tables II and III). About  $50\%$  of these fixtures and jaws were observed for more than 5 years (Tables II and III).

# METHODS

and follow-up registrations, were closely followed. After a two-step surgical procedure, the patients were provided with removable dental prostheses. The prostheses resembled conventional fixed partial dentures but were screwed onto abutments on the fixtures (Fig. 2). The abutment-fixture units were immobile.

All patients were followed up continuously with annual standardized clinical and radiologic examinations that were recorded in a computerized system.

Two samples were selected. One sample, A, of 152 patients (97 women and 55 men) was used for retrieving questionnaires on the opinions of the patients 3 years or more after treatment. The other sample, B, comprised 95 fixtures (42 from upper and 53 from lower jaws in 10 women and six men) followed up for 3 years. Clinical mucosal reactions around the abutments were examined in this latter sample.

# RESULTS

The anchorage function or the fixture survival rate was defined as the number of stable prosthesis-supporting and osseointegrated fixtures in relation to the total number of fixtures installed. The long-term anchorage function of fixtures exceeded  $80\%$  in the maxillae and  $90\%$  in the mandibles (Table IV). For routine group IIb even better results were obtained.

Anchorage function was also calculated for prostheses as the number of jaws in which the patients enjoyed continuously stable prostheses in relation to the total number of jaws treated, although some exchange of supporting fixtures may have taken place. The anchorage function for prostheses was between  $90\%$  and  $100\%$  for upper and  $100\%$  for lower jaws (Table V).


Only nine patients had their prostheses changed to complete dentures. All nine situations involved the maxillae and were reviewed earlier. The longest continuous functioning time for a prosthesis on osseointegrated fixtures is 17 years. In sample A,  $90\%$  of the women patients and  $95\%$  of the men patients stated that, if necessary, they would be treated again with a fixture-anchored prosthesis. About  $85\%$  of the women and  $95\%$  of the men patients felt that their prostheses were integral parts of their bodies.

In sample B there was a mean pocket depth of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  and the percents of plaque- and gingivitis-affected quadrants around the abutments were  $15\%$  and  $8\%$ , respectively.

# DISCUSSION

The preliminary results gained from sample A corroborate the findings from other psychosocial studies on the effects of treatment with jawbone-anchored prostheses. Such treatment not only meant a rehabilitation of the masticatory system but also implied a considerable increase in the self-confidence of the patients, which in turn elicited widespread positive psychosocial consequences.

The anchorage function for fixtures and prostheses was even better than that reported earlier. The number of fixture losses was small, and lost fixtures occurred, with few exceptions, only during the first year after completion of surgical treatment. The anchorage function of prostheses was the most relevant parameter from the patient's point of view in determining the success or failure of the method. During the last 2 years not one patient required a return to a removable denture.

Clinical soft tissue reactions to the abutments were mild and would not have been associated with periodontitis if teeth had been present in the same sites. Moreover, biopsies and microbiologic samples from osseointegrated fixture-abutment marginal sites in other samples of the total material were indicative of only occasional mild inflammatory reactions. Marginal bone height variations were discussed at length by Adell et al. They stated that a mean  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  of marginal bone was lost during the first year after prosthesis loading. This was interpreted as a response to the surgical trauma and to the initial marginal torque stress applied peroperatively. After the first year only  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  of marginal bone per year was lost for all groups, although a number of fractured fixtures, which caused a considerable marginal bone loss, were still included in the material.


Parts of the total patient sample of material were excluded for the following reasons:

1. No reliable conclusions on the long-term prognosis can be drawn from patients observed for only 1 year.
2. The quality and behavior of bone tissue in a graft may differ from that of original jaw bone, and the results of fixtures in grafts have already been reviewed in a separate article.[8]
3. The clinical procedures in the development group were not as standardized as those in the routine groups, although the same basic principles were applied. The development group has also been reviewed separately.2

The 5-year limit was regarded as an important time of reference. It is common in medical literature for comparison of various treatments; it should, therefore, be regarded as a standard for prostheses on teeth. It has been specifically recommended by the 1978 Harvard Conference on dental implants.[9]

# PROGNOSIS

The anchorage function for fixtures and, as a consequence, the anchorage function for prostheses depended on a maintained osseointegration and a maintained marginal bone height. The number of fixtures lost was small. Only a minute portion of marginal bone height resorbed. Because these losses occurred mainly during the first year after installation of abutments, a predictable prognosis could be made for each patient after the first year of prosthesis wear.

# CONCLUSIONS

The osseointegration method with jawbone-anchored prostheses gave a 5- to 10-year implant survival rate of  $81\%$  in the maxillae and  $91\%$  in the mandibles. Very few fixtures were lost during the first year after abutment connection. Continuously stable prostheses were worn in more than  $90\%$  of the upper and in  $100\%$  of the lower jaws observed for 5 to 10 years.

The osseointegration method fulfills and exceeds the demands by the 1978 Harvard Conference on dental implantation methods and implies a considerable psychosocial improvement for the individual.
