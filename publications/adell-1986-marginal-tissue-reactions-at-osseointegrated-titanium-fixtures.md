ABSTRACT - 16 consecutive totally edentulous patients were provided with 95 osseointegrated titanium fixtures in 7 upper and 9 lower jaws. Facultatively removable bridges were later connected to abutments, attached to the fixtures. The marginal soft and hard tissue reactions were investigated at a baseline examination and after 6, 12, 21, 30 and 39 months by standardized clinical and radiographical methods. At the last examination, microbiological samples and gingival biopsies were also analysed. The  $\%$  ratios of abutments without plaque,  $70 - 75\%$ , and without any gingivitis,  $80 - 85\%$ , were almost constant throughout the study. The mean probing depth was  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  at the final examination. About  $75\%$  of all probing depths were  $3\mathrm{mm}$  or less and none exceeded  $5\mathrm{mm}$ . The bridge-gingiva distances increased during the investigation. Attached gingiva surrounded  $65\%$  of the buccal and lingual abutment surfaces. Only  $0.9\mathrm{mm}$  marginal bone was lost as a mean during the first year and not more than  $0.05\mathrm{mm}$  annually for the next 2 years. After 6 months, no significant changes in marginal bone levels occurred. The perifixtural bone gradually became more radiopaque, especially marginally in upper jaws, indicating a successive load-related remodelling. The microbiota comprised coccoid cells and non-motile rods to  $93\%$  in 32 samples. Healthy tissues were present in  $35\%$  of the 14 soft tissue biopsies. In a further  $29\%$ , only a slight inflammation was observed. No constant correlations could be established for any of the investigation parameters used. It is concluded that the marginal soft tissue reactions were mild and not significant for a progressive periodontitis. Mobility tests of separate fixtures combined with quantitative and qualitative standardized radiological examinations of the surrounding bone appear to provide a truer comprehension of longitudinal events at osseointegrated implants than conventional clinical soft tissue observations. The prognosis for the osseointegrated implants appears excellent, especially with regard to the microbiota, the small marginal bone height changes, and the radiological indications of remodelling in the perifixtural bone.

(Accepted for publication 14 December 1984)

Osseointegrated titanium dental implants, fixtures, have been shown capable of supporting fixed bridges for periods of at least 17 years in large, consecutive and continuously followed materials. Maintained osseointegration of the fixtures and a continuously well-functioning marginal muco-periosteal-osseous barrier zone are the 2 factors which mainly determine the long-term prognosis for the treatment.

The prerequisites for attaining and maintaining osseointegration have been reviewed in detail by ALBREKTSSON et al.4 and BRANEMARK et al.? while knowledge about the marginal reactions has been limited so far. The purpose of the present investigation has been to follow and evaluate the marginal tissue reactions through a longitudinal prospective study.

# Material and Methods

All the 16 patients who were treated between May and October 1978 were included in the study. These patients were totally edentulous as a result of tooth loss from destructive periodontal disease. They were provided with a total of 95 fixtures, distributed according to Table 1. The fixtures were inserted in accordance with the standardized technique described by BRANEMARK et al. and reviewed by LEKHOLM. The mean age of the patients at the time of fixture installation was 53 years (range 32-69 years). The preoperative period of edentulousness was, on the average, 15.2 years (range 2-33 years). In the opposite jaw, 8 patients had a denture, 6 had natural teeth, and 2 patients had bridges on fixtures.

The baseline examination was performed immediately after the patient had been provided with fixed bridges, i.e., about 1 month after the abutment operation. Follow-up examinations were performed after 6, 12, 21, 30 and 39 months. At the last examination, some histological and

The final registration was performed by 2 examiners, while the previous ones were carried out by only 1 examiner.


# Clinical parameters

The presence of plaque-accumulation on the abutments was examined by the use of a pointed explorer. The presence or absence of plaque was assessed at 4 surfaces of each abutment (mesi-buccally, disto-buccally, disto-lingually, and mesio-lingually).

Gingivitis was registered visually at the corresponding surfaces as for plaque. All clinical signs of inflammatory reactions in the mucosa/gingiva around the abutments were noted as gingivitis.

Probing depth was measured with a graded probe at 4 surfaces of each abutment. The measurements were made to the nearest mm.

Presence or absence of attached gingiva was visually registered at the buccal and lingual surfaces of each abutment.

Bridge-gingiva distance was measured with a graded probe at the buccal surface of each abutment. The measurements were made to the nearest mm.

# Radiographical parameters

All examinations were performed in radiograms, taken by means of standardized serial-identical stereo-pair technique with parallel projection according to the recommendations by HOLLENDER & ROCKLER13.

Marginal bone level changes were registered as differences in the distances between reference points on the mesial and distal surface of the fixtures and the marginal bone levels close to the fixtures as described by ADELL et al.2.

Inter-fixtural bone level changes were measured in a direction perpendicular to reference lines, drawn between reference points on 2 adjacent fixtures. The measurements were performed at the midpoint between 2 fixtures. At the distal fixtures, half the inter-proximal distance to the closest fixture was marked on extrapolated reference lines distally to the fixtures, where marginal bone levels were measured.

Peri-fixtural bone quality was scored in the following manner:

score 1 - cancellous trabecular bone along the entire contour of the fixture;

score 2 - radiopaque zone marginally with cancellous trabecular bone surrounding the deeper parts of the fixture;

score 3 - radiopaque zone investing the entire fixture contour.

# Microbiological parameter

Samples of the subgingival microbiota were taken from two sites of each patient in accordance with the technique described by MAGNUSsON et al.21. The samples were analysed by dark-field microscopy  $(\times 1,000)$  according to LISTGARTEN & HELLDEN19. One of the samples was retrieved from the site which was subsequently exposed to biopsy. The deepest pocket in the patient was represented by 1 of the 2 samples.

# Histological parameters

A biopsy including the soft tissues down to the marginal bone was taken at one abutment/fixture of each patient. The tissue samples were processed according to the methods described by LINDHE et al.[16] and were analysed in the light microscope. The presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates was scored according to a system originally described by TAGGE et al.[27].

# Statistical analysis

All data collected were registered at the Göteborg University Computing Center. Statistical analyses were performed by means of procedures in the STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SYSTEM $^{22}$ .

Analysis of measurement precision was performed on repeated measurements according to DAHLBERG. Both inter-examiner and intraexaminer variations were studied. The results are given in Table 2.

In general, patients/jaws were used as the observation unit since the inter-jaw/-patient variation was found to be of the same magnitude as the variations between fixtures within the same jaw.

Nonparametric methods were used to evaluate statistical significances. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was applied in its one-sample version to evaluate differences between time points and in its two-sample version to compare upper and lower jaws. Spearman's correlation coefficient test was used for analysis of possible correlations between values and changes of the different observation methods. For the microbiological and histological parts of the study, where small numbers of observations were present, Fisher's exact permutation test was utilized[23].

The level of significance considered throughout this paper was  $5\%$ .

Standard deviations are given below, when the material was normally distributed.

# Results

With few exceptions (5 out of 96 follow-up examinations), all patients attended the scheduled examination program. 1 patient who did not appear for a 30-month registration was excluded. 4 registrations could

# Clinical parameters

The plaque-distribution per abutment is given in Fig. 1. This shows that about  $70 - 75\%$  of the abutments had no plaque at all. Consequently, only  $25 - 30\%$  of the abutments had one or more surfaces affected by plaque. The plaque accumulation for all examined surfaces was  $15\%$  (s.d. 18) for the entire observation period. A surface plaque frequency of  $25\%$  would have implied that 1 surface of the abutment, and  $50\%$  that 2 surfaces etc., were affected by plaque as a mean. The  $\%$  of plaque affected surfaces per jaw was  $17\%$  (s.d. 25) at the final examination. Only some minor changes in plaque accumulation occurred throughout the study. 7 patients remained free from plaque at all examinations, while others always had various amounts of plaque.

The distribution of surfaces with gingivitis per abutment is presented in Fig. 2. This shows that about  $80 - 85\%$  of the abutments were surrounded by clinically healthy gingiva or mucosa throughout the period of observation. Consequently, only  $15 - 20\%$  of the abutments were surrounded by one or more gingivitis-affected surfaces. The fre quency of gingivitis for all examined surfaces was  $8\%$  (s.d. 19) for the entire observation period, interpreted in the same manner as for the mean plaque frequency for all surfaces above. The  $\%$  of inflamed gingival surfaces per jaw was  $7\%$  (s.d. 10) at the final examination. 7 patients had no gingivitis at all throughout the study. It was a consistent finding that sites with plaque and sites with gingivitis did not correspond. Thus, plaque could occur on abutments the gingiva of which was devoid of clinical signs of inflammation, and gingivitis could occur at abutments which had no visible accumulation of plaque.

The probing depth values are given in Table 3. The mean final pocket depth was less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  with the following categories of probing depths:  $72\%$  of the pockets had probing depths less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , and  $28\%$  had probing depths between 4 and  $5\mathrm{mm}$ .

About  $65\%$  of all buccal and lingual abutment surfaces were associated with a zone of attached gingiva (Figs. 3a, b). The  $\%$  of attached gingival surfaces per jaw was  $67\%$  (s.d. 24) at the final examination. Attached gingiva was present at  $58\%$  (s.d. 35) of the buccal surfaces and at  $75\%$  (s.d. 39)

Measured buccally at each abutment of the lingual surfaces per jaw at the final examination. The remaining abutment surfaces were consequently surrounded by movable oral mucosa. When the buccal soft tissue units of the abutments were considered, the frequency of attached gingiva did not differ between upper and lower jaws.


The bridge-gingiva distances increased significantly throughout the study (Table 4). The mean bridge-gingiva distance was 3.2 mm (s.d. 1.1) after 39 months.

Apart from the observations on attached lingual gingiva, no statistically significant differences could be observed between upper and lower jaws, when the values of the clinical parameters at different observation times were compared.

Means of measurements mesially and distally to the fixtures first year and subsequently  $0.05\mathrm{mm}$  (s.d. 0.3) annually during the 2 follow-up years. The marginal bone level at the 6-month observation differed significantly from that of the first registration, while no significant changes in marginal bone levels occurred thereafter. There were no significant differences between upper and lower jaws at any observations. At later observation intervals, a weak tendency could be demonstrated towards a greater bone loss distally at upper jaw fixtures.


The inter-fixtural bone level changes generally followed the variations in marginal bone heights and are given in Table 6.

The peri-fixtural bone quality scores messially and distally at the upper and lower jaw fixtures appear from Figs. 4a-d. Significant differences between upper and lower jaws were found for this parameter at all times of observation, implying a gradual shift towards a more radiopaque marginal and/or peri-fixtural bone (Figs. 4e, f), accentuated in upper jaws.

No significant differences could be established for the peri-fixtural bone quality scores mesially and distally at any fixture.

The radiographical bone quality at the most distally placed fixture bilaterally was also compared to that of the remaining, more centrally situated, ones. Significant differences were found at the final examination, indicating that the distal fixtures both mesially and distally were invested in a more radiopaque bone marginally and/or perifixurally.


# Microbiological parameter

The frequency of recurrence of various micro-organisms in the samples from the final examination are given in Table 7. No significant differences were found between the 2 samples retrieved from each patient with respect to the frequency of any certain strain of micro-organism. Coccoid cells and non-motile rods dominated (93%) all samples.

# Histological parameters

Due to technical difficulties, 2 of the 16 samples could not be examined. These 2 specimens represented clinically healthy soft tissue.

A layer of keratinized oral epithelium was observed in biopsies taken from abutments surrounded by attached gingiva and a layer of nonkeratinized oral epithelium was found in biopsies surrounded by oral mucosa. Plasma cells and lymphocytes were found in small infiltrates of the connective tissue in the marginal parts of most of the biopsies. In the mid- portions of the specimens, the "dento-gingival" epithelium was thin and the connective tissue contained few scattered lymphocytes (Figs. 5a, b). In deeper parts of the biopsies a thicker "dento-gingival" epithelium was often present. Inflammatory cells were observed in 4 biopsies at this level. The apical extension of the epithelium in the pockets could not be established with certainty as epithelial remnants could have been left attached to the surfaces of the titanium components during removal of the biopsies.

The frequencies of biopsies with various inflammation scores are presented in Table 8. Three of the 9 inflammatory infiltrates were found in the deeper parts of the specimens. The remaining 6 infiltrates were diffusely spread throughout the biopsies. About  $35\%$  of the specimens did not contain any inflammatory infiltrates at all.

# Correlation between parameters

Correlations between the values of the different parameters were only established for some single examinations. In a longitudinal perspective throughout the study only very

weak correlations were found. Thus, gingivitis only appeared occasionally in the presence of plaque and could hardly be correlated to the presence of deeper pockets nor to the small loss of marginal bone height. At the first 2 or 3 observations, a small pocket depth appeared accompanied by a greater bridge-gingiva distance.

It could never be demonstrated that changes in one parameter were significantly correlated to changes in another one.

As judged from the 32 microbiological samples retrieved, no correlation was established between the frequency of any certain group of micro-organisms and (clinical) gingivitis or pocket depth.

When the 14 biopsies were taken into account, regarding the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, no correlations were established between presence or degree of histologic inflammation and (clinical) gingivitis, pocket depth, marginal bone level change or frequency of any certain strain of micro-organisms.

A regression analysis revealed that no significant correlations existed between age, sex or jaw of the patients and the parameters for examination of fixture/abutment conditions.

# Discussion

In general, the results of this investigation corroborate those earlier published29, but this study has elucidated the marginal reactions in more detail.

Irrespective of the fact that no oral hygiene instructions were given in between the examination intervals, about  $70 - 75\%$  of the abutments were constantly free from clinically detectable plaque (Fig. 1). The remaining abutments generally comprised one or two surfaces with plaque, and this plaque was found in a small group of patients not able to maintain the high standard of oral hygiene characteristic of the majority of the participants.


The  $\%$  of abutments without signs of gingivitis (Fig. 2) was  $80 - 85\%$  almost constantly throughout the study. If the  $\%$  of periabutment surfaces with gingivitis was calculated as a mean for the entire observation period of value of  $8\%$  was obtained, a figure which corresponds well with earlier results. When gingivitis was observed in the present material, only 1 or 2 gingival sites at each abutment were generally affected, i.e., gingivitis around the total circumference of an abutment was a rare occurrence throughout the study.

It was a frequent finding that the location of plaque and gingivitis did not concur, and the values of these parameters were not consistently correlated. As has been suggested earlier2, other factors, e.g., mechanical trauma from sharp exposed marginal fixture threadings against the mucosa may also contribute to the development of gingival inflammation.

The probing depths constantly decreased throughout the study, reaching a final value of  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  (Table 3). With regard to the error of the method[5,18], this decrease was, however, not regarded as significant. About  $75\%$  of the probing depths were  $3\mathrm{mm}$  or less. Corresponding values at teeth would have indicated healthy conditions. No probing depths exceeded  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in this material.

The bridge-gingiva distances, presumably having the same measurement error as the probing depths, increased in time (Table 4). In relation to the small values of marginal bone level loss (Table 5), although not measured in the same sites, this was interpreted as a shrinkage of the gingiva. The patients had previous to fixture installation worn removable dentures, which may have stimulated the formation of excess amount of soft tissue ridges. When the mobile dentures were substituted by fixed bridges on stable fixture abutments and as the patients main tained a high standard of oral hygiene, a shrinkage of the soft tissue may consequently be expected.


Attached gingiva was present at  $65\%$  of all buccal and lingual gingival areas facing abutments (Fig. 3). In this study no gingivovestibular prosties or grafts were performed. The presence of attached gingiva could therefore only be related to its preoperative presence. Apart from the desire to prevent traumatization of the marginal soft tissues at movements of oral mucosa in those few cases where marginal threadings of the fixture were exposed, attached gingiva appeared not to be a necessity for maintaining gingival health. This observation corresponds well with earlier findings[11, 17, 28] that the presence of attached gingiva is no prerequisite for the maintenance of gingival health at teeth in the absence of plaque. In fact, WENNSTROM[28] for teeth stated that "a free gingival unit supported by loosely attached alveolar mucosa is as an effective protective barrier against bacterial plaque infection as a free gingival unit supported by a wide zone of attached gingiva". This investigation has supported the view that the same holds true also for gingival units at fixture abutments. On the other hand, BRANEMARK & ALBREKTSSON[8] for osseointegrated fixtures in the human skull bone, penetrating the skin, went so far as to state that no permanent transcutaneous passages were possible unless epidermis movements around the implant abutments had been restricted. With respect to the results it appears plausible that the movements of gingiva and/or oral mucosa in this study had been sufficiently limited.

The marginal bone height changes were small (Table 5), smaller than in all earlier studies on osseointegrated fixtures, with a mean loss of  $0.9\mathrm{mm}$  during the first year and then only  $0.05\mathrm{mm}$  annually. The accuracy of the present radiographical method was evaluated in an experimental model by

HOLLENDER & ROCKLER<sup>13</sup>. They found that the difference between the "true" and the radiographically estimated values of marginal bone heights never exceeded  $0.3 \, \text{mm}$  in stereoscopic viewing. Moreover, in agreement with the present investigation (Table 2), they found the precision to be high. One reason for the small bone height loss could be the fact that no fractures of fixtures<sup>2</sup> occurred in this material, probably due to an improved bridge fitting to the abutments. The fixture fractures in the study by ADELL et al.<sup>2</sup> were always associated with a severe and rapid marginal bone height loss. The pattern of bone height changes was consistent with the trends of earlier investigations, i.e., the maximum amount of bone loss occurred within one year after abutment connection. In this study no significant changes could in fact be proven from after six months, and no differences were observed when upper and lower jaws were mutually compared. The initial bone loss is explained by the effects of the surgical procedure, i.e., interference with periosteal vascularization and cutting of marginal bone, and by marginal stress concentrations. The procedure was so designed that the greater part of the force during tightening of the fixtures to their sites affected the marginal – generally more compact – bone before the fragile cancellous bone threadings were affected. If due attention then was not paid to the mechanical character of the marginal bone or to its degree of vascularization, a zone of anemia may have been created, resulting in an unnecessary marginal bone loss. Attempts are presently being made to reduce the first year marginal bone loss.

Another reason for marginal bone loss might have been inadequate stress distribution at bridge loading before the bone had remodelled in response to the forces regularly applied via the fixtures. The fixtures were immobile so the osseous response had to be a change in the bone architecture or mineralization. Such a load-related remodelling of bone after surgical intervention is known to be a slow process with a duration of at least one, possibly several years $^{14}$ , until a state of equilibrium is reached.


Further indications of the remodelling process were given by the significant enhancement in radiopacity close to the fixtures, especially marginally (Fig. 4). Such an increase in density has also been demonstrated in follow-up radiograms of osseointegrated fixtures by computerized image analysis $^{26}$ . Whether this successive enhancement of radiopacity was due to an increased bone volume and/or to an increased mineral content is not known. Apparently, however, the greatest remodelling occurred within the marginal area, which corroborates the in vitro findings by HARALDSON $^{12}$  on stresses concentrated to this zone. The significantly more frequent shift towards a greater radiopacity at fixtures in upper than in lower jaws may have been an effect of anatomical preoperative differences rather than a real change. Reactive differences are more clearly noticed radiographically in cancellous maxillary bone than in a bone surrounded by a thick compact shell as in the mandible. The image-giving parts of an event within a jaw are known $^{6,25}$  primarily to be an area of trabecular bone close to the inner surface of the cortex. A change in radiopacity close to a fixture may thus be masked by the cortex of a mandible, while corresponding changes in a maxilla may be more easily discerned.

The significantly more radiopaque bone, investing the most distally placed fixtures at the final examination, indicated that stress concentration arose in these sites, probably as a cantilever effect of the extended bridges. The slight tendency towards a greater marginal bone loss at the distal surfaces of fixtures in upper jaws further, supports this statement. This is consistent with the clinical observation that an initial osseointegration of fixtures in these positions was more frequently lost than in other sites of upper jaws with their reduced mechanical capacity of the cancellous bone. It is also consistent with the statement by bio-engineers[24] that the bone around the most distally situated anchorage elements, supporting cantilever bridges, is under greater stress concentrations than more medially placed fixtures.


About  $93\%$  of the microbiota were dominated by coccoid cells and non-motile rods (Table 7). Spirochetes and motile rods were almost completely absent. If a corresponding distribution of micro-organisms had been observed at teeth, this condition would most likely have been evaluated as a healthy state, as far as can be judged by dark-field microscopy[19].

A hemidesmosome nature of epithelium attachment to the titanium surfaces was supported by the electron microscope findings by ALBREKTSSON et al.4. They observed gingival cells of normal size and shape densely packed on the titanium abutment surfaces separated from them only by a thin layer of ground substance. They did not find any white blood cells or inflammatory cells in the bordering soft tissue.

Out of the relatively small number of biopsies - which could hardly be increased with regard to patient comfort -  $35\%$  were free from infiltrates, and only  $29\%$  received a high score of inflammation (Table 8). These values appeared to be low compared with corresponding conditions at teeth in patients with similar hygiene check-up intervals[20]. The lack of any constant correlation between the values of, or changes in, the clinical, radiographical, microbiological or histological parameters of this investigation was a striking finding. This could either be due to the material being too small or more probably - to the postulate earlier stated[2,9], namely that at least conventional clinical periodontal investigative methods do not provide the examiner with a true comprehension of the condition in the tissues surrounding osseointegrated fixtures and their abutments. It is in this context of interest to note that neither WENNSTROM nor other authors (for review, see WENNSTROM et al.) always found clinical scoring of gingivitis to correspond with the histological assessment of inflammatory cell infiltration.


The composition of the microbiota on titanium abutments also appeared different from that on teeth, irrespective of variations in probing depths and clinical inflammation. Surface energy characteristics of titanium might have influenced the accumulation of the microflora. This could have been the reason why only some few small inflammatory infiltrates were observed within the connective tissue.

The inter- and intra-examiner variations in measurement precision (Table 2) were noticeable but were not regarded as abnormal with respect to the kind of measurements performed.

Examination of individual fixture stability and radiological investigation of perifixtural bone height and quality remain as the most reliable longitudinal parameters for revealing the condition of the tissues investing fixtures. It has repeatedly been suggested[2,9] that marginal soft tissue reactions, which are not reflected in changes in marginal bone heights, have but small prognostic significance. On the other hand, it should be emphasized that marginal bone height changes, as revealed by radiograms, are slow reactions and that correlations between this parameter and e.g., gingivitis, irrespective of its cause, were established for some observations. Consequently, a neglect of soft tissue reactions at fixture abutments cannot be justified.

This study once more verified that the greatest changes in the marginal soft and hard barrier tissues occur during the first year after abutment connection. If similar results as in this investigation had been obtained in a group of dentated patients under in other respects comparable circumstances, a conclusion would probably have been drawn that these patients generally had fairly healthy marginal soft and hard tissue conditions. The prognosis would most likely have been considered good, especially with regard to the dominant presence of coccoid cells and non-motile rods and the small annual marginal bone loss.


# Summary and conclusions

(1) The values of the clinical parameters - if compared with corresponding conditions at teeth - in general indicated a healthy soft tissue status at the fixture abutments. Plaque and gingivitis were absent at  $70 - 75\%$  and  $80 - 85\%$ , respectively, of the abutments throughout the investigation. The mean final probing depth was  $2.9 \mathrm{~mm}$ . About  $75\%$  of the probing depths were  $3 \mathrm{~mm}$  or less and none exceeded  $5 \mathrm{~mm}$ . About  $65\%$  of the abutments were surrounded by attached gingiva. The bridge-gingiva distance increased throughout the study and was  $3.2 \mathrm{~mm}$  after 39 months.

(2) The marginal bone height changes were minute - only  $0.9\mathrm{mm}$  marginal bone was lost as a mean during the first year and then not more than  $0.05\mathrm{mm}$  per year. After 6 months no significant changes in marginal bone levels occurred.
(3) The peri-fixtural bone became more and more radiopaque, especially obvious marginally in upper jaws, indicating a successive load-related remodelling.
(4) The microbiota, studied by dark-field microscopy, was dominated by micro-organisms, significant for healthy conditions in gingival pockets at teeth. Coccoid cells and non-motile rods comprised  $93\%$  of the micro-organisms.

(5) The soft tissue biopsies revealed healthy gingiva in  $35\%$  of the specimens and in a further  $29\%$  of the samples only a slight inflammation was found. The biopsies did not imply the presence of any progressive gingivitis.
(6) No continuous correlations could be proven between values or changes in any of the parameters. Conventional clinical periodontal examination methods thus did not appear to give a full comprehension of the conditions in the soft tissues adjacent to fixture abutments.
(7) Individual fixture mobility tests and quantitative and qualitative radiological investigations remain as the most reliable longitudinal examination methods but neglect of soft tissue conditions cannot be justified.
(8) The prognosis for the osseintegrated implants appears excellent, especially with regard to the microbiota, the small marginal bone height changes, and the radiological indications of remodelling in the peri-fixtural bone. It can be established with great certainty after the first year has passed.
