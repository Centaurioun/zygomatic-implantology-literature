# Abstract

Background: Zygomatic implants alone or in combination with conventional implants have been used for severe atrophic maxillary arches. Long-term outcomes of extramaxillary technique need validations.

Purpose: To retrospectively assess the clinical outcomes and the prevalence of surgical, biological, and prosthetic complications of implant-fixed complete dental prostheses (IFCDPs) supported by zygomatic implants up to 11 years of follow-up.

Materials and methods: Dental records of 34 subjects treated between October 2008 and June 2019 were reviewed. Patients received an immediate fixed full-arch prosthesis supported solely by zygomatic implants or by a combination of zygomatic and conventional implants.

Results: A total of 90 zygomatic implants and 53 standard implants were placed. Up to 11 years of follow-up, two conventional implants were lost, leading to  $96.2\%$  success rate for conventional implants and  $100\%$  for zygomatic implants. Marginal bone loss for conventional implants averaged  $0.85 \pm 0.17 \mathrm{~mm}$  after the first year and  $1.36 \pm 0.12 \mathrm{~mm}$  after 10 years, resulting in full implant success. No prosthesis was lost. The main surgical complication was the perforations of the Schneiderian membrane, occurring in five patients and in seven sinus cavities. Considering the biological complications, mucositis for standard and zygomatic implants ranged between  $21\% - 35\%$  and  $26\% - 40\%$ , respectively. No periimplantitis were reported. Soft tissue hypertrophy ranged between  $1.8\%$  and  $30\%$  for conventional implants and  $1.1\% - 35\%$  for zygomatic implants. Inflammation under the prosthesis ranged between  $33\%$  and  $50\%$ . For the mechanical complications, abutment loosening was recorded in  $5.8\%$  of cases (two patients), tooth debonding and fracture of the prosthesis happened in five subjects  $(14.7\%)$ , and loosening of the prosthetic screws was reported in one patient  $(2.9\%)$ .

Conclusions: Immediate rehabilitation of the severely atrophic maxilla with zygomatic implants alone or in combination with standard implants could be considered a viable treatment modality.

# What is known

Systematic reviews evidenced good clinical outcomes for full-arch fixed prosthesis supported by zygomatic implants. There are only a few long-term clinical studies with extramaxillary approach and surgical, biological, and prosthetic complications are poorly assessed.

# What this study adds

This study reported long-term clinical outcomes and surgical, biological, and prosthetic complications up to 11-years of follow-up.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

After tooth loss, the alveolar ridge undergoes progressive atrophy, which may become severe over time especially in edentulous jaws. $^{1}$  Three main alternatives are available for complete edentulism: removable denture, implant-retained overdenture, and fixed implant-supported prostheses. $^{2}$  The latter offers an established long-term predictability as well as a higher level of satisfaction for the patient in terms of aesthetics, phonetics, and function. $^{3,4}$

In cases of severe maxillary atrophy, the placement of implants to support a fixed prosthesis can be challenging due to reduced bone volume, $^{5}$  poor bone quality (type III and IV according to Lekholm and Zarb $^{6}$ ), and difficulties related to the surgical approach. $^{7}$  Various techniques can be used to obtain sufficient bone volume prior to implant placement such as sinus augmentation, $^{8}$  bone grafts from intraoral and extraoral sites, $^{9}$  Le Fort I osteotomies with interposition grafts, $^{10}$  and titanium mesh. $^{11}$  However, all of these procedures require long treatment times involving potential for multiple surgeries with possible severe complications and high morbidity. This may make patients less likely to accept these treatment modalities. $^{12}$

In 1988, Brânemark introduced the use of zygomatic implants (ZI) associated with conventional/standard fixtures to support a dental prosthesis.[13] The surgical technique involved drilling on the palatal side of the residual crest and an implant osteotomy created inside the sinus cavity, leading to the perforation of the sinus membrane. His first clinical work on 28 patients and 52 ZIs had an implant success of  $96.2\%$  after 5 years of loading.[13] However,  $14\%$  of the subjects developed sinusitis. Additionally, the palatal emergence of the implant platform affected the patient's phonetics and made daily hygiene maintenance difficult.

More recently, surgical techniques have evolved $^{14}$  and new implant morphologies have been created to overcome the complications that were observed with the Brænemark approach. $^{15}$  The osteotomy can be started at the level of the residual ridge, and the Zl can be inserted external to the sinus membrane, preserving its integrity. The morphology of the implant that does not have threads throughout its body has the purpose of reducing the trauma for the soft tissue and the risk of tissue recession. The short and medium-term results of the Zls are promising, $^{16-18}$  as evidenced by a scientific literature review on 1541 zygomatic implants with a survival rate of  $97.86\%$ . $^{19}$  The data, however, are heterogeneous in terms of design, number of patients treated, follow-up, and loading protocols. $^{20,21}$


The aim of this retrospective clinical study is to assess the clinical outcomes and to measure the prevalence of surgical, biological, and prosthetic complications of implant-fixed complete dental prostheses (IFCDPs) supported by zygomatic implants up to 11 years of follow-up.

# 2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

# 2.1 Study design

This study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines.[22] Dental records of 34 subjects treated between October 2008 and June 2019 were reviewed. These individuals are a subset of patients from an ongoing prospective clinical study[17] aimed to assess the clinical behavior of immediately loaded IFCDPs supported by ZIs alone or by a combination of zygomatic and standard implants. Fifteen patients received implants and the immediate prosthesis in a private clinic in Lisbon, Portugal, while the remaining subjects underwent surgical and prosthetic phases in Bollate, Italy. One surgeon (AE) with experience in full-arch implant rehabilitations and immediate loading procedures performed all the surgeries, while the restorative phases were performed by the same group of clinicians. Patients were informed of the nature of the study, benefits, risks, and possible alternative treatments with their advantages and disadvantages and they signed an informed consent. The study protocol was in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2004.


Patients were considered for the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: age  $\geq 18$  years the day of the surgery with no restriction for race and gender; complete edentulous maxilla with extreme horizontal and vertical resorption of the posterior ridges preventing implant placement in the pterygoid area/tuberosity or conventional implants without sinus augmentation (class V and VI according to Cawood and Howell $^{23,24}$ ); insufficient bone volume in the premaxilla for implants of at least  $3.3\mathrm{mm}$  diameter and/or  $10\mathrm{mm}$  length; patients with good general health and physically and psychologically able to undergo a surgical procedure under general anesthesia (class 1 and 2 according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists). Exclusion criteria were history of systemic disease (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, cancer, HIV, and diseases of the immune system, disorders that compromise wound healing, bone metabolic diseases) or any other immunosuppressive therapy that represents a contraindication for oral surgical treatment; existing sinusitis and active infection in the areas intended for implant placement; irradiation to the head and neck region within 60 months; use of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates at any time; pregnancy or lactating period; heavy smokers (more than 20 cigarettes/day); inability to maintain adequate level of plaque control.

# 2.2 Surgical phase and prosthetic protocol

A panoramic radiograph, a radiograph of the skull in lateral view and a CBCT (cone-beam computer tomography) that includes the zygoma and the osteomeatal complex were taken. The DICOM files were acquired with a dedicated software (NobelClinician, Nobel Biocare) to get a 3-dimensional view of the surgical area. Measurement of the residual ridge height, represented by the distance between the alveolar crest and the bottom of the maxillary sinus, were recorded from the cross-sectional images of the CBCT (Table 1). Particular attention was given to the radiographic appearance of the sinus membrane. Subjects presenting minimal or moderate thickening of the sinus membrane or a dome-shape cyst were included in the study. In case of sinus ostial narrowing/obstruction or extensive sinus opacification, consultation with an ENT was recommended for diagnosis and surgical treatment. Subjects were then recruited and treated when the sinus and the ostium were evaluated healthy and permeable. Intra-oral and extra-oral clinical examinations were conducted by the surgeon and all members of the restorative team. The amount of keratinized gingiva, smile line, lip support, and inter-arch relationship were noted. The status of the existing removable prosthesis, if used by the patient, was assessed. If an improper vertical dimension of occlusion was recorded, a new complete denture was fabricated and it was delivered to the patient for 6 months, recording any sign of temporomandibular joint pathology or patient discomfort.


Surgical planning was performed based on the observation of the radiographs and the clinical examination of the patient, but the final decision related to implants number, position, and configuration was taken intraoperatively by the surgeon after the evaluation of the local bone density. Placement of only ZIs with an extramaxillary approach or a combination of zygomatic and conventional implants, inserted axially, or with a certain degree of inclination relative to the bone crest were the possible treatment modalities.

Antibiotic prophylaxis was given 1 h before surgery, consisting of  $2\mathrm{g}$  of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (Augmentin, Roche, Milan, Italy). Three days prior to surgery and 10 days postoperatively, chlorhexidine digluconate of  $0.2\%$  mouthwash (Curasept, Curaden Healthcare S.R.L., Milan, Italy) was prescribed. Surgical procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Local anesthesia with articaine chlorhydrate/adrenaline of 1:100000 (Alfacaina N; Weimer Pharma, Rastatt, Germany) was used, providing infiltration in the vestibular area of the maxilla up to the zygoma, followed by bilateral block of the greater palatine nerve. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication (Naprossene Sodico  $550\mathrm{mg}$ , Synflex Forte, Recordati, Milan, Italy) was prescribed postsurgery as needed for pain and corticosteroid medication (Prednisone, Teva Italia) was given daily with a tapering dose (15 mg at surgery, 10 mg on the first 2 days postoperative, and 5 mg on Days 3 and 4 postoperative).

The surgical approach has been described in a previous report. $^{17}$  The zygomatic implants were placed following the protocol described by Maló. $^{15}$  A linear incision starting from the molar area to the contralateral side was made slightly offset to the palate, with two vertical releasing incisions over the zygomatic process. A full thickness flap was elevated, exposing the piriform rim and the body of the zygomatic bone with its inferior edge. The infraorbital nerve was isolated and the insertion of the masseter muscle was identified, thus representing the superior and inferior limits for the zygomatic implants, respectively. The fibromucosa of the hard palate was also reflected to avoid interferences with the rotary instruments. If knife edge ridges were present, bony forceps or a diamond round bur were used to create a flat bone profile.

Based on the preoperative clinical and radiographic evaluation and after a direct assessment of the residual bone volume and density, the surgeon decided the proper implant configuration for every single case. Patients were treated with the All-on-4 Extra-Maxilla (four ZIs) or All-on-4 Hybrid protocols (one ZI per side and 2 to 4 conventional implants in the premaxilla) or by a combination of zygomatic and conventional implants. The zygomatic implants were placed first with the aim of optimizing their primary stability and respecting the integrity of the local anatomical structures represented by the infraorbital nerve, the orbit, and the infratemporal fossa. The osteotomy was conducted as posterior as possible but maintaining a safe distance of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  from the posterior vertical edge of the zygoma. Multiblade and diamonds burs were used to remove bone from the buccal surface of the maxillary bone at the base of the zygoma until reaching the Schneiderian membrane. With the use of manual instruments the membrane was

mobilized inward to preserve its integrity and create space for the implant drills. Moreover, it was possible to assess the morphology of the zygomatic bone and to determine the axis of insertion for the zygomatic implants. The surgical technique aimed to place the body of the zygomatic implants into a virtual space created between the sinus membrane and the inner surface of the maxillary bone or to accommodate the zygomatic implants tangent to that surface. In the majority of the cases, due to the advanced atrophy, the body and the neck of the zygomatic implants will not be in contact with bone and they will be covered only by soft tissue. In presence of a residual ridge the osteotomy was conducted starting from the palatal slope of the ridge and the implant platform was entirely surrounded by bone (Figure 1). The zygomatic implants were carefully inserted at a low speed (20-50 rpm) and the final seating was completed with a manual wrench.


In the All-on-4 Extra-Maxilla, the posterior zygomatic implants usually emerged at the level of the second premolars, while the platform of the anterior fixtures was located at the level of the lateral incisors (Figures 2-4). In the All-on-4 Hybrid and in the rehabilitations combining zygomatic and conventional implants, the ZIs were placed first and the standard implants were subsequently inserted in the
FIGURE 1 Two zygomatic implants have been placed with the extramaxillary approach on the right side, while on the second quadrant one zygomatic and one conventional implant with a mesial inclination have been inserted. Due to the morphology of the residual ridge and the entry point of the osteotomy towards the palate, native bone is present all around the implant head. This bone is very useful to support the facial flap and reduce the risk of soft tissue dehiscence along the body of the zygomatic implants

Two types of zygomatic implants with an anodically surface (TiUnite; Nobel Biocare AB) were used in this study. The NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  (Nobel Biocare AB) had a straight head, an external hex connection, and a 5-mm diameter body that ends with a narrow tip and active threads. The threads were not present along the body or in proximity of the connection. The NobelZygoma  $45^{\circ}$  (Nobel Biocare AB) differed from the previous one because of the  $45^{\circ}$  angulated neck and the 4-mm diameter body. Thirty, forty-five, and sixty degrees angulated multiunit abutments were placed over the NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  to correct the emergence of the prosthetic screw, while 17 and  $30^{\circ}$  abutments were available for the NobelZygoma  $45^{\circ}$ . Abutments angulated at  $17^{\circ}$  or straight abutments were positioned on standard implants. The flaps were sutured trying to create a collar of keratinized gingiva around each fixture. Three hours after the
FIGURE 3 Detail of the zygomatic implants on the right side
FIGURE 4 Detail of the zygomatic implants on the left side surgery, all patients received an immediate fixed temporary prosthesis containing 10 teeth and made entirely in acrylic resin with nanohybrid composite teeth (SR Phonares II, Ivoclar Vivadent). Occlusion was limited between canines with no contacts in lateral excursion. Six months later, final prosthesis containing a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) Procera titanium framework with IvoBase Hybrid PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) resin and 12 Phonares II teeth (Ivoclar Vivadent) were fabricated (Figures 6 and 7). Functional scheme included group function and mutually protected occlusion. IvoBase Injector (Ivoclar Vivadent) was used for processing.


# 2.3 Data collection and follow-up protocol

The functionality of the prosthesis and tissue healing were assessed on a weekly basis during the first month. Recall appointments were scheduled with the same experienced hygienist every 3 months in the
FIGURE 5 Panoramic radiograph taken at 2-years follow-up with the final prosthesis
FIGURE 6 Final prosthesis first year and then twice a year. Depending on patient compliance and risk factors (i.e., history of periodontal disease, diabetes, and smoking), a personalized recall schedule was set in agreement with the patient and the clinician. A panoramic radiograph was taken every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly thereafter. Periapical films were obtained only for the standard implants every 6 months because of difficulties in achieving a proper film alignment due to the lack of palatal concavity in almost all cases. Bone level was measured by calculating the distance between the fixture and the most coronal point of the peri-implant bone, on both the mesial and distal side, using the implant-abutment junction as a reference point. Mesial and distal values were averaged to have a single measurement for every implant. To adjust for dimensional distortion and enlargement on the radiographs, the actual sizes of the implants were compared to the measured implant dimensions on the radiographs. The prostheses were removed after 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter, and any screw loosening was recorded. The stability of each implant was tested clinically with the pressure of two opposing instruments. The torque of the abutment screw was checked for every implant. Any complication with the prosthetic components was also recorded.


When the prosthesis was removed, the presence of plaque and bleeding was evaluated by gently inserting a plastic periodontal probe (Perio-Probe; Kerr Corporation, Bioggio, Switzerland)  $1\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the gingival margin. Each implant was examined on four aspects (mesial, distal, buccal, and palatal). If at least one site presented plaque, the implant was considered positive for plaque accumulation. The same criteria were used for bleeding on probing. An implant was considered positive for bleeding on probing (clinical sign of mucositis) if there was bleeding at least in one of the four sites. During the same visit, the probing depth was assessed at four sites for each conventional fixture, recording values equal or superior to  $4\mathrm{mm}$ . Soft tissue recession with exposure of the implant surface was also noted.

# 2.4 Primary outcome measures

The primary outcome measures for this study were prosthetic success, survival and success for conventional implants and success for zygomatic implants.

Prosthetic success was defined as a prosthesis that was in function, without mobility or pain, even if one or more implants were lost. Prosthesis stability was tested by means of pressure between two opposing instruments. The prosthesis was judged as a failure if the implants on one side of the arch were lost.

Implant survival for conventional implants was defined according to the following criteria $^{25}$ : (1) the implant fulfilled its function as support for the reconstruction; (2) no signs of persistent pain or infection were evident; (3) no radiolucent areas indicative of an encapsulation were observed around the implants, as evaluated on periapical radiographs or panoramic films; (4) stability when individually and manually tested upon removal of the prosthesis. Additionally, if an implant reported marginal bone loss of less than  $1.5 \mathrm{~mm}$  after the first year and less than  $0.1 \mathrm{~mm}$  per year thereafter, it was considered a success. Implant removal was listed as failure.

Zygomatic implants were considered successful if they met the first three criteria mentioned for the conventional implants. In terms of stability, some differences with the conventional implants existed. ZIs are considered successful if there is no mobility or slightly visible

If there was rotation associated or not with pain and evidence of loss of integration at the level of the zygoma, the implant was considered as a failure.[14,26]


# 2.5 Secondary outcome measures

The secondary outcome measures for this study were intraoperative and postoperative complications, biological complications, and prosthetic (technical and mechanical) complications.

Surgical complications included perforation of the sinus membrane, perforation of the orbit, fracture of the zygomatic bone, injury of the infraorbital or zygomatic facial nerve, facial hematoma, development of sinusitis.

Biological complications consisted in peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis, hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the soft tissue,[27] soft tissue recession without exposure of the implant rough surface, fistula, or abscess.

Prosthetic complications included prosthetic or abutment screw loosening, wear of the prosthetic material, minor or major chipping of the veneering material or pink acrylic, tooth debonding, fracture of the prosthetic screw, the abutment, the framework, or the implant.


# 2.6 Statistical analysis

A dataset including records for eligible patients was compiled. Implant details and patient demographic data were complete. Descriptive statistics for numerical parameters was performed with means and standard deviations and SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used.

# 3 | RESULTS

# 3.1 Demographic

Thirty-four participants, 10 male and 24 female, were enrolled and treated between October 2008 and June 2019 (Table 2). The mean age the day of surgery was 65 years (range 46-78 years). Nine subjects  $(26.5\%)$  were smokers the day of the surgery: five of them reported a daily consumption of 5 cigarettes and four patients smoked an average of 10 cigarettes per day. Over the interval from surgery to the last follow-up, three patients quit smoking. None of the patient reported signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis prior to the surgery. The opposing dentition was natural teeth (2 cases), natural dentition with fixed dental prosthesis on natural teeth (10 cases), natural dentition with fixed dental prosthesis on implants (4 cases), natural teeth with Kennedy class I removable partial denture (RPD) (1 case), implant retained prosthesis (two interferominal implants with locator attachments in 4 cases), implant fixed complete dental prosthesis (7 cases), complete removable denture (6 cases). One patient treated with an All-on-Four Extra Maxilla died 5 months after the surgery for reason unrelated to the study, resulting on an average follow-up of 92.33 ± 47.05 months (range 14-141 months). All other subjects attended the scheduled recall visits.


# 3.2 | Implant and prosthesis

A total of 90 zygomatic implants (71 NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  and 19 NobelZygoma  $45^{\circ}$ , Nobel Biocare AB) and 53 standard implants (NobelSpeedy Groovy, Nobel Biocare AB) were placed. All standard implants reached a minimum insertion torque of 40 Ncm, while every ZI was inserted with a minimum torque of 50 Ncm. Every implant was immediately loaded with a fixed prosthesis as planned. Eleven patients were treated with an All-on-4 Extra Maxilla (9 subjects using NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  and two patients with NobelZygoma  $45^{\circ}$ ), 19 subjects received All-on-4 Hybrid (17 associated with two standard implants, one with 3 standard implants and one with 4 standard implants), 2 subjects received three zygomatic implants and one conventional implant, 2 subjects were treated with one zygomatic implant and three conventional implants (two axial and one tilted).

One female patient broke her temporary prosthesis 5 months after loading while she was abroad and she lost the conventional implant in position of the right lateral incisor. The prosthesis was originally supported by three conventional implants and one NobelZygoma  $45^{\circ}$  implant on the left side. In the opposing arch an implant fixed supported prosthesis was present. The emergency was resolved by a local dentist with the delivery of an interim complete denture. A new conventional implant was placed in the same position 4 months later when the patient came back to Italy. A new temporary fixed prosthesis was delivered the same day. A male patient treated with All-on-4 Hybrid lost a conventional implant in position of right lateral incisor 1 year after loading. The same day, a new implant was placed in canine position and it was connected to the existing definitive prosthesis. Five months later a new bridge was made. His opposing dentition included natural teeth and removable partial denture with metal framework. Details of implant failure are presented in Table 3.


No other implants were lost up to 144 months, resulting in  $96.2\%$  of cumulative survival rate for conventional implants (Table 4). None of the zygomatic implants evidenced mobility, leading to a success of  $100\%$  (Table 5). Based on the established criteria no prosthetic failure occurred, with a success rate of  $100\%$ .

# 3.3 Peri-implant parameters

For conventional implants, bone level measurements were made after 6 months, 1 year and then annually. Marginal bone loss averaged  $0.85 \pm 0.17$  mm after 1 year ( $n = 52$ ),  $1.18 \pm 0.10$  mm after 5 years ( $n = 38$ ) and  $1.36 \pm 0.12$  mm ( $n = 19$ ) after 10 years, leading to an implant success of  $100\%$ . Percentage of implants with plaque accumulation, bleeding on probing, and probing depth superior to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  (recorded only for conventional implants) are also presented (Table 6). No suppuration was recorded for standard or ZI at any time.

# 3.4 Complications

All patients had swelling in the surgical area and 15 subjects presented with facial hematoma. Seven small perforations of the Schneiderian membrane happened during drilling in five patients and in seven sinus cavities. Considering a total of 90 zygomatic implants placed in 34 patients and 66 sinus cavities, the percentage of perforation was  $7.7\%$ ,  $20.5\%$ , and  $10.6\%$  considering the implant, patient, and sinus as level of analysis, respectively. Three perforations occurred at the level of the zygoma in three patients and three sinus cavities. None of the patients developed sinusitis. Two subjects had a perforation at the level of the zygoma in one sinus and one perforation close to the bone crest in the other sinus. One of these two patients, treated with All-on-Four Extra Maxilla, experienced dehiscence of the wound in the postoperative phase with exposure of the implant surface. She also developed an oroantral communication and sinusitis after 5 months. The second subjects did not develop sinusits. A female subject, with no surgical perforation, developed sinusitis with exposure of the zygomatic implant surface after 5 years. In total, 2 out of

34 patients had sinusitis after treatment (5.88%). No perforation of the orbit, fracture of the zygoma, or nerve injuries were reported.

Biological complications are listed in Table 7. Mucositis for standard and zygomatic implants ranged between  $21\% -35\%$  and  $26\% -40\%$ , respectively. No peri-implantitis were reported. Soft tissue hypertrophy ranged between  $1.8\%$  and  $30\%$  for conventional implants and  $1.1\%$  and  $35\%$  for zygomatic implants. Percentage of implants with visible threads varied between  $2.6\%$  and  $15.7\%$  for conventional implants, while zygomatic implants showed implant surface in a percentage of  $3.2\%$  and  $8.9\%$ . Inflammation under the prosthesis ranged between  $33\%$  and  $50\%$ . Limiting the analysis to the All-on-Four Extra Maxilla prosthesis, inflammation was reported in 8 out the 10 patients who were followed-up ( $80\%$  of the subjects).

Prosthetic complications occurred in seven patients and in seven prosthesis (20.5% of the patients). One subject experienced screw loosening of the 30 degree abutment 10 years after loading and a second patient had screw loosening of the  $45^{\circ}$  abutment after 2 years. Two subjects reported chipping of a tooth in the temporary prosthesis and two patients lost one tooth in the final bridge after 5 and 6 years of loading, respectively. One patient broke the immediate prosthesis and she lost one conventional implant. One subject had multiple loosening of the prosthetic screws and all of them were replaced every 2 years. Summarizing, abutment loosening occurred in 5.8% of cases (2 patients), tooth debonding and fracture of the prosthesis happened in 5 subjects (14.7%) (two subjects had fixed implant prosthesis in the mandible, one had implant retained overdenture and two subjects had natural dentition with implant fixed prosthesis) and loosening of the prosthetic screws was reported in one patient (2.9%).

# 4 DISCUSSION

The aim of this retrospective study was to report the clinical outcomes and the complications of immediate fixed prosthesis supported by zygomatic implants alone or by a combination of zygomatic and standard fixtures for the treatment of severely atrophic maxillary arches.

The fixed implant rehabilitation of extreme maxillary atrophy represents a challenge because of the insufficient bone volume, the extensive sinus pneumatization, the poor bone quality, and the discrepancy of spatial relationship between the arches. In a long-term clinical study, Chiapasco et al.[28] reported the clinical outcomes and implant success after Le Fort 1 osteotomy and interposition graft. The authors noted a cumulative implant success of  $82.9\%$ , significantly inferior compared to the implant placed in native bone. Moreover, a mean hospitalization of 2.5 days, high morbidity related to the donor site and a total treatment time that can reach 18 months were the most common findings. An alternative approach is represented by the volumetric bone reconstruction with titanium mesh and autogenous bone and bone substitutes. A systematic review by Briguglio[11] highlighted a cumulative implant success of  $82.25\%$ , an average vertical regeneration ranging from 2.56 to 6 mm and a high risk of soft tissue dehiscence with exposure of the grid. In our clinical studies the

majority of the patients experienced one or multiple failures with previous bone augmentation procedures and they refused the option of a regenerative approach.

Up to 11 years of follow-up, no prosthesis was lost and implant success rate of  $96.2\%$  was reported for conventional implants and  $100\%$  for zygomatic implants. These percentages are in line with the results of a study by Sales and coworkers[29] that aimed to evaluate the quality of the systematic reviews that assessed the efficacy of zygomatic implants for the rehabilitation of severe atrophic maxillae. Considering seven systematic reviews, aggregate implant success rate was  $96.72\%$ . A recent multicenter retrospective study on 249 patients followed for over 5 years reported an overall implant survival rate of  $97.6\%$  for 452 ZI.[30] Malo reported cumulative survival rate of  $98.2\%$  for 747 extramaxillary zygomatic implants and  $98.2\%$  for 795 conventional implants up to 7 years of loading.[16] A multicenter randomized clinical trial by Davó and coworkers presented 1-year post-loading results from 71 patients with severely atrophic maxillary arches.[31] Half of the patient were treated with zygomatic implants and immediately loaded fixed prosthesis, while the other half received sinus augmentation with xenograft, delayed implant placement and conventional loading protocol. Preliminary data reported better outcomes for the zygomatic implant group, with significantly higher prosthetic and implant success rates. Long-term data are needed to confirm those results.

Scientific literature reports three surgical techniques for zygomatic implant placement: the Brænemark technique (often identified as the classic or intrasinus approach),<sup>13</sup> the slot technique proposed by Stella and Warner,<sup>32</sup> and the extramaxillary approach developed by Aparicio<sup>14</sup> and Maló.<sup>15</sup> In this study the zygomatic implants were placed following the protocol previously described by Maló.<sup>15</sup> The extramaxillary approach allows for the integrity of the membrane to be preserved during the drilling phases and for the zygomatic implant to be placed in a space between the membrane and the inner surface of the maxillary bone. The surgical technique provides for the creation of a groove along the surface of the maxillary bone until the membrane is exposed underneath. The membrane will later be mobilized inward with manual instruments to create space for the drills.<sup>17</sup> In our study, five perforations occurred close to the zygoma and the implant worked as a seal. Only two perforations in two subjects happened close to the crest and in one case, the patient developed sinusitis. The classic approach, on the other side, created the perforation of the sinus membrane, because of the trajectory of the osteotomy. Even if this does not cause significant complications, an analysis carried out by D'Agostino<sup>33</sup> highlighted a greater risk of sinusitis in patients treated with the classic approach compared with a technique that tries to preserve the integrity of the membrane. Chrcanovic found that isolated sinusitis without the creation of an oroantral fistula has not been associated with failure of the implant, and sinusitis alone might not cause implant loss.<sup>21</sup>


Maxillary sinusitis is the most common complication associated with zygomatic implant surgery.[21,29] In the present analysis, the percentage of sinusitis was  $5.88\%$ , which is in line with the results of Sales  $(5.86\%)$ .[29] One patient with sinus perforation close to the ridge and wound dehiscence developed sinusitis after 5 months. A second patient reported sinusitis after 5 years, and this was also associated with delayed exposure of the implant surface. A systematic review by Chrcanovic pointed out that prevalence of sinusitis is not reported by many authors and that this complication might arise years after the surgery while the majority of the studies on zygomatic implants have short follow-up.[21] Sinusitis can be caused by many factors, such as blockage of maxillary osmium by surgical debris, bacterial migration from to oral cavity to the sinus through perforations, and lack of osseointegration in the most coronal part of the zygomatic implant resulting in its mobility during function.[21] Moreover, sinusitis might be related more to oroantral communications than to exposed implant threads. Additionally, there is no consensus on how to diagnosis this condition and many studies do not report the pre-existing status of the sinus before the surgery.[21] The authors believe that the reduced prevalence of sinusitis might find justification in the preservation of the integrity of the sinus membrane associated with the placement of the zygomatic implant external to it.

The percentage of peri-implant mucositis reported in this analysis is significantly higher compared to previous studies and systematic

If bleeding was evidenced in one of the four sites intended for probing after removing the prosthesis during the hygiene recall visit, an implant was identified as positive. In many cases, bleeding was noted in the palatal surface of the posterior zygomatic implants, where the access for the hygiene instruments is limited. Pain and suppuration was never reported by the patients. Hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the soft tissue was noted in particular around the palatal aspect of some zygomatic implants. The tissue appeared pink in color, with no bleeding and no sign of inflammation. This reaction might occur as tissue remodeling under the prostheses during function or because of chronic trauma from the hygiene instruments. This finding is not correlated with bone loss or peri-implantitis. When the majority of the patients were treated, only  $30^{\circ}$  abutments with a height of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  were available. The deep placement of the implant platform and the thick fibromucosa of the palate resulted in a subgingval position of the abutment. Nowadays abutments of  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in height exist to overcome this problem. Moreover, many patients had reduced manual dexterity due to advanced age and the increased height of the prosthetic flange makes domestic maintenance more difficult.


Exposure of the surface for the zygomatic implants occurred in two patients for a total of six implants and a prevalence of  $8.9\%$ . One patient had a history of multiple failures of onlay grafts with scar tissue that resulted in wound dehiscence after the placement of four zygomatic implants. Due to the local anatomy, the body and the head of the implants were outside the maxillary bone, covered only by soft tissue. In order to prevent dehiscence of the soft tissue, the use of the buccal fat pad during the implant placement can be used to cover the implant surface.[37] Aparicio has recently published a technique called "scarf graft" that is based on the dissection of a pedunculated connective tissue from the palatal flap that will be sutured around the buccal aspect of the implant neck with the purpose of increasing the soft tissue thickness.[38] In order to prevent the risk of sinusitis and soft tissue recession, Penarrocha has proposed a guideline[39] that included bone augmentation techniques or soft tissue enhancement procedures (free connective tissue graft stabilized with pins or pedunculated palatal rotation graft) depending on the position of the implant platform and the condition of the residual ridge after the placement. The clinical outcomes of a retrospective case series were promising in establishing a stable soft tissue around the facial implant platform.

In the present analysis, prosthetic complications occurred in  $20.5\%$  of the cases, significantly inferior compared to Maló's study  $(44\%$  of the patients). These data are not always reported in the systematic reviews. For example, it was mentioned in three out of the seven reviews analyzed by Sales with a cumulative percentage of  $2.81\%$ .[29]


The main limitations of this study are the retrospective design and the reduced number of patients. This is because the authors have used the zygoma option only in cases of severe bone deficiency. Many clinical situations have been treated with the conventional Allon-4 protocol alone or in combination with the trans-sinus tilted implants.[40]

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

Immediate rehabilitation of the severely atrophic maxilla with zygomatic implants alone or in combination with standard implants could be considered a viable treatment modality. Advanced surgical skills, proper learning curve, and adequate prosthetic protocols are necessary to achieve high implant survival rates and reduced prevalence of surgical, biological, and prosthetic complications.
