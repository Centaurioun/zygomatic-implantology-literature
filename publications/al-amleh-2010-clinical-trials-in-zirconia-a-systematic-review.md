SUMMARY Zirconia is unique in its polymorphic crystalline makeup, reported to be sensitive to manufacturing and handling processes, and there is debate about which processing method is least harmful to the final product. Currently, zirconia restorations are manufactured by either soft or hard-milling processes, with the manufacturer of each claiming advantages over the other. Chipping of the veneering porcelain is reported as a common problem and has been labelled as its main clinical setback. The objective of this systematic review is to report on the clinical success of zirconia-based restorations fabricated by both milling processes, in regard to framework fractures and veneering porcelain chipping. A comprehensive review of the literature was completed for in vivo trials on zirconia restorations in MEDLINE and PubMed between 1950 and 2009. A manual hand search of relevant dental journals was also completed. Seventeen clinical trials involving zirconia-based restorations were found, 13 were conducted on fixed partial dentures, two on single crowns and two on zirconia implant abutments, of which 11 were based on soft-milled zirconia and six on hard-milled zirconia. Chipping of the veneering porcelain was a common occurrence, and framework fracture was only observed in soft-milled zirconia. Based on the limited number of short-term in vivo studies, zirconia appears to be suitable for the fabrication of single crowns, and fixed partial dentures and implant abutments providing strict protocols during the manufacturing and delivery process are adhered to. Further long-term prospective studies are necessary to establish the best manufacturing process for zirconia-based restorations.

# Introduction

In dentistry, gold and metal-alloys have passed the test of time and are recognized as predictable and well-established clinical materials for the restoration of various fixed prostheses (1). Indeed, metal-ceramic systems require relatively little special knowledge for their routine use which has led to their worldwide acceptance and use since their inception. Nevertheless, the increasing aesthetic demand in dentistry has driven the development of a number of ceramics for their aesthetic capability, biocompatibility, colour stability, wear resistance and low thermal conductivity (2). As far back as 1885, porcelain jacket crowns were first used for single crowns for the anterior teeth because of their aesthetic and natural appearance (3). However, ceramics cannot withstand deformation strain of more than  $0.1\% - 0.3\%$  without fracturing and are susceptible to fatigue fracture. It is this brittleness, because of the ionic-covalent atomic bonding, which has limited their use in dentistry for decades (4).


The most recent introduction to the dental ceramics family is zirconia, which in its pure form is a polymorphic material that occurs in three temperature-dependant forms that are: monoclinic (room temperature to  $1170^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ), tetragonal ( $1170^{\circ}\mathrm{C} - 2370^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) and cubic ( $2370^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  - up to melting point) (5). However, when stabilizing oxides such as magnesia, ceria, yttria and calcium are added to zirconia, the tetragonal phase is retained in a metastable condition at room temperature, enabling a phenomenon called transformation toughening to occur. The partially stabilized crystalline tetragonal zirconia, in response to mechanical stimuli, such as tensile stress at crack tips, transforms to the more stable monoclinic phase with a local increase in volume of approximately  $4\%$ . This increase in volume closes the crack tips, effectively blunting crack propagation. It is this transformation-toughening process which gives zirconia its strength and toughness, exceeding all currently available sintered ceramics. Compared to alumina, zirconia has twice the flexural strength, partly because of its grain size and the transformation-toughening mechanism. (6).


To date, there are three types of zirconia-containing ceramics which are used in dentistry. Glass-infiltrated zirconia-toughened alumina ceramics, magnesium-doped partially stabilized zirconia and  $3\mathrm{mol}\%$  yttria containing tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP), with the latter being the most utilised form in dentistry because of its higher flexural strength reported to range from 900 to  $1200\mathrm{MPa}$  (7). Y-TZP has been used in root canal posts (8), frameworks for all-ceramic posterior crowns and fixed partial dentures (FPDs) (9-12), implant abutments (13, 14) and dental implants (15).

Advances in CAD/CAM technology has made it possible to more readily use zirconia in dentistry. This technology enables complex shapes to be milled out of pre-made zirconia blanks (or blocks), where the prepared abutment is first scanned, then using computer software, the desired framework is designed prior to milling (16).

There are two types of zirconia milling processes available: (i) soft-milling and (ii) hard-milling. Soft-milling involves machining enlarged frameworks out of pre-sintered blanks of zirconia, also called the "green" state. These are then sintered to their full strength, which is accompanied by shrinkage of the milled framework by approximately  $25\%$  to the desired dimensions. Hard-milling involves machining the framework directly to the desired dimension out of densely sintered (higher strength and more homogenous) zirconia blanks, typically these have been hot isostatic pressed (HIPed). However, because of the extreme hardness of sintered zirconia, a robust milling system is required that needs an extended milling period compared to the soft-milling process as well as placing heavy demands on the rigidity of the cutting instruments. The relative ease and speed of soft-milling may be why more manufacturers chose this method to fabricate their dental zirconia products, while only a smaller number have used HIPed zirconia. Among the common representative systems utilizing soft-milling are Lava,\* Procera zirconia,  $\dagger$  IPS e.max ZirCAD and Cercon. Systems that utilize hard-milling of HIPed zirconia include DC-Zirkon and Denzir.\*\*


Supporters of soft-milling claim that hard-milling may introduce microcracks in the framework during the milling process. In contrast, hard-milling supporters claim a superior marginal fit because no shrinkage is involved in their manufacturing process. Nevertheless, in vitro studies support the use of both HIPed and non-HIPed zirconia for all-ceramic FPDs, crowns and implant abutments for the posterior of the mouth because of their high flexural strength and fracture toughness (17).

The most utilized zirconia in dentistry, Y-TZP, has been found to withstand cyclic fatigue testing, where posterior all-ceramic FPDs spanning up to 5-units, had a lifetime comparable to that achieved with metal-ceramic restorations (2), and it has been predicted, based on the results of this study, to have a lifetime longer than 20 years (18). However, early clinical findings show that there are two main drawbacks for zirconia restorations compared to metal-ceramics. The first is a high incidence of veneering porcelain fracture, manifesting clinically as chipping fractures, and the other is an inherent accelerated ageing problem that has been identified to occur in zirconia in the presence of water. This ageing phenomenon is known as low-temperature degradation (LTD), which causes a decrease in physical properties by spontaneous phase transformation of the zirconia crystals from the tetragonal phase to the weaker monoclinic phase putting zirconia frameworks at risk of spontaneous catastrophic failure (19).

The objective of this systematic review is to report on the clinical success of HIPed and non-HIPed Y-TZP-based restorations (single crowns, FPDs and implant abutments), focusing on the incidence of framework fracture and chipping of the veneering porcelain in both groups. In addition, recent in vitro studies conducted in an attempt to solve some of the reported problems in zirconia-based restorations are also discussed.

# Materials and methods

A search was performed in MEDLINE and PubMed for in vivo trials on zirconia restorations published between 1950 and June 2009. The main keywords used for the search and the number of articles produced were:

1 "zirconia AND clinical"- 329 articles  
2 "zirconia AND fixed partial dentures"- 130 articles  
3 "zirconia AND FPD"-23 articles  
4 "zirconia AND implant abutments"- 61 articles  
5 "zirconia AND single crowns"- 73 articles

In addition, a manual hand search was conducted through the literature to identify any possible clinical trials on Y-TZP which may have not been listed on MEDLINE and PubMed. The articles found were read to identify ones which satisfied the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:

Inclusion Criteria:

1 Human in vivo only  
2 Conducted on Y-TZP  
3 Fixed prosthetics (single crowns, FPDs or implant abutments)  
4 Study has a set inclusion and exclusion criteria  
5 Study has a materials and methods  
6 In the English language Exclusion Criteria:

1 Case reports  
2 In vitro trials  
3 Animal studies  
4 Trials  $< 12$  months

The search yielded 19 articles and abstracts involving Y-TZP restorations in clinical trials which satisfied the inclusion criteria. Following this, one final search was done by inspecting the bibliographies of the 19 reviewed articles for any additional studies, however, none were found.

# Results

In total, only 17 clinical trials involving Y-TZP-based restorations were found in the literature, of which only three are randomized control trials (14, 20, 21). The majority of studies investigated all-ceramic FPDs in the posterior mouth (4, 9-12, 20, 22-29), while a small number investigated single crowns (21, 30), implant abutments (13, 14, 31), and only one study was available on implant-supported zirconia FPDs (20). Eight different brands of Y-TZP were identified among the 17 studies with Cercon zirconia being the most investigated brand (Table 1).


The longest follow-up period found was 5 years, where two papers reported results on patients restored with zirconia all-ceramic FPDs (9, 10). Both studies involved 3 to 5-unit FPDs on natural teeth in the premolar and molar regions, except for one 3-unit FPD that replaced a lateral incisor (9). The survival rate of Y-TZP FPDs over 5 years was  $100\%$  (9) and  $74\%$  (10), and in the latter study, a 5-unit FPD framework fracture occurred, reportedly because of accidental biting of a stone in a piece of bread. While the incidence of chipping of the veneering ceramic was  $15\cdot 2\%$ , in this study, secondary caries was found to be the most common cause of failure  $(21\cdot 7\%)$ . This was attributed to the poor marginal fit produced by a prototype milling technique used to fabricate the zirconia restorations in this particular study.

Four studies reported data on 1-year follow-up periods for four different treatment modalities. These were zirconia FPDs on natural teeth (27), FPDs restored on titanium implant abutments (20), inlay-retained FPDs (28) and zirconia implant abutments(31), two of which are randomized control trials (20, 31). The highest incidence of framework fracture and chipping veneering porcelain was both reported in 1-year follow-up studies (10%(28) and  $54\%$  (20), respectively) when compared to longer follow-up periods.

# Zirconia implant abutments

Zirconia implant abutments demonstrated encouraging early results in the only two studies conducted on single-tooth implant abutments using both HIPed and non-HIPed zirconia. Glauser et al. reported no fractures of the 38 HIPed-based zirconia abutments in the anterior and premolar regions in 18 patients evaluated after 4 years (13), and favourable hard and soft tissue responses were also reported. All abutments were restored with Empress I (Leucite reinforced) crowns and cemented with Panavia  $\mathrm{TC}^{\dagger\ddagger}$  resin cement. However, screw loosening of two zirconia abutments at 8 and 27 months was reported, nevertheless no framework fracture occurred during the follow-up period.

In a randomized controlled trial, 20 customized non-HIPed-based zirconia single-tooth implant abutments  $(\mathrm{Procera}^{\dagger})$  and 20 customized titanium single-tooth implant abutments  $(\mathrm{Procera}^{\dagger})$  were followed for

HIPed, hot isostatic pressed zirconia; FPD, fixed partial denture; IRFPD, inlay-retained fixed partial denture; Ti abut, titanium implant abutment.

3 years, with no fractures or loosening of abutments in either group, and a  $100\%$  survival rate reported (14). In this study, the abutments were restored in the canine to molar regions. There was no difference in the soft tissue health around both abutment groups, nevertheless using spectrophotometric analysis, both zirconia and titanium abutments induced similar amount of discolouration of the mucosa when compared to the gingiva of natural teeth.

Both trials on zirconia implant abutments were conducted on regular platform, externally hexed implants (Branemark system-  $\mathrm{RP}^{\dagger}$ )were used for single-tooth replacement. The Branemark implant system was the first titanium dental implant introduced in the mid 1970s, nevertheless recently introduced internal type connections have been shown to improve the fracture resistance and stability of the implant-abutment system (32). However, so far there are no published clinical trials using internal type zirconia implant abutments, so no comparison could be made of the long-term stability of both systems using zirconia abutments.


# Zirconia single crowns

Single crowns have a small representation in published clinical trials on Y-TZP. In a 2-year randomized control trial, 1 of 15 Cercon zirconia crowns $^{\S}$  fractured in half only 1 month after cementation on a maxillary second molar (21), so that the success rate for this study was  $93\%$  after 2-years. There was no significant difference in soft tissue health adjacent to the Cercon crowns and the control crowns made with In-Ceram zirconia (Vita). No chipping of the veneering porcelain was reported after 2 years. In the mean time, no framework fracture have been reported after 3 years in a study with 204 single crowns fabricated with Procera zirconia $^{\dagger}$  in a private practice setting (30). However,  $16\%$  of the crowns had some type of complication, and  $6\%$  were recorded as a failure. Loss

Although zirconia single crowns appear to demonstrate good short-term success rates of  $93\%$  after 2 years and a survival rate of  $93\%$  after 3 years, these must be viewed with caution as they reflect data from a study with a small sample size of 15, and the other study reported data from a private practice setting that was mainly based on patients records rather than clinical evaluation.

# Zirconia-fixed partial dentures

The most investigated treatment modality are the zirconia-fixed partial dentures, with 13 different clinical trials reporting data on FPD spans ranging from 3 to 10-units. Except for one study, all FPDs used natural teeth as abutments; the exception used titanium implant abutments. Zirconia PFDs demonstrated favourable results, exhibiting a high success rate in most studies. A relatively small number of framework fractures have been reported in the clinical trials and do not appear to have occurred spontaneously, but rather an initiating factor was determined to have contributed to the fractured framework. The longest FPD spanned 10-units (5 pontics on 5 abutments) with the framework made with DC-Zirkon and the veneering porcelain was Vita D (29). This study also included two cantilever posterior FPDs. No framework fractures were reported after 3 years of follow-up; however, chipping of the veneering porcelain was reported in 4 posterior FPDs of the 65 FPDs placed in the anterior and posterior regions.

# Zirconia framework fracture

Fracture of Y-TZP substructures mostly occurred in FPDs, nevertheless this was found to be rare, and was only reported in five studies on two zirconia brands (Table 2). The incidence of framework fracture was directly related to the design of the FPD, where inlay-retained FPDs (IRFPD) showed the highest failure rate of  $10\%$  after only 12 months. These IRFPDs were made with IPS e.max ZirCAD $^{\ddagger}$ , where debonding of the inlay pontic has been concluded to be the cause of the framework fractures. In the review, Cercon zirconia suffered the majority of frameworks fractures compared to the other investigated zirconia brands; however, it must be kept in mind that it is also the most investigated brand (5 of 18 trials), followed by Lava* (3 of 18 trials). Both IPS e.max ZirCAD and Cercon zirconia are a non-HIPed zirconia manufactured by the soft-milling process.

# Veneering porcelain fracture

The most common complication observed in zirconia-based restorations was fracture of the veneering porcelain, manifesting clinically as chipping fractures of the veneering ceramic with or without exposing the underlying Y-TZP framework. All eight of the investigated zirconia brands exhibited chipping fractures, even when using specifically manufactured veneering porcelains with modified coefficients of thermal expansions compatible with zirconia  $(>11\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{K}^{-1})$  (10, 25). These chipping fractures were found to occur in non-load-bearing areas, such as the mesio-lingual cusps on a mandibular second molars (23), and the lingual aspect of FPD pontics (10). Possible trends in the location of the chipping have been identified by some authors and included the premolar and molar regions

(30), particularly the second molars on FPDs (25) and the connector area in mandibular posterior FPDs (29).

Denzir zirconia\*\* frameworks veneered with Esprident Triceram, $\S\S$  demonstrated the highest incidence of veneering porcelain fracture at 1 year of  $54\%$  when FPDs were using titanium implant abutments (20). In addition, there was a  $36\%$  incidence of roughness/pitting on occlusal surfaces of 3-unit FPDs on natural teeth after 5 years with Denzir zirconia frameworks veneered with either a feldspathic porcelain Vita Veneering Ceramic D (Vita) or leucite reinforced pressed ceramic IPS Empress $\ddagger$  (9).

# Cementation and bonding

Because of its high flexural strength, zirconia can be conventionally cemented, just like metal-ceramic restorations, without the need for any pretreatment; although bonding of zirconia is possible provided special conditioning, treatment of the zirconia is carried out first because zirconia is not etchable. Indeed, cementation of zirconia all-ceramic restorations is a simpler process compared to other all-ceramic systems which require added steps for bonding. This was evident in the range of cements used by the various authors in the published clinical trials; zinc phosphate cement (4, 9, 20, 24, 29, 30), glass-ionomer cements (GIC) (21-23, 26), resin-modified GIC (12, 25) and resin cements (9-13, 27-30).

Loss of retention was seen in 7 of 16 studies involving the cementation of zirconia restorations. One 3-unit FPD cemented with Panavia F lost retention after 12 months (9), a 4-unit FPD cemented with Variolink lost retention after 33-3 months in service (10), while two 3-unit FPDs in the molar region cemented with zinc phosphate lost retention at 17 and 32 months (29). Ketac Cem* glass-ionomer cement had one posterior 3-unit FPD decemented after 38 months (22), in addition to two long-span FPDs at 8-8 and 14-2 months in service (23). All debonded zirconia restorations were recemented successfully for the duration of the follow-up period in each of the studies.

In contrast, six cases of debonded inlay-retained zirconia FPDs were seen with Panavia F (dual-cured resin cement) and Multilink (automix self-curing resin cement), despite the pretreatment of the zirconia with tribiochemical air abrasion (Rocatec*). Fracture of the framework occurred in three of the six debonded restorations (28). Similarly, in a study on single Procera zirconia crowns, 12 of 204 crowns lost retention of which 4 could not be recemented (30). Unfortunately, the type of cement used for the crowns which lost retention was not reported, as both zinc phosphate and resin cement (Rely-X Unicem*) where used.


Despite the encouraging retentive capacity of zinc phosphate-cemented zirconia restorations, after 5-years follow-up of 3-unit FPDs that were cemented with either resin cement (Panavia F) or zinc phosphate (De Trey Zinc), visible evidence of ditching along the margins was only seen in the zinc phosphate-cemented group. Ditching was reported in  $5\%$  of mesial abutments and  $26\%$  in distal abutments in this study, however, this problem was not reported in the other trials using zinc phosphate cement.

# Discussion

With the limited number of published clinical trials, one can conclude that Y-TZP has the potential for being accepted as a suitable material for fixed prosthodontic dental treatment; however, larger sample sizes and longer in vivo studies are needed. The majority of published studies are prospective clinical trials, with the longest follow-up period being 5 years. In addition, only three randomized control trials exist, with 1 to 3-year follow-up periods. Long-span multi-unit FPDs have also been included in a number of studies demonstrating confidence in the structural potential of zirconia frameworks (4, 10, 12, 20, 23, 29).

Certainly, the published clinical trials demonstrate a careful and meticulous approach in their treatments, with steps taken to insure that the zirconia frameworks are delivered at their best possible condition before final cementation. Furthermore, it was interesting to note that all 17 studies included bruxism in their exclusion criteria, and therefore this should alert a potential limitation of this all-ceramic system that is not being investigated clinically.

# Zirconia framework fracture

The probability of fracture of zirconia FPDs has been estimated to be almost  $0\%$  after a simulated 10-year clinical service study (33), however, framework fracture has been reported in several in vivo trials of less than

5-years (10, 21-23, 28). Four of 5 studies involving Cercon zirconia reported framework fractures both in single crowns and FPDs. In an in vitro trial, it was reported that a force of 379 to  $501\mathrm{MPa}$  was needed to load Cercon zirconia 4-unit FPDs to failure which is higher than the average human bite, confirming its suitability as a substructure framework for FPDs (34). Cercon zirconia is a non-HIPed Y-TZP, and it is too early to say whether it is a weaker brand of zirconia compared to others because of the limited number of trials published so far, and keeping in mind that Cercon zirconia has been the most clinically investigated brand of Y-TZP so far.

A 5-unit Cercon zirconia maxillary FPD fractured at the connector between two pontics at the first and second premolars after 38 months in service (10). The dimension of the fractured connector was  $19\cdot 28\mathrm{mm}^2$  well above the recommended connector area of  $9 - 16\mathrm{mm}^2$  by Raigrodski (2004) (35). Accidental biting on a stone was reported to be the primary reason for failure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the primary crack initiation site on a Cercon zirconia FPD that failed 29 days after insertion to be from the gingival aspect of the connector that was around  $10\cdot 5\mathrm{mm}^2$  in surface area (23). It was claimed by the authors to be because of inappropriate alteration performed by a dental technician during the veneering of the FPD. This confirms reports that the most susceptible part of fracture in all-ceramic FPDs is the connector area (36, 37). In fact, fractographic analyses of five failed 4-unit Cercon zirconia FPDs confirmed all the connector failures were initiated from the gingival surface; where tensile stresses were the greatest (34). In contrast, lithium disilicate-based FPDs were found to fracture from the occlusal surface of the failing connector (38).

As for single crowns, one Cercon zirconia crown restoring a non-vital maxillary second molar fractured in half after 1 month in service (21). This tooth did not have a post, and although bruxism was part of their exclusion criteria, the patient reportedly had nocturnal bruxism, for which he had been undertaking muscle-relaxation splint therapy.

Despite the promising results reported in vitro (39), IRFPDs made with IPS e.max ZirCAD $\ddagger$  also a non-HIPed Y-TZP, demonstrated the highest incidence of fractured frameworks in just 1-year, with a survival rate of  $57\%$  (28). These FPDs had inlays, partial and full-crowns as retainers with at least one retainer being an inlay. Debonding of  $20\%$  of the retainers resulted in a  $10\%$  framework fracture primarily when one retainer debonded, which subsequently overloaded the connectors to failure. Bonding procedures in the study used the generally recommended bonding method for Y-TZP, namely using tribochemical silica-coating air abrasion (Rocatec*) pretreatment of the inner surface of the copings, followed by silanization and cementation using phosphate monomer resin cements, Panavia  $\mathbf{F}^{\dagger\dagger}$  and Multilink Automix $^{\ddagger}$ . Debonding was explained by the reduced area of adhesion, either because of the small surface area of the inlay retainers or because of voids in the resin cement. No other in vivo study investigated the longevity of inlay-retained FPDs, and furthermore, it is the only in vivo study conducted on IPS e.max ZirCAD. The physical properties of IPS e.max ZirCAD are no lower than the average Y-TZP (40), hence the high failure rate seen could only be explained by the design of the inlay-retained framework. Wolfart & Kern reported two case studies on IRFPDs. These IRFPDs had modified wrap-around wing retainers resembling metal winged resin-bonded retainers to increase the bonding surface area that also had full thickness zirconia that omitted any veneering ceramic for maximum strength (41). Nevertheless, in contrast to other treatment modalities, Y-TZP IRFPDs cannot yet be recommended and should not be clinically prescribed until improvements in bonding of zirconia is achieved and further long-term clinical trials are published.


An in vitro study of five framework-designed cantilever zirconia FPDs made of Lava* showed poor fracture resistance, where most fractures occurred at the distal wall of the terminal abutment (42). As a consequence, cantilever FPDs made of zirconia were not recommended by the authors; nevertheless, a 3-unit and a 4-unit cantilever Y-TZP FPDs survived 3 years in function in the posterior region of the mouth (29). These cantilever FPDs were made from DC-Zirkon® HIPed densely sintered blanks and cemented with zinc phosphate cement. Further larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are necessary before zirconia cantilever FPDs can be recommended.

# Chipping of veneering porcelain

Zirconia has a white opaque colour, which needs masking by veneering it with a more translucent, and aesthetic porcelain to achieve an acceptable aesthetic result, as with porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations (PFM). The most striking finding which has been reported in the literature is the high incidence of cohesive failure of the veneering porcelain, manifesting clinically as chipping of the veneering ceramic with or without exposing the underlying Y-TZP framework. The incidence of chipping fractures ranged from  $0\%$  in two studies, both on Cercon zirconia at 2 years (21) and 3 years(22), to as high as  $54\%$  in just 1 year (20). No brand of Y-TZP has escaped this problem, and it has been reported in all seven brands of zirconia investigated for crowns and bridges as follows: Cercon [15% in 5 years (10), 3% in 2 years (23), 3% in 1-5 years (24)]; Lava [25% in 2-5 years (25), 3% in 1 year (27) and 3% in 2 years (26)]; IPS e.max ZirCAD [13% in 1 year (28)]; Procera [2% in 3 years (30)]; DC-Zirkon [6% in 3 years(29), 15% in 2 years (4)]; Denzir [36% in 5 years (9), 54% in 1 year (20)] and Digizon [9-5% in 3 years (12)]. In some occasions, they occur at nonload-bearing areas, and no set pattern has been identified so far, although the second molars have been reported to have a higher incidence than the rest of the dentition because of higher forces found at the posterior of the mouth (25, 29).


It is important to appreciate that a large number of chip fractures reported were undetected by the patients and were an incidental finding during review appointments (4, 20, 27), and some patients were satisfied with simply polishing the rough margins (23, 27), or repairing the fracture with composite resin (12), while in some cases, the patients chose not to have them polished at all (25). Nevertheless, some restorations did require total replacement because of major chipping fractures which could not be polished or because they posed aesthetic concerns (10, 30).

Chipping fractures can be a disappointment to both the clinician and patient, and it has been noted in the literature as a serious problem (43), instigating a large number of studies investigating this phenomenon in an attempt to solve it. Numerous reasons have been suggested, such as mismatch of the CTE between the veneering porcelain and the zirconia substructure (44), mechanically defective micro-structural regions in the porcelain, areas of porosities (28), surface defects or improper support by the framework (43), overloading and fatigue (45), low fracture toughness of the veneering porcelain (46) and finally the low thermal conductivity of zirconia (47). Delamination, as opposed to chip fractures, has also been proposed as a cause of failure. Delamination is the adhesive failure between the veneering ceramic and zirconia, manifesting clinically as the complete loss of porcelain partially exposing the substructure, although Ohlmann et al. (2008) argued that delamination can only be confirmed after microscopic examination, which is impossible if the restoration remains in situ, and therefore it is quite possible that many fractures that have been classified as delamination may in fact be chipping fractures. This speculation is supported by the evidence that the bond strength between zirconia and a large number of veneering porcelains with varying CTEs was higher than the cohesive strength of the porcelain itself (44, 48, 49). Consequently, it has been concluded that the veneering porcelain is the weakest link, and improving its strength could reduce the incidence of veneering porcelain chipping (44, 50). This was attempted by using high-strength heat-pressed ceramics which have shown to have better bond strengths to zirconia frameworks compared to traditional layering ceramics and have been receiving support in the literature (51). Aboushelib et al.(52) described a "double veneering" technique which combines the high bond strength of heat-pressed ceramics with the superior aesthetics of layered porcelain in an effort to improve the overall strength and aesthetics of the veneering porcelain. Unfortunately, chipping fractures have also been reported in pressed porcelain in clinical trials on zirconia FPDs and do not appear to have solved this chipping problem (9, 28).


Swain (2009) (47) proposed that tempering residual stress was the basis for the preponderance of chipping of porcelain bonded to zirconia. He concluded that there are three factors which contribute these residual stresses and the unstable chipping fractures in zirconia: mismatch of the higher thermal expansion coefficient of porcelains bonded to zirconia; thickness of the veneering porcelain and cooling rate. The cooling rate after the removal of the sintered restoration from the furnace, while the restoration is still at elevated temperatures, generates significant thermal gradients within the porcelain and is directly related to the low thermal conductivity of zirconia, which is much lower than that of metal-alloys and even alumina ceramic, which has not experienced similar incidences of chipping fractures. He suggests that by more slowly cooling the restoration above the glass transition temperature of the porcelain, it is possible to prevent the development of high tensile subsurface residual stresses in the porcelain which may result in unstable cracking or chipping. This approach of a reduced cooling rate after the final firing or glazing procedure is now recommended by most dental material producers.


Improper design of the zirconia framework has also been suggested to be a contributing factor in chipping fractures, because of the inadequate support provided by the thin zirconia copings commonly milled. Recently, an improved customised zirconia-coping design has been recommended by bulking out the substructure to provide adequate support to the veneering porcelain. This was demonstrated in a case report by Marchack and colleagues (43), where the design of their zirconia crowns was taken from the conventional PFM technique of a full contour wax-up which was then cut back to allow for the veneering porcelain. An aesthetic drawback would be the visible opaque white zirconia along the palatal or lingual surfaces; however, the authors argue that patient acceptance is high as soon as they are given the choice between the appearance of a metal margin or a white ceramic. Tinschert et al. (29) adopted this modified framework design in their FPDs, however, chipping fractures still occurred in 4 of 65 FPDs in their clinical trial spanning 3 years. Alteration of the zirconia crystalline structures during sandblasting prior to the veneering process was suggested by the authors to be a possible reason why they had chipping fractures, however, if that was the case, then complete delamination of the porcelain would be expected rather than chipping fracture of the superficial porcelain.

A novel approach in veneering zirconia copings has been described by Beuer and colleagues (46) by sintering a CAD/CAM-milled lithium disilicate veneer cap onto the zirconia coping significantly increasing the mechanical strength of the restoration. Other than improved strength, they claimed this method to be a cost-effective way of fabricating all-ceramic restorations. To date, there are no clinical trials that have adopted this method, and further in vitro studies are needed before they can be clinically trialed.

# Low-temperature degradation

Catastrophic failure of zirconia restorations has been a major concern because of the inherent spontaneous ageing problem of zirconia in the presence of water. Low-temperature degradation (LTD) was first described by Kobayashi in 1981 (53), where in a humid environment, spontaneous slow transformation from the tetragonal phase to the more stable monoclinic phase occurred in zirconia grains at relatively low tempera tures of  $150 - 400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This ageing process initiates at surface grains and then later progresses towards the bulk material causing a reduction in flexural strength of the material, putting it at risk of spontaneous catastrophic failure. How great a problem this ageing process is going to be for zirconia restorations is currently unknown. The vulnerability of zirconia to ageing is exacerbated by the fact that its severity has been shown to differ between different zirconias from different manufacturers, and even in zirconia from the same manufacturer but which have been processed differently (54). This may be reflected clinically, for example, in the fractured zirconia frameworks reported with Cercon zirconia, suggesting a possible weakness of this brand compared to others, however, before this can be confirmed, further studies with larger sample sizes and following a longer review period must be completed; especially that each case of framework fracture was caused by an initiating factor, such as accidentally biting a stone, improper laboratory technique, insufficient thickness of the zirconia coping and poor design, which if avoided, a longer restoration life-time may have been expected.


# HIPed vs. non-Hiped zirconia

The type of blanks with which the zirconia restorations are milled from have been suggested to have a direct affect on the final outcome of the restoration. Supporters of soft-milling using the non-HIPed zirconia claim that hard-milling of HIPed zirconia could introduce microcracks to the framework during the milling process, reducing its overall physical strength and longevity of the prosthesis (16). This was not evident in the published clinical trials; in contrast, zirconia catastrophic fractures have only been reported in non-HIPed zirconia and not in HIPed zirconia. On the other hand, HIPed zirconia supporters claim superior marginal fit because no shrinkage is involved in the manufacturing process, and precise margins are not possible with non-HIPed zirconia, giving rise to recurrent caries, periodontal conditions and unaesthetic margins. Sailer et al. (2007) reported the highest incidence of secondary caries  $(22\%)$  in a non-HIPed zirconiaFPDs after a 5-year follow-up, suggested to be because of using a prototype soft-milling method which has since been improved. Notably, no other study reported a high incidence of caries, even when using non-HIPed zirconia. Reich and colleagues (55) examined the clinical fit of 4-unit posterior FPDs made by non-HIPed zirconia and found a median marginal gap of  $77~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  in 24 FPDs, well within the clinically acceptable marginal gap limit of  $100 - 120~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  (56). Further, in vivo studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to establish any significant differences between HIPed and non-HIPed zirconia restorations; and although more dental zirconia manufacturers supply non-HIPed Y-TZP, so far clinical results are in favour of HIPed zirconia because of the absence of any framework failures in the short-term.


# The future of zirconia

Case reports of large multi-unit tooth and implant FPDs suggest that the dental community may have some confidence in zirconia as a restorative material, with some authors restoring full mouth rehabilitations using zirconia abutments and frameworks despite limited scientific evidence (57-59).

The issue of porcelain chipping appears to be germane to zirconia frameworks despite their intrinsic superior mechanical properties and that porcelain mechanical properties are almost framework independent. Despite this apparent anomaly methods of strengthening the veneering porcelain are being developed to control the unstable chipping fractures. These include novel concepts that are being reported in the literature, such as the high-strength CAD/CAM-fabrication of the veneering porcelain (46) and the "double veneering" technique (52). Other approaches include bulking out the zirconia framework and omitting veneering porcelain at non-aesthetic areas such as the lingual and palatal aspects of the restoration.

At this time, investigations appear to have been directed towards zirconia materials with stabilisers other than yttria which are less prone to LTD, such as magnesia partially stabilized zirconia (Mg-PSZ) (60) and ceria-stabilized zirconia/alumina nanocomposites (Ce-TZP/A) (61). These non-yttria-stabilized zirconia materials may be less susceptible to LTD and spontaneous phase transformation, however, their fracture toughness and flexural strengths are not as high as Y-TZP and so they may not be suitable for medium to long-span FPDs. Therefore, long-term in vivo studies must be carefully evaluated before non-yttria-stabilized zirconia materials could be recommended.

# Conclusion

1 Based on the limited short-term studies available, zirconia can be said to be suitable for the fabrication of all-ceramic posterior single crowns, long-span FPDs and implant abutments.  
2 Inlay-retained FPDs cannot be recommended in light of published in vivo trials.  
3 Chipping of the veneering porcelain is confirmed to be an ongoing problem with zirconia all-ceramic-based restorations.  
4 Zirconia framework fractures have only been reported in soft-milled non-HIPed zirconia, with a possible advantage being seen in hard-milling HIPed zirconia.  
5 Zirconia-based all-ceramic restorations can be cemented with conventional luting cements, however, bonding to tooth structure is also possible but with limited success.
