# Abstract

Background: Preformed metal crowns (PMCs) have been the restoration of choice for paediatric dentistry; however, PMCs have a non-aesthetic appearance, which has become a point of concern. Recently, prefabricated zirconia crowns (PZCs) have been increasingly used as an aesthetic restorative material for primary teeth, as they have pleasing properties.

Aim: This systematic review summarises the clinical results for PZCs in the primary dentition, including wear on the opposing dentition, retention, fracture resistance, parental satisfaction, gingival health, and cementation materials.

Materials and Methods: Electronic database searches were conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports/series were included. The quality of the studies was analysed using the Cochrane tool and the domain-based evaluation for non-randomised studies of interventions.

Results: The search retrieved 166 references, of which 14 studies were included for qualitative analyses. The risk of bias varied from low to unclear. The included studies indicated that prefabricated zirconia crowns are retentive and are not associated with accelerated wear on the opposing dentition. They also exhibit a high fracture resistance, satisfy the parents and are compatible with gingival health. There is, however, inconclusive evidence with regard to cementation materials.

Conclusion: Prefabricated Zirconia Crowns appear to be a good alternative to preformed metal crowns in term of esthetics, retention, resistance to fracture, parent satisfaction, and gingival health.

# WHY THIS PAPER IS IMPORTANT TO PAEDIATRIC DENTISTS

This paper provides paediatric dentists with insight on the use of PZCs for children with primary dentition as it clarified important findings related to the wear on the opposing dentition, retention, fracture resistance, parental satisfaction, gingival health, and cementation materials.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Aesthetic dentistry is currently an essential component of dental practice. Although there is a significant body of literature available for adults, little is known about aesthetic dentistry for children. $^{1,2}$  Advancements in dental restorative techniques have occurred over the past decade and continued today, thus necessitating the continual reassessments of treatment philosophies and strategies. Aesthetic management of decayed, damaged, or traumatised primary anterior tooth in children, which often requires full-coverage restorations, is challenging. This is especially due to the following factors: small tooth size; proximity of the pulp to the tooth surface; comparatively thin enamel; weakened surface area for bonding; and difficulties with behaviour management, particularly in very young children. $^{3}$

For several decades, preformed metal crowns (PMCs) have been the restoration of choice for most paediatric dentists to restore severely decayed primary teeth. Indeed, PMCs have been one of the most effective restorations since Humphrey first described their use in paediatric patients in 1950. $^{4}$  PMCs are easy to place and affordable, and have a very high success rate for protecting damaged primary teeth. $^{5,6}$  A disadvantage of PMCs, however, is their non-aesthetic appearance, $^{7}$  which has become a concern in paediatric dentistry. A previous survey conducted in 2009 indicated that the aesthetics of restorative materials are a primary concern among the parents of paediatric patients. $^{8}$  Since then, a number of substitutes for PMCs have been developed, including open-faced PMCs, bonded strip crowns, and pre-veneered PMCs. $^{9}$  Although these new types of restorations have superior aesthetics, they are also associated with the following consequences: poor gingival health, gingival bleeding, and exposure of restorative margins. $^{6}$  Furthermore, the veneer resin of pre-veneered PMCs frequently chips; this results in increased costs, as additional treatment procedures are required for repair or replacement. $^{10}$

Recently, all-ceramic crowns have been developed and used in adults with high success rates. $^{11}$  Currently, prefabricated zirconia crowns (PZCs) are used as an aesthetic restorative material for primary teeth. Zirconia, also known as 'ceramic steel', is a crystalline dioxide of zirconium. Zirconia crowns (ZCs) not only look more translucent, but also are almost three times stronger than the porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns because they are milled from a single densely sintered block of crystals. $^{12}$  Although there is a lack of long-term clinical research on prefabricated full-coverage zirconia restorations, custom-made ZCs have been shown to have reasonable aesthetics and excellent mechanical properties for the restoration of permanent teeth. Thus, custom-made ZCs have been used for crowns, fixed partial dentures, implant abutments, fixtures, inlays, and onlays. $^{13}$  ZCs, however, cannot be flexed, crimped, or contoured. Therefore, manufacturers recommend passive seating. Furthermore, due to the thickness of ZCs, more aggressive tooth preparation is required, during which the chance of pulp exposure is increased in the primary dentition.


Considering the importance of aesthetic crowns for the treatment of primary teeth, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of published papers on PZCs for primary teeth, including its effectiveness in clinical performance, to answer the following question: Do PZCs used for children with primary dentition affect the wear of the opposing dentition, retention of the crown, fracture resistance, parental satisfaction, gingival health, and cementation compared with PMCs?

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (reference CRD42020193187). The PICOS method (Participants, Interventions, Comparison, Outcome, and Study) was used to formulate our research query: the participants consisted of children with primary dentition; the intervention was the PZC; the comparison was the PMC; the outcomes comprised evaluation of wear of the opposing dentition, crown retention, fracture resistance, parental satisfaction, gingival health, and cementation; and the study design was a systematic review.

# 2.1 Research protocol

The literature search commenced in April 2020 and included the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. The following key search terms were used for all databases: 'zirconia crowns for primary dentition', 'zirconia crowns for children', 'prefabricated zirconia crowns for primary teeth', and 'paediatric dentistry zirconia crowns'.

# 2.2 | Eligibility criteria

Published manuscripts from observational studies, clinical trials, and case reports/case series that aimed to assess the success of PZCs in anterior or posterior primary teeth were eligible, provided that they evaluated wear on the opposing dentition, retention of crowns, fracture resistance, parental satisfaction, gingival health, or cementation materials for PZCs. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were considered for inclusion if they compared PZCs and PMCs (in terms of clinical success as a full-coverage restoration for primary dentitions); this was considered the gold standard for comparison. When PMCs were not available as a control group, RCTs comparing ZCs with pre-veneered PMCs were considered for inclusion, provided that the pre-veneered PMCs had a similar basis as PMCs.[15] Case reports/case series that provided follow-up assessments for PZCs for more than 6 months were included. The age range for patient inclusion was 2 to 11 years; the follow-up time ranged from 6 to 37 months. Only articles published in English were included.


Studies were excluded if they: were in vitro studies; were not related to the use of PZCs in primary teeth; had a follow-up time of less than 6 months; or were unpublished studies or book chapters that did not undergo peer review.

# 2.3 Literature search, selection of studies, and data extraction

No restrictions were imposed on the year of publication, as PZCs only became available for use in primary dentition in 2010. Electronic searches were conducted from the earliest available date until July 2020 in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library.

The selection of articles was completed in two steps. The first step included searching the database for relevant items in titles and abstracts. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria in step 1 were excluded. If the abstract did not have sufficient information to determine inclusion or exclusion, the full article was assessed. The reference lists from the included and excluded studies were also screened in an attempt to identify additional studies. The second step included determining the relevance of the studies included from step 1 by reading the full articles. Two authors of the current study undertook such activities independently. A third author was consulted in cases of disagreement to determine whether an article should be included in this review.

The following data were extracted: author names; year of publication; the country where the study was performed; the number of teeth included and final sample size; the age of participants (years); PZC brand used; whether pulp therapy was performed; type of cement used; period of follow-up (months); statistical analyses performed; and study outcome(s), including an attestation of whether PZCs were the best available full-coverage restorative material.

# 2.4 Risk of bias in individual studies

Each RCT was assessed for risk of bias according to the second version of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.[16] This tool is based on six domains: bias due to the generation of sequence allocation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, complete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting; assessment of the overall risk of bias considers the importance of the different domains.


Observational studies were assessed following the domain-based evaluation described in the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). This tool is based on seven domains: bias due to confounding, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviations from intended interventions, missing data, measurement of outcomes, and selection of the reported result.

Using both risk-of-bias assessment tools, studies were classified as follows: 'low risk of bias' (plausible bias unlikely to alter the results seriously) if all criteria were met; 'unclear risk of bias' (a plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one or more criteria were assessed as unclear; or 'high risk of bias' (a plausible bias that severely weakens confidence in the results) if one or more criteria were not met. Two authors independently evaluated the risk of bias in all of the included articles. In the event of disagreement between the two authors, the third author was consulted.

# 2.5 Ongoing trials

The study identified seven ongoing RCTs for PZCs: NCT03889535, NCT03296709, NCT03067337, NCT03296709, NCT04073901, NCT03740308, and CTRL/2019/07/020237. At the time of writing this review, none of these studies had been completed.

# 3 RESULTS

# 3.1 Study selection

A total of 166 studies were identified from the initial database searches. After the removal of 44 duplicates, 122 titles and abstracts were screened. Of these, 104 were excluded because they were in vitro studies or did not relate to the use of PZCs for primary dentitions, leaving 18 references for critical assessment. Of the 18 articles, four were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Of the 14 studies included in the final qualitative analysis, seven were on anterior teeth and six were on posterior teeth; a single case report pertained to both anterior and posterior primary teeth. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the systematic review.

# 3.2 | Characteristics of the studies

The included studies were performed in the USA, $^{18-20}$  UAE, $^{21,22}$  Turkey, $^{23,24}$  India, $^{3,25}$  Korea, $^{26}$  France, $^{27}$  Egypt, $^{28,29}$  and Canada. $^{30}$  The language of all publications
FIGURE 1 Flow diagram of the systematic review was English. All articles were published between 2013 and 2020. The age range of participants in the included studies was 2 to 8 years, and the follow-up time ranged from 6 to 37 months. Of the 14 included studies, six were RCTs, three were observational studies, and five were case reports/case series. In the Carla Cohn case report, two cases were presented, but this review only included the second case in which the patient was followed up for 24 months; the other case was excluded because it lacked a sufficient follow-up time.[30] An overview of the main characteristics retrieved from the 14 studies is presented in Table 1 (RCT studies), Table 2 (observational studies), and Table 3 (case reports/case series).


# 3.3 Outcome measures

Wear on the opposing primary teeth was measured in four of the studies in a clinical setting. Retention of ZCs was measured in 14 studies through the survival and durability of the crowns, until the end of the study follow-up period. Crowns were considered retentive if they did not fall off or became dislodged. Fracture resistance was measured in five studies, in which either the presence or lack of evidence of a fracture was reported. Parental satisfaction was measured in three studies via satisfaction surveys completed by a patient's parent. The survey scoring scales ranged from the Likert scale, the level of satisfaction or satisfaction with the crown appearance compared with PMCs. Gingival health was measured in seven studies using the same scale. Gingival health was scored according to the Loe gingival index. Cementation materials were reported in 12 studies; outcomes included the type of cement used, the duration of follow-up (in months), and whether the PZCs were debonded or retained.


# 3.4 Risk-of-bias assessment

Details of the assessments for determining the risk of bias for the clinical trials and observational studies are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. For clinical trials, four studies used random sequence generation and allocation concealment $^{18,21,22,28}$ ; however, the risk of bias in random sequence generation was unclear, and allocation concealment was high in the two other studies. $^{23,25}$  Information on the blinding of participants and personnel was detailed in two studies, $^{18,21}$  whereas the risk of bias was high in the other four studies. $^{22,23,25,28}$  Outcome assessment was mentioned in three studies, $^{18,22,28}$  unclear in two studies, $^{21,25}$  and high in one study. $^{23}$  All studies reported their methods of sample collection and outcome data, without any significant attrition or a lack of reporting that could have biased the studies.

In terms of the observational studies,[19,20,29] the items pertaining to bias due to confounding, deviation from the intended intervention, and selection of the reported results were scored as having a low risk of bias in all three studies. Low risk of bias was also identified for the selection of participants and the classification of intervention items in two studies,[20,29] whereas it was high in one study.[19] The risk of bias due to missing data was high in one study,[19] unclear in the second study,[29] and low in the third study.[20] Measurement outcomes were mentioned in two studies,[19,20] and the risk of bias due to measurement outcome was high in one study.[29]

After performing the current systematic review, relevant clinical information from the articles was condensed. The main findings are described below.

# 3.5 Wear evaluation of opposing teeth

Three clinical studies evaluated the wear on teeth opposing the PZCs. Eleven per cent of the total number of PZCs in three studies exhibited wear on the opposing dentition, whereas only  $3\%$  of cases noted wear on the teeth opposing PMCs.[18,19,21] A 29-month follow-up period for one tooth restored using a PZC exhibited the same natural wear pattern on the opposing tooth compared with the contralateral side that had no opposing restoration. Moreover, no unusual or accelerated attrition on the tooth opposing the PZC was observed.[27] Details of the wear on teeth opposing PZCs are presented in Table 4.

# 3.6 Retention of PZCs

Fourteen studies evaluated the retention of PZCs; these included five RCTs, four observational studies, and five case reports/case series. A total of 427 PZCs were evaluated among all of the studies, with an  $89\%$  retention rate for follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 37 months. Only one study described a significantly low retention rate of  $50\%$ , and this was attributed to the type of cement used; however, it was noted that the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different types of luting cement on PZC retention.[28] The reasons reported for PZC failure  $(11\%)$  included pathology, loss of the entire crown, cementation issues, trauma, biting on hard objects, and unknown causes. Five case reports, with an average follow-up duration of 2 years, evaluated a total of 22 cases and reported a retention rate of  $100\%$ .[3,24,26,27,30] In all RCTs, both PZCs and PMCs had similarly high retention rates of  $99\%$  and  $100\%$ , respectively. A detailed description is shown in Table 5.

FIGURE 3 Quality of the included observational studies, based on the ROBINS-I quality assessment scale

# 3.7 Fracture resistance of ZCs

Five clinical studies evaluated the fracture resistance of PZCs; these included three RCTs and two observational studies. Only one PZC was reported to have more than  $50\%$  of the crown surface fractured.[23] None of the PMC crowns were fractured in the study, whereas three pre-veneered crowns were reported to have small, but noticeable, areas of material loss.[21] Table 6 provides the details of the fracture resistance studies.

# 3.8 | Parental satisfaction

Three studies investigated the parental satisfaction of PZCs; all reported a high satisfaction rate. Two of the studies were RCTs and revealed higher levels of satisfaction compared with PMCs.[18,19,22] The details of the parental satisfaction results by different study types are shown in Table 7.

# 3.9 | Gingival health

Seven studies investigated gingival health around PZCs, including two observational studies, four RCTs, and one case report. Among the four RCTs, three compared the gingiva around PZCs with that around PMCs, $^{18,23,25}$  whereas the remaining study compared the gingiva around PZCs with that around pre-veneered PMCs.[21] None of the studies observed significant gingival inflammation around PZCs. Gingival index scores were significantly lower around PZCs compared with PMCs or pre-veneered PMCs  $(P < .001)$ . In the Donly et al study, gingival health adjacent to PZCs appeared to be superior at 6 months compared with PMCs; however, after 2 years, the gingiva appeared similar around both crowns. Neither of the observational studies observed a marked increase in gingival inflammation.[19,28] In the report by Lopez Cazaux et al, in which PZCs were followed up to 29 months, the gingiva healed after 3 days. A long-term follow-up at 24 months also indicated good health of the periodontal tissues.[27] Table 8 provides a detailed description of gingival health outcomes.


# 3.10 | Cementation materials

This review included 12 studies that reported the type of cement used for PZCs, as well as their related failures. Five of these studies were case reports/case series. Of a total of 354 PZCs evaluated in 12 studies, 34 failed due to cementation issues. The majority of studies in this review (seven studies) used glass-ionomer cement (GIC) as the luting cement and reported a success rate of  $82\%$  to  $100\%$ .[3,19,21,23,24,27-29] Two case reports used resin cement and reported a success rate of  $100\%$ .[3,26] One Study by Donly et al used a bioceramic cement and reported a success rate of  $100\%$ .[18] Seminario

Using bioactive cement, 15 of 19 PZCs were debonded, whereas 3 of 17 crowns were debonded in the GIC group.[28] BioCem was also used exclusively in one case report by Cohn, who reported a success rate of  $100\%$ .[30] Table 9 provides a detailed description of the different types of cement evaluated in this review.

# 4 | DISCUSSION

Due to significant disadvantages with the appearance of PMCs, many papers have commented on the increasing demand for aesthetic restorative solutions for primary teeth.[31-35]

PZCs were introduced in 2010 by Spring (formerly EZPedo). Currently available RCTs, observational studies, and case reports/case series suggest that PZCs are an acceptable restorative material in primary dentition. Different manufacturers produce PZCs for children, all of which showed similar results. Despite the overall satisfaction regarding PZCs, sufficiently strong evidence is not available. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review for PZCs in primary dentition.

# 4.1 Wear on the opposing primary teeth

The wear on teeth opposing crowns is an essential issue. Prefabricated zirconia crowns and PMCs are capable of abrading opposing teeth upon attrition or mechanical wear.[18,36,37] Several studies have suggested that ceramic substrates produce more wear on the opposing tooth structure than does enamel[38,39]; however, no unusual or accelerated wear of the opposing dentition was observed in this review. Our observations agree with an in vivo study that found that PZCs exhibited comparable wear on enamel to that observed with metal-ceramic crowns and control enamel.[40] Although zirconia has a high hardness, wear strongly depends on the microstructure of the restorative material and the degree of surface finish.[36] For example, in a study by Janyavula et al that examined wear on enamel due to polished and glazed zirconia, polished zirconia demonstrated significantly less wear than glazed zirconia.[41] Furthermore, Chong et al found that clinically adjusted unpolished zirconia exhibited more wear on the opposing enamel than crowns replenished after clinical adjustment, thus demonstrating the importance of replenishing crowns after clinical adjustment.[42]

Theriot et al determined that none of the paediatric PZCs (Nusmile, Kinder Krowns, EZCrowns) had a surface

roughness below the threshold of  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}$  for bacterial retention. $^{43}$  Due to a lack of reporting, we were unable to address two aspects of wear in the present review: (a) adjustments to the polished PZC surfaces and (b) occlusion. As a major contributor to occlusion is the eruption of permanent first molars, the occlusion could be different in younger patients (under 6 years old) with primary teeth; this may explain the absence of wear on the opposing tooth. Thus, future studies that correlate attrition before and after the eruption of first permanent molars would add considerable value to understanding the wear of PZCs on the opposing teeth in children.

The RCTs, observational studies, and case reports evaluated in this review suggest there is little need for concern about the wear of the enamel on the teeth opposing PZCs. Prefabricated zirconia crowns produced by different manufacturers have shown minimal to no wear on the opposing dentition; however, this conclusion was based on a limited number of studies, and further studies are needed to support or refute this conclusion.

# 4.2 Retention of PZCs for primary teeth

Potential disadvantages of zirconia restorations include the inability to crimp the crown for mechanical retention, and the need for more tooth reduction than that for a traditional PMC. $^{44}$  The results of this study found that PZCs were retained with a high success rate; the failure rate was  $11\%$ , with the majority of failures due to apical pathology, trauma, or cementation issues. Therefore, the success of PZCs might be influenced more by the management of pulp therapy and the technique used to perform the restoration, rather than the mechanical properties or chemical retention of the crowns.


Differences in survival probabilities by age, type of tooth (anterior versus posterior), or decayed, missing, filled teeth (dmft) at baseline were not significant in any of the studies. One case report followed PZCs after luxation injuries; 2-month follow-up evaluations after trauma showed that PZCs could tolerate injuries and were able to heal with the surrounding periodontium.[45] Another important factor for the retention of PZCs is the crown preparation height. The in vitro study of Jing et al showed that a minimum of  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of tooth structure is needed for the retention of PZCs.[46]

# 4.3 | Resistance of PZCs to fracture in primary teeth

In this review, PZCs were found to be highly resistant to fracture. Manicone et al revealed that monolithic PZCs have

no upper facial structures, as they are composed of solid zirconia; this eliminates any chance of facial veneer fracture $^{47}$ ; however, of a total of 235 PZCs evaluated in a different study, a single PZC was found to be fractured, whereas no PMCs were fractured; the authors did not comment or discuss the reasons for the fracture, as it was a unique and unusual incidence. $^{23}$  Interestingly, the mean maximum bite force of children 3-12 years old ranged from  $78~\mathrm{N}$  to  $235.12~\mathrm{N}^{48,49}$ ; however, one in vitro study found that the mean force required to fracture the three PZCs brands far exceeded those values. $^{50}$

# 4.4 | Parental satisfaction

Parental satisfaction and the self-consciousness of children have become important factors when selecting restorative materials; hence, the use of aesthetically pleasing options should be strongly considered. This correlates with trends observed among dental providers of a shift from amalgams and PMCs to more natural-looking alternatives.[51] In this review, the aesthetics of the PZCs were evaluated by scoring methods that differed between studies; however, the result for parental satisfaction for PZCs is promising, as it showed a high rating or statistically significant difference when compared to PMCs. High parental satisfaction was noted, as most crowns had a natural cosmetic shape and only an imperceptible colour difference relative to the adjacent teeth. Although parents in two other studies identified some problems with the crowns,[19,22] their overall satisfaction with PZCs was very high. Therefore, parents seem to find such restorations highly acceptable.


# 4.5 | Gingival health

Gingival health has continued to be a point of discussion with the development of prefabricated paediatric PZCs. In this review, four controlled studies used the same gingival index to compare periodontal health indicators between primary teeth restored with PZCs and those restored with PMCs. These studies showed that teeth treated with ZCs had better gingival scores than those treated with preformed PMCs.[18,21,23,25]

Donly et al discussed that gingival health appeared to be better adjacent to PZCs at 6 months, compared with PMCs; however, after 2 years, the gingiva adjacent to either type of crown appeared similar.[18] The only study in this review that showed a higher percentage of inflammation adjacent to PZCs was a cross-sectional study by Holsinger et al,[19] where  $32\%$  of PZCs examined mild inflammation in the surrounding gingiva; however, that study did not have a control group, nor did they measure the plaque index. The authors also suggested that poor oral hygiene might have played a significant role in the inflammation recorded.

In a study by Mathew et al, PMCs exhibited significantly more microbial adhesion than PZCs at all time points.[25] The surface roughness created by trimming, crimping, and cutting of PMCs could be a significant factor in biofilm accumulation, which in turn perpetuates gingival inflammation. In contrast, PZCs were not adjusted, thereby protecting the surface finish and preventing microbial and plaque adhesion.[25]

This review has revealed the need for long-term studies examining the marginal integrity of the restoration and the remnants of the luting cement in the sulcus area. As these factors influence plaque accumulation and periodontal health, they may contribute to the small number of cases reporting mild inflammation around the PZCs. The evaluation of gingival health requires not only a gingival index, but also a plaque index to facilitate the differentiation of inflammation related to poor oral health from that due to the characteristics of the restoration.

# 4.6 Cementation materials

Prefabricated zirconia crowns are technique-sensitive and less moisture-tolerant during cementation. The retention of PZCs is dependent upon the bond strength of the luting cement between the tooth and the restoration. The bond strength is cement-dependent, and different manufacturers recommend different types of cement. Some manufacturers recommend a pure GIC or resin-modified GIC, whereas others recommend a bioactive or resin cement. Most of the studies in this review used a GIC and showed excellent success rates of  $93\%$ . Self-adhesive resin cements are recommended by some manufacturers as luting agents for PZCs. In this review, only two case reports used self-adhesive resin, with a  $100\%$  success rate.[3,26] The reason that self-adhesive resins are not commonly used could be because the cementation technique requires several steps and can be challenging to perform in younger children.[52] Azab et al showed that the type of luting cement for paediatric PZCs affects the restoration's debonding, where packable GIC was significantly more retentive than bioactive cement.[28] This finding was not consistent with two studies evaluated in this review,[20,30] which showed high success rates; however, one of these studies was a case report for only one crown that was followed for 29 months, whereas the other study used two different types of cement (BioCem and RelyX luting cement). Bioactive cement bonds to zirconia and tooth structures, which may increase bond strength and could cause a different retention rate than crowns cemented with a GIC.[53] The use of cement in paediatric PZCs remains inconclusive; one RCT significantly favoured one cement over the other, whereas other studies related restoration failures to the cementation and cement types used. Further studies are required to investigate whether restoration failures are due to the type of cement or technique used. This information will contribute to the use of PZCs in paediatric dentistry.


# 5 CONCLUSIONS

Clinical evaluation of PZCs revealed this restoration to:

have no unusual or accelerated attrition of the opposing dentition
- be highly retentive
- be resistant to fracture
- be well accepted by parents
- be gingiva-friendly
have inconclusive evidence about type of cements used

# 6 | CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

This systematic review gives detailed information about the use of PZCs for primary dentitions. It is a review of all articles to date that have investigated their wear on the opposing dentition, retention, fracture resistance, parental satisfaction, gingival health, or cementation materials. The results provide clinicians with insight on the use of PZCs for children with primary dentition.
