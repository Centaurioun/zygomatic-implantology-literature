Abstract. The use of titanium implants is well documented and they have high survival and success rates. However, when used as reduced-diameter implants, the risk of fracture is increased. Narrow diameter implants (NDIs) of titanium-zirconium  $(\mathrm{Ti}-\mathrm{Zr})$  alloy have recently been developed (Roxolid; Institut Straumann AG). Ti-Zr alloys (two highly biocompatible materials) demonstrate higher tensile strength than commercially pure titanium. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the existing clinical evidence on dental NDIs made from Ti-Zr. A systematic literature search was performed using the Medline database to find relevant articles on clinical studies published in the English language up to December 2014. Nine clinical studies using Ti-Zr implants were identified. Overall, 607 patients received 922 implants. The mean marginal bone loss was  $0.36 \pm 0.06 \mathrm{~mm}$  after 1 year and  $0.41 \pm 0.09 \mathrm{~mm}$  after 2 years. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 36 months. Mean survival and success rates were  $98.4\%$  and  $97.8\%$  at 1 year after implant placement and  $97.7\%$  and  $97.3\%$  at 2 years. Narrow diameter Ti-Zr dental implants show survival and success rates comparable to regular diameter titanium implants ( $>95\%$ ) in the short term. Long-term follow-up clinical data are needed to confirm the excellent clinical performance of these implants.

The use of dental implants for the replacement of lost teeth is considered a highly predictable treatment option. When the available bone is insufficient to place standard diameter implants, additional surgical techniques for bone regeneration are usually needed. An alternative treatment option is to place narrow diameter dental implants (NDIs). Several reports have aimed to define the dimension of a narrow diameter. In this review, an implant with a diameter between 3 and  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  was considered an NDI. The main indications for the use of NDIs are reduced mesiodistal space, reduced crestal width (narrow

ridge), and reduced amount of interradicular space. $^{14-17}$

There is great concern regarding the resistance and possible fatigue strength of this type of implant, especially when used in areas with a high occlusal load (posterior areas) or in patients with parafunctional habits. Since NDIs have a reduced contact area with the bone compared to regular diameter implants, this may also compromise the short- and long-term survival rates. For the same reasons, NDIs are not recommended to restore single canines, premolars, and molars. To overcome these problems, titanium alloys with higher tensile and yield strength, such as  $\mathrm{Ti}_6\mathrm{Al}_4\mathrm{V}$ , have been used to manufacture NDIs. Several studies have reported on corrosion, toxicity and biocompatibility issues related to aluminium and vanadium, and reduced bone responses with the use of this alloy.

To further improve the mechanical strength and biocompatibility, a new titanium-zirconium alloy (Ti-Zr) has been developed (Roxolid; Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland). This material is made of titanium alloyed with  $13 - 15\%$  of zirconium. This metal alloy is highly biocompatible and allows the same surface treatment, sand blasting and acid etching, as commercially pure titanium grade IV. The increased biomechanical properties of this material together with its excellent biocompatibility allow the use of NDIs even in clinically challenging situations. However, clinical evidence regarding the use of Ti-Zr NDIs is still limited. The aim of the present systematic review was to report on the clinical performance of Ti-Zr NDIs in clinical trials.

# Materials and methods

# Search strategy and eligibility criteria

This systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement; the PICO(S) questions were used as evaluation criteria in order to identify the Patient or Population, Intervention, Control and Comparison, Outcome, and Study types.39

A literature search was performed to identify available articles reporting on the clinical outcomes of Ti-Zr dental implants. A systematic approach was used to search the National Library of Medicine (Medline via PubMed) for articles published up to December 2014, including the following terms: 'titanium-zirconium' OR 'Ti-Zr' OR Roxolid'. The electronic search was supplemented with a manual search of the following publications: International Journal of Periodontics and
Fig. 1. Flow diagram describing the search strategy.

Restorative Dentistry, International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants, Journal of Periodontology, Implant Dentistry, Dentistry Today, Journal of Oral Implantology, Quintessence International, International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Clinical Oral Implants Research, and Journal of Clinical Periodontology (Fig. 1).

The search resulted in a total of 162 hits from which eight abstracts were considered potentially relevant, while the manual search yielded two additional abstracts. Two reviewers (PA, EL) independently evaluated the abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the full-text articles were obtained. A third reviewer (JN) was consulted to confirm the eligibility of the selected articles.

Clinical (human) studies on Ti-Zr dental implants that fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were selected: (1) clinical studies of at least 10 treated patients; (2) prospective studies including randomized-controlled and non-randomized controlled studies and cohort studies; (3) retrospective studies including controlled studies, case-control studies, and single cohort studies; (4) a mean follow-up period of at least 6 months; (5) inclusion of data on the survival rate of the implants.

The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) articles written in languages other than English; (2) review articles; (3) studies with fewer than 10 patients, or case reports; (4) a mean follow-up period of less than 6 months. The level of agreement between reviewers regarding study inclusion was calculated using the kappa value.

# Data extraction

Full text data extraction was performed independently for each eligible article by at least two reviewers (PA, EL). The following variables were extracted from each study: author(s), year of publication, study design, total number of patients, inclusion and exclusion criteria, follow-up duration, study outcomes (survival and success rates, marginal bone loss (MBL), and peri-implant measurements), patient demographics, implant type and manufacturer, total number of implants placed and number of implants in each patient, failed implants, jaw segment, bone regeneration needs, prosthetic complications, and loading protocols.

The methodological quality of the studies included was evaluated by one reviewer (PA) with regard to study design, randomization method, allocation concealment, blinding to the patient and examiner, and drop-out rates. In addition, the "Levels of evidence" document from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine was used to determine the qualitative validity.[40]


# Statistical analysis

Due to the heterogeneity of the articles, the difference in reported variables, and the inclusion of only two randomized controlled clinical trials, three objective outcomes could be extracted to perform the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis consisted of a weighted average for survival, success, and MBL, based on a random-effects model, with a confidence interval of  $95\%$ . The statistical analysis was performed using R 3.0.2 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

# Results

The search of the Medline database via PubMed resulted in a total of nine articles that were considered. After assessment against the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, nine articles were selected (Table 1). One RCT was excluded because an article with the same study population and a longer follow-up period was found.[41] The overall proportion of interreviewer agreement was  $100\%$ , indicating an 'excellent' level of agreement.

# Types of studies

The selected studies included the following study types: two randomized controlled trials, [42,43] six prospective studies, [38,44-48] and one retrospective study. [49] The studies reported cases of single-tooth gap, partial, or fully edentulous patients and implant placement in the anterior and posterior regions of both the maxilla and mandible (Table 1).

# Implants and demographic data

All implants placed in the studies included in this review were manufactured by the same company from a Ti-Zr alloy (Roxolid; Institut Straumann AG). Tissue-level and bone-level implants were used, with a reduced implant diameter of  $3.3\mathrm{mm}$ . Bone-level implants had a conical shape and a narrow cross-fit connection. Tissue-level implants had a cylindrical shape and a 4.8-mm platform, with a machined collar design. In contrast to titanium NDIs, Roxolid NDIs are recommended for the restoration of anterior and posterior teeth.

# 4 Altuna et al.

A total of 607 patients received 922 narrow diameter Ti-Zr implants. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 36 months (Table 1). The patients treated ranged in age from 21 to 76 years, and a higher proportion of women than men were treated in the studies.

# Implant placement and loading protocols

Most of the studies followed early or delayed implant placement protocols according to the classification of Esposito et al.50 Two articles included immediate implant placement.47,48 Early or delayed loading protocols as defined by Weber et al. in 2009 were mostly used.51 Immediate loading was only described in three articles.44,47,48

# Clinical outcomes

For this review, the clinical outcomes of the nine studies were evaluated in terms of the survival and success rates and MBL. Only one of the nine studies did not present well-defined success criteria.[42] Reported survival rates ranged from  $94.7\%$  to  $100\%$  and success rates from  $94.7\%$  to  $100\%$ . Three articles presented a sample size of 20 patients.[38,45,48] One implant failed in each test group in two articles and two implants in the other, causing a drop in the survival rate.

Three studies reported mean pocket probing depths, with values of  $2.69 \pm 0.8 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $3.0 \pm 0.74 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $2.9 \pm 1.2 \mathrm{~mm}$ . Another study presented a mean probing pocket depth that ranged from 2.21 to  $2.89 \mathrm{~mm}$  after two years of loading. Mean MBL ranged from  $0.16 \pm 0.42 \mathrm{~mm}$  to  $0.41 \pm 0.56 \mathrm{~mm}$  at 1 year after implant placement, and from  $0.33 \pm 0.54 \mathrm{~mm}$  to  $0.58 \pm 0.60 \mathrm{~mm}$  at 2 years. Only one study reported MBL after 3 years of follow-up, with a value of  $0.78 \pm 0.75 \mathrm{~mm}$  (Table 1).

After normalization of the results, a weighted average was obtained with a confidence interval of  $95\%$  for survival, success, and mean MBL. At 12 months after implant placement, the survival and success rates of the 901 implants were  $98.4\%$  and  $97.8\%$ , respectively, and the MBL reported for 156 implants was  $0.36 \pm 0.06 \mathrm{~mm}$ . At 24 months, the survival and success rates of 676 implants were  $97.7\%$  and  $97.3\%$ , respectively, and the MBL reported for 148 implants was  $0.41 \pm 0.09 \mathrm{~mm}$  (Figs 2-7).

# Bone regeneration needs

No bone regeneration was performed in three of the studies.43,45,46 Minor bone regeneration for small defects such as fenestrations or dehiscences was performed at the time of implant placement in two studies.[38,42] In the study by Cordaro et al., bone regeneration was avoided in four out of 10 patients  $(40\%)$  with the use of NDIs.[49] Another study, using immediately loaded NDIs in partially edentulous patients, reported the same outcome.[48] More than half of the patients  $(54\%)$  avoided augmentation procedures in a non-interventional study.[47] Finally, bone regeneration was not

# Discussion

The use of Ti-Zr dental implants is well documented in several in vitro $^{52-55}$  and experimental studies in animals, and these have shown similar results to conventional grade IV titanium implants. The clinical evidence on Ti-Zr NDIs was analyzed in this review. The nine articles included here reported the use of 922 Ti-Zr NDIs in 607 patients, with a follow-up period of between 3 and 36 months. Very recently, Müller et al. reported the 5-year follow-up of a double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial comparing Ti-Zr with titanium NDIs in a split-mouth design.[60] The cumulative survival rate of  $98.9\%$  and bone level change of  $-0.60\mathrm{mm}$  confirmed the favourable results of Ti-Zr implants as presented 3 years after implant placement.[43]

In most of the articles, the definition of a successful implant was that reported by Buser et al. In the studies included in the present review, all survival and success rates were high (94.7% to 100%) and similar to those reported for standard diameter implants.

Two different designs of Ti-Zr implants were used, namely tissue-level and bone-level implants. Romeo et al. compared Straumann tissue-level implants with a reduced diameter  $(3.3\mathrm{mm})$  with standard diameter implants  $(4.1\mathrm{mm})$  and found no statistically significant difference in the MBL.[21] In the randomized clinical trial by Quirynen et al., Ti-Zr bone-level implants were compared to titanium grade IV bone-level implants.[43] The MBL values were similar in the two groups, which is consistent with the results of this review. The MBLs for Ti-Zr NDIs with tissue-level and bone-level configurations were similar to those reported for titanium implants of similar designs.[62-64]

Ti-Zr NDIs were used in the anterior and posterior areas of both jaws and with all types of prosthetic designs. Although single tooth gaps in the anterior area with reduced mesiodistal space or a narrow alveolar ridge are the main indications described in the literature for the use of NDIs, other indications are also known. According to a recent systematic review, patients with a single tooth gap and those who are partially edentulous in the posterior areas can be treated with NDIs.[11]

Kobayashi et al. compared the tensile strength of pure titanium, alloys containing Zr, and pure zirconium and reported 2.5- to 3-times higher tensile strength for Ti-Zr alloys.[65] In a recent study, the tensile strength of Ti-Zr, with a value of  $953\mathrm{MPa}$ , was found to be approximately  $40\%$  greater than that of commercially pure titanium grade IV.[66] It seems clear that there is a risk of fracture when using NDIs, but that the risk can be minimized by choosing the strongest materials. The fracture of a tissue-level Roxolid NDI was described recently.67 In the clinical case presented, a single implant was placed in the canine area with a telescopic abutment to retain a removable partial denture. The reason for failure, according to the article, was mechanical overload and not following the manufacturer's indications for the use of NDIs. In the studies summarized in the current review, no fractures of the NDIs were described. Long-term follow-up data are needed for NDIs placed in load-bearing areas.

Immediate loading of the Ti-Zr implants was described in three of the studies. Only  $3\%$  of the cases were immediately loaded in one study, and one patient received immediate loading in the study by Chiapasco et al. Immediate loading was performed in all of the patients in one of the studies included, with a survival rate of  $94.7\%$  and a success rate of  $94.7\%$ , even though this is not routinely needed in daily practice. One interesting fact about this latter study is that immediate provisionalization was performed in conjunction with bone augmentation in  $40\%$  of the cases.

Bone augmentation is used widely and is considered to be a predictable technique to reconstruct a deficient alveolar ridge.8-

10,68 One of the most interesting facts about NDIs is their potential ability to reduce the need for bone regeneration, because less residual bone is needed for implant insertion.[69,70] Several authors have reported the placement of NDIs in compromised situations. In a prospective clinical trial, implants with a diameter of  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  were placed in edentulous patients with horizontal atrophy and followed for at least 1 year; the resulting survival and success rates were  $100\%$  and the MBL was  $0.30 \pm 0.13\mathrm{mm}$ .[13] In another study,  $3.3\mathrm{mm}$  TPS ITI implants were placed in partially and fully edentulous patients with an overall survival rate of  $99.4\%$  and success rate of  $96.4\%$  after 1 year of loading; the MBL was  $0.35 \pm 1.05\mathrm{mm}$ .[71] Both of these studies showed similar results to those presented in this review. In a recent study by Papadimitriou et al., significantly less bone regeneration was needed when NDIs were planned for placement in edentulous patients.[72] This was also described in the article by Chiapasco et al. included in this review, in which only seven out of 18 patients with horizontally deficient ridges required additional guided bone regeneration.[44] Lambert et al. found no need for bone regeneration at  $40\%$  of all implant sites, thus confirming that NDIs are a less invasive treatment option.[48]

After evaluating grafting needs when using Ti-Zr NDIs, it is reasonable to expect an increase in patient satisfaction due to reduced complexity, costs, and duration of treatment. Accordingly, in a recent review by Pommer et al., minimally invasive treatment options such as flapless implant placement, short implants, or NDIs were compared to bone augmentation techniques. The evidence was limited, but it was concluded that patient satisfaction was generally higher with less bone grafting.[75] The quality and level of evidence was limited in general and with a high risk of bias, so caution is advised when interpreting these data.

In conclusion, narrow diameter Ti-Zr dental implants show high survival and success rates  $(>95\%)$  and marginal bone level changes  $(<1\mathrm{mm})$  that are comparable to those of regular diameter titanium implants in the short term (investigated follow-up periods of up to 36 months). The first results of the 5-year outcomes of Ti-Zr implants recently became available, confirming the excellent clinical performance of Ti-Zr even after a longer period of follow-up.[60] Therefore, NDIs made from this new alloy, which has increased mechanical strength and excellent biocompatibility properties, appear to be a reliable treatment option to restore a reduced mesiodistal space, reduced crestal width (narrow ridge), and reduced amount of interradicular space. Arguably one of the most relevant benefits for the patient is the reduction in complexity, duration, and costs of treatment due to the less frequent requirement for bone grafting. If used as recommended, the new alloy implants appear to be a reliable treatment option. More long-term follow-up clinical data are needed to confirm the evidence in the present studies.
