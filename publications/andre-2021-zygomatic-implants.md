# Introduction

Paired with the promise of "teeth-in-a-day," zygomatic implants have increased in popularity as a graftless treatment option that can reduce the timeline between the surgical procedure and prosthetic reconstruction, while offering a highly predictable outcome for patients with a severely resorbed maxilla. However, the placement of these implants requires ample knowledge of the local anatomy and surgical technique in order to optimize treatment outcomes and avoid major complications. Careful planning and open communication between the surgeon, restorative dentist, laboratory technicians, and patient can assist in optimizing the final results.

Recent surgical approaches pay close attention to individual anatomic, physiologic, and prosthetic needs in order to create safer surgical protocols, increase predictability, and consequently, achieve satisfactory long-term results. [3,4] Zygomatic implants may offer an answer to the complicated question of how to rehabilitate completely edentulous patients with a severely deficient maxilla. Implant-supported prosthetics can enhance the quality of life of edentulous individuals by improving their function and esthetics and positively affecting the patient's social life.

Other treatment options for the rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla with an implant-supported prosthesis include bone augmentation with delayed or immediate placement of endosseous implants, as well as pterygoid plate, "all-on-four," and short implants. Bone grafting techniques used to satisfy the horizontal and vertical requirements for successful implant placement include sinus augmentation, $^{5}$  guided bone regeneration, onlay grafting, interpositional bone grafts, ridge splitting, and distraction osteogenesis. Autogenous bone remains the gold standard for alveolar bone augmentation because of its unique combination of osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and osteogenic properties. $^{6}$


In the severely atrophic maxilla, the use of extensive autogenous bone augmentation may be required in order to allow for a successful treatment outcome. One of the disadvantages of harvesting large amounts of autogenous bone is the addition of distal surgical sites, which can lead to increased operating time and potentially increased surgical morbidity. In addition, the time between bone grafting in severely atrophic sites with autogenous bone grafts and implant placement can range from 4 to 6 months.[6]

Zygomatic implant placement, a graftless technique, provides another modality for patients who have had bone graft failures in the past or for those who are medically complex and cannot tolerate extensive surgical procedures. A position statement by the American College of Prosthodontists stated that "the use of the zygomatic implant in various clinical scenarios with multiple configurations enables the dental team to restore quality of life and gives patients an expedited and predictable option." The reduction in surgical sites, fewer number of surgical procedures, and the shortening of the timeframe between surgery and final prosthesis delivery are some of the advantages that may lead the surgeon and patient to choose this treatment option. In this article, the authors aim to provide an overview of the indications for zygomatic implants and the local anatomy involved and describe the various techniques used for the placement of these implants.

After a decade of clinical studies, zygoma implants were made available to the dental profession (Fig. 1). Changes to the initially proposed surgical approach have rapidly taken place as individual considerations and prosthetic needs have become evident. Currently, various companies offer different variations of zygomatic implants, including Nobel Biocare, Neodent, Noris Medical, Southern Implants, and Implant Swiss. Nobel Biocare Zygomatic implants are available in lengths from 30 to  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$ . Brånsystem Zygoma Implants have a 45 abutment head and can have a TiUnite surface or machined surface. TiUnite is a roughened thickened titanium oxide layer that is highly porous. The machine surface layer implants have an opening in the head, allowing for the use of the regular platform Bränsystem components.

# Indications and contraindications

Zygomatic implant placement is indicated for the implant-supported rehabilitation of completely edentulous patients with significant sinus pneumatization and severe posterior alveolar ridge resorption. $^{12}$  There is little clinical research demonstrating the success of these implants in partially edentulous patients. Bedrossian $^{13}$  described a systematic pretreatment approach for the classification and treatment of the atrophic maxilla. The maxilla is divided into the following 3 zones: zone I (premaxilla), zone II (premolar area), and zone III (molar area) (Fig. 2). The availability of bone in each zone should be assessed by the clinician, typically through the evaluation of a preoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Table 1 describes the recommended surgical approaches. These recommendations can assist the surgeon in formulating the surgical treatment plan. Bedrossian and colleagues $^{11}$  recommended the placement of zygoma implants when there is less than 2 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  in zone 2 and zone 3. In the case of an edentulous patient with inadequate bone in all 3 zones, the placement of 4 zygoma implants, also known as Quad Zygomatic Implants, has shown promising results in the literature (Boxes 1 and 2). $^{14,15}$

# Biomechanics

The stability and success of zygomatic implants have been attributed to the "quad-anchoring" of the implant to the maxilla and zygoma bones. When following Professor Bréheinequek, the stability of zygomatic implants originates from its engagement at the alveolar crest by the lingual cortex of the alveolus and the cortical fibor of the maxillary sinus (Fig. 4). Stabilization at the apex of the implant is pro-vided by the zygomatic bone itself. $^{18}$  In a study by Nkenke and colleagues, $^{19}$  the bone mineral density, trabecular bone volume, and trabecular bone patterns were assessed in 30 human zygomatic bone specimens. Interestingly, the quantitative computed tomography and histomorphometry analysis

revealed the zygomatic bone has an unfavorable microarchitecture for implant placement. However, despite that fact, the study concluded that zygoma implants may achieve long-lasting success, as proven by the literature, when multicortex stabilization is achieved. It was determined that the engagement of the zygomatic implant to cortical bone plays a more significant role in the stability of the implant than contact with larger amounts of trabecular bone.

Various studies have focused on the precise location of stress of these implants during function. When occlusal forces are applied, most of the support comes from the zygoma bone.[4,20] More specifically, Freedman and colleagues[21] described the lateral cortex of the zygoma as the main load-bearing area. Ujigawa and colleagues[20] conducted a finite elemental analysis that concluded that the stresses during occlusal load transfer differ in zygomatic implants with or without connected standard implants supporting the superstructure. In Fig. 5, connected zygoma implants to standard implants, referred to as the combination model, show better stress distribution. In contrast, stress load of implants not combined with standard implants, or the single model, is seen to be partially concentrated at the joint of the fixture abutment. It can also be appreciated that in both models, the midportion of the implant shows higher stresses during bending movements. Bending forces could have adverse effects in the stability and longevity of the implant.[12] The role of the maxillary alveolar support in reducing the maximum stress distribution of zygomatic implants was further studied by Freedman and colleagues.[21] When the 2 zygomatic implants,

anchored in the zygomatic bone and maxillary alveolar bone, are connected by a fixed bridge, the occlusal and lateral stresses are reduced compared with models with no alveolar bone support.

These studies prove that with the current techniques, the distribution of forces is better managed by cross-arch stabilization of the zygoma implants with a rigid superstructure to standard implants in the premaxilla. Final prosthesis considerations should include minimizing distal cantilevers, achieving a balanced occlusion, and decreasing the cuspal inclination of prosthetic teeth. $^{4}$

# Workflow: anatomically versus prosthetically driven

Multiple approaches have been developed by oral surgeons with the intention to decrease surgical time, decrease patient morbidity, and increase the success of zygomatic implants. The

ultimate decision on which approach to use lies at the hands of the operator after a throughout review of the patient's local and systemic factors. Evaluation of the potential implant site and trajectory of the zygomatic implant via computed tomography is crucial in the planning phase. Special attention is placed on the availability of bone in the zygomatic arch and the residual alveolar crest. The relationship of the proposed zygomatic implant path to the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus and proximity to the orbital rim should be considered. There are 2 proposed surgical approaches: anatomically driven and prosthetically driven.[12,16,22] The placement of the zygoma implants can be extramaxillary, extrasinus, or intramaxillary.

The zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) was originally proposed by Dr Carlos Aparicio $^{23}$  in 2010 (Fig. 6). The investigator studied 200 zygomatic implant sites in 100 patients with a focus on skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest complex and developed 5 typical anatomic and implant pathway situations. The proposed classification is outlined in Table 2. The ZAGA system highlights the anatomic differences among patients and within the same patient bilaterally and can be used during surgical planning.

A recent publication by Ponnusamy and Miloro<sup>3</sup> proposed a restoratively aimed zygomatic implant routine (RAZIR) workup. The preoperative workup consists of CBCT, intraoral scans, diagnostic impressions, record bases, and occlusal rims. This protocol is based on (1) determining the position of the teeth in

Zygomatic Implants: A Solution for the Atrophic Maxilla. Dent Clin North Am. 2020 Apr;64(2):401-40; with permission.)

Esthetic and functional considerations are meticulously considered to support esthetics, phonetics, lip position, lip support, and function and to allow the patient to easily maintain oral hygiene. For example, the buccopalatal placement of the teeth and an analysis of the relationship between the proposed implant emergence sites and alveolar ridge. The required thickness of the final restoration is analyzed, and the appropriate final prosthesis is selected. RAZIR requires the merging of the final tooth positions (digital or analog) with the intraoral scan and diagnostic CBCT scan. This step allows the surgeon to virtually place the zygomatic implants and determine the appropriate surgical technique (intrasinus, extrasinus, or extramaxillary).

Prosthetic reconstruction of the edentulous maxilla with zygomatic implants can be achieved in a 2-stage protocol[24] or immediate-loading protocol.[25] In the 2-step protocol, the zygomatic implants are uncovered after a period of osseointegration for 6 months, and cross-stabilization is established with the Cal technique or similar passive bar insertion. During stage II surgery, osseointegration is confirmed by the lack of mobility, resistance to a reverse torque of  $10\mathrm{Ncm}$ , absence of the final restoration via a diagnostic tooth setup, (2) virtually determining the zygoma implant position by directing the implant platform at the central fossa of the second premolar or at the cingulum of the lateral incisor for anterior zygomatic implants, and (3) the selection of the appropriate surgical approach based on the required trajectory.

pain on percussion, and absence of signs of peri-implantitis. Immediately loaded zygomatic implants are also splinted with the use of a fixed provisional prosthesis, oftentimes the patient's preexisting denture. Cross-arch stabilization is key, and occlusal loading of zygomatic implants without cross-arch stabilization is not recommended. $^{4,13,26}$

# Surgical technique

The placement of zygoma implants can be achieved under local anesthesia, intravenous sedation, or general anesthesia. In the literature, there are conflicting recommendations on the appropriate level of sedation for this procedure.[9,12] Ultimately, the surgeon is responsible for deciding based on the patient's desired level of comfort, medical status, and length of procedure. Local anesthesia can be achieved via local infiltrations

# Box 3. Surgical tips for zygomatic implant placement

1. One should have good retraction to allow for clear visibility of the surgical site. The senior author prefers to identify the inferior orbital foramen and nerve within his dissection.
2. The senior author finds that placing a retractor (ie, a Seldin retractor) within the notch formed by the zygomatic and frontal process works well (Figs. 14 and 15). Its place provides excellent retraction and visualization for helping to guide the drills into the appropriate anatomic position.
3. The authors prefer to engage the zygomatic bone and to leave visible bony contours by  $1\mathrm{mm}$  or so.
4. The senior author finds that using the most lateral posterior wall of the sinus as a guide helps ensure the appropriate angulation and placement of the zygomatic implant.

and blocks, including the posterior superior alveolar nerve block, greater palatine nerve block, infraorbital nerve block, and bilateral transcutaneous infiltrations of the temporal areas over the body of the zygoma. $^{13}$

The classical or intrasinus surgical technique described by Brånbergink with a Le Fort I type incision. $^{10,27,28}$  A modification to this technique is a crestal incision across the edentulous arch with vertical releasing incisions over the maxillary tuberosities. The full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is elevated to provide direct visualization of the trajectory of the implant from the premolar region of the alveolar bone to the zygoma body. $^{13}$  The dissection is continued from the lateral wall of the maxilla toward the zygomatic bone to allow for increased visibility of the zygomatic region and the infraorbital nerve. A lateral window of approximately  $10 \times 5 \mathrm{~mm}$  is then made into the lateral aspect of the maxillary sinus using a round bur (Fig. 7). Initially, the careful management of the Schneiderian membrane was recommended to decrease the incidence of oroantral communications and sinus disease; however, in the current literature, there is less emphasis on the preservation of the membrane, as little clinical correlation has been found. $^{5,8,23,29}$

Fig. 15 Demonstration of retraction technique using a Selden retractor positioned in the notch formed by the zygomatic process and frontal process of the zygomatic bone to increase visibility of the surgical field during the procedure. Also please note the visible engagement of the zygomatic implant in the zygomatic bone, ensuring complete anchoring of the implant to 4 cortices.

The entrance of the implant is marked with a round bur in the palatal side of the crest, as close to the midline as possible (Fig. 8). A surgical guide can be fabricated before the procedure in order to enhance the prosthetic results. Sequential osteotomies are performed starting with the use of a round bur at a maximum speed of  $2000\mathrm{rpm}$ , per the manufacturer's recommendations. The width is then progressively increased with the use of 2 twist drills  $(2.9\mathrm{mm}$  and  $3.5\mathrm{mm})$ . Similar to the recommendations during placement of endosseous implants, copious irrigation is needed. A depth indicator can be used to decide or verify the required length of the zygoma implant (Fig. 9). The zygoma implant can then be inserted with either the zygoma handpiece at 20 to  $50\mathrm{Ncm}$  or with the use of the Z-handle until it reaches the appropriate depth (Fig. 10). The implant mount screw position marks exactly the future position of the abutment screw, which should be perpendicular to the occlusal plane. For the 2-stage procedure, the cover screw is placed, and the surgical flap is reapproximated with sutures (Figs. 11-13). Multiunit abutments may be placed if the implants are planned for immediate loading.

Another variation is the extrasinus technique, in which the zygomatic implant is placed outside of the lateral wall of the sinus in patients with a prominent buccal concavity. This technique calls for the placement of the zygoma implants in an anatomically driven manner, originating as close to the alveolar crestal bone as possible while still achieving adequate cortical stabilization within the zygoma bone. The use of the buccal fat pad is imperative for adequate soft tissue coverage of the lateral aspect of the implant (Box 3).

# Success rates and criteria for success

The combined survival rate of zygomatic implants reported by Chrcanovic and colleagues30 over a 12-year period has been reported as  $95.21\%$ . Conversely, when considering the success rates of these implants, there is a lack of a standardized, reproducible measure for success of zygomatic implants.31 Standard endosseous implants and zygomatic implants differ in their biomechanics, lengths, and surgical protocols; therefore, the parameters established for the evaluation of standard endosseous implants do not directly translate to useful criteria when evaluating zygomatic implants. As an example, although periodontal probing is part of the assessment of standard implants, Aparicio and colleagues[29] and Ponnusamy and Miloro[3] advocate against the periodontal probing of zygomatic implants, as the practice does not provide accurate information of the integration of the implant and may iatrogenically cause oral-antral communications and soft tissue damage.


In a recent study, Aparicio and colleagues[29] offered successful criteria with the purpose of bringing uniformity to the scientific study of zygoma implants. The investigators reviewed their proposed Zygoma Success Code and introduced a memorable acronym "ORIS," which stands for 4 specific criteria to describe the outcome of zygomatic implants. The criteria include the following: offset, rhinosinusitis, infection, and stability. The proposed system differentiates between degrees of success reported as success condition I, II, III, IV, or V. The representation of each degree of success condition is as follows:

I. Optimal stage
II. Alteration of routine without clinical impact
III. Alterations that are clinically manifested but treatable
IV. Implant supports prosthesis but has not been tested to ORIS criteria
V. Implant failure

For the classification of zygomatic implants, the worst criteria measurement is taken. At least 1 presurgical and postsurgical CBCT is necessary to fully evaluate the implant. The offset measurement is obtained by calculating the following: (distance between the center of the palate to the center of the residual ridge) - (distance from center of the palate to the implant head). A positive value indicates the implant is placed palatal to the crest, and negative values indicate the implant is placed in the buccal aspect. Rhinosinusitis is evaluated radiographically by the modified Lund-Mackay[32] (Table 3) and clinically by the Lanza-Kennedy questionnaire). Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is diagnosed when 2 or more major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria are met. Major criteria include facial pain or pressure, facial congestion or fullness, nasal obstruction, purulent discharge, hyposmia or anosmia, purulent discharge, hyposmia or anosmia, acute fever, purulence on examination. Minor criteria are defined as a headache, nonacute fever, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain, cough, otalgia or aural fullness. Purulence on nasal examination alone is sufficient to make a diagnosis of CRS. Soft tissue infection is assessed via inspection (recession, gingival redness, swelling, bleeding) and palpation (bleeding on gentle palpation, purulence). The stability of the implant is determined by the presence of mobility, pain, or rotation. Rotation is an absolute indication for implant removal.

# Complications

The main complications associated with the placement of zygoma implants reported in the literature are sinusitis and failed osseointegration of the implants.[33] The intrasinus trajectory of zygomatic implants can lead to early alterations of the paranasal sinuses on radiographic examination.[17] However, the findings have been frequently of a subclinical nature, and the symptoms described by patients are not significant compared with the general population.[29,34] Transient neurosensory disturbances to the malar region can occur because of

# Clinics care points

- Zygomatic implants offer a predictable treatment alternative for patients with a severely resorbed posterior maxilla. $^{12,30,36,37}$

- The use of zygomatic implants has been endorsed by the American College of Prosthodontists in various scenarios, as it facilitates the delivery of prosthetics, which can enhance the patient's quality of life.
- Following the guidelines established by Bedrossian and colleagues, zygomatic implants should be considered when there is less than 2 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of available bone in zone 2 and 3 of the maxilla.[13]
- Survival rates of zygoma implants are comparable with survival rates of endosseous implants.[12]
Patients should be screened for preexisting maxillary sinus pathologic condition and treated before the surgical placement of zygomatic implants.[34]
- The parameters for successful osseointegration of zygoma implants differ from the success criteria for endosseous implants. $^{12}$
Periodontal probing is not recommended as part of the zygomatic implant assessment, as it can have iatrogenic effects.[3,29]
- Cross-arch stabilization is key for the survival of zygomatic implants and the longevity of the prosthetic restoration. Specifically, the engagement of the zygoma implant in cortical bone plays a significant role in the stability of the implant.[19]

# Summary

Zygomatic implants as an option for the reconstruction of the atrophic maxilla have proven to be a viable alternative. The surgical procedure is one familiar to most practicing oral and maxillofacial surgeons and can be accomplished in either an office or an ambulatory surgical setting. Zygomatic implants can be used together with other conventional implants to offer an immediate all-on-four reconstructive solution for those special patients indicated for such a procedure.
