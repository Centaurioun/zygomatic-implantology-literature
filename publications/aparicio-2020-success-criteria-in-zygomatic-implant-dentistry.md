# Success Criteria in Zygomatic Implant Dentistry

Carlos Aparicio, Roberto López-Piriz, and Tomas Albrektsson

# Introduction

There is a broad interest in the scientific community to determine risk factors regarding therapy with zygomatic implants (ZI). However, the criteria used in the literature to describe the success of a ZI are inconsistently chosen and/or applied and are often inspired by the criteria of success used for conventional implants. The extreme maxillary atrophy that indicates the use of ZI is associated with resorptive changes in both alveolar and basal bone which makes neither the direct placement of regular implants nor the use of conventional criteria to describe implant success/failure advisable. Moreover, protocols for rehabilitating the atrophic maxilla using ZI have been continuously evolving to overcome initial shortcomings of the protocol. The current zygomatic approach is relatively new, especially if the head of the ZI is located in an extra-maxillary buccal position to the alveolar crest with no alveolar bone around its perimeter. Zygomatic-related rehabilitation differs from conventional implant treatment with regard to biomechanics, clinical procedures, outcomes, and eventual complications, like soft tissue incompetence or recession, which may lead to recurrent sinus or soft tissue infections and aesthetic complaints. Currently, the manner in which clinical outcomes and complications of ZI are reported in the literature is inconsistent and lacks a standardized protocol. Specific criteria to describe success/survival of ZI, including a standardized way to report on rhinosinusal pathology associated with ZI, is necessary in order to write, read, and compare scientific literature related to ZI-based oral rehabilitation. The aim of this chapter is to critically review success criteria used for regular and zygomatic implants. Following on, a revisited Zygomatic Success Code describing specific criteria to score the outcome of a rehabilitation anchored on zygomatic implants is proposed.

# Criteria of Success for Conventional Implants

Defining criteria that can be used to evaluate the health of implant integration has been an arduous task since the beginning of implant dentistry. In this context, one of the first attempts to objectively evaluate the success of implants was the 1978 Harvard consensus [1]. In 1978, Schnitman and Shulman proposed criteria for success that would be completely unacceptable today, such as the presence of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of mobility of the implant. However, although they failed in quantifying mobility as a success criterion, they selected fundamental parameters that, in many cases, are still considered when determining the "health" of conventional implants: stability, peri-implant radiolucency, crestal bone level with respect to the platform, peri-implant mucosal health, and long-term survival rate.

Subsequently, in 1986, Albrektsson et al. [2] analyzed the advantages, disadvantages, and survival of the most common implant systems and proposed success criteria that have been utilized for over three decades. As proof of the general acceptance of these criteria, it is sufficient to indicate that half of follow-up studies of more than 10 years published in the scientific literature use these criteria. They clearly established that after the first year of surgery, the implant must be clinically immobile to reflect successful osseointegration and that, consequently, there must be no peri-implant radiolucency. They defined as acceptable a loss of vertical bone height of  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  per year, but were unable to make any reference to the bone loss acceptable during the first year since, at that time, radiograms were not allowed during the first year after implant placement. Further, success demanded the absence of persistent iatrogenia and a survival rate of  $85\%$  at 5 years and  $80\%$  at 10 years. In addition, they highlighted the need to differentiate in follow-up studies between survival and success.

During the initial period of osseointegration, several methods were used to determine osseointegration such as anti-clockwise rotation test and the sound analysis at implant/abutment percussion with a metallic instrument. However, an accepted way to establish osseointegration was the clinical mobility test practiced by trying to laterally move the implant either between two metallic instruments or between the clinician's fingers. The absence of a reproducible parameter prevented a true discriminatory measurement of subclinical mobility that was sufficiently sensitive and specific. In 1990, Olive and Aparicio [3] proposed that the Periotest&reg; device is used to quantify implant mobility and to compare and report mobility in numerical form. In their study, the authors classified implant mobility as falling into one of three categories:
- Osseointegrated: When there is no clinical mobility and the implant negative Periotest&reg; values.
- Not integrated: When there is clinical mobility and the implant has clearly positive Periotest&reg; values.
- Limiting implants: When there is subclinical mobility, hardly noticeable by manual methods and the implant has slightly positive Periotest&reg; values.

Olive and Aparicio propose that, in the presence of subclinical mobility, the period of bone healing of the implant should be extended and Periotest&reg; measurements be continued until osseointegration or failure is determined. Subsequently, Meredith et al. [4] recommended the use of resonance frequency analysis (RFA) for measuring the stability of conventional implants. Although RFA theoretically provides a more precise idea of implant mobility, neither method correlates well with histological data.

In the Proceedings of the first European Workshop on Periodontology in 1993, Albrektsson et al. [5] included, as a criterion of success, crestal bone loss from baseline of less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  during the first year of implant function. At the same workshop, other authors proposed the convenience of using periodontal indices such as depth of probing and bleeding to evaluate the health of the implant.

Currently, there is a tendency to evaluate the health and diseases status of peri-implant tissues through periodontal indices. This practice overlooks the fact that important differences exist between periodontal and peri-implant tissues. Furthermore, it assumes that traditional periodontal indicators are reliable to evaluate the peri-implant tissue complex. The clinician who uses periodontal indexes to assess peri-implant health expects that increasing probing depth over time or an increase in the rate of bleeding upon probing will correlate with crestal bone loss progression. However, those indices are not necessarily correlated with increased crestal bone loss and are not correlated with the presence of a pathogenic microflora, nor are they related to histological changes that characterize peri-implantitis [6]. Furthermore, there is no scientific evidence indicating that the greater the distance between the peri-implant gingival margin and the implant platform is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. It remains unproven that increasing probing depth over time is associated with peri-implant bone loss. In this sense, evidence based on animal experiments is extremely weak and human studies show poor correlation between probing pocket-depth changes and peri-implant bone-level changes [7].

Roos et al. [8] qualitatively classified implants into four categories: lost to follow-up, failed (explanted implants or those with mobility), surviving, or successful. They further defined the presence of pain or persistent inflammation and paresthesia as adverse events. They emphasized the importance of recording the time of occurrence of adverse effects and their duration, any therapeutic measures implemented, and recovery. This approach categorized adverse effects as mild, moderate, or severe. Occasionally, these adverse events may justify implant explantation. On surviving implants, they performed a quantitative analysis based on the following parameters: radiographic examination, evaluating signs of osseointegration loss and crestal bone level, as well as a particular testing of implant mobility. For the first time, they established degrees of success. Thus, when in the absence of adverse events the loss of bone level is  $< 1 \mathrm{~mm}$  in the first year and averages  $< 0.2 \mathrm{~mm}/$  year in successive years and individual stability is confirmed, the implant is classified as a success grade I. If individual implant stability cannot be examined, but it maintains the rest of the parameters, it is classified as a success grade II. Grade III is the same as grade II but the implant has experienced  $>1 \mathrm{~mm}$  of crestal bone loss in the first year (although the authors did not specify the acceptable limit before considering and implant as merely surviving). Survival represented those implants that did not meet the requirements of success or failure or had not been evaluated correctly. The authors concluded that strict criteria of success and individual mobility tests should be used along with radiographic examination, when evaluating new implant systems. On the other hand, in the opinion of Roos et al., for already accredited systems, it would be satisfactory to apply lighter success criteria and only perform radiographic examination in regularly scheduled clinical exams.
In the consensus document of the Toronto Osseointegration Conference in Clinical Dentistry [9], it was emphasized that implants are intended to solve prosthetic problems and, therefore, this aspect should be considered when evaluating the success of implants. Next, considerations were made about the need to use a standardized periapical radiological method to determine and compare crestal bone level in addition to assessing implant stability. The criteria proposed by Albrektsson et al. in 1993 [5] were maintained, but a subjective criterion was introduced: the need for a functional and aesthetic prosthesis that satisfies the patient and the professional.

In 1998, Esposito et al. [10] made an interesting classification of failure in biological (early or late depending on the load), mechanical (when there are fractures of the components), iatrogenic (when a lesion has been caused), or due to inadequate adaptation of the patient (phonetics, aesthetic, and psychological). They proposed that peri-implant inflammation put the implant at risk and should be evaluated, but emphasized that it is important to differentiate between complications which increase the risk of failure and established failure. They evaluated methods of assessing the success of implants and suggested that the ability to measure crystal bone changes less than  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  is very limited and that only mesial and distal aspects are assessed with radiography.

In the Pisa consensus on criteria of success in 2007, Misch et al. [11] noted that probing depth is unhelpful and stated that peri-implantitis existed in the presence of peri-implant exudate. They also considered time as an important modulating factor, suggesting a minimum of 12 months evaluation required for initial success; between 12 months and 3 years for early success; between 3 and 7 years for intermediate success; and longer than 7 years be considered long-term evaluation. Together with the success of the implants, the survival rate of prosthetic structures should be recorded and reported.

In summary, there are few studies that analyze the results of treatments after 10 years of follow-up, a time period essential to understand the biological impact of implants. No internationally accepted parameters have yet been agreed upon to determine the success of an implant, nor how values of these parameters identify a specific health status of an implant and reveal its prognosis or the need for clinical intervention. However, it seems that the criteria outlined by Albrektsson [2], the immobility and the crestal bone level determined radiographically, continue to be more significant parameters when evaluating an implant.

# Success Criteria for Zygomatic Implants

Currently, there are no clear criteria to specifically describe ZI-based rehabilitation outcomes and assess to what extent any particular criterion or grouping of criteria indicate a particular level of success or risk for the treatment. There is a tendency to validate, and, subsequently, to consider and evaluate a zygomatic implant in the same way as a conventional implant placed in pristine alveolar bone. However, ZIs differ from conventional implants in many aspects. For instance, the surgical approach to placing zygomatic implants and eventual complications is different. Some unique aspects of ZIs, as pointed out by different authors [12-16], are:

- Longer implant which needs special instrumentation.
- Non-axial placement.
- An extra-sinus or extra-maxillary path to reach the zygomatic bone.
- Different complications, like sinus infection or soft tissue recession, may appear after its placement.
- Placed on the extreme resorbed maxilla with a typical flat palate. This, together with the non-axial placement of the zygomatic implants, makes it very common to encounter actual physical difficulty in placing radiographic intra-oral films properly in order to obtain standardized radiographs for measurement of crestal bone changes.

The above-mentioned features render it impossible to utilize the same success criteria used for conventional implants placed in the residual crest of the maxilla or mandible.

In conclusion, in the absence of specific criteria to determine success or failure of ZIs, we should understand that authors are reporting ZI rehabilitation results as either "implant failure" or simply "implant survival." In other words, the permanence of a ZI-supported prosthesis with no associated pain or infection cannot be associated with "implant success" unless additional different criteria for zygomatic implants are specified and validated (Fig. 1a, b).

The most common parameters and criteria currently being used to assess success of zygomatic rehabilitations are discussed below.

# Implant Stability

The presence of implant mobility is traditionally associated with a lack of osseointegration and is considered a failure criterion for conventional implants. By extension, the same criterion has been applied to zygomatic implants. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that zygomatic implants are not designed to be osseointegrated throughout their whole length. In addition, the surgical technique has evolved over time, looking for a positioning of the implant as anatomically feasible as possible. This concept, according to the ZAGA classification [17], places the implant on the crest or slightly buccally, so that sometimes the bone contact is limited to the lower lateral level of the maxillary wall and the zygoma bone itself. Eventually, when we submit non-axial forces to an externally placed zygomatic implant, or to a zygomatic bone of poor quality, we can observe a slight movement without it necessarily being associated with clinically important symptomatology or pathological sign. This movement is justified by the modulus of elasticity of the bone in counteracting the non-axial force that is exerted remotely on the head of a long implant that is anchored only at the level of the zygoma and subjected to bending stress. This movement of the head of the implant will disappear with the placement of the prosthesis superstructure and, in the absence of other symptoms, it is not considered as a complication.
In order to decide the appropriate healing period length after placement, Aparicio et al. proposed in 1993, 2006, and 2012 the measurement of the stability of the zygomatic implant to be tested individually by the Periotest device [3, 18, 19]. Clinical mobility was manually tested and used as the sole criterion of success in the first follow-up of consecutive patients treated with zygomatic implants reported by Malevez et al. in 2003 [20]. They recognize the impossibility of using parameters of success of conventional implants like X-rays and highlight the lack of value of the OPG. Later, Zwahlen et al. in 2006 [21], Davó et al. 2008 [22], and Bedrossian in 2010 [23] proposed the absence of rotational movement of the implant as an essential criterion of stability and related it to survival/success of the implant. Rotational stability has been examined in different ways such as manual tests, reverse torque, or tightening of the abutment screw at different degrees of torque. Rotational movement of a ZI is a failure criterion and justifies the removal of the implant.

Numerous publications focus on spontaneous pain at the zygomatic level, associated with lateral or rotational movement when chewing or in response to the percussion of the implant. Frequently, the absence of pain is included as a criterion of success in the evaluation of zygomatic implants [21, 23-26].

# Peri-implant Soft Tissue Status

Attention has been paid to peri-ZI implant soft tissue stability, specifically to those extra-maxillary placed implants. The presence of inflammation or local soft tissue infection related to the mucosa around the zygomatic implants may lead to extensive cellulitis or simply cause local pain and difficulty in completing successful prosthetic work or for implant maintenance. In the next paragraphs, different aspects of peri-ZI implant soft tissue issue are discussed (Fig. 2a, b).

# Peri-implant Parameters

The relevance of periodontal indices applied to the peri-implant evaluation of conventional implants [7] has been questioned. Their use in ZI-based rehabilitation may be even less successful. The clinician must take into account the differences between ZIs and conventional implants placed in pristine bone. For different anatomical reasons, the coronal area of the ZI can be completely surrounded by bone or surrounded almost exclusively by mucosa as seen with extra maxillary implants in maxillary type 4 ZAGA [17]. In addition, bone probing on the buccal side of a zygomatic implant head placed obliquely with medium inclinations of about  $55^{\circ}$  is not possible. The probe will stop at the implant body itself instead of at the height of crestal bone. If the implant is placed with a palatal entrance, the measurement of soft tissue height at palatal position will be deeper than the buccal one with no clinical significance. Additionally, the multiple variations between ZI design used today

![](images/bd332124679d5331b3fa658a17acfc8998e7272253f984fada7ec8aae83dbf1d.jpg)
In the scientific literature, repeated attempts to apply periodontal measurements in the use of ZI as if they were natural teeth have been conducted. Al-Nawas et al. [24] evaluated soft tissues around ZI and proposed to include peri-implant alterations as success criteria. As it may be expected on a palatal-entrance implant, different probing depths were found from the palatal side to the buccal side. The authors stated, "In our study, the pocket probing depth is increased even in absence of bleeding and in absence of pathological microbial colonization. This makes a noninfectious cause of the probable soft tissue alteration."

Maló et al. [27] considered as secondary criteria of success the following factors: the modified bleeding index (mBI); suppuration (Sup); probing pocket depths (PPD) assessed with a  $0.25\mathrm{Ncm}$  calibrated plastic periodontal probe; and mucosal signal efficacy evaluation index (MSEE). During probing of an implant, the probe should follow the implant surface. The orientation of an angulated implant head could thus affect the measurements. Indeed, the probe would hit the implant body, especially if inflammation is present. Nevertheless, the authors stressed that none of these parameters was different from those found with conventional implants.

# The Absence of Soft Tissue Inflammation or Local Infection

Attention has also been paid to the presence of inflammation or local infection related to the mucosa around the ZI. Stiévenart and Malevez [28] reported patients who presented inflammation around the prosthetic abutments due to problems with hygiene maintenance. Becktor et al. [29], in a study of 16 subjects and 31 zygomatic implants, observed that nine subjects had local peri-implant infection problems in ZI. Five out of the nine subjects had a fistula and local infection around the ZI, and four out of five had a fistula bilaterally. It must be taken into account that the entrance of the implant was made through the palate where an inflammatory reaction of the fatty tissue is frequent upon contact with the abutment. Their study takes into account the evaluation of gingival problems in ZI and, although it describes the findings of the cases described, it does not propose criteria for the evaluation of success in this clinical aspect.

Landes et al. [30] suggested inflammation as criteria of success when describing the extreme case of five osseointegrated implants from two subjects that had to be explanted due to chronic soft tissue inflammation that prevented connection of the prosthetic abutment.

A retrospective study of ZI carried out by Maló et al. [27] proposes the absence of complications as survival criterion. These authors evaluate the presence of three types of complications:

- Biological complications: soft tissue inflammation, fistula formation, pain, or maxillary sinus infections.
- Aesthetic complications: aesthetic complaints of the patient or dentist.
- Functional complications: phonetic, masticatory, comfort, or hygienic complaints.

In that study, Maló et al. reported four subjects with sinusitis out of 18 subjects who attended the follow-up of 1 year, yielding a sinus complication rate of  $22.2\%$ . Remarkably, they did not take sinus infection into account claiming a  $98.5\%$  survival rate after the first year.

# Soft Tissue Stability

One concern with the extra-sinus technique may be the long-term effect of the exposed implant surface toward the soft tissue on the lateral aspect of the zygomatic implants. Lekholm and colleagues [31] reported findings from a retrospective study involving 27 subjects with 38 test machined implants (with exposed threads at surgery) and 30 control machined implants (fully submerged with no threads exposed). Clinical and radiographic results demonstrated that marginal defects and fenestrations present at the time of fixture insertion did not lead to progressive bone loss during the first 5 years of function. Furthermore, Becktor and colleagues [29] stated that sinusitis is more often related to oro-antral communications rather than to exposed implant threads per se. Carmagnola et al. [32] examined bone tissue alterations that occurred around implants at which the crestal level of bone support at fixture placement was different at buccal and lingual surfaces. The findings from the histomorphometric measurements demonstrated that the number of bone multicellular units per  $\mathrm{mm}^2$  ( $n\mathrm{BMU} / \mathrm{mm}^2$ ) was about ten times larger in the bone tissue at the test sites than at the control sites. Since BMUs are considered as indicators of bone activity, they demonstrate that, even after 7 months of healing, the process of remodeling was much more active in the test than in the control regions. The crystal bone level of osseointegration tended to become similar at the buccal and lingual surfaces of the test implants. The analysis of the soft tissues at the test and control implants revealed that bone tissue remodeling in the test group was accompanied by a certain amount of recession of the peri-implant mucosal margin.
Soft tissue dehiscence leads to both partial exposure of the implant and uncovering of the thin bone layer between the neck of the implant and the sinus cavity. The exposed bone remodels more actively over time and usually is a painless situation. If the condition persists in this critical area of minimum bone thickness, a sinus communication may appear. Due to the retention of a bacterial film, which is increased in implants characterized with threads or rough surfaces, chronic soft tissue inflammation might be increased: Bone remodeling and appearance of subsequent complications can be accelerated.

An uncertainty raised by Carmagnola et al. [32] is the long-term effect on mucosal stability that an extra-sinus implant contacting/compressing the peri-implant mucosa may have. Another aspect introduced by Aparicio's group [33] is the long-term repercussions on oral hygiene, and therefore on gingival health, which causes partial exposure of the ZI. The same group proposed, for the first time, to include the stability of the soft tissue around the implant as a specific parameter when determining the success or failure of a ZI [33]. The extra-maxillary location of the ZI involves direct contact of the implant body with the mucoperiosteal flap. Compression of the soft tissue by the ZI body would be influenced by how much residual tension of the soft tissue is created during postsurgery healing, and how significantly the implant is protruding to the buccal side. Pressure on the soft tissue by the ZI body may compromise soft tissue vascularization, which introduces the risk of fenestration of the mucosa and the exposure of the implant head/body.

In this regard, Miglioranza et al. [34] presented short-term clinical results of a retrospective follow-up of at least 12 months of 150 extra-sinus zygomatic implants in which they indicated the event of vestibular dehiscence at the level of the cervical portion with exposure of two threads, without signs of inflammation at that level, in two implants considered survivors.

![](images/74a25e9f845a272c0f5e53d814119d795b7509bfcdac13c8359feed2b29f6689.jpg)

Based on these data, the exposure of the implant body should not be associated, per se, with ZI failure. However, it is clear that soft tissue dehiscence exposing the implant body does make hygiene difficult and may lead to additional complications such as sinus communications, aesthetic complaints, mucositis, or cellulitis which can even reach the orbit (Fig. 2a, b). Currently, there is a tendency for the use of ZI incorporating the original mechanized surfaces at the coronal part and rough surfaces at the apex. Newly designed implants have removed or reduced threads in the body and the cervical third of the implant. These features may prevent or diminish gingival recession and facilitate hygiene should an implant become exposed (Fig. 3).

# Radiographic Examination

In conventional implant dentistry therapy, one reference test to evaluate the success of an implant is crestal bone-level measurement using periapical radiography with a parallelization technique. According to Malevez in 2003 [35], the periapical technique is impossible to be applied in a standardized way in the zygomatic patient, given the inclined position of the implant and the common decrease of the palatal curvature experienced by the atrophic maxilla. In the same study, Malevez et al. emphasize the limited value of an orthopantomogram (OPG) in the determination of implant success. However, the utility of OPG can be justified in the preoperative period as a general initial assessment. Postoperatively, it can be used to locate the distribution of the implants and see prosthetic data in a generic way, but it is not effective to monitor the evolution of the implant or its relationship with the zygomatic bone or to identify ZI-associated radiolucency. Scientific studies that base their results on the radiographic examination of serial OPGs over time are questionably designed.

For research purposes, Aparicio et al. in 2008 [36] proposed the use of a preoperative TAC or CBCT to evaluate the sinus, the anatomical shape of the anterior wall

![](images/2af8e6e0ef87a9d290286da1027044fe4deb766aac6334abf0e2e0ea6be99f2a.jpg)

![](images/f032a8cd87380f70e405f0254adc0775f875d50c48455a1afb7ebdb0a5dab7d7.jpg)

of the maxilla, the degree of maxillary atrophy, and to identify any additional pathologies (Fig. 4). Postoperatively, they recommend a follow-up CBCT 1 year after surgery and every 5 years thereafter in order to report on the health of the maxillary sinus (Fig. 4b).

# Prosthesis Evaluation

The ultimate justification for the placement of implants is the fastening of a functional prosthesis. As per conventional implants, the successful anchoring of the prosthesis has also been included to assess the success or survival of ZI in different studies [22, 37-39].

During the period from 2004 through 2008, Bothur and Garsten [40] investigated the speech quality of subjects treated with a fixed dental prosthesis (FDP) supported by multiple ZIs. They concluded that a mild deterioration in speech can be anticipated in patients subjected to treatment with an FDP supported by multiple ZIs if the ZIs emerge in a palatal position. No information is provided about how much palatal positioning is tolerated, if any.

Although some authors have considered aesthetics as a criterion of success, very few authors have highlighted differences between the evaluation of the prosthetic result in conventional implants and that obtained using ZIs. In this context, Becktor et al. [29] measured the palatal position of the ZI determining the distance between the nearest buccal cusp of the final rehabilitation and the center of the prosthetic screw of the ZI. All the implants were placed following a trans-sinus technique and the measurements were taken as descriptive data of the study without including it in the criteria of success. They described an average distance of  $11.2\mathrm{mm}$  (range  $4 - 15\mathrm{mm}$ ) between the head of the trans-sinus ZI and the nearest vestibular cusp.
With the purpose of evaluating the differences and advantages of the trans-sinus technique and the extra-sinus technique regarding prosthetic emergence profiles, Carmagnola et al. [32] proposed an objective and specific criterion to measure the prosthetic result of a zygomatic-related rehabilitation. The distance from the middle of the ZI head, with no abutment, to the center of the residual alveolar ridge following the ZAGA methodology was measured and compared with the position of ZI placed using the conventional trans-sinus technique (Fig. 5a). The average

# Zygoma Implant-Associated Sinus Pathology

The absence of sinus infection is generally accepted as a specific success criterion for ZIs. Most authors recognize that rhinosinusitis can be a problem associated with ZI treatment and that it may emerge at any stage of treatment, even after a long period of follow-up. Different authors have reported recurrent maxillary sinusitis in subjects after placement of ZIs. A variety of reasons have been suggested for sinusitis to occur, such as lack of bone implant contact at the level of sinus entry caused by inaccurate osteotomy or contamination through the abutment screw of the abutment; soft tissue infection causing bone remodeling; implant-probing destroying a weak hemidesmosomal junction of the soft tissues; rupture of the sinus membrane at the implant entrance level together with lack of bone sealing; or the shape of the window used as responsible for membrane integrity maintenance. Nevertheless, unless a clear sinusoral communication is present, it is generally not possible to clarify the etiology of maxillary sinusitis or whether or not it is associated with ZI surgery. Usually, rhinosinusitis responds to medical or specific surgical endoscopic treatment without leading to complete failure of the ZI [18, 20, 21, 23, 29, 38, 41-43].

Although there is no consensus on how to report rhinosinus status, the term used to describe the sinus pathology in most of the studies using ZI is "sinusitis," without clarifying the type, the associated signs and symptoms, or whether a CT scan or endoscopy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. For these reasons, often, it is not possible to gather sufficient useful detail of the sinus status described.

In 2008, Davó et al. [44] used a computerized postoperative radiological examination of the sinus including three observations:

- Radiolucency/sinus opacity.
- Increase in the thickness of the Schneiderian membrane and height/level of the osteo-meatal complex.
- Presence/absence of macroscopic oro-antral communication.

In 2013, Aparicio el al [19]. proposed a System to Report Rhino-sinusitis Diagnosis in Patients with Zygomatic Implants. Data were reported in the same way as ear, nose, and throat (ENT) literature for conventional patients (Lanza-Kennedy, Lund-Mackay, Tables 1 and 2), with some particularities. According to the "Task Force on Rhinosinusitis Criteria for the Diagnosis of Rhinosinusitis," two or more clinical symptoms must be present for the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). A definitive diagnosis of CRS requires objective confirmation of disease either by nasal endoscopy or by sinus computed tomography (CT) scanning because objective documentation of mucosal inflammation is required.

Lund-Mackay staging worksheet. Each region is scored as 0, 1 or 2. (0 represents no abnormality; 1 represents partial opacification; and 2 represents total opacification). The osteomeatal complex can only be scored as 0 or 2. The minimum possible score is 0 (negative computed tomography) and the maximum score is 24. A normal or "negative" scan is defined as any scan with a Lund-Mackay score of 0. Any scan with a score  $>0$  is considered an abnormal or "positive" scan. Total score is calculated by the addition of the scores of all regions plus the osteomeatal complex.

From Lanza and Kennedy [49]

CT scans include sinus ostial narrowing or obstruction, sinus mucosal thickening or opacification, and, less commonly, air-fluid levels in the sinuses. Based on those recommendations, Aparicio el al. assessed the sinus health radiographically and clinically according to the Lund-Mackay system and the Lanza and Kennedy survey recommended by the Task Force on Rhinosinusitis for research outcomes.

# Self-Administered Questionnaire

To assess the success of ZI therapy, different questionnaires have been applied with the intention of measuring patient satisfaction/quality of life (QOL). One problem with satisfaction/QOL tests is that it is difficult to establish the threshold from which a treatment should be considered successful or unsuccessful. Ideally, there would be a weighting system that accounts for the value of each factor involved in patient satisfaction. In any case, assessing treatment success should be based on objective criteria and, if possible, estimate the prognosis of the rehabilitation [19, 30, 45-47].

# ORIS Criteria and the Zygoma Success Code (Revisited)

Considering the success criteria used to assess conventional and zygomatic implants, as well as the differences between both types of implants, the authors propose four objective and differential criteria for ZIs with respect to conventional implants. These criteria, which will allow the condition of the implant to be evaluated by establishing the degree of success and distinguishing it from failure or mere survival, are:

- Offset of the prostheses.
- Rhinosinus status.
- Infection-condition of the soft tissue.
- Stability (individually tested).

ORIS is the acronym of Offset, Rhinosinusitis, Infection and Stability. ORIS is also a term from Latin origins with a broad meaning covering the face, the mouth, pronunciation, speech, and facial expression. We chose it as a mnemonic tool because it covers all four criteria for the long-term success of a single ZI.

When evaluating the ZI, we may assess 5 possible conditions on each criterion.

- Success condition grade I: Represents the optimal stage.
- Success condition grade II: Represents a sub-optimal clinical situation but without clinical impact.
- Success condition grade III: Represents a questionable implant with alterations that have clinical impact but which are capable of being resolved successfully.
- Condition IV: Represents a surviving implant that supports a prosthesis but has not been measured according to the proposed criteria.
- Condition V: Represents implant failure.

To classify an implant, we will take the worst condition in one of the criteria, with grade V being the worst. For instance, a ZI would be a failure if one of the criteria is assessed belonging to condition V, no matter if the rest of the criteria are considered as belonging to condition I.

# Criterion O (Offset)

The possibility of fixing and maintaining a prosthesis is a common success criterion for conventional and zygomatic implants. One difference of ZI therapy compared to the conventional implant therapy is the possibility of the emergence of the ZI in a palatal or buccal position that does not align with the residual bone crest. A bulky dental bridge at the palatal aspect sometimes leads to discomfort, speech problems, and problems with oral hygiene. For precise reporting on prosthesis success, anatomic measurements to assess the position of the head of the ZI with regard to the middle of the crest of the alveolar ridge in the horizontal axial dimension should be included. A positive value of implant head position to the alveolar ridge relationship indicates a palatal position of the implant, whereas a negative value indicates a buccal emergency. A negative value indicates an implant placed with no contact with the buccal bone at the head level. This situation will probably induce soft tissue dehiscences (Table 3).

Using postsurgery CBCT, images in the coronal and horizontal axial planes are obtained for each of the ZI studied. Special emphasis is devoted to assessing and storing the axial plane in order to relate the ZI head position to the residual alveolar crest on each side. Anatomical measurements are performed to assess the position of the head of the ZI with regard to the epicenter of the crest of the alveolar ridge in the horizontal axial dimension. Measurement 1 indicates the distance between the palate edge to the crest midpoint. Measurement 2 indicates the distance between the palate halfway point to the implant head center. Measurement 3 [1, 2] indicates the distance between the middle of the palate to the implant head epicenter. A positive value on this implant head position to the alveolar ridge relationship indicates a palatal position of the implant, whereas a negative value indicates a buccal emergency [33].

# Criterion R (Rhinosinus Status)

In the dental literature, there is no consensus on how to report a rhinosinusitis diagnosis. A system to report rhinosinusitis diagnosis in patients with ZI is proposed. Essentially, the sinus health should be clinically and radiographically assessed as recommended by the Task Force on Rhinosinusitis for research outcomes according to Lund-Mackay (L-M) system [48] and according to Lanza and Kennedy (L-K) survey [49].

According to L-M, each CBCT test includes six regions: anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, maxillary, frontal, sphenoid, and osteomeatal complex. Each region is independently scored for both the left and right side, so a total of 12 regions are evaluated. Each region is independently scored for both the left and right side, so a total of 12 regions are evaluated. Each region is given a score of 0, 1, or 2. Where 0 represents normality/no opacification, 1 represents partial opacification, and 2 represents total opacification. The osteomeatal complex can only be scored 0 or 2. Total scores range from 0 to 24. A normal or "negative" scan is defined as any scan with an L-M score of 0, whereas a scan with a score  $>0$  is considered an abnormal or "positive" scan (Table 1).

Description of the specific criteria (ORIS) classifying zygomatic implants as successful in grades I-II-III (Conditions I-III), survival (Condition IV) or failed (Condition V). The green color indicates success, orange is for survival, and the red color is considered unacceptable (implant failure). Zygomatic implants are evaluated for each criterion of success. The condition of the implant is determined by the worst condition of the four ORIS criteria (i.e., O—1/R—3/I—2/S—4 would be classified as Survival) aORIS is a term from Latin origins with a broad meaning covering the face, the mouth, the pronunciation, the speech and the facial expression. We chose it as a mnemonic tool because it covers all four criteria to evaluate the long-term success of single zygomatic implants bProsthetic offset: distance from the center of the implant head to the center of the residual alveolar ridge. Positive values correspond to zygomatic implants placed palatal and negative values correspond to zygomatic implants placed buccally to the alveolar crest

$^{\mathrm{c}}$ L-K is the Lanza and Kennedy clinical evaluation according to Table 2. ML-M is the Modified Lund-Mackay radiological test evaluated as negative when no increased opacity is observed between the postsurgical L-M score and the presurgical L-M score (CBCT)
$^{\mathrm{d}}$ Peri-Implant soft tissue examination is performed attending to visual manifestation of recession and or mucosal inflammation (detected on swelling, redness or bleeding when slightly impressed), probing must be avoided. Peri-Implant soft tissue infection is diagnosed when a purulent exudation is observed spontaneously or by means of applying finger pressure to the peri-Implant soft tissue complex. Patient non-acceptance of the soft tissue aesthetic condition might fall into condition V

The authors have modified the Lund-Mackay (ML-M) system to report its value over time. The modified L-M thus requires at least a presurgical and a postsurgical cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The ML-M final score will be given by the comparison between post- and presurgical CBCT scores. An increase in the score over time is an indication of potential rhinosinus complications and will be classified as ML-M (+). A decrease or a constant value over time will be classified as ML-M (-).

According to L-K clinical criteria, diagnosis of sinusitis requires a "yes" answer in two or more major criteria, one major and two or more minor criteria, or purulence on nasal examination (Table 2). If clinical symptoms or radiological changes are sporadic and respond positively to treatment, they may still represent an implant in a successful condition.

# Criterion I (Peri-implant Soft Tissue Condition)

Peri-implant soft tissue condition is a key factor for the success of ZI rehabilitation and must be reported. It can be critically discussed whether or not inflammation necessarily indicates disease. The presence of inflammation is, in fact, a normal finding around oral implants as pointed out by Donath et al. [50] and Albrektsson et al. [51]. Oral implants display an inevitable chronic inflammation that cannot be regarded as indicative of so-called mucositis disease. However, the presence of visual soft tissue inflammatory or exudative signs must be reported. Soft tissue dehiscences and their evolution should also be reported in prospective studies. Photographs, using a reference scale, are recommended to assess the stability or eventual progression of soft tissue recession. As discussed previously, use of a dental probe around ZI is not recommended for different anatomical and technical reasons.
The presence of asymptomatic peri-implant soft tissue, without visual clinical changes of inflammation or infection, together with the absence of recession at vestibular level, is classified as a success condition I. The presence of vestibular recession, with stable implant body exposure in time, in the absence of symptoms or signs of inflammation or soft tissue infection, is considered success condition II. The presence of either symptoms related to inflammatory changes or gingival infectious exudates, responding positively to treatment, or the presence of nonstable gingival recession, is considered as success grade III. The persistence or recurrence of inflammatory symptoms associated with recession implies the consideration of failure or condition IV. Finally, patient complaints regarding an unacceptable and persistent aesthetic situation due to the exposure of the implant may cause this implant to be classified also as condition V.

# Criterion S (Stability [Individually Tested])

Different degrees of implant stability can be found when any single ZI is individually tested. Occasionally, slight mobility may be detected with no other associated pathological signs when implants are placed outside the sinus or in poor-quality zygomatic bone. In other words, despite either the presence of clinically tested bone anchorage or the absence of rotation, certain painless mobility may be identified when the implant is laterally loaded by a remotely applied force due to the elastic modulus of the anchoring zygomatic bone. In any case, neither a rotational movement nor pain must be present. The movement should disappear when multiple implants are splinted together. All rotational implant movements should be considered a sign of implant failure (Table 3) whether or not accompanied by the presence of pain.

# Conclusions

Currently, the manner in which results and complications of ZI are reported in the literature is inconsistent and lacks a standardized approach. There have been no clear criteria to specifically describe the zygomatic implant rehabilitation outcomes and assess to what extent they indicate a particular level of success or risk. Moreover, in a similar manner, there is a tendency to improperly validate, and subsequently use, the same diagnostic methods to evaluate the status of teeth and regular oral implants, and there is a tendency to consider and evaluate a zygomatic implant in the same way as a regular implant placed on pristine alveolar bone. However, zygomatic implants differ from conventional ones in biomechanics, clinical procedures, outcomes, and eventual complications. Zygomatic implants are associated with resorptive changes in both alveolar and basal bone that make the use of conventional criteria unsuitable to describe implant outcome. Indeed, inter-differences related to the zygomatic surgical protocol employed may be found and should be noticed.
The authors propose the use of four specific and objective criteria to systematically describe the outcome of zygomatic implants. The ORIS acronym is the suggested name for the new criteria: (1) Offset: evaluation of prosthetic success based on final positioning of the zygomatic implant with respect to the center of the alveolar crest in the horizontal dimension. (2) Rhinosinus status report: a pre-, and postsurgical cone-beam computed tomography comparative approach to evaluate whether sinuses are healthy; a clinical questionnaire where "yes" and "no" answers can be given. (3) Infection permanence related to dehiscence: an evaluation of soft tissue signs of infection or dehiscence on a grading scale based on reference photographs. (4) Stability report: accepting as criteria of success some mobility until dis-osseointegration signs of rotation or apical pain present.
