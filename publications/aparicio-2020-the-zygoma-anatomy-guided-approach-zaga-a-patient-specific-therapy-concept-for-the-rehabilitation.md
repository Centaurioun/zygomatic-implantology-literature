# The Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach: ZAGA—A Patient-Specific Therapy Concept for the Rehabilitation of the Atrophic Maxilla

Carlos Aparicio

# Introduction

When patients present with either an atrophic or a resected maxilla, lack of bone may prevent the use of conventional endosseous implants. The rehabilitation of severe maxillary atrophy is a key indication for the placement of zygomatic implants [1-11]. Clearly, from a surgical point of view, the treatment of the extremely atrophic maxilla using four zygomatic implants is much more complex than treatment with conventional implants placed in pristine bone. In most cases, the patient suffering from severe atrophy in his upper jaw will have a single chance to replace his/her missing teeth with a fixed prosthesis anchored by zygomatic implants. Therefore, the treatment of maxillary atrophy with zygomatic implants must be performed by a trained expert, as it must be successful on the first attempt.

As of today, clinical experience and data from follow-up studies [12-18] support a new approach named the Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA) that is able to overcome the shortcomings of both the original technique and the extrasinus technique. The ZAGA Concept standardizes the procedure and guides the clinician towards an ideal prosthetic implant position for anchorage, appropriate load distribution and adequate emergence of the implant head, while also attaining critical long-term goals of correct sinus sealing and soft tissue stability.

The purpose of this chapter is to share the accumulated experience rehabilitating patients with extreme maxillary atrophy using the ZAGA approach. In addition to the clinical aspects, we present a concept: Zygoma ZAGA Centers network, aiming at disseminating knowledge about the ZAGA methodology among professionals and patients for safe and predictable rehabilitation of severely atrophied maxillae. The general objective is double: first to provide the professional with tools and training to adequately apply the ZAGA methodology and accomplish the successful treatment of severe maxillary atrophy. Second, our goal is to inform the eventual patient population of the benefits and technical possibilities achievable by the ZAGA Concept.
# Techniques for Zygomatic Implant Placement

# The Original Brænemark Protocol

The original surgical technique (OST) described by P-I Brænemark describes a palatal entrance and an intra-sinus path for the implant body (Fig. 1). An antrostomy on the superior level of the maxillary wall is also recommended for visual control of zygomatic implant placement and preservation of the sinus membrane. This often results in an imprecise osteotomy that does match the final implant position well. Besides, the size of the osteotomy is important if it is to be used as a window for visual control of the drilling procedure. This leads to the creation of a weak point with regard to implant-to-bone sealing and sinus protection. Moreover, in patients with pronounced buccal concavities on the lateral aspect of the maxillary sinus, the use of an intra-sinus path leads to undesirable palatal emergence of the implant head. As a consequence, the final prosthesis is too bulky and difficult to maintain.

# First Variations of the Original Technique

In 2000, Stella and Warner [19] and, subsequently, Peñarrocha et al. [20] described the sinus slot technique, which makes use of a slot window through the buttress wall of the maxilla for guidance and control of implant insertion. The authors promoted zygomatic implant placement using local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation. The importance of placing the zygoma platform directly over the alveolar ridge and recommendations on how to address the most atrophic maxillae were discussed for the first time. The Stella and Warner technique represented a significant enhancement of the original zygomatic implant placement technique. However, as the sinus slot osteotomy is performed prior to implant drilling as a separate procedure, it prevents a precise matching of the implant surface to the sinus slot bone preparation. Moreover, in instances when the anatomy of the sinus wall is very concave, there is no need to prepare a slot. An intact maxillary wall may be left instead (Fig. 2).

Boyes-Varley and colleagues presented in 2003 [21] a modification of the original surgical approach with the goals of achieving better access to the surgical area and decreasing postoperative morbidity. Further, they described an appliance to be used intraoperatively to help to accurately locate the initial drill preparation site as far laterally as possible into the alveolar ridge. Their technique introduced a new implant design that aimed to improve the fit and stability of zygomatic implants. Miglioranza and colleagues [22, 23] described in Portuguese, in 2006 and 2007, a technique and its results to place zygomatic implants in an exteriorized manner. Publishing in an international magazine [24], Miglioranza and colleagues described the retrospective results of the exteriorized technique in 2011. In 2008, Malo and colleagues [25] reported results from a pilot study to rehabilitate the severely atrophic maxilla using extra-maxillary anchored implants. The technique attempted to overcome sinus complications by using a new  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter partially threaded implant design anchored on the zygomatic bone only. However, Malo et al. reported an incident of sinusitis of  $22\%$  based on 4 patients suffering from sinus infection out of the 18 patients who underwent the 1-year follow-up evaluation.

At the Europerio 2005 meeting, the Aparicio Clinic group introduced a new extra-sinus surgery approach for placement of zygomatic implants. Subsequently, they reported in 2006 [12] and in 2008 [13, 14] the 1- and 3-year results, respectively, of a prospective study reporting the outcome of their extra-sinus approach when placing zygomatic implants in concave maxillae. To obtain implant head emergence at the centre of the residual alveolar crest, drilling was performed from the palatal side of the crest towards the zygomatic bone. No prior antrostomy or slot is performed and sinus membrane integrity is not taken into account at zygomatic entrance. As a result, the zygomatic implant enters from the palate side of the premolar/molar crest and emerges through the lateral maxillary sinus wall close to the sinus ground/maxillary basal bone. The implant takes an extra-sinus or extra-maxillary path and sometimes engages the lateral sinus wall. Finally, the implant apex penetrates the zygomatic bone and its tip appears in the superior part of the zygomatic arch (Fig. 1a, b). For the first time, measurements of distances between the centre of the crest and the centre of the implant head were recorded. The mean distances using their new extra-sinus approach and classical approach were  $3.8\mathrm{mm}$  and  $11.2\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively. In addition, all patients but one received a fixed immediate prosthesis within  $24\mathrm{h}$  after surgery. The mean Periotest values after implant placement were lower (i.e., higher stability) than in a previous study using zygomatic implants with a two-stage technique. However, neither a clear protocol describing the criteria used to establish the entrance point nor the implant path was described.
# The Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA)

# Rationale

In 2011 [15], this author was able to classify, into five different types, anatomical differences found in 200 sites belonging to 100 patients. By using specific criteria to establish the implant path according to patient anatomy, Aparicio proposed an evolution of his extra-sinus technique through creation of the Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA) protocol [16]. The ZAGA Concept offers clinicians a standardized guiding mechanism to obtain an ideal prosthetic position for anchorage, load distribution and emergence of the implant head while also achieving long-term correct sinus sealing and soft tissue stability. The rationale for the ZAGA method is to provide individualized treatment for a patient based on his/her unique anatomical presentation. Following on, different types of implant design may be used according to the anatomical variation.
# Procedure

With this novel approach, the preparation of the implant site is guided by the anatomy of the area. For an optimal prosthetic outcome, the coronal entrance point at the level of the alveolar process is determined according to prosthetic, biomechanical and anatomical parameters. Next, the apical zygomatic entrance point is identified based on the desired number and length of the implant(s) and the anatomy of the zygomatic bone. Finally, the implant trajectory defined by these two points determines the preparation and pathway of the implant body. Thus, depending both on the zygomatic buttress and on the intraoral starting point of the zygomatic implant, the path of the implant body may vary from a total intra-sinus to a total extra-sinus one.

# Benefits

Usually, no previous antrostomy is required for this purpose. However, correct flap design to include the posterior maxillary wall and the superior zygomatic rim for adequate exposure of the area is needed to control and perform the drilling procedure. Since no reflection of the sinus membrane is necessary, the procedure is considerably less time-consuming than the original technique. Using the ZAGA protocol, a precise osteotomy that usually includes the perforation of the anterior maxillary-zygomatic cortex twice is achieved (Fig. 2). Better implant stability, improved bone-to-implant contact and enhanced bone sealing also result. This approach has yielded several advantages in the long run, for example, less invasive and shorter surgery, improved function and aesthetics, and reduced risk for maxillary sinus pathology [17].

# The ZAGA Surgical Procedure

Pre-surgical analysis with the ZAGA protocol is identical to the one described in the original surgical technique. Patients can be treated under general anaesthesia or intravenous sedation with local anaesthesia. The patient receives antibiotics (amoxicillin  $35\mathrm{mg / kg}$ ) in a single dose  $1\textrm{h}$  prior to surgery. If mandibular teeth are present,  $750~\mathrm{mg}$  of amoxicillin every  $8\mathrm{h}$  for 7 days starting on the day of surgery is prescribed.

A slightly bevelled palatal incision is performed from the posterior external palatal side of the tuberosity to the midline. An ascending vertical vestibular-releasing incision is made until the nose is identified. The incision aims to prevent eventual soft tissue dehiscence by allowing displacing enough connective tissue from the palatal to the buccal (Fig. 3). Using modified dissectors (Bontempi ZAGA kit), a muco-periosteal flap is raised to expose the alveolar crest, the infraorbital nerve and the lateral and posterior walls of the maxilla up to the superior rim of the zygomatic arch. A hemi-maxillary flap is recommended for less traumatic placement of unilateral zygomatic implants. In cases where regular implants are to be placed below the nose cavity, it is advisable to raise the floor of the nose floor to protect the integrity of its mucosa (Fig. 4a, b). A modified retractor (Bontempi ZAGA kit) provided with a distal hook is anchored on the superior rim of the zygomatic arch (Fig. 5) for three purposes:

1. To ensure good visibility of the zygomatic bone and its limits
2. To help the surgeon visualize the correct implant direction
3. To protect soft tissues during the most apical second perforation of the anterior zygomatic cortex

# ZAGA Steps and Criteria to Determine Optimal Implant Position

When performing an osteotomy for zygomatic or regular implant placement, the goal is to achieve an implant bed fitting as closely as possible to the implant shape without damaging neighbouring structures. By matching the osteotomy with the direction of the implant (Fig. 6a–e), we will eliminate the need for a lateral window and preserve as much bone as possible both at the crest and at the maxillary lateral wall. As for regular implants placed in pristine crestal bone, the zygomatic implant itself is responsible for closing the osteotomy. When this happens, the need to perform grafts disappears and the surgery becomes minimally invasive.

With the previous statement in mind, a three-step method to choose the ideal position for the implant right after the incision and elevation of the muco-periosteal flap, and following the ZAGA guidelines, is described:

1. Decide the optimal position of the head of the implant at the coronal level
2. Determine the entry point at the zygomatic bone
3. Join the two previously described points

Each of the steps is carried out according to criteria defined below.

# The Oral Coronal Implant Location

The procedure for implant placement begins by determining the intraoral coronal entrance position dictated by prosthetic, biomechanical and anatomical considerations. Since the ultimate goal is as natural a prosthesis as possible, the starting site (implant head emergence) should be at or near the top of the crest of the alveolar ridge (Fig. 7) to attain an aesthetic and minimally bulky prosthesis design. Such a prosthesis does not interfere with the tongue, thus preventing phonetic problems and is easy for the patient to clean. To achieve mid-crystal implant head emergence, it is quite common that the entrance spot is located on the palatal side of the alveolar ridge. To make a final decision regarding the position of the implant

To achieve desired load distribution and minimal cantilever length, a mesial-distal entrance at the level of the second premolar/first molar regions is preferred when two zygomatic implants are to be placed. To avoid extensive distal and mesial cantilevers when four zygomatic implants are used, the position of the anterior implant will be approximately between the canine and the lateral teeth (Fig. 8). The placement of parallel and or too close zygomatic implants should be avoided. This unfavourable location is typically forced by the use of, too wide,  $5\mathrm{mm}$  diameter implant designs preventing optimal zygomatic implant distribution [25].

Zygomatic implants should be used in areas where there is no bone left for stabilization of traditional implants. Mesial-distal variations on zygomatic implant position according to pristine bone distribution should be considered. It is possible that a lack of pristine bone is located in the anterior maxilla instead of the typical

The buccal-palatal position of the implant in relation to the residual alveolar bone is mainly determined by two factors:

Vertical and horizontal resorption of the alveolar/basal process
- Anterior maxillary wall curvature

With this in mind, the initial preparation is performed from the palatal side of the bone crest when enough bone is found (Fig. 10). If more severe resorption is observed, the first osteotomy is performed on the buccal side of the remaining ridge (Fig. 11). The degree of bone resorption and the anatomy at the crest level will determine the final contour of the coronal entrance point. The ZAGA philosophy intends to prevent
- Risk for early or late sinus communication
- Risk of soft tissue recession around the implant head/body

Both possibilities are tightly related to the nature, the condition, and the position of the initial osteotomy. For instance, if a palatal or crestal osteotomy is performed through thin bone (i.e.  $< 2 \mathrm{~mm}$  in thickness), an oral-sinus communication may appear over time. This lack or late loss of bone/soft tissue sealing around the implant entrance may be due, among other reasons, to:

- Mismatch between the initial osteotomy and implant diameter
- Late bone resorption around the implant due to an infective process
- Inadequate use of hygiene instruments (like water jet directed towards the implant to soft tissue junction)
- Genetic tendency and history of periodontitis
- Tobacco consumption
Physiological bone atrophic process

To avoid soft tissue recession, care should be taken to not place the implant too far buccally and too separate from crestal bone, as the implant body may compress the soft tissue. Such a buccal implant position may compromise the permeability of soft tissue vascularization and lead to muco-gingival dehiscence. This side effect may be of special importance when dealing with an extremely atrophic maxilla where implant sealing, at least on its buccal side, is attained only by soft tissue (Fig. 12a-d).

In our experience, the surgeon must consider that when one of the aforementioned complications (iatrogenic sinus infection/oro-sinus communication or soft tissue recession) is inevitable, the first priority is to prevent the sinus infection.

According to a previous statement, when maxillary atrophy type IV ZAGA is encountered, the sinus entrance is performed as close as possible to the apical entrance of the zygomatic bone. Moreover, a minimum trajectory of  $5 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  of residual bone and intact membrane at the crest level of the maxillary anterior wall must be preserved lateral to the implant neck (Fig. 13).

The ZAGA 0 to IV classification [15] (Fig. 14) establishes the relationship of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest area including options for various ZAGA implant paths. This classification helps the clinician to understand the possibility of finding not only inter-individual, but also intra-individual, anatomic variations. If residual bone at the sinus floor level is sufficient in thickness and width (minimum  $3\mathrm{mm}$  high  $\times 5\mathrm{mm}$  wide), and the patient has no periodontitis history, the entry point should be in a position close to the middle part of the crest with an intra-sinus starting path of the implant. If, on the other hand, the bone height/thickness at the crest level is smaller or the anterior maxillary wall is more concave, the alveolar entry should be displaced towards the buccal area. The osteotomy will be in the shape of a tunnel or a canal, depending on the height of the pristine bone and the concavity of the maxillary wall (Fig. 15a-c). The ultimate goal is to achieve an implant trajectory that:

1. displaces the antrostomy at least  $15\mathrm{mm}$  away from the coronal area of the implant (Fig. 13),
2. maintains at least  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of alveolar residual bone in contact with the neck of the implant (Fig. 13) and,
3. houses the implant body submerged as much as possible into the alveolar bone crest in such a way that it does not compress the soft tissue (Fig. 15c).

# Determination of the Apical Zygomatic Entrance Point

The zygomatic bone, when perforated two times on its facial cortical aspect, will provide the main anchorage for a zygomatic implant (Fig. 2c). In other words, whenever possible, an oblique lateralized implant path should be the goal. According to the ZAGA protocol, two factors are important when determining the anterior maxillary/zygomatic cortical entrance of the implant:

Number of implants to be placed
- Amount of zygomatic bone remaining above the apical threads of the implant (Fig. 16)

The main complications to be prevented at this stage are:

- Interfering with orbit fossa structures
- Iatrogenic fracture of the zygoma bone

Regarding the number of zygomatic implants to be placed, two common scenarios are identified:

- Posterior atrophy with the presence of bone in the inter-canine zone that requires placement of a single zygomatic implant on each side. To decrease the posterior cantilever, a more upright implant position placing the implant head as far distal as possible is preferred. Indeed, when using the first molar site rather than the second premolar site, the final exit of the drill may be too close to the orbit. Great care should be taken not to perforate the bony orbit and disrupt the orbital contents.
- Posterior and anterior atrophy. In this case, a Quad approach comprising two implants in each zygomatic bone is usually chosen [26-28]. Since one of the implants would need to be placed closer to the orbit, extreme care should be taken. Prior to the drilling procedure, the infra-orbital arc and orbital fossa anatomy must be explored.

Following the ZAGA philosophy of preventing complications, the author clearly prefers current narrower implant designs (using just 3, 4 mm apical diameter) which require a smaller osteotomy and preserve a greater amount of bone between implants and, consequently, reduce the risk of a zygoma bone fracture.

A valuable analogy is that a chair with four legs achieves its initial stability by the sufficient insertion of the legs into the seat of the chair. Following on, its stability is further enhanced by preventing possible lateral movements of the legs when they are joined together in a second plane. Stability achieved will be greater when the union of legs is closer to the ground/floor. In the same way as the chair example, zygomatic implant stability is achieved by taking into account two aspects:
- At the apex: At the seat of the chair level, the amount of bone-to-implant contact achieved during implant insertion at the zygomatic level. The path that goes from the maxillary/zygomatic inferior entrance until the upper zygomatic cortex exit is key.
- At the coronal level: Splinting of all the placed implants, chair legs, using a rigid prosthetic framework provides enhanced stability.

Following the ZAGA protocol, the osteotomy at the zygomatic apical level must have two characteristics:

- Perforate two times, inferior and superior, the facial side of the zygomatic bone (Fig. 2c).
- Leave, at least,  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of bone above the threaded apical part of the implant (Fig. 16).

To achieve maximum capability for implant stabilization, the apical osteotomy should be a double osteotomy by perforating twice, once at the inferior entrance and once at the superior exit on the facial side of the zygomatic bone. Once the alveolar position of the implant has been determined, the zygomatic bur will drill an initial 'entrance' perforation on the lower facial cortical side of the zygomatic bone and a second 'exit' perforation on the upper facial cortical side of the zygomatic bone. The osteotomy may include posterior perforation of the zygomatic bone into the temporal fossae, partial implant path on the posterior temporal fossae, zygomatic upper posterior entrance from the sinus cavity or temporal fossae, and final zygomatic upper anterior cortical exit (Fig. 1b). To prevent a drilling-related zygoma fracture, the zygomatic entrance point should be located to ensure at least  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of remaining bone above the apical position of the zygomatic implant. In this sense, narrower implant diameters are clearly preferable.

# Determination of the Implant Path

Once the coronal entrance/contact point on the crestal bone is defined, the drill directly points to the zygomatic bone. In most cases, the ZAGA protocol does not use an antrostomy before performing the zygomatic osteotomy. The goal for zygomatic implant placement, as for any regular implant, is to achieve an implant bed matching the implant configuration. By fitting the osteotomy to the implant body, we are eliminating the need for a lateral window while preserving as much bone as possible, both at the crest and at the maxillary lateral wall level. No window or slot is perforated during the procedure. Instead, a direct apical maxillary/zygomatic osteotomy, coincident with the implant path, is performed. The position of the apical osteotomy and coincident implant direction are controlled by:

- Benefit of a muco-periosteal flap allowing surgical control of the anatomic limits and structures, including the superior zygomatic rim and the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus facing the temporal fossae.
- Use of a retractor placed at the superior zygomatic rim. The retractor will help the surgeon in three ways:

- Enlarges the field of vision.
Guides eventual implant direction deviations.
- Protects the soft tissue from being injured by the drill at the moment of the final perforation of the upper facial zygomatic cortical bone.

As aforementioned, the apical and the coronal spots are joined by an implant placed without a previous creation of a window or slot. As a result, the implant body will match and seal the osteotomy eliminating the need for additional bone graft. Because of the different anatomies that may be found, the zygomatic implant can be placed in a variety of positions regarding the maxillary wall, ranging from an intrasinus path to a fully extra-sinus path. Based on the ZAGA protocol, implant placement can be classified into five types, depending on the path of the implant:

- ZAGA type 0 is characterized by the following:

- Anterior maxillary wall is very flat.
- Implant head is located in pristine bone provided it has a minimum of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  height and  $6\mathrm{mm}$  width (Figs. 14a, 17a).
- In the original Brænemark protocol, no care for the sinus lining was taken. In ZAGA Type 0, a precise underprepared osteotomy through the  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of crestal bone height and sinus floor lining will allow for implant stabilization, bone sealing around the implant and sinus membrane repair in a period of 2–3 weeks. In these situations, with enough bone, the possibility of a prior 'window' osteotomy with the goal of protecting the sinus lining can be considered, that is, following the method proposed by Dr. J. Chow to eliminate the risk of maxillary sinusitis with zygoma implants [29].
- If the patient has insufficient bone or a history of periodontitis or smoking, the author prefers to change the protocol into an exteriorized technique in order to position the location of the antrostomy far away from the crest (Fig. 17b).
- Implant body has an intra-sinus path.
- Implant contacts bone at the alveolar crest and zygomatic bone, and sometimes, at the lateral sinus wall.

- ZAGA type  $I$  involves a combined intra-extra path with most of the implant body into the sinus:

- Anterior maxillary wall is slightly concave.
- Implant head is located on the alveolar crest, provided a minimum of approximately  $4\mathrm{mm}$  bone height surrounding the implant neck can be maintained (Fig. 14b). If the patient has insufficient palatal bone height around the entire implant (Fig. 18a), or has a history of periodontitis or smoking, the author prefers to place the implant path using an exteriorized technique in order to position the location of the antrostomy site away from the entrance point (Fig. 18b). The intra-sinus path approach plus window antrostomy and eventual grafting is considered more risky and invasive.
- Drill has performed the osteotomy slightly through the wall.
- Although the implant can be seen through the wall, most of the implant body has an intra-sinus path.
- Usually, there is no need for a prior window osteotomy because the remaining alveolar crest is slightly tilted buccally, allowing for an exteriorized technique (Fig. 17b).
- Implant contacts bone at the alveolar crest, lateral sinus wall and zygomatic bone.

- ZAGA type II involves a combined extra-intra path with most of the implant body outside the sinus:

- Anterior maxillary wall is concave.
- Implant head is located on the alveolar crest.
- Drill has performed the osteotomy through the wall matching the implant shape.
- No sinus window is performed.
- Implant can be seen through the wall and most of the body has an extra-sinus path.
- Implant contacts bone at the alveolar crest, lateral sinus wall and zygomatic bone (Figs. 3 and 6).
- ZAGA type III involves an in (alveolar)-out (extra-sinus)-in (zygomatic) path:

- Anterior maxillary wall is very concave.
- Implant head is located on the alveolar crest.
- Drill has performed the osteotomy following a trajectory that goes from the palatal to the upper buccal alveolar bone, and then, the implant body leaves the concave part of the anterior sinus wall to penetrate into the zygomatic bone.
- No slot or sinus window is performed prior.
- Most of the implant body has an anterior extra-sinus path.
- Middle part of the implant body is not touching the most concave part of the wall.
- Implant contacts bone in the coronal alveolar and apical zygoma bone (Figs. 1b, 2a-c).

- ZAGA type IV involves extra-maxillary path

- Maxilla and alveolar bones show extreme vertical and horizontal atrophy.
- Implant head is located buccal to the alveolar crest. There is no or minimal osteotomy at this level to respect the maximum amount of bone at the crestal and coronal maxillary wall level.
- Drill has arrived at the apical zygomatic entrance following a path outside the sinus wall.

- No window or slot is performed prior. Most of the implant body has an extrasinus/extra-maxillary path. Just the apical part of the implant is surrounded by bone.
- The implant contacts with bone at the zygoma and lateral sinus wall (Figs. 12, 16, and 17).

# Final Considerations

This ZAGA Concept protocol is an evolution of previous ones: Our experience has led us to progress and transition from a surgical technique that advocates an intra-sinusal implant path to another path, which in many cases requires a partially exteriorized or even extra-maxillary path.

During a period of 6 years, we have followed the original surgical technique. Subsequently, in the presence of large concavities of the maxillary anterior wall, we initially externalized the implant carefully. We assessed our 1- and 3-year results and gained confidence. Today, we have accumulated more than 15 years of experience with the ZAGA technique. Therefore, we can affirm that, if there is a true indication of bone deficiency (less than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  height or  $5\mathrm{mm}$  wide crest), we find fewer and fewer indications to perform ZAGA type 0 (Fig. 16a) or type I (Fig. 17a) surgeries. In other words, there are very few occasions fulfilling the conditions of crestal entry, an intra-sinusal path, maintaining a minimum amount of bone greater than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in contact with the implant head/neck plus an intact sinus lining. If such conditions are met, we should analyse other treatment options, that is, short implants, since surgery with zygomatic implants may not be indicated.

If the amount of bone at the entrance level of the implant to the sinus is less than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , we must consider, among other factors, the patient's habits and their periodontal history, and foresee that an eventual loss of bone at this level could facilitate oral-sinus communication. Understanding the measures we can implement to achieve a good coverage of the implant by high-quality, keratinized soft tissue and to maintain it over time, the author prioritizes avoiding recurrent sinus infection towards a soft tissue dehiscence. Figure 16b shows a case of a straight wall ZAGA Type 0, where the implant is placed from the vestibular side with the extra-sinusal path.

The ZAGA protocol aims at achieving optimal soft tissue to implant sealing. Thus, the insertion of the final abutments is highly recommended. Furthermore, an immediate provisional prosthesis should be placed and equilibrated within the first  $24\mathrm{h}$  [30-37]. To limit the applied load at this stage, the provisional prosthesis must not include distal cantilevers. A period of a soft diet is recommended to allow for bone to implant healing.

# The Zygoma ZAGA Centers Network

The rehabilitation of maxillary severe atrophy is the key indication for placing zygomatic implants. Especially from a surgical point of view, the treatment of the extreme atrophy of the maxilla with zygomatic implants is significantly more complex than treatment with conventional dental implants placed in the pristine bone.
Statistics show that the number of people suffering from intense maxillary atrophy annually detected in a regular size office is low. Considering the usual learning curve, it is understandable that for a general practitioner, it is very difficult to become an expert surgeon in zygomatic implant-based rehabilitation.

In addition, in the vast majority of cases, the patient who suffers from severe atrophy in his upper jaw will only have one chance to treat his tooth loss with fixed teeth anchored on zygomatic implants. It is our belief that the treatment of maxillary atrophy by zygomatic implants must be performed by an expert, to ensure success at the first attempt.

The www.zygomazagacenters.com (ZZC) is formed by an international network of professionals trained and certified in the ZAGA philosophy. The ZAGA Centers bring together the surgical treatment of patients needing zygomatic implants in their home area or city. Due to the experience gathered, the ZAGA Center becomes the true voice for expertise for treatment of maxillary atrophy. The main function of the ZAGA Center is to perform the surgery according to the ZAGA method and to equilibrate a fixed immediately placed and immediately loaded prosthesis.

To do so, and to share the clinical knowledge generated, the ZAGA Centers are interconnected through the Zygoma Integrated Solutions platform containing all the protocols and guidelines necessary to attain a standardized treatment result. Through the Zygoma Integrated Solutions Platform, the ZAGA Centers have the support of ZAGA Partners, a network of professionals interested in offering the prosthesis and oversight of the final maintenance of this treatment to their patients.

Acknowledgements The ZAGA protocol arises from the desire to overcome the drawbacks of the original technique. Like almost all innovations, the one described in this chapter would not have happened without an origin from which to evolve. In this regard, I wish to deeply thank my teacher and mentor Prof. P-I Brænemark for sharing his vision of the use of zygoma bone for remote implant anchorage. I am also grateful for the opportunity he gave me to publish the first report in 1993 showing the utility of zygomatic implants in maxillary rehabilitation. In addition, I would like to recognize the generosity and support of Prof. Dr. Chantal Malevez during my first three surgeries. I still smile when remembering those first intense moments. I would like to acknowledge Mr Graham Blackbeard, CEO of SouthernImplants  $C^\circ$ , for the intense discussions we have had to achieve the best possible zygomatic implant design. SouthernImplants is the manufacturer  $C^\circ$  of "Zygan", the Zygomatic model of implant used to illustrate this chapter. Finally, I would like to acknowledge all the colleagues who have generously shared their experiences in the field of zygomatic implants through publications. Without them, I could not be presenting this work.
