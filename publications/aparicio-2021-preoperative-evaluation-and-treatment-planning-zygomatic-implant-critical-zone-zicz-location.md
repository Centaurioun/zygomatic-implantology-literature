# KEYWORDS

- Zygomatic implants evaluation  $\cdot$  ZAGA  $\cdot$  Anatomy-guided approach  $\cdot$  Patient-specific therapy  $\cdot$  Zygomatic implant critical zone

# KEY POINTS

- A systematic preoperative evaluation is an essential basis to identify challenges, risks, and limitations to establish an accurate treatment plan.
- The understanding of anatomic differences provides the framework for the treatment planning design.
- A complete treatment planning, including the visualization and prevention of late complications, constitutes the strategy for predictable, functional, and esthetic outcomes.

# Introduction

Maxillary atrophy usually represents the final outcome of multiple failed conservative dental treatments, regenerative approaches, or rehabilitation procedures such as grafting or implant placement. The rehabilitation of the severely atrophic edentulous maxilla entails both a huge challenge for the practitioner and the last opportunity for the patient to have a fixed set of teeth, to recover esthetics and masticatory function. $^{1,2}$

Clinicians face several important decisions in the planning and delivery of oral rehabilitation anchored on zygomatic implants. Nevertheless, this surgery demands, in addition to a high level of surgical experience and skills, a meticulous patient-centered evaluation to:

- Address the patient's concerns and goals
- Minimize risks and adverse events
- Reduce the treatment duration and the financial cost
- Adequately inform the patient of the potential benefits and risks of this treatment
- Provide the patient with an understanding of appropriate treatment alternatives
- Simplify treatment when possible.

This treatment should be performed knowing one's own limitations and seeking consultation whenever appropriate.

These goals are achieved using a systematic preoperative evaluation of the implicit risks and a profound knowledge of the maxilla anatomy. Only based on these elements, one can set up a centered patient's welfare, anatomy-guided treatment planning.

# Anatomic considerations

Profound knowledge of the anatomy is required, including the following structures (Fig. 1):

- Alveolar process of the maxilla
Maxillary anterior wall
Zygomatic process of the maxilla
- Maxillary left and right, anterior ethmoidal, posterior ethmoidal, sphenoidal, frontal sinuses, and ostium
- Tuberosity/pterygoid process
Zygomatic bone
- Proximal soft tissues susceptible to being damaged during the drilling procedure or flap raising

# The zygoma anatomy-guided classification

When planning the osteotomy for a zygomatic implant, it is crucial to understand that a zygomatic implant may adopt different trajectories. This will depend on the location of the coronal entrance, and on adapting the surgical procedures and implant designs to each patient's anatomic characteristics. This is aimed at reducing early and late complications.

Based on a cross-sectional study of 200 sites, a classification system comprising 5 basic anatomic groups named from ZAGA
Fig. 1 Maxillary bone (green line). Zygomatic process of the maxilla (orange). Located at the separation of the maxilla and zygoma surfaces. Its geometry and curvature are crucial parameters to determine the antrostomy location in an extramaxillary placed implant. Residual alveolar process (yellow) architecture is a key factor to plan where the ZICZ will be located.

Fig. 2 ZAGA Classification for the posterior zygomatic implant. The ZAGA Concept implies that in accordance to the amount of residual alveolar bone and anatomic characteristics the implant path will vary from the total intrasinus one (A) to the more or less partially intrasinus  $(B,C)$ ; the intra-alveolar, extramaxillary wall  $(D)$ ; or the extra-alveolar and extramaxillary wall  $(E)$ .

0 to 4 was proposed by Aparicio. $^{3}$  Five basic skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress and alveolar crest complex and implant trajectories were identified. Anatomic intraindividual patient differences were found in  $58\%$  of the population (Fig. 2). It is believed that the proposed system is useful for classifying zygomatic implant cases for therapy planning and scientific follow-up purposes and case discussion.

# The zygomatic implant critical zone

The knowledge and familiarity of the surgeon with anatomic characteristics of the structures that the oblique plane of the planned osteotomy intersects are of utmost importance. Therefore, it is relevant to study in more detail the implant trajectory in several zones of the osteotomy. For didactic purposes, we suggest distinguishing 3 main zones on the zygomatic implant trajectory:

- the "Zygomatic Implant Critical Zone"
- the "Antrostomy Zone"
- the "Anchor Zone."

Preventing late complications will be closely related to the understanding of the physiology, and function(s) of each of the 3 zones.

The authors of this article propose the name of "Zygomatic Implant Critical Zone" (ZICZ) to define the complex formed by maxillary bone, soft tissue, and the zygoma implant at the coronal level where the first contact with maxillary bone occurs (Figs. 3 and 4). The essentials for the localization of the ZICZ and implant osteotomy/trajectory can be found in the ZAGA Concept and will be discussed in a more detailed manner in a specific chapter. Residual alveolar bone and soft tissue preservation at the coronal level of the zygomatic implant are critical to prevent oral-sinus or oral-nasal fistula and soft tissue dehiscence, which are the most common late complications (Figs. 5-25). Bone and soft tissue maintenance at the ZICZ should be one of the main goals of our surgical procedure. $^{4-6}$  In this regard, a series of protocols, tools, interventions, and procedures are proposed to reach appropriate bone and soft tissue stability on the ZICZ (Table 1).

The antrostomy zone is the area where the drill penetrates into the maxillary sinus cavity (see Fig. 3; Fig. 26). The recommended ZAGA minimally invasive osteotomy procedure matches the implant shape by direct bone drilling in the 3 zones. No previous "window" or "slot" osteotomy is performed nor required. Depending on the maxillary anatomy, the antrostomy zone will be located more or less apically from the ZICZ. As a rule of thumb, the antrostomy should be located as far as possible from the ZICZ. Excluding ZAGA types 0 and 1 that are perforating the sinus floor, the antrostomy zone is usually located at the zygomatic process of the maxilla, below the zygomaticomaxillary suture. To determine the ZICZ position, anatomic, numerical, and implant design tridimensional criteria are used. To avoid fracture of the zygomatic bone during or after the drilling procedure, a minimum amount of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of bone thickness should be left on top of the implant at the zygoma level. Accordingly, the location of the antrostomy will depend on the zygoma buttress curvature and the position of the coronal entrance point. The flatter the zygomatic buttress, the more inferior the antrostomy perforation should be. On the contrary, the more pronounced the buttress curvature is the higher the entrance (Figs. 27-54).

The Anchoring Zone is the section of the zygomatic bone where the implant reaches its maximal primary stability (see Fig. 3; Fig. 55). As zygomatic bone consists of trabecular bone with unfavorable features for implant placement, structural

The ZAGA Concept implies the use of a more tangential zygomatic bone-to-implant contact in the most atrophic anatomies. Obviously, the use of narrow-diameter implants/drills helps to preserve the zygomatic structure.

Fig. 27 Case 2 - 0- MC- profile pre*. As a medical history resume, this patient underwent two failed full mouth implant rehabilitations including BGR procedures also failed. The radiological profile shows the unfavorable biomechanical situation of the patient at the first visit. Very closed Goniac angles (powerful masseter muscles); maxillary atrophy and natural dentition on the lower jaw are risk factors for mechanical complications. The extreme maxillary atrophy is a risk factor for biological late complications such as fistula and soft tissue incompetence.


# Preoperative evaluation

# Health status evaluation and oral considerations

The systemic health status of the patient must be evaluated. Using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification is highly recommended. Relevant aspects related to zygomatic implant surgery are:

- Use of bisphosphonates
History of local irradiation
History of diabetes
Smoking
- Patient psychology and expectations
- Oral hygiene and periodontal risk assessment
- Need for tooth extraction
- Oral mucosa status
- Antagonist dentition type and extension
- Acute or chronic sinusitis
Maxillary or zygoma pathology
- Mouth opening

# Prosthetic and biomechanical evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation of the edentulous maxilla includes accurate pretreatment assessment of related prosthetic factors, which include the following:

# Smile line/visibility of the residual crest

The visibility of the transition line between soft tissue and prosthetic reconstruction may occur either anteriorly or posteriorly associated with alveolar resorption in zones I and II and sinus pneumatization. Selecting an intrasinus zygomatic implant path, if prosthetic components are foreseen to be visible, maybe an option to evaluate if a reduction of the alveolar height cannot be performed.

# Biomechanical status

Analysis of the skeletal relationship between the 2 jaws with emphasis on the anterior offset must be performed (Fig. 56, see Figs. 27-54). Also, parafunctional habits shall be evaluated.

# Radiologic evaluation

# Methods for radiological assessment

The methods best suited in the assessments are computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT). Conventional motion tomography can be used but does not offer the same image clarity as CT or CBCT and requires a higher radiation dose. A checklist of the surgical information to be gathered before diagnosis is listed in Box 1.

# Box 1. Checklist for radiological evaluation

- Dimensions and quality of the zygomatic bone
Maxillary lateral wall curvature
- Residual alveolar process architecture and dimensions
- Maxillary sinus condition and osteomeatal unit permeability
- Anatomic variations assessments: vascular anastomosis in lateral sinus membrane, sinus septum, residual alveolar ridge relationship to the palatal artery and foramen
- Skeletal relationship
- Presence or absence of remaining teeth and basic information about them
- Lower jaw dentition type and distribution, if any.

Alternatives for treatment modality based on the presence of radiologically available bone on different zones

The indication for a rehabilitation anchored on zygomatic implants is the presence of severe maxillary atrophy or resection preventing conventional implant insertion. Depending on the defect extension and intensity on the different maxillary zones (Fig. 57), alternative types of treatment may be considered (Table 2).

# Planning software

Based on 3D x-ray exploration, several planning software options have been developed to facilitate zygomatic implant planning. Residual alveolar bone characteristics along with the curvature of the zygomatic bone are of utmost importance in decision making for defining the zygomatic implant critical zone and antrostomy zone. Optimal osteotomy will be patient-specific and may adopt any path from the intrasinus to the extrasinus.

# Morphometric evaluation and presurgery planning

Current radiological information as DICOM images may easily be transferred and subsequently transformed into an STL

An occlusal view of a 3-D model with two BLX dummy implants (Straumann AG) placed in the anterior and two different designs of zygomatic implants on the posterior maxilla (Straumann ZAGA Round on the right and Straumann ZAGA Flat on the left). The 3-D model was ordered to print by sending the DICOM images to ct@zagacenters.com file format able to be printed using three-dimensional stereolithographic technology (Fig. 58). Constructed from digital image data, 3D models will facilitate the surgeon familiarizing with the internal and external anatomy of the patient's maxilla. In the experience of the authors, using 3D models with advanced maxillary atrophies is extremely helpful.


# Legal aspects considerations

The informed consent of all procedures must be gained from the patient before all surgical procedures. Also, preclinical evaluation documents such as intraoral and facial pictures, 3D models or radiographic explorations have a legal value to prove professional competence. Finally, complications are frequently associated with deficient treatment planning.

# Clinics care points

- This treatment should be performed knowing one's own limitations and eventually seeking consultation whenever appropriate.
- A zygomatic implant may adopt different trajectories.
- For didactic purposes, we suggest distinguishing 3 main zones on the zygomatic implant trajectory.
- Bone and soft tissue maintenance at the ZICZ should be one of the main goals of our surgical procedure.
- Constructed from digital image data, 3D models will facilitate the surgeon familiarizing with the internal and external anatomy of the patient maxilla.
