# The zygomatic anatomy-guided approach concept

The zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) was described as a refinement of the extrasinus technique for placement of zygomatic implants (ZI). The concept seeks a patient-specific therapy and applies to all the atrophic maxillary anatomies. According to the ZAGA concept, placement of the ZI is guided by the anatomic and prosthetic requirements. The osteotomy goals (Box 1) are to achieve maximum primary stability, optimal anteroposterior (AP) distribution, and implant trajectory and position that prevent potential long-term complications, such as oral-antral fistula formation or soft tissue dehiscence (Figs. 1-113).

The essence of the ZAGA concept is understanding the possible anatomic variations present between patients, and even in different sites for the same patient, and then to provide this patient with a zygomatic anchored rehabilitation according to the specific anatomy. ZAGA concept includes adaptation of the implant trajectory to the anatomy and the choice of the adequate implant design able to adapt to the performed osteotomy.

In execution of the ZAGA concept, the implant path may be intrasinus, extrasinus (see Figs. 21-55), or in multiple intermediary positions (see Figs. 1-20 and 56-113), using the maxillary wall as an additional source of anchorage. The ZAGA concept aims to maximize the primary stability of a prosthetically ideal positioned ZI, which produces a conservative osteotomy at the coronal-alveolar, medial-maxillary wall, and apical-zygomatic bone level.


Once the anatomic features of that specific patient have been visualized and studied, the ZAGA concept provides the clinician with decision-making tools on the establishment of the ideal coronal entrance point at the alveolar process and the apical entry into the zygomatic bone.

# Late complications of the zygoma-related rehabilitation

The authors propose the term, late complications, for those complications appearing at least 3 months after surgery, once implants have been individually tested for no rotational movements, pain, or infection.

The zygoma fixture—associated late complications frequently are related to the surgical technique; that is, extramaxillary placement of ZI may lead to an increased possibility for mucosal dehiscence compared with the classical palatal perforation. On the other hand, intrasinus techniques have more possibilities of developing an oral-antral fistula. An intrasinus implant path perforates the sinus through a thinner bone and thicker mucosa, unable to be sealed by the abutment (see Figs. 22–24). The intrasinus path together with an increased anterior maxillary wall concavity also is associated with implant platforms positioned at averages of  $12\mathrm{mm}$  palatal to the crest. The resulting bulky prostheses provokes hygiene difficulties and soft tissue problems like gingival hyperplasia or/and infection, which may lead to bone resorption around the implant neck at the

# Box 1. The ZAGA minimally invasive zygomatic osteotomy goals

- Accomplish a prosthetically driven implant trajectory, placing the implant head at the optimal dental position.
- Achieve optimal AP distribution of the implants.
- Achieve maximal implant primary stability.
- Preserve as much bone as possible at the maxillary wall and alveolar bone.
- Maximize the BIC along the length of the whole implant. This includes alveolar, maxillary wall, and zygomatic bone.
- Complete sealing of the osteotomy by the implant body.
- Protect the sinus integrity at the implant head/neck level to prevent late sinus-oral communication.
- Prevent soft tissue dehiscence.

# The zygomatic anatomy-guided approach concept for minimally invasive osteotomy

# The alveolar tunnel osteotomy for a round section implant design

Following the ZAGA concept for a patient-specific zygomatic therapy, if the cone-beam computer tomography (CBCT) cross-sectional plane for virtual implant placement shows that residual bone at the sinus floor level is sufficient in thickness and width (minimum, 4-mm high  $\times$  6-mm wide), the ZI should enter the antrum through the residual alveolus. In other words, whenever bone architecture at the desired implant platform position is sufficient to circumferentially enclose the implant neck with at least  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of bone, attempts should be made to maintain this bone and to place the implant through it (ZAGA types 0 and 1). This concept minimizes the risk of late soft tissue complications.


The authors naming the circular osteotomy a tunnel osteotomy because, at the alveolar osseous entrance, it has a floor, lateral walls, and a more or less complete roof. The ZAGA concept recommends aiming for a tunnel osteotomy whenever possible, regardless of the maxillary wall curvature (see Figs. 1-20) (ZAGA types 0, 1, and 3). In other words, in the presence of a remaining alveolar crest allowing for a tunnel-type perforation, a maxillary wall curvature with a pronounced curvature is not perforated until the antrostomy zone (ZAGA type 3). The rationale is that a stable ZI, with an appropriate threaded profile, surrounded by sufficient bone at the alveolar entrance and stabilized by adequate prostheses, will achieve osseointegration capable of long-term sealing the sinus entrance.
Fig. 1 Simulation of an extrasinus path in a ZAGA type 3 situation. Implant path will use a ZAGA tunnel-type osteotomy to reach the zygoma.
Fig. 3 Case 1: the antrostomy location also is marked.


Tunnel osteotomy typically is used in ZAGA types 0, 1, and 3 maxillary wall situations when it is accompanied by an adequate thickness and geometry of alveolar bony support circumferential to the implant neck.

Tunnel osteotomy, by definition, has a circular profile entrance that needs to be sealed by a round profile implant.

In order to avoid possible bone loss from implant micromovements, ideally, ZI should be splinted immediately following placement to other conventional or ZI in a rigid crossarch stabilization system.

Providing that the clinician feels comfortable controlling the drilling direction and trajectory, a lateral window-shaped osteotomy into the maxillary antrum is not recommended to minimize bone injury. The entry point preferably should be located in a position close to the middle part of the alveolar crest regardless of the maxillary wall anatomy, attempting to place the implant neck fully surrounded by the adequate thickness of native bone. The circular osteotomy for implant placement penetrates at least  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of crest, with no special effort to maintain sinus membrane integrity, and adopts either a total, partial, or extrasinus path on its midpoint until reaching the zygomatic bone. The final determination of the relationship between implant and maxillary anterior wall is determined by the curvature of the external wall of the maxillary buttress.

There is no scientific documentation of the minimum amount of residual bone required to withstand the masticatory loads applied from the ZI to the sinus floor bone-implant junction. Circumstances affecting bone to implant contact (BIC) quality and maintenance at the alveolar entrance can differ dramatically from 1 patient to the next, that is, difference between final drill diameter and implant diameter, implant insertion precision, degree of ZI stability resisting

A stepped twist drill of  $2.8\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter was elected as the final drill.
Fig. 71 Case 3: the stepped  $2.8\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter twist drill was used until thorough perforation of the zygomatic bone. A retractor previously placed on the angle formed by the frontal and temporal apophysis of the zygomatic bone would protect facial skin from eventual drill injury.

# The alveolar and/or maxillary wall channel osteotomy for a flat section implant design

The clinical scenario of the severely atrophic maxilla is represented by a thin ( $\leq 2$ -mm) bone separating the maxillary sinus from the overlying soft tissue. An eventual implant entry scarcely achieves BIC, and the maintenance of weak soft tissue sealing becomes critical. Under these conditions, osseointegration of the ZI at its neck level is difficult to achieve and to maintain. Risk for late sinus-oral communication then is increased.
Fig. 113 Case 3: patient status after prosthesis placement. Prosthetic rehabilitation executed by Drs Alexandra Marquez and Marina Praetere, Lisbon, Portugal.


Instead of perforating through an inadequate crestal or palatal bone, the ZAGA concept promotes displacing the alveolar antrostomy toward the buccal plate or vestibule as far as possible from the zygomatic implant critical zone (ZICZ). The main goals for this variation are to avoid sinus late complications by maintaining sinus membrane integrity at the alveolar level; the secondary goal is to prevent soft tissue dehiscence, over the body of the implant along the remaining alveolar bone and maxillary wall. A channel-type space capable of accommodating most of the circumference of the implant helps prevent soft tissue dehiscence by positioning the body of the implant appropriately within the soft tissue tolerance.

This type of osteotomy, not capable of providing a complete covering of the implant midbody and neck, is defined as a channel osteotomy. It is a groove made on the coronal-alveolar bone and sometimes also in the lateral maxillary wall and zygomatic buttress. Like a waterway or channel, it has a floor and lateral walls with more or less height, but no roof. When a channel osteotomy is performed, bone is not covering the buccal implant midpoint or its neck.

A bony canal having a circumferential arc section ideally is sealed by an implant showing a circumferential arc section too. Accordingly, a recommendation is made to use a flat implant section design that fits into a channel minimizing its buccal impact against soft tissue.

The final idea of the channel type of osteotomy (see Figs. 21-55 and 56-113) is to sink the implant neck as much as possible on the alveolar and lateral wall maxillary bone and still not perforate the sinus membrane. The rationale for this ZAGA concept recommendation is based on the fact that in patients with minimal bone thickness around the implant's entry point, under function and in time, bone may resorb. As a consequence, sinus sealing is achieved just by a weak hemidesmosome junction. That fragile antrum sealing may be jeopardized in many circumstances—inadequate hygiene, use of water jet oral hygiene devices against the gingival junction, inappropriate or aggressive use of periodontal probe, and so forth. It has been speculated that the lack of bony support would end up in transversal mobility of the long coronal part of the ZI facilitating oral-sinus communication. On the contrary, placing the ZI platform partially or outside of the sinus maintaining lateral maxillary bony support/contact would allow for better prosthetic positioning together with a more conservative approach regarding sinus integrity preservation.

In such an extremely resorbed anatomy model, a strong recommendation is made to, if possible, position the antrostomy at least  $15\mathrm{mm}$  above the coronal area of the platform (Figs. 57-61 and Figs. 109-112). It also is recommended to preserve the sinus membrane integrity and as much bone thickness as possible at the ZICZ crest level. To prevent soft tissue stretching when placing the implant laterally to the maxillary wall, it is recommended to groove buccal bone to house the implant body with as much medial submergence as possible into bone crest in such a way that it does not protrude against periosteum, jeopardizing soft tissue vascularity. The depth limit for the canal formation is dictated by maintenance of the sinus membrane integrity at this level.

# Clinics care points

- The first step is to balance the 2 main late risks of the treatment—oral-antral communication and soft tissue dehiscence—and decide the type of osteotomy.
- Typical zygomatic surgery is not an emergency surgery: wait for complete soft tissue healing previously to the surgery.
- Use a palatal incision to move keratinized soft tissue buccally to the implant head.
- Consider using a machined surface for the implant neck and body. If dehiscence occurs, it is easy to maintain.
- It is mandatory to preserve the sinus membrane integrity and as much bone thickness as possible at the ZICZ crest level.
