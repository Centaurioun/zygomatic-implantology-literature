# Zygomatic Implants. The ZAGA Concept

# 11.1 Indications

The maxilla presents a particular challenge for the anchorage of dental implants. Even in the absence of present or historical disease, anatomical bone volume may already be limited and bony topography irregular, particularly posteriorly.

Lack of posterior maxillary anchorage for dental implants is a relatively common problem which may be managed with a staged or simultaneous graft of bone harvested from a second surgical site or with a bone scaffold material. Grafting will extend, perhaps greatly extend the treatment period, and where a second site is involved results in a more invasive treatment which may be seen as more complex and daunting to the patient. Medically compromised or elderly patients may not be deemed to be fit for extensive grafting procedures or repeated interventions.


By angling the distal implant in a full-arch reconstruction to project beyond the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus many patients with moderate maxillary atrophy may be treated without the extra intervention and the inherent delay of a graft procedure. The use of an angled implant will broaden the distribution of the implant support for full-arch fixed bridgework, and make it possible to use longer implants so that immediate loading becomes more practical. However, in situations where the sinus extends anteriorly, or where the alveolar ridge is poorly developed or atrophic, useful distal extension of implant support may not be available.

Zygomatic implants (ZI) are longer implants which extend beyond the maxilla to anchor into the zygomatic bone to offer secure support for implant-based reconstructions [1]. The zygomatic bone is generally available and able to offer robust implant anchorage, even where there has been a great deal of maxillary atrophy (Fig. 11.1a, b), and in more extreme situations, where the maxilla has been resected or irradiated.

ZI, either on their own or sometimes in conjunction with regular dental implants (Fig. 11.2), are generally used to support a full-arch prosthesis. In a quadruple distribution, four ZI will provide support for a full-arch reconstruction even where there is a total absence of anchorage sites for regular dental implants (Fig. 11.3). There is a implant design, and surface characteristics have evolved over a 20-year period, and each element of change may impact upon the biological and mechanical stability of the implant and the prosthesis it supports. Changes in design and surgical protocols mean that few genuine long-term studies are available. As with any dental implant treatment, changes in health and circumstances and advancing age may affect prognosis, and so a carefully considered and cautious approach should be adopted when planning treatment. Certainly, the use of ZI should be reserved for situations where the use of conventional dental implants in a standard protocol is ruled out (Fig. 11.1a, b).

The installation of four zygomatic implants was chosen considerable body of scientific evidence to support the use of ZI, with success rates that compare favorably with graft surgery in combination with dental implants [2]. However, when compared with treatment with dental implants, zygomatic implant reconstructions may present with an additional array of complications. Surgical protocols,



From the patients' perspective the functional outcome of an implant treatment incorporating grafting procedures, or treatment with zygomatic implants is similar. As with any implant treatment, properly informed consent is a key tenet, and patients must be made aware of the various alternatives and associated complications and limitations of both graft and zygomatic implant surgeries. When faced with the choice between a multi-step grafting process or a single-stage procedure with the added benefit of immediate loading of a provisional prosthesis, many individuals appear to have a strong preference for the zygomatic implant approach (Fig. 11.2).

A history of sinusitis, smoking, and the presence of a parafunctional habit will all impact upon or influence the outcome of both grafting and zygomatic implant treatments.

The argument for the use of zygomatic implant treatment is more compelling:

- As the impact of protracted or multiple treatments becomes more onerous, as with an elderly or medically compromised patient. Treating a patient with zygomatic implants in their 80s is clearly less likely to result in long-term complications than treating a patient in their 50s.
- As the extent of bone loss becomes more extreme, where donor site morbidity is more of a concern, or where grafting and implant placement cannot take place simultaneously; all leading to an increase in the number of surgical interventions, and an extended treatment period.
- With increasing loss of function. Inability to manage a removable prosthesis, or the need to avoid wearing a prosthesis during lengthy and complex grafting procedures may make such prolonged treatment untenable.
- Where an extensive implant and/or graft treatment has previously failed (Fig. 11.4).
- Where a patient will not accept the loss of their teeth or tolerate a removable denture as a step towards graft treatment.
- In oncology, where a maxillectomy or a partial maxillectomy has taken place. The zygomatic bone can usually be easily accessed at the time of resection.

It may be preferable to consider alternative approaches to zygomatic implants:

In a younger patient.
- Where lack of bone is less extreme, and the situation can be improved with minimal intervention—less extensive grafting, simultaneous grafting, and implant placement.
- If front teeth (or implants) remain and appearance can be maintained or made acceptable to the patient, albeit on a provisional basis, such that grafting can take place without a great impact on quality of life, perhaps in preparation for more comprehensive treatment once a graft has matured.
- When the need for the extra support offered by the zygomatic implant is marginal, and other alternatives such as angled, short, or narrow implants may be available, or where the dental arch may be shortened without much compromise to appearance or function.

Zygomatic implants are most commonly used in full-arch treatments, where rigid splinting to other dental or zygomatic implants stabilizes the long, tilted, and apically anchored implant. This approach provides consistently predictable
Fig. 11.4 Radiological 2D cut and 3D image of a patient with a failing implant treatment results and has been well supported by the literature. The use of zygomatic implants for the support of short-span prosthesis is less well-studied. In this sort of situation, the patient may still have front teeth and may find their appearance to be acceptable despite the lack of back teeth. Temporization with a removable partial denture stabilized by the remaining teeth may be more manageable for the patient than in a full-arch treatment. Under these circumstances, use of a zygomatic implant for support of short-span bridge work may be more difficult to justify, particularly, in a healthy younger individual where graft treatment is straightforward. Nonetheless, the use of zygomatic implants in unilateral cases has the benefit of immediacy and may have a role in following extensive consultation with the patient.


In oncology, where resection of the maxilla has taken place, the zygoma, including the lateral and infraorbital rim, can be an exceptionally useful site for implant anchorage. Possibilities include the use of a variety of zygomatic implants, special 'oncology' implants, customized implants, and standard dental implants with custom abutments. The implants can be used with overdenture attachments, or more ideally, splinted with milled bars to support obturators, or where closure of nasal or sinus openings has been carried out, with fixed bridgework. In this way, patients can appreciate a rapid and near complete return to full function without a need for microvascular anastomosis and free-flap surgery. Zygomatic implants can also be used as anchorage for a nasal prosthesis or where the radiation dose delivered to the alveolus excludes the possibility of reconstruction with regular dental implants.

# 11.2 Technique Evolution

# 11.2.1 PI Brænemark Original Technique

After several short-term initial communications reporting the possibility of the use zygomatic anchorage for dental prosthetic fixation in severely atrophied or discontinuous maxillae [3-7], a long-term study on onlay bone grafting and simultaneous placement, the zygoma fixture was introduced by PI Branemark et al. in 2004 [1]. Twenty-eight consecutive patients were included. A total of 52 zygoma fixtures and 106 conventional fixtures were installed. Bone grafting was deemed necessary in 17 patients  $(60\%)$ . All patients were followed for between 5 and 10 years. The procedure indicated a "window" antrostomy in the uppermost lateral aspect of the anterior maxillary wall (Fig. 11.5). The sinus mucosa was then reflected and no special effort was made to keep it intact.


According to PI Branemark, "the direction of the zygoma fixture was selected to provide optimal stability over prosthetic requirements." In other words, the original implant trajectory had, depending on the maxillary wall curvature, a more or less palatal entrance to achieve an intrasinus path allowing for optimal implant anchorage in the zygomatic bone. Due to the palatal position of the zygoma fixtures, the palatal flap was thinned, and the fat tissue eliminated to prevent soft tissue inflammation around the abutments. Despite the palatal position of the heads of the ZI, in the case of concave maxillary walls, resulting in a prosthesis which may impinge upon
Fig. 11.5 The skull image is showing the original Branemark protocol for zygomatic surgery: "the direction of the zygoma fixture was selected to provide optimal stability over prosthetic requirements." In other words, the implant trajectory had, depending on the maxillary wall curvature, a more or less palatal entrance to achieve an intra-sinus path allowing for optimal implant anchorage in the zygomatic bone occupying the tongue space, no patient discomfort and/or speech difficulties was reported [1].


Branemark's long-term study [1] reported 3 ZI failures and a survival rate for individual implants of  $94.2\%$ . The overall prosthetic rehabilitation rate was  $96\%$  at five years. A total of 8 out of the 28 patients experienced late sinusitis during the follow-up period  $(28.50\%)$ . Four patients  $(14.25\%)$  presented recurrent sinusitis. They were treated by improving drainage from the sinuses through a new ostium inside the inferior turbinate. Radiographically diagnosed sinusitis with, clinically, symptom-free maxillary sinuses were found in another four patients  $(14.25\%)$ . In those cases, no treatment was required and regarded as necessary. Those results were consistent with the sinus reactions observed by Davo in 2008 on 71 immediately loaded ZI, that were followed for a 13 to 42 months of period [8].

In 2010, Bedrossian et al. reported a prospective follow-up of 36 patients followed from 5 to 7 years, treated using the immediate load protocol with a survival rate of  $97.2\%$  [9]. Aparicio et al. in 2012, reported on a long-term prospective study, 22 consecutive patients that were followed for at least 10 years after loading. The original two-stage ad modum Branemark protocol and turned titanium-threaded implants were used. Two ZI were partly removed due to periimplant infection at year nine. A cumulative survival rate of  $95.12\%$  was obtained (10 years  $\mathrm{CSR} = 95.12\%$ ). All patients maintained functional prostheses. In 2013, Davo et al. reported on a 5-year prospective study of immediately loaded zygomatic implants. The implant surfaces were either commercially pure titanium (machined) (44 implants) or porous titanium oxide (37 implants). The 5-year survival rate of immediately loaded zygomatic implants was  $98.5\%$  (68/69).

# 11.2.2 The Slot Technique

In 2000 Stella and Warner [10] described the sinus-slot technique in a technical note. The goal was to provide a solution to the prosthodontic shortcomings of the original Brænemark technique and to reduce post-operative pain. They claimed that in an already-resorbed maxilla, a sinus window can further compromise the precarious bone support of the remaining dental alveolus. They proposed a reduced antrostomy in the shape of a slot as opposed to the standard window osteotomy. The slot was drilled prior to implant placement following the planned path of the implant (Fig. 11.6). The palatal mucosa was reflected so that only the crest of the ridge was exposed. A rounded tungsten carbide drill was used to prepare a hole in the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus at the upper extreme contour of the zygomatic buttress. The zygomatic implant depth gauge was placed in the hole and positioned to simulate the angle of approach of the implant twist drill. A second hole was made on this line  $5\mathrm{mm}$  above the crest of the ridge. A slot was then made connecting the 2 holes. A rounded drill was used to mark the implant anchoring zone on the maxillary crest at the first molar level. Through this perforation, the first  $2.9\mathrm{-mm}$

Fig. 11.6 Clinical picture showing a "slot" antrostomy. Note that since the slot is made before implant placement, the slot is not matching the final implant path. (Courtesy of Prof. Dr. Miguel Peñarrocha, ZAGA Center Valencia) drill was introduced and directly visualized through the prepared sinus slot. The drill was advanced superiorly towards the junction of the lateral orbital rim and zygomatic arch. In the same way, the pilot drill and  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  twist drill were also directed through the center of the sinus slot. The depth of the preparation was again confirmed with the zygomatic implant depth gauge, and the appropriate length implant was chosen [11].


Authors recommended for the first time a more conservative approach: incision, dissection, and osteotomy to achieve a better anatomical emergence of the ZI. The slot results in a smaller antrostomy and serves to orient the twist drills for implant placement under direct visualization [12].

Although the slot technique represented an improvement regarding prosthesis design, the technique had some drawbacks. For instance, the authors did not provide specific criteria for possible variations of the slot anatomical limits or implant path. The precision for the slot to completely match the implant shape was limited (Fig. 11.6). In other words, bone-to-implant contact (BIC) was not optimized. Slot antrostomy, prior to implant placement, may be unnecessary in the presence of maxillary wall concavities. Criteria relating the crestal implant entry point to the type of atrophy at the sinus floor were not provided either.

# 11.2.3 The Extra-Sinus, Exteriorized, and Extra-Maxillary Approach

The next evolutionary technique that emerged was the extra-sinus approach. The 1-year results for this new technique were first described in the English literature by Aparicio's group in 2006 [13]. Miglioranza et al. also in 2006 [14] also described a similar approach in Portuguese named the exteriorized technique in Portuguese. In a 3-year prospective study in 2008, Aparicio et al. [15] reported the results of the extra-sinus placement of the zygomatic implant (midportion) on 20 consecutive patients recruited from October 2004 to October 2005. The mini mum follow-up period was at least 3 years. A total of 36 zygomatic implants, smooth turned titanium surfaces (Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) were used (Fig. 11.7). According to the authors, the original indication for this approach was the presence of buccal concavities in the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, which precluded the intra-sinus trajectory of zygomatic fixtures while positioning the implant head within a distance of  $10\mathrm{mm}$  from the top of the alveolar crest. The implant site was prepared, with respect to the alveolar bone, drilling from the palatal side of the crest pointing to the zygomatic arch without making an opening into the maxillary sinus thus preserving the sinus membrane integrity (Fig. 11.7a).


One concern with the technique may be the long-term effect of exposed threads directly adjacent to the soft tissues at the lateral aspect of the zygomatic implants. Aparicio et al., however, reported healthy mucosa covering the extra-sinus part of the zygomatic implants in all patients. An explanation may be found on the use of this technique solely in patients with concave lateral maxillary walls and in taking surgical care to preserve the remaining alveolar bone volume (Fig. 11.7). They informed no signs of maxillary sinus infection with all implants maintaining stability and no implant failures observed during the follow-up period. The extra-sinus technique resulted in an emergence of the collar of the zygomatic fixture closer to the crest of alveolar bone of the maxilla, this was considered beneficial from a cleaning and patient-comfort point of view.

Later in 2008, Malo et al. in a pilot study, using  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter ZI with different preestablished implant head angulations, described a zygomatic implant technique where the recontouring of the remaining crestal bone at the maxillary alveolus was systematically performed in order to achieve "only zygomatic anchorage of the implant." When the patients presented with an over contoured external maxillary sinus wall, the maxillary sinus membrane was inevitably perforated, as it was in the pathway of drill direction. Out of the 18 patients that underwent the 1-year follow-up, four patients had sinus infection (22% of sinusitis if dropouts are consid (i) The use of a previously described "channel osteotomy" was introduced to minimize surgical damage occurring to the maxillary sinus membrane during extra-maxillary ZI bed preparation.
Fig. 11.7 (a) Channel type of osteotomy used at the initial stages of the extra-sinus technique. The initial indication for the extra-sinus technique was limited only to just pronounce maxillary concavities [16]. (b) Prosthetically driven extra-sinus implant placement respecting the remaining alveolar bone. Note the implant design corresponds to the original threaded, turned titanium Branemark fixture ered). This type of approach was called the "Extra-maxillary" technique. In a subsequent study, extending the previous one, Malo et al. (2012) retrospectively reported 3-year use,  $5\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter, extra-maxillary zygomatic implants placed in 39 consecutive patients from January 2006 to October 2009 [17]. The maxillary alveolar bone was prepared to allow direct access by the drill to the entry point at the inferior aspect of the zygomatic bone, and the alveolar bone was not used for anchoring the extra-maxillary implant coronally. Six patients with sinus complications were reported  $(18\%)$ . Malo group further reported a long-term 7-year follow-up of the extra-maxillary technique. In contrast to their earlier study, which included a total of 39 patients observed from January 2006 to October 2009 [17], a substantially higher number of patients were included in the new study (313 new patients in 2 years and 9 months) [18]. Reasons for much reduced incidence of sinus infections  $(8\%)$  observed in the new study compared with the previously reported higher rates  $(18 - 22\%)$  were not explained. A possible explanation for this improvement in the prevention of sinus infections may be related to a few surgical modifications the authors made in the latter study:



(ii) Moreover, the authors appear to have abandoned the previously reported technique of alveolar bone reintouring.
(iii) As well as avoiding the exclusive use of 5-mm-diameter zygomatic implants.

Nevertheless, the authors reported a high incidence of mechanical complications in 156 ZI patients  $(44\%)$ . This may be because the extramaxillary implants, in this study, were retained by zygomatic bone anchorage only and/or because the implants were placed too parallel to each other thus increasing the prosthetic cantilevering. In the absence of a rigid alveolar crestal support, unfavorable stress distribution would have predisposed to these mechanical failures. According to Freedman et al., 2015, occlusal stresses are higher than lateral stresses when there is lack of robust alveolar bone support for the implant neck. Despite the extra-maxillary implant allocation, none of Malo's previously quoted studies [17-19] reported complications regarding soft tissue dehiscence or recession around zygomatic implants.

Miglioranza et al. [20] retrospectively reported on the treatment of 75 patients with conventional implants compared with 150 zygomatic implants placed using the extra-maxillary (extra-sinus) approach. Although a life chart of the implants and dropout information were not reported, the implants were followed up for at least a year. Surgical technique involved using a round drill to penetrate the residual alveolar ridge near the crest, entering it from the palatal side and exiting on the buccal aspect of the ridge, then following an extra-sinus path before entering the zygomatic bone superiorly. Survival rate was estimated at  $98.7\%$ . Two implants showed slight soft tissue dehiscence with no inflammation.


# 11.2.4 The Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA)

The clinical scenario of the severely atrophic maxilla is represented by a thin  $(\leq 2\mathrm{mm})$  bone separating the maxillary sinus from the overlying oral soft tissue. In such cases, an implant perforating the palatal sinus floor would scarcely achieve adequate BIC (bone to implant contact) thus making it difficult to achieve and maintain osseointegration along its coronal section. The absence of adequate peri-implant crestal bone seal would predispose to the formation of late oral-antral communication between the maxillary sinus and the mouth. In order to preserve maxillary sinus integrity and to prevent possible sinus infections, implant position may be buccally offset to avoid perforation into the sinus cavity when placing ZI. Nevertheless, new soft tissue-related complications have also been observed in these situations where the implant platform is positioned buccal to the crest of the alveolar bone outside the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. The presence of the zygoma implant directly beneath the vestibular depth may lead to vascular compression, soft tissue necrosis, and/or erosion of the mucosa leading to exposure of the implant (Fig. 11.8). The occurrence of soft tissue dehiscence, in the absence of adequate alveolar bone supporting the implant head, is difficult to prevent and eventually could lead to peri-implant infections. Indeed, implant design and implant macro and micro surface characteristics will crucially influence bone and soft tissue maintenance at the zygomatic implant critical zone (ZICZ).

The concept of zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) was described by Aparicio [21, 22] as a refinement of the extra-maxillary technique. The concept seeks for a "patient-specific therapy" and applies not only to patients with extreme buccal concavities but to all varia tions of the maxillary anatomy. The placement of the ZI is guided by an anatomically and prosthetically driven approach. The technique relies on the recognition of the existence of the interindividual anatomical differences as well as the intra-individual variations. By following specific criteria developed by Aparicio et al., the intraoral entrance point for the ZI is determined accurately, based on two main factors: the volume and architecture of the alveolar/basal process and on the anterior maxillary wall curvature.


The fundamental principle of this, evidence-based, new concept is to design the placement of ZI in an anatomically and prosthetically guided approach in order to

- Maximize the bone-to-implant contact at the zygomatic anchor zone (ZAZ), the ZICZ and, if possible, at mid-point. Maximized BIC will contribute to bone sealing and stability.
- Achieve maximum structural zygomatic stabilization by a precise under preparation and subsequent implant insertion through four cortical of the maxillary zygomatic process and zygomatic bone.
- Prevent the most frequent late complications such as oral-antral communication or soft tissue dehiscence.

The first principle of the ZAGA Concept is to place the implant within the alveolar bone, following the Brænemark protocol, to minimize the risk of late soft tissue complications. Indeed,
Fig. 11.8 Soft tissue dehiscence bacterial plaque and inflammation around zygomatic implants. (Image taken from internet) whenever the alveolar bone architecture at the sinus floor level is found to be sufficient to house the implant neck ( $>4$  mm height and  $6\mathrm{mm}$  wide), attempts should be made to maintain this bone and to place the implant through it minimizing the risk of late soft tissue complications. In the event that inadequate residual bone architecture is noticed, the coronal osteotomy should be buccally offset to prevent future sinus complications, such as oral-antral or nasal oral communications, occurring. Eventually, the latter situation requires careful planning to prevent soft tissue complications. These concepts will be analyzed deeply in the next sections.


# 11.3 The ZAGA Concept

# 11.3.1 The ZAGA Classification

To better understand the influence of the maxillary wall anatomy and the alveolar crest on a prosthetically driven implant trajectory, Aparicio in 2011 [21] described the "ZAGA Classification," an anatomical classification that is based on the prosthetically driven position of the ZI trajectory with reference to the amount of the remaining alveolar crest and maxillary sinus wall curvature (Fig. 11.9).

The classification described by Aparicio ranges from ZAGA 0 (Fig. 11.9a) (Straight-Convex lateral maxillary wall with the implant head on the crest and mid-partion of the zygoma implant in the sinus) to ZAGA 4 (Fig. 11.9e), which is the most extreme resorption of the maxillary alveolar ridge together with or without a significant concavity of the lateral maxillary sinus wall. The ZAGA 4 situation represents extreme bone resorption at the sinus floor and subsequent decrease of the transversal and anteroposterior palatal dimensions as occurs in the severely atrophic maxilla.

As shown by ongoing anatomy studies of Chow's group (personal communications), the number of Type 0 cases increases as the entry location of the Zygomatic implant is moved further distally in the maxilla. The maxillary wall contour is more convex around the Zygomatic buttress region, which is usually above the first molar location. Indeed, if the entry site is located at the first molar, more patients will present with type 0 when compared to an entry site at the second premolar.


# 11.3.2 The ZAGA Zones

As previously stated the success of the ZI treatment is based on the identification of the patient anatomical characteristics, specifically the surgeon must be familiar with the characteristics, physiology, and function(s) of the structures that the oblique plane of the planned osteotomy intersects. With a didactic intention, we are differentiating three main zones of the zygomatic implant path:

- The "Zygomatic Implant Critical Zone".
- The "Antrostomy Zone".
- The "Zygomatic Anchor Zone".

The "Zygomatic Implant Critical Zone" (ZICZ) is the complex formed by maxillary bone, soft tissue, and the zygoma implant at the coronal level where the first contact with maxillary bone occurs (Fig. 11.10). The rationale for correct positioning of the ZICZ can be found in the ZAGA Concept and will be discussed later. Residual alveolar bone and soft tissue preservation/augmentation at the coronal level of the zygomatic implant are critical to prevent late complications. Indeed, bone and soft tissue maintenance at the ZICZ should be one of the main goals of our surgical approach.

The Antrostomy zone (AZ) is the area where the drill penetrates into the maxillary sinus cavity (Fig. 11.11). ZAGA recommends a minimally invasive osteotomy procedure intended to maximize BIC using an under preparation of the designed implant trajectory. Prior to implant placement no previous "window" or "slot" osteotomy/antrostomy is performed nor required. As it will be later explained, depending on the maxillary anatomy, the antrostomy zone will be located either at the internal side of the remaining alveolar bone (Tunnel Osteotomy) or apically from the
Fig. 11.9 (a-e) ZAGA Classification [21], expressing the different positions in which a prosthetically driven posterior zygomatic implant may be placed in relation to different maxillary wall curvatures and remaining alveolar bone crest
ZAGA Type P-2
ZAGA Type P-4

ZICZ when there is not enough alveolar bone, and the osteotomy trajectory is buccally offset (Channel Osteotomy). As a rule of thumb, the antrostomy should be located as far away as possible from the ZICZ. Excluding ZAGA Types 0 and 1 when the ZI perforates the sinus floor, the AZ is usually located at the zygomatic process of the maxilla, below the zygomatico-maxillary suture. ZAGA Concept uses anatomic, prosthodontic, numerical, and 3D implant design crite ria to determine the ZICZ position. The location of the antrostomy will depend on the zygoma buttress curvature and on the position of the coronal entrance point.


The Zygomatic Anchoring Zone (ZAZ) is the section of the zygomatic bone where the implant reaches its maximal primary stability (Fig. 11.12). The zygomatic bone is variable in quality and quantity between patients. It has been described by Nkenke et al. [23] as it consists of
Fig. 11.10 The clinical picture illustrates a Straumann ZAGA®-Flat zygomatic implant in its final position. The yellow circle marks the Zygomatic Implant Critical Zone (ZICZ) as the complex formed by maxillary bone, soft tissue, and the zygoma implant at the coronal level where the first contact with maxillary bone occurs

Fig. 11.12 The clinical picture illustrates the measuring gauge trespassing the Zygomatic Anchor Zone (ZAZ) trabecular bone with unfavorable features for implant placement. To maximize primary stability, the ZAGA Concept uses a tangential zygomatic bone-to-implant intersection, penetrating the four cortical of the maxillary zygomatic process and zygomatic bone to achieve optimum structural zygomatic stabilization.


# 11.3.3 The ZAGA Concept

The ZAGA Concept is in continuous evolution as a systematic protocol. It represents a combination of key criteria that define the success of the ZI treatment: identification of the patient anatomy; establishment of the prosthetically driven zygomatic implant trajectory including the entry and exit points of the osteotomy at ZICZ and ZAZ; sinus antrostomy location; identification of a new portfolio of zygomatic implant designs capable of adapting to patients anatomy; associated procedures to prevent complications (e.g., use of the buccal fat pad and connective tissue grafting); and a systematic method to evaluate the success or failure of a zygomatic implant-related rehabilitation (ORIS Criteria) [24].

A thorough preoperative 3D radiographic evaluation protocol and a full understanding of the ZAGA classification and implant design [25] are essential to determine the final ZI position while anticipating possible complications. Once the anatomical and prostodontic features of each individual patient have been carefully investigated, the ZAGA Concept provides the clinician with surgical decision-making criteria needed to establish the key landmarks for positioning the coronal ZICZ at the alveolar process, and the apical entry point into the zygomatic bone. These factors described elsewhere are fundamental for reducing long-term complications such as chronic rhinosinusitis and achieving a successful outcome [25]. The evidence shows that the ideal position for a prosthetically optimum, implant head location is at or near the crest of the alveolar bone, with a mesiodistal space between implants carefully calculated to minimize the anterior-posterior cantilevering. By following specific prosthetic, biomechanical, and anatomical crite ria, the chosen location of ZI contact or entry points at the ZICZ depends on the vertical and horizontal resorption and architecture of the alveolar bone and on the anterior maxillary wall curvature. Guided by these factors, the intraoral preparation can start either on the bone crest or in cases of severe resorption the first perforation, after grooving the buccal maxillary wall, may be performed extra-maxillary, on the zygomatic buttress (e.g., ZAGA 4). Table 11.1 represents the osteotomy goals according to the minimally invasive ZAGA Concept. The understanding of the ZAGA concept helps the clinician to better use the available crestal bone allowing for the following: (i) bone integration (bone sealing) at the


Table 11.1 ZAGA Concept: the goals of minimally invasive zygomatic implant osteotomy preparation

This includes alveolar, maxillary wall, and zygomatic bone</td></tr><tr><td>·Completely seal the osteotomy for achieving a stable soft and hard tissue coverage</td></tr><tr><td>·Protect the sinus integrity at the implant head/neck level to prevent late oral-antral communication</td></tr><tr><td>·Prevent soft tissue dehiscence</td></tr></table> implant neck and body level in most of the ZAGA types and (ii) better soft tissue control to predictably cover the ZI in comparison with an exclusively extra-maxillary technique (soft tissue sealing).


Once the crestal site for the ZICZ has been established, the ZAGA Concept proposes anatomic, prosthodontic, and implant design criteria to achieve maximal implant primary stability and avoid complications. Since zygomatic bone consists of trabecular bone with unfavorable features for implant placement, according to Nkenke et al. [23], structural zygomatic stabilization will be maximized by the penetration of four corticals of the maxillary zygomatic process and zygomatic bone. To avoid fracture of the zygomatic bone during or after the drilling procedure, a minimum amount of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of bone thickness was left externally to the implant at the zygoma level (Fig. 11.13). In that sense the use of ZI with reduced diameter becomes of extreme importance, especially in the cases of quadruple ZI installation. Accordingly, in cases where an extra-sinus implant path was decided, the final position of the antrostomy was in relation to the number of implants to be placed and the type of the zygoma buttress curvature. The flatter the zygomatic buttress, the more inferior the perforation for the antrostomy was located. In the opposite situation, the more pronounced the buttress curvature is, the higher the entrance was performed.

When treatment planning, attention to the prevention of the most common late complications, i.e., oral-antral or nasal communications or soft tissue recession/infection, is mandatory for achieving a long-lasting successful outcome in zygomatic implant surgery. To preserve sinus integrity and prevent soft tissue complications such as mucosal dehiscence, guidelines have been developed to perform implant osteotomy in the pattern of a tunnel or a channel depending on the architecture of the residual alveolar bone forming the sinus floor and the contours of the maxillary lateral wall. Bone-to-implant contact/support must be achieved for better load distribution in both, tunnel and channel osteotomy types [26, 27].

# 11.3.3.1 The ZAGA "Tunnel Osteotomy" for a Round Implant Design

According to patient-specific, ZAGA zygomatic implant concept, the ZI should enter the sinus cavity directly through the alveolar crest provided that there is sufficient residual bone volume of a minimum  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  high and  $6 - 7\mathrm{mm}$  wide bone is still present below the floor of the maxillary sinus cavity (Table 11.2). In other words, whenever bone architecture at the sinus floor level is sufficient to circumferentially enclose the implant neck with at least  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  of bone, attempts should be made to maintain this bone and to place the implant through it, to minimize the risk of late soft tissue complications (Fig. 11.14a-c).

Providing the clinician feels comfortable controlling the drilling direction a lateral "window"-shaped osteotomy is not recommended to minimize bone injury. The entry point should preferably be located in a position close to the middle part of the crest regardless of the maxillary wall anatomy attaining to place the implant neck fully surrounded by the adequate thickness of pristine bone. The circular osteotomy for implant placement will penetrate at least

Fig. 11.14 (a) Providing the alveolar sinus floor thickness is  $>4\mathrm{mm}$ , ZAGA Concept recommends piercing thorough alveolar bone to reach the zygomatic bone. Sinus entrance will be performed prosthetically driven, regardless of maxillary wall anatomy and sinus lining integrity. Although the cassical "window" antrostomy is not considered strictly necessary, clinicians must decide whether or not to use it. This type of perforation is known as "ZAGA Tunnel Osteotomy." In this figure, a tunnel osteotomy has been virtually performed in a ZAGA type 0 anatomy. (b) Radiographic cut on 2D and 3D visions representing a tunnel osteotomy that has been virtually performed in a ZAGA type 1 maxilla. The prosthetically driven circular "ZAGA
Tunnel Osteotomy" enters the sinus through a  $4\mathrm{-mm}$  alveolar thickness, yet around one-third of the implant body is placed outside the sinus cavity. No slot or window antrostomy, previous to implant placement, is recommended. (c) Radiographic cut on 2D and 3D visions representing a tunnel osteotomy virtually performed in a ZAGA type 3 maxilla. The prosthetically driven circular "ZAGA Tunnel Osteotomy" is placed through the alveolar bone. Maximum respect for alveolar bone remaining is mandatory to allow connective tissue fibers to attach and prevent soft tissue dehiscence. The implant body is placed outside the sinus cavity, no slot or window antrostomy, previous to implant placement, are necessary

4-5 mm of crest, with no special effort to maintain sinus membrane integrity and will adopt either a total, partial, or extra-sinus path on its mid-part until reaching the zygoma bone. The final determination of the relationship between implant and maxillary anterior wall will be determined by the external wall shape. In tunnel osteotomy, performing an antrostomy on the facial side of the maxillary wall is not considered necessary and the ZI enters the sinus cavity directly through the remaining alveolar bone regardless of maxillary wall anatomy/curvature. Actually, the antrostomy is made on the sinus side of the perforated alveolar bone. The rationale to perforate the sinus lining is based on the need to support the neck of the ZI in adequate alveolar bone while reaching a prosthetically optimum implant position. Moreover, with the achievement of optimal stabilization of the implant on the ZAZ will facilitate osseointegration of the neck of the implant at ZICZ (Fig. 11.14a-c). There is no empirical evidence of what the minimum amount of residual bone is able to long term withstand the different masticatory loads applied from the zygomatic implant to the sinus floor bone-implant junction. Indeed, circumstances affecting BIC quality and maintenance at the piercing level can dramatically differ from one patient to the next, i.e., drilling and implant insertion precision, degree of zygomatic implant anchorage/stability allowing or not for micromovements, quality of soft tissue attachment, type of oral hygiene maintenance, history of periodontitis, habits, etc. In other words, if a


theoretically suitable thickness of circumferential alveolar bony support at the zygoma implant platform may be attained, this should be the first option. Nevertheless, given the absence of evidence on this matter, in order to minimize jeopardizing implant movements zygoma implants must be splinted to other conventional or zygoma implants in a rigid "cross arch stabilization system," from the beginning of the treatment, if possible [28-31].

Other authors [32] have proposed an extended sinus lift with extended bone window, such that zygomatic implants are placed outside the intrasinus displaced maxillary sinus wall as a method to avoid the risk of maxillary sinusitis related to ZI placement. Probable bone formation around zygomatic implants underneath the elevated sinus membrane was also suggested. Again, sinus floor thickness evaluation is mandatory to prevent sinus complications. It is important to note that if the preceding method fails in the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the sinus lining, the risk of sinus-related complications may be increased.

Authors of this chapter propose to name the circular osteotomy, described above, as a "Tunnel Osteotomy" because, at the coronal osseous entrance, it has a floor, lateral walls, and more or less complete roof. ZAGA Concept recommends aiming for "tunnel osteotomy" whenever possible, regardless of the maxillary wall curvature (Table 11.2). The rationale being a stable ZI, with a suitable threaded neck profile, surrounded by sufficient bone at the coronal entrance, appropriately anchored on the zygomatic bone and stabilized by adequate prostheses, will achieve osseointegration capable to seal the sinus entrance for the long term. A tunnel can be achieved depending on the existing height and architecture of the remaining alveolar bone at the prosthetically chosen entrance point. This type of osteotomy is typical of ZAGA Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 maxillary wall situations accompanied by an adequate thickness and architecture of alveolar bony support circumferential to the implant neck. The ZAGA Tunnel Osteotomy, by definition, has a circular profile entrance that needs to be sealed by an implant having a round section (Fig. 11.15a, b).

# 11.3.3.2 The "ZAGA Channel Osteotomy" and Flat Implant Design

It is not uncommon to find patients presenting with reduced bone height/thickness or poor architecture at the alveolar crest level, not enough or adequate to allow for an osteotomy capable of achieving and maintaining intimate bone to implant contact all around the neck of the ZI implant. Instead of perforating through a thin crestal or palatal bone the ZAGA Concept recommends displacing the initial entry point of ZI, from the crest of the atrophic alveolar crest towards the buccal aspect of the ridge, aiming to move the osteotomy as far as possible away from the thin crestal bone; in order to maintain sinus membrane integrity at this anatomically compromised point. As previously described [25], the current authors of this chapter suggest to name this technique as the "ZAGA Channel Osteotomy" (Table 11.2). In atrophic cases (e.g., ZAGA types 2 & 4), the ZAGA Channel technique therefore involves preparing the ZI bed on the buccal aspect of the alveolar crest along the lateral maxillary wall whilst avoiding a formal antrostomy at this point. This maximizes the BIC and implant support as the implant is placed in a channel shaped osteotomy that is designed to provide as much congruence as possible within the lateral sinus wall (Fig. 11.16a, b).

The ZAGA Channel Osteotomy (Table 11.2) is a groove made on the coronal alveolar bone, and sometimes also in the lateral maxillary wall and zygomatic buttress. As a waterway or channel, it has floor, lateral walls with more or less height, but no roof. When a "ZAGA Channel Osteotomy" is performed, bone is not covering the buccal implant mid-part nor its neck. It is indicated in anatomical situations where the implant mid-body and neck could not be fully positioned with adequate coverage of bone.

The rationale for this ZAGA Concept recommendation is based on the fact that in patients with minimal crestal bone around implant piercing, under function and in time, bone may resorb. As a consequence, sinus sealing that is performed by a weak hemidesmosome junction may be jeopardized, i.e., inadequate hygiene, use of water pressure devices against the gingival junction, inadequate use of dental probe, etc. [33] speculated that the lack of bony support would end up in transversal mobility of the long coronal part of the zygomatic implant facilitating orosinus communication that is in accordance with Freedman FEA studies [26, 27]. On the contrary, placing the zygoma implant platform partially or outside of the sinus with just lateral maxillary bony support/contact would allow for better prosthetically positioned together with a more conservative approach regarding sinus integrity preservation. It is important to remark that in such an extremely resorbed anatomy model, a strong recommendation is made to, if possible, locate the antrostomy at least  $15\mathrm{mm}$  up from the coronal area of the platform. Indeed, it is also recommended to preserve sinus membrane integrity and as much bone thickness as possible at crest level. To prevent soft tissue injury when placing the implant laterally to the maxillary wall, it is recommended grooving buccal bone to house the implant body as laterally submerged as possible into bone crest in such a way that it does not protrude against mucosal position so that it does not compress soft tissue vascularity. The digging limit is membrane integrity at this level.

A bony canal having a circumference arc section, would, ideally, be sealed by an implant showing a circumference arc section too (Fig. 11.17a-c). Accordingly, a recommendation for the use of a flat implant section design that fits into a channel minimizing its buccal impact against soft tissue is made.
Fig. 11.16 (a) The 2D radiographic visions are characterizing an extremely resorbed ZAGA Type 4 posterior maxilla. The inclined CBCT cut represents the chosen spot for implant placement. A virtual round implant has been placed into a "ZAGA Channel type" osteotomy. A flat implant body design would better adapt to this osteotomy contour minimizing capillary soft tissue compression. Sinus lining should be preserved at the coronal level. (b) The 2D radiographic visions are postoperatively characterizing the implant positioning of (a) To respect sinus integrity, the implant has been displaced laterally in an extra-maxillary position. Lateral walls of the "ZAGA Channel osteotomy" are of minimal height. As the virtual round profile implant is not surrounded by an alveolar bone it may compress soft tissues and future dehiscence should be expected. (c) A flat implant body design (Aparicio 2017) is better adapted to the contour of Channel osteotomy. This allows the remaining alveolar bone to be preserved, and the implant neck to be medially surrounded by bone. The sinus lining can be preserved at the coronal level as perforating the thin covering of the alveolar bone is avoided for positioning of the head of the ZI at the palatal aspect or mid-point of the crest when there is inadequate bone remaining at this important anatomical location

# 11.4 The ZAGA Flat and ZAGA Round Zygomatic Implants: The Story of a Breakthrough

This section dives into the genesis of the new portfolio of "adapted to the anatomy" new zygomatic implants, from design to manufacturing, up until reaching the patients. With two different implant designs: Straumann ZAGA®-Round and ZAGA®-Flat many unique features, this system clearly stands as a breakthrough for the growing field of zygomatic implant rehabilitation. The invention, design, industrial technology transfer, and in fine commercialization is a textbook story from start to finish.

# 11.4.1 The Clinical Pain Points to Solve

Born from the clinical requirements of the end-user in mind, the Straumann ZAGA zygomatic implant system designed by Dr. Carlos Aparicio is described for the first time in a book chapter aiming at solving specific pain points of the oral surgeons:

- The eventual lack of volume in the zygomatic bone, especially when performing quad surgeries.
- The steric problem of implant transporters usually breaking the bony crest, so valuable for soft tissue maintenance.
- The interference of wide implant transporters with anterior hard bone or another implant in a compromised maxilla.
- The lack of strong primary stability in the zygoma area.
- The difficulty for soft tissue anchoring at the crest level.
- The high tension of the soft tissue when placing the implant extra-maxillary in ZAGA Types 2 and 4.
- The bacterial adhesion to implant rough surfaces.

# 11.4.2 ZAGA and Adapted Implant Design

ZAGA, the acronym for Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach, is the concept used to place zygomatic implants in a prosthetically driven man ner and according to the anatomy of the patient. Clearly, the zygomatic implant systems back in the ending of the last century and in the first decade of the current one needed to further adapt to the patient's anatomy and to the current surgical requirements. Adapting the implant design to the anatomy of each patient is critical to reaching clinical success and patient satisfaction, or should we say happiness with a new smile, free of complications. Indeed, if we were to summarize all late pitfalls, they would fall into one of the two following categories: soft tissue complications and rhinosinusitis complications. The use of the ZAGA protocol as well as the design of the ZAGA-Flat and ZAGA-Round Straumann zygomatic implants aims at preventing these complications.


# 11.4.3 A Design Becoming a Reality

A thorough global professional journey around the world-led Dr. Aparicio from his drawing on a desk to the industrial technology transfer of the ZAGA designs by the hand of Graham Blackbeard CEO at Southern Implants. Originally as five different models (Fig. 11.18), a set of two were selected to best solve the clinical limitations of zygomatic implants and adapt to all ZAGA classifications but also to connect to the industrial reality (Figs. 11.19 and 11.20).

Along with patent protection (https://uspto.report/patent/app/20190254781) for the most innovative features of the implants, the portfolio also includes aspects already proven to be appreciated by the oral surgeons. The final ZI design then includes the following:


- A narrower  $3.4 \mathrm{~mm}$  apex diameter. This is possible as implants are fabricated with special cold-worked Grade 4 titanium, shown in bench experiments to increase fatigue strength.
- A rough tapered apex portion to enhance primary stability and match the minimally invasive ZAGA osteotomies.
- A turned machined implant body and head to prevent bacterial adhesion.
- A  $55^{\circ}$  angle correction on the implant platform optimizing prosthetic versatility.
- A model with a flat mid-portion section to reduce soft tissue tension when placed extra-maxillary.
- A model with a round mid-partion section to fit a tunnel type osteotomy when placed intra-sinus.
- A transporter with the same outer diameter as the implant to ease implant placement and preserve the bone crest.

Backed by its scientific approach and building on its legacy of innovation, Straumann now takes the election for the final design (Fig. 11.21) and the universal distribution of the ZAGA-Flat and ZAGA-Round Straumann zygomatic implants. The correct use and indication for zygomatic implant rehabilitation along with several ways to prevent long-term complications represent the main objective of this achievement.

# 11.5 ORIS Criteria to Evaluate Zygomatic Implant Rehabilitation

There is a tendency to validate, and subsequently use, the same diagnostic methods to evaluate the status of teeth and oral implants. The relevance of the periodontal index applied to the peri-implant evaluation of conventional implants has been questioned [34]. Its use in zygomatic implant dentistry may even be less successful. Currently, there is a tendency to consider and evaluate a zygomatic implant in the same way as a conventional implant. However, zygomatic implants differ from traditional implants in biomechanics, clinical procedures, outcomes, and eventual complications. Hence, zygomatic implants are different from regular ones and to consistently evaluate the success of the treatment, compare and in fine enhance the quality of the procedure, criteria of success have been proposed in the literature and used clinically [24, 35]. The multi-aspect evaluation of the treatment success is vital to ensure recovering the quality of life of each patient. Aparicio et al. [36] compared the outcomes in rehabilitating the atrophic maxilla using the original zygomatic technique versus the Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA). Twenty-two consecutive zygomatic patients operated on from 1998 to 2002 and 80 consecutive zygomatic patients operated on from 2004 to October 2009 were selected. All included patients were in a maintenance program. For the first time in a zygoma-related article, sinus health was radiographically and clinically assessed according to the Lund-Mackay system and Lanza and Kennedy survey recommended by Task Force on Rhinosinusitis for research outcomes. The clinical use over time revealed room for improvement in several aspects, leading to the adaptation and creation of the ORIS success criteria [24]. The ORIS acronym is suggested to name four specific criteria to systematically describe the outcome of zygomatic Implant rehabilitation:
Fig. 11.22 The 2D radiographic vision is characterizing the lateral offset of a ZI placed in an extremely resorbed ZAGA Type 4 posterior maxilla: line "a" means the distance between middle palate and the center of the alveolar crest; line "b" means the distance between middle palate and the center of the implant head. The difference of a-b should be as close as possible to  $0\mathrm{mm}$

1. Offset: evaluation of prosthetic success based on final positioning of the zygomatic implant with respect to the center of the alveolar crest (Fig. 11.22).
2. Rhino-sinus status report: a presurgical and postsurgical CBCT comparative approach to evaluate whether sinuses are healthy (Fig. 11.23).
3. Infection permanence related to dehiscence: an evaluation of soft tissue signs of infection or dehiscence on a grading scale based on referenced photographs obtained (Fig. 11.8).
4. Stability report: accepting as criteria of success some mobility until dis-osseointegration signs of rotation or apical pain appear.

The use of the ORIS criteria of success over time as a follow-up tool is key to evaluate the long-term, multi-aspect success of the treatment.

(b) The comparison with the preoperative CBCT shows that the inflammation was already present. In this case the Lund-Mackay test would be negative. (c) CBCT of the same implant taken after a period of 24 months, the inflammation had disappeared

# 11.6 The use of ZAGA Concept and the New Zygomatic Implant Designs on the Extremely Atrophied Maxilla

In our daily practice, it is not uncommon to receive patients presenting very reduced bone height and thickness or poor architecture at the crest level, that does not allow us to perform an osteotomy capable of achieving and maintaining an intimate bone to implant contact surrounding the overall implant neck profile. Indeed, the indications for zygomatic implants have been broadened since they are used not only in cases of lack of bone in the posterior maxilla but also in clinical cases of extreme anterior and posterior maxillary atrophy. Then, four implants anchored in the zygomatic bone ZI are placed. In these new situations, the indication for reaching the zygomatic bone using an intra-nasal implant path, in the same manner as an intra-sinus path that was pre


scribed on the original technique cannot be extrapolated.

As previously explained, The Zygomatic Implant Critical Zone (ZICZ) is the complex formed by the maxillary bone, the soft tissue, and the implant coronal neck at the place where it contacts for the first time with the maxilla. In the presence of extreme atrophy, ZAGA Concept recommends to buccally offset the ZICZ with the aim of sinking the implant neck/body as much as possible into the alveolar and lateral maxillary wall bone while maintaining the sinus lining integrity with no membrane perforation at the ZICZ level.

Implants surrounded by minimal thickness of bone at their entry point may present bone resorption under function and within time. A subsequent oral-antral fistula would appear if bone failed to seal antrum entrance. Indeed, the amount of bone to implant contact (BIC) may be jeopardized by different circumstances, i.e., periodontal disease history, inadequate oral hygiene, use of water pressure devices at the gingival junction, inadequate use of the dental probe, etc. Moreover, it has been speculated that the lack of crestal bone support would end up in transversal mobility of the long coronal part of the zygomatic implant facilitating oral-sinus communication.

Placing the zygoma implant platform outside of the sinus, and with a lateral maxillary bone support/contact, would allow a better prosthetic positioning together with a more conservative approach regarding sinus/nasal integrity preservation. In order to prevent soft tissue dehiscence when placing the implant laterally to the maxillary wall, it is recommended to groove the buccal bone to house the implant body with as much lateral submergence as possible into bone, in such a way that it does not protrude against the mucosal position and does not compress the soft tissue vascularity. The depth limit for the canal digging is the sinus membrane integrity at this level. The use of a flat section implant adapted to this osteotomy type, i.e., the Straumann ZAGA Flat would help the surgeon to prevent soft tissue complications.

The Antrostomy Zone (AZ) is represented by the position where the antrum entrance occurs. In a ZAGA type 4 case, typically found in a quadruple ZI installation, the AZ should be located as far as possible from the ZICZ. The opposite situation for us to imagine would be the one represented by the ZAGA Type 0. Here, the residual alveolar bone is adequate in architecture and height (more than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  height and  $6\mathrm{mm}$  wide) for a "tunnel" type perforation able to maintain bone sealing over time. In this ZAGA type 0 case, the AZ will be located just at the sinus side of the tunnel osteotomy.

A tunnel osteotomy is also recommended in cases of concave maxillary wall where there is less bone height but the zygomatic antrostomy zone (ZAZ) is foreseen to be performed far from the ZICZ after an exteriorized implant path (i.e., ZAGA Type 3). The rationale being a ZI, with an appropriate threaded neck profile, surrounded by sufficient bone at the coronal entrance and stabilized by adequate apical anchorage, and prostheses, will achieve osseointegration at the neck level capable to seal the sinus entrance for the long term. A tunnel can be achieved depending on the existing height and architecture of the remaining alveolar bone at the chosen entry point. Tunnel osteotomy, by definition, has a circular profile entrance that needs to be sealed by an implant having a round section, i.e., the Straumann ZAGA®-Round design (Fig. 11.24).

In a Quad situation, the Zygomatic Anchor Zone (ZAZ) is also represented by the portion of the zygomatic bone where the implant gets its maximal primary stability. As in the double zygoma, the positioning of the ZAZ will vary with respect to the anatomy and specifically with the curvature of the zygomatic buttress. Since the zygomatic bone consists mainly of trabecular bone, structural zygomatic stabilization will be achieved when the four cortical are perforated. The ZAGA Concept does not recommend performing a slot not a "window" previous to implant positioning. There is no need to "see" the implant on its path inside the zygomatic buttress. Indeed, the classic opening of the maxillary wall on its upper part close to the suture zygomatic maxilla is reducing the capability for implant sta bilization and in some situations is decreasing the tapered effect of the implant design. The recommendation is to raise a flap enough to discover the zygomatic bone, its limits, and to be able to place a retractor on the angle formed by the temporal and frontal apophysis.

# 11.7 Zygomatic Implant Network: www.zagacenters.com

The patient with a primary indication for fixed oral rehabilitation anchored to zygomatic implants presents maxillary atrophy in both the anterior and posterior sectors. This patient will only have one chance to receive this treatment. One chance means that if we fail, the patient will be condemned to a removable prosthesis for the rest of his life. That is, if we do not cause additional complications. On the other hand, the number of patients indicated for zygomatic implant placement that a normal-sized clinic identifies is low. This means that the surgeon responsible for that clinic has too long a learning curve.

ZAGA Centers arise in response to the patient's need to be able to easily select centers whose priority is the patient himself; that have accumulated experience with zygomatic implants; that practice a long-term predictable zygomatic implant placement technique (ZAGA Concept); and that use the most appropriate implants and tools for each patient. ZAGA Centers are dental practices that are experts in the treatment of severe jaw atrophy with zygomatic implants. Each ZAGA Center undergoes a strict selection process prior to certification. Criteria include clinical and patient care aspects. Once certified, they participate in the network's activities, which include scientific, clinical, and industrial activities.

The ZAGA Center is locally exclusive and is part of a worldwide network of zygomatic implants (Fig. 11.25). They are local reference centers for patients and other dental clinics. They have and accumulate experience in this treatment. Above all, they are here to respond to each patient's individual problem. If zygomatic implant treatment is the indicated solution, they will thoroughly explain and adapt the treatment plan. In fact, from the diagnosis to the surgical procedure, ZAGA Centers adapt to the characteristics and anatomy of each patient, individualizing the treatment.
Fig. 11.25 The ZAGA Centers Network global map


The ZAGA Center becomes part of a worldwide network. As such, they actively participate in scientific research activities around zygomatic implants. In addition, they have several opinions to help provide the best possible care for each patient. Most ZAGA professionals are authors of peer-reviewed scientific publications. Finally, clinicians harmonize and improve best practices in the field by sharing experiences and advice.

In addition, the ZAGA Centers SL network offers valuable tools for patients such as an informative portal that includes frequently asked questions and testimonials: www.zygomaticimplants.org The portal is available in more than ten languages. Therefore, if a person is looking for information as a patient, he or she will be recommended to visit the Patient Portal.

# 11.7.1 What Is the Goal of the ZAGA Center Network?

To recognize and support professionals with expertise in the rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla using zygomatic implants in a unique geographic area.

The professionals we intend to support have the following characteristics:

Their practice is patient-centered, meaning that it focuses on the patient's well-being.

They use the ZAGA concept for the treatment of severe maxillary atrophy.

They are willing to share their expertise in zygomatic implants to improve treatment outcomes. Both internally (within the network) through meetings, congresses, courses, etc., and externally, by sharing their knowledge through scientific publications.

Being a member of the network implies obtaining a series of benefits, but also acquiring some responsibilities.

# 11.7.2 Benefits and Responsibilities Associated with the ZAGA Network

Differentiation as unique and exclusive members in a global network of experts in zygomatic implants.

Identification by potential patients as a local leader in the treatment of zygomatic implants versus other centers in the same geographic area.

Standardization of practice and protocols, making treatment results more predictable, thus encouraging and increasing patient referrals from other professionals. The goal of our scientific meetings and co-authored publications is precisely to improve our standardized protocols.

Social and ethical responsibility perspective, which is facilitated by collaboration in a group of professionals with similar ethics, philosophy, and social orientation that becomes an influential group. This perspective is nurtured and encouraged by the ZAGA team, for example, with the recent creation of a research grant in zygomatic implants.

Although we consider the above four points to be the main pillars of ZAGA's value proposition for its members, there are other advantages and benefits that can be obtained by belonging to the network, which we at ZAGA headquarters are working hard to facilitate. For example, discounts on materials (implants, 3D models, instruments, etc.), promotion of the network and its members to potential patients, periodic analysis of each center's web positioning, advice, etc.

# 11.7.3 Educational Programs

ZAGA Centers network is committed to sharing and transmitting the philosophy of the ZAGA Concept and in addition to scientific publications, it does so through two major interrelated activities: the theoretical and practical training and the mentoring program.

There are different educational programs organized by ZAGA Centers SL. The ZAGA Zygomatic Implants course is the most well known. It describes our experience of more than 25 years with zygomatic implants in the rehabilitation of the extremely resorbed maxilla. The course is a three-day intensive zygomatic implant course. Participants gain knowledge about the use of this advanced treatment in different anatomies. In addition, they learn about the related prosthetic rehabilitation. We also review different surgical techniques, their benefits, and limitations, including the classic intra-sinus technique, the extra-sinus technique up to the ZAGA philosophy. Precisely, we provide detailed information on the latter to prevent surgical and prosthetic complications. The hands-on training includes the placement of implants on real 3D patient models. After the practice, the trainee will see the actual surgery of the patient corresponding to his 3D model. In addition, the participant receives the DICOM images of his "patient" for virtual planning before starting. After that he will place implants in the 3D model of his cryopreserved donor and finally, the surgical training is completed by placing implants in cryopreserved human heads.

ZAGA Centers also have a mentoring program created to bridge the gap between the theoretical course and the first surgeries with patients. The mentoring program is available on the ZAGA Centers website www.zagacenters.com for both practitioners interested in being supervised by a mentor, while performing surgery and practitioners interested in observing a mentor performing surgery. The mentorship program is open to any surgeon who wishes to learn from mentors.

# 11.8 Conclusions

While zygomatic implants are a predictable alternative to bone grafting techniques, in patients who present with moderate maxillary bone atrophy, they are the first choice of treatment for the rehabilitation of patients with severe bone atrophy, oncology patients as well as patients with full-arch implant failures and associated bone defects. Alternatives, such as bone grafting procedures, have significant disadvantages that include the risk of complications inherently associated with regenerative techniques that require multiple surgical interventions that span over a much-prolonged overall treatment time. Emerging evidence including a recent randomized clinical trial comparing zygomatic implants and regenerative therapies showed that zygomatic implants are a better rehabilitation modality [2].


The ZAGA technique has evolved to standardize the zygomatic implant surgery by adopting an individualized, anatomically and prosthetically guided, implant placement approach to reduce complications and to improve the predictability of long-term treatment outcomes. At the heart of the ZAGA concept is the use of a modified surgical technique according to individual variations in maxillo-zygomatic anatomy; the ZAGA tunnel osteotomy in Zaga types 0, 1, & 3 and channel osteotomy technique in ZAGA 4 cases. The ultimate objective is to achieve maximum stability for the ZI by engaging the three key anchorage points: the crest of the alveolar bone, lateral wall of the maxilla, and the denser zygomatic bone whenever possible, while aiming to achieving optimal prosthodontic emergence profile as well as protecting the integrity of the maxillary sinus by preserving the residual alveolar bone and sinus lining and avoiding vascular compression of the covering soft tissues in extra-sinus pathways.

This has, recently, led to the development by Aparicio of a modified portfolio of Zygomatic implants best suited for different anatomical situations according to the above-described ZAGA concept; the round and flat Straumann ZAGA ZI. These implants with slimline profiles allow the correct coronal positioning of the implant head while preserving the reduced volume of residual alveolar bone. The round ZI has been designed to be used in tunnel osteotomies where the remaining alveolar bone may embrace the implant neck. The flat variant is more suitable for channel osteotomies to seal the sinus wall and achieve the best possible BIC without compressing the soft tissue on its buccal side.


Acknowledgments It is with great pleasure that we acknowledge the work done by Drs. Edmond Bedrossian and SepehrZarrine in collaboration with Dr. Carlos Aparicio to improve the efficiency of the drills required for zygomatic surgery contained in the Straumann cassette.
