# Prevention and the Management of Complications Using the Zygoma Implant: A Review and Clinical Experiences

Edmond Bedrossian, DDS, FACD, FACOMS; Armand Bedrossian, DDS, MSD

Purpose: To review potential complications associated with the zygoma implant reported in the literature and experienced by the primary author, and to discuss prevention and management strategies. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed published reports and combined these with their clinical experience to compile a list of potential complications, with emphasis on prevention and treatment recommendations. Results: Predictable clinical solutions are offered for identification and management of complications, including orbital involvement, intracranial involvement, infraorbital nerve (V2) paresthesia, subperiosteal infections, overextended apical extension, vestibular dehiscence, failed zygoma implant, fractured implant, and sinus infections. Conclusion: A comprehensive knowledge of the specific steps required for the proper execution of this complex procedure will allow for predictable outcomes; systematic reviews have reported cumulative survival rates between 96.7% and 97.8%. Understanding the causes, prevention, and management of potential complications is imperative for the contemporary surgeon using the zygoma implant.

The zygomatic implant is a method to establish posterior support in patients who lack remaining alveolar bone in zones 2 and 3. Multiple studies have documented successful use of the zygoma implant, including a 94.2% cumulative survival rate (CSR) reported by Brænemark et al. in their 1977 retrospective article. Bedrossian and Aparicio et al. reported CSRs of 97.25% and 97.71% in their 2010 and 2012 prospective reports, respectively, using the zygoma implant in conjunction with immediate loading and with 7- and 10-year follow-ups.

In 2013, Chrcanovic and Abreu reported a 96.7% success rate, with the majority of failures occurring during the osseointegration period, and in 2014 Goiato et al. reported a 97.86% success rate when following 1,541 zygoma implants.

## Materials and methods

The authors identified published reports of complications related to the zygoma implant using the PubMed platform. Combining published reports with the authors' clinical experience, they compiled a list of potential complications and offered prevention and treatment recommendations.

## Results

Potential problems associated with the zygoma implant include:

- Orbital involvement
- Intracranial involvement
- Infraorbital nerve (V2) paresthesia
- Subperiosteal infections
- Overextension of the zygoma implant apex
- The "cosmetic" or "other" zygoma implant
- Vestibular dehiscence
- Failed zygoma implant
- Fractured implant
- Sinus infections

## Orbital involvement

The zygoma implant is unique in that it engages a distal bony site (the zygoma) at its apex and the maxillary alveolar crest at its platform. Bedrossian and Brænemark have described the trajectory of the osteotomy and implant in their surgical protocols. The suggested trajectory allows the zygoma implant to be "quad-cortically" stabilized.

The osteotomy trajectory passes through the lingual plate of the residual maxillary alveolus, the base of the maxillary sinus, the lateral-posterior corner of the maxillary sinus, the body of the zygoma, and finally perforates the lateral cortical wall of the zygoma. Proper training and an understanding of this trajectory are essential.

An improper entrance angle of the initial round drill into the floor of the maxillary sinus may establish a more medial trajectory (described in the original protocol as the "yellow" line), directing the path toward the orbital floor rather than through the body of the zygoma (the "red" line). To avoid this medial trajectory, anatomical landmarks and direct visualization techniques have been described and should be used.

Opening a window into the maxillary sinus allows direct visualization of the lateral-superior corner of the maxillary sinus roof. The tip of the round drill can be directly visualized as it approaches this corner from the maxillary alveolar crest starting point.

One published case described damage to the lateral rectus muscle with loss of lateral gaze after the drill and implant entered the orbit and transected the muscle. Even though the implant osseointegrated and vision was preserved, transection of the lateral rectus muscle is difficult or impossible to repair, resulting in persistent diplopia or loss of lateral gaze.

To avoid this complication, surgeons should always directly visualize the drill tip, especially as drills approach and perforate the lateral cortex of the zygoma. This direct visualization also permits correct use of a depth gauge to measure implant length.

### Solution and clinical management

Penetration into the orbit or infratemporal fossa is preventable by direct visualization of the drill tip during osteotomy preparation. Surgeons must understand the intended trajectory and visualize the superior-lateral corner of the maxillary sinus, which corresponds to the apical osteotomy site on the zygoma. The tip of the initial 2.9 mm drill should be seen exiting the lateral cortex of the zygoma before proceeding.

## Intracranial placement

There is a reported case of intracranial placement of the apical portion of a zygoma implant when the implant was used improperly in a pterygoid trajectory, penetrating the middle cranial fossa. The irritation beneath the dura caused chronic headaches; the definitive treatment would require an apicoectomy of the implant tip via craniotomy, which the patient declined.

### Solution and clinical management

Using zygoma implants in trajectories intended for pterygoid implants is contraindicated. Practitioners unfamiliar with maxillofacial anatomy or the zygoma protocol should not perform this procedure.

## Infraorbital nerve (V2) paresthesia

The infraorbital nerve typically exits approximately 6.1 to 10.9 mm from the infraorbital margin. During surgery it may be injured by excessive subperiosteal dissection, inadvertent transection, or compression by retractors, leading to paresthesia, anesthesia, or dysesthesia.

Careful dissection and passive retraction of soft tissues will limit stretch injuries. Attention should also be paid to retractor placement to avoid crushing the nerve.

## Subperiosteal infections

During osteotomy preparation the drill may collect debris from the sinus, alveolus, or zygoma body and deposit debris beneath the periosteum. Failure to irrigate copiously before removing retractors can leave debris that later becomes infected, possibly requiring antibiotics and incision and drainage.

### Clinical case 1

An 18-year-old woman with Chediak-Higashi syndrome underwent zygoma reconstruction. Nine months postoperatively she developed a warm, tender swelling over the left zygoma. A 3D radiograph demonstrated a radiolucent area at the implant apex. Two courses of oral antibiotics failed, so surgical exploration and intraoral incision and drainage were performed.

With copious irrigation, apicoectomy of the zygoma implant and curettage of granulation tissue were completed. The surgical site was closed and the prosthesis replaced. The patient received oral antibiotics for one week and the abscess resolved within 10 days without adverse effects.

### Clinical case 2

A 65-year-old woman treated with the quad-zygoma concept presented six months posttreatment with a soft tissue mass over a zygoma implant. A 3D study showed a radiolucent defect at the implant apex. An extraoral approach via a "crow's-feet" incision allowed direct visualization. The implant apex was removed, the defect irrigated and grafted to reduce the risk of surface contour deformity. Postoperative antibiotics for one week led to resolution and the implants remained functional.

### Solution and clinical management

Copious irrigation of subperiosteal bony surfaces before removing retractors and before primary closure is recommended to reduce the risk of retained debris and subsequent infection.

## Overextension of the zygoma implant apex

Because the lateral cortex of the zygoma slopes, depth gauge readings can be inaccurate if improperly oriented, leading to over- or underestimation of implant length. If an implant apex is overextended and causes patient discomfort, the overextended tip may be removed after osseointegration (typically 6 months) via apicoectomy using an extraoral or intraoral approach with a fissure carbide bur and copious irrigation. If a significant overextension is identified on immediate postoperative imaging, removal and replacement with the correct length implant is advised before discharge.

### Clinical examples

- An 85-year-old woman had a 3 mm overextension removed extraorally at 6 months with no complications.
- A 79-year-old woman had the overextended tip exposed and removed under local anesthesia at a 2-year follow-up without complications.

### Solution and clinical management

Direct visualization of the lateral cortex and depth gauge tip is recommended when measuring implant length; the two commonly accepted depth gauge positions account for the slanted lateral cortex.

## The "cosmetic" zygoma implant

Nine months after reconstruction of a failing subperiosteal implant with the zygoma concept, a patient presented with swelling over the zygoma. Initial antibiotics failed and the patient developed a draining fistula. On exploration a Proplast implant used for aesthetic augmentation of the zygoma was identified as the nidus of infection.

### Solution and clinical management

For patients with prior cosmetic augmentation of the zygoma region, a thorough history and review of preoperative 3D imaging are recommended to identify previous implants or materials that may complicate zygoma implant placement.

## Vestibular dehiscence

Extrasinus placement may result in intraoral exposure of the platform and threads due to muscle pull on unattached vestibular soft tissues, causing irritation and dehiscence. Coverage procedures (advancement flaps, buccal fat pad, Alloderm) have had variable success.

### Solution and clinical management

The ad modum Brænemark technique, which anchors the implant platform at the alveolar crest with the midportion traversing the maxillary sinus adjacent to the lateral maxillary wall, promotes soft tissue adaptation and better force distribution. In cases of severely concave lateral walls (ZAGA 4) or post-maxillectomy defects, the implant platform may be necessarily subperiosteal and dehiscence may be unavoidable; thorough preoperative counseling and hygiene instruction are important.

## Failed zygoma implant

Most failures occur during the 6-month osseointegration phase. Management options for a failed zygoma implant include:

1. Remove the failed implant and delay replacement until after healing (with a conventional maxillary denture during healing), or
2. Remove the failed implant and immediately place a new zygoma implant (allowing continued use of a fixed provisional prosthesis).

When two zygoma implants are placed into the same zygoma, they are typically positioned "on top of each other": the "top" implant has a platform in the premaxilla below the lateral nasal aperture, and the "lower" implant has a platform in the second premolar–first molar area.

### Solution and clinical management

Immediate replacement is considered after evaluation of 3D imaging to identify available bone superior to the failed implant's apex. The failed implant is removed and the new implant placed through the existing crestal position with a more medial apical trajectory ("top" position). The new implant platform can be incorporated into the existing provisional using a temporary titanium cylinder. If delayed replacement is chosen, fabricate a complete denture before implant removal and convert to an immediately loaded provisional once the new implant is placed. Allow approximately six months for osseointegration before definitive prosthesis fabrication.

## Fractured implant

Fractured zygoma implants most commonly present with loss of cross-arch splinting. Unsplinted implants experience significant forces at the implant platform and prosthesis, especially during lateral excursions; splinted cross-arch restorations substantially reduce lateral stress.

Management options:

1. Section the fractured implant at the zygoma bone base, leaving the apical osseointegrated portion in situ, and place a new implant following the failed-implant protocol; or
2. Remove the fractured implant and replace immediately or after approximately 3 months. Removal is difficult because of apical osseointegration and requires careful, patient counterclockwise rotation to disengage the fixture.

### Solution and clinical management

- Map the intended path for the replacement implant with 3D imaging.
- In cases with large crestal defects, place a resorbable membrane over the implant platform to support soft tissue closure and reduce the risk of oral–antral communication if sutures break down.

## Sinus infections

The relationship between zygoma implants and maxillary sinus disease is not fully defined. Some studies show no increased inflammatory reaction of the sinus mucosa where titanium implants pass through, while others report sinus membrane hypertrophy in 15–20% of patients without clinical sinusitis. Exposing implants to the sinus cavity may result in membrane thickening without clinical symptoms.

Evidence suggests titanium does not act as a foreign body causing chronic sinusitis when implants traverse the sinus. Instead, oral–antral communications at the implant platform (allowing bacterial migration from the oral cavity) are more likely to cause sinus infections.

Postsurgical debris inside the maxillary sinus can also migrate and obstruct the ostiomeatal complex (OMC), contributing to sinusitis. Recurrent sinus disease despite medical therapy may reflect OMC obstruction and should prompt referral to an otolaryngologist for possible functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) to restore drainage.

### Clinical considerations

Sinusitis signs/symptoms: pressure, pain, fullness, facial swelling or erythema, malaise, fever, drainage, or foul-smelling mucopurulent discharge. Evaluate 3D imaging to determine whether disease is limited to the maxillary sinus or involves ethmoid, frontal, or sphenoid sinuses (pan-sinusitis).

### Solution and clinical management

Initial management may include humidification, topical/systemic decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine or topical vasoconstrictors), and antibiotic therapy (e.g., amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, cefuroxime, or levofloxacin) when bacterial infection is suspected. Refer to an ENT specialist when the clinician lacks experience treating sinus disease, when symptoms recur, or when medical therapy fails; FESS may be required to reestablish OMC patency.

## Discussion

The zygoma implant is a predictable method to provide posterior support for atrophic maxillae when used by experienced clinicians familiar with regional anatomy and specific surgical protocols. Proper technique and postoperative maintenance, including cross-arch splinting and prosthetic monitoring, are critical to minimize complications.

## Conclusions

A comprehensive understanding of the steps required for this complex procedure is critical for predictable outcomes. Recognizing causes, prevention strategies, and management options for potential complications is essential for clinicians using the zygoma implant.
