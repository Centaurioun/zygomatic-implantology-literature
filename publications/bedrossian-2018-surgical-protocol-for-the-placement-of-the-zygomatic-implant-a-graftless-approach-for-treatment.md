# Surgical Protocol for the Placement of the Zygomatic Implant: A Graftless Approach for Treatment of the Edentulous Maxilla

Edmond Bedrossian and Per-Ingvar Brænemark

# Abstract

Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to review the surgical protocol for the use of the zygoma implant to establish posterior support for the edentulous maxillae.

Method: Review of the literature for the reconstruction of the edentulous maxillae using both the grafting and the graftless approach.

Results: The use of the zygoma implant with and without immediate loading protocols has shown to be a predictable treatment concept.

Conclusion: The result of this contemporary review of the various techniques for the reconstruction of the edentulous maxilla suggests that placement of the two zygoma implants (ad modum Branemark) in conjunction with 2-4 premaxillary implants, rigidly connected and stabilized with a fixed prosthesis, allows for the favourable force distribution during function with long-term success of the implants and prosthesis.

This chapter is being written with great admiration and respect for PI Branemark. His boundless vision for formulating a simplified and predictable treatment option for treatment of patients with significant maxillary resorption and/or defects is greatly appreciated. The author has had the privilege of collaborating with PI Branemark in the publication of the surgical protocol for the placement of the zygoma implant in Fonseca's textbook. It is only an honor and appropriate to have PI Branemark as a postposthumous co-author on the use of this zygoma implant in its more contemporary application.

# 8.1 Historical Perspective

The edentulous maxillae have a unique anatomic presentation that limits the installation of the appropriate number and distribution of implants within the alveolar ridge. The maxillary sinuses bilaterally and the position of the nasal floor in the premaxillary region may limit the vertical volume of alveolar bone available for placement of implants in the maxilla for a fixed, implant-supported prosthesis. The palatal and posterior resorption pattern of the edentulous maxillae may also limit the horizontal bony volume necessary to house endosseous implants.

The typically large pneumatized sinuses in this group of patients require extensive bone grafting if conventional implant placement is envisioned. Various procedures to reconstruct bony volume have been reported in the literature. Adell, [1] Breine, and Branemark [2] used composite grafts to provide a tooth anchorage system. LeFort I osteotomy [3] and iliac block grafts [4, 5] have also been used to re-establish bony volume for placement of implants. To create bone mass in the posterior maxillae, sinus-lift grafting procedures have also been advocated. Survival of implants with sinus-lift procedures was reported as having a  $90\%$  success at the "Sinus lift consensus conference" of 1996 [6]. The conclusion reached in the consensus conference was similar to Tolman's report in 1995 which stated that due to the "multivariate and multifactorial protocols and materials reported, it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions and therefore, these must await controlled prospective studies" [7]. Keller and Tollman have also described grafting of the maxillae with delayed implant placement and delayed loading, with 87 and  $95\%$  implant and prosthetic respective survival rates [8]. Rasmusson using autogenous inlay, onlay, and/or LeFort I procedures [9] presented a success rate of 80 and  $77\%$  for grafting with delayed implant placement and for grafting with simultaneous implant placement, respectively. Other authors in order to recreate the alveolar volume and topography needed for stabilization of dental implants to support a fixed prosthesis have also reported using various bone grafting techniques to reconstruct the resorbed maxillae [2-5].
Fig. 8.1 The zygoma implant has a "quad-cortical" anchorage within the maxilla and the zygoma bones

In more contemporary literature, to avoid extensive bone grafting procedures, tilted implants [10-12] have been recommended for the reconstruction of this group of patients.

For patients with significant anterior extension of their maxillary sinuses, extending forward into the bicuspid region, the zygomatic implant has become commonly treatment planned and utilized. The zygomatic implant allows for establishing posterior maxillary support by using the limited crestal alveolar bone in the bicuspid region to stabilize the platform of the implant and the os zygomaticum for establishing initial stability of the apical portion of the implant, thus allowing for a "quadr cortical" stabilization of the zygoma implant (Fig. 8.1). The use of the zygomatic implant and its success rate have been studied internationally, with reported success rate between 94 and  $100\%$  [13-18].

Branemark in 2004 reported on the cumulative survival rate (CSR) of  $94\%$  in their initial retrospective study of 52 patients treated with the zygoma implant following the two-stage, delayed loading protocol [17]. Bedrossian et al., in their 2010 article, reported on the 7-year prospective follow-up of patients treated using the immediate load protocol with a CSR of  $97.2\%$  [19]. Aparicio et al. in 2014 also reported on ten prospective studies using the immediate load protocol with a similar  $97.71\%$  CSR [20].

Bedrossian in 2011 introduced the "Rescue Concept" using the zygoma implant as part of a decision-making algorithm for cases of failed sinus grafting procedures or in cases of failed tilted implants. This concept allows for continuity of care of the patient without major interruption in their treatment [21].

In recent years, the popularity of the use of the zygoma implants has also increased due to favourable systematic reviews by Chrcanovic et al. and Goito et al. [22, 23]. Chrcanovic et al. reported a  $96.7\%$  success rate over a 12-year follow-up period. Goito et al. in turn reported a  $97.86\%$  success rate following 1541 zygoma implants.

# 8.2 Patient Selection

In planning patients with the zygoma implant, a "systematic preoperative evaluation protocol" is required before the surgical treatment [24]. Both surgical and prosthetic needs must be considered before initiation of the surgical treatment to allow for a predictable outcome. The preoperative evaluation protocol takes into consideration the available alveolar bone in the different zones of the maxilla (Fig. 8.2). The zygomatic implant is considered in the group of patients who demonstrate bone in zone
Fig. 8.2 Zones of the maxilla: Zone 1, cuspid to cuspid; Zone 2, bicuspid area; Zone 3, molar area
Fig. 8.3 The transition line should be hidden apical to the extreme smile line for aesthetic outcome

1 only. The systematic preoperative treatment planning protocol also evaluates and determines whether the final prosthesis is a ceramo-metal bridge or profile/hybrid prosthesis. The determination of the type of prosthesis is based on the lack or the presence of "composite defect". If hybrid prosthesis is considered, recognizing the level of the transition line preoperatively allows for an aesthetic outcome of the final prosthesis. The "transition line" is defined as the junction between the hybrid prosthesis and the residual edentulous crestal soft tissues (Fig. 8.3) that should always be apical to the extreme "smile line" for an aesthetic outcome.

# 8.3 Radiographic Evaluation

Although computerized and conventional tomography can be used, the Panorex radiograph is critical in the initial evaluation of the patient [1, 9, 16, 18]. The presence of alveolar bone in the premaxilla, zone 1, and lack of bone in the bicuspid and
Fig. 8.4 Reformatted frontal view of the maxillary sinuses and the zygoma bone. The maxillary sinuses as well as the naso-ethmoidal sinuses are visible the molar regions, zones 2 and 3, respectively, are the indications for considering the zygomatic concept [24]. In 2003, Nkenke et al. [25] evaluated the anatomy of the zygomatic bone, describing that reformatted frontal images in 2 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  cuts afford the less experienced operator more information for planning the surgery (Fig. 8.4).


Frontal and axial 3-dimensional slices can also be obtained to further evaluate the maxillary sinus, naso-ethmoidal complex, bony osteomeatal complex as well as contour of the lateral maxillary walls allowing for the adoption of the ZAGA classification concept [26]. The width of the residual maxillary alveolar bone and the width and height of the zygomatic body can also be visualized in frontal reformatted sections. The presence of sinus pathologic conditions including, but not limited to, thickening of the Schneiderian membrane and air fluid levels may also be ruled out using 3-dimensional radiographic studies.

# 8.4 Primary Load-Bearing Bone Under Function

The indication for the placement of the zygoma implant is lack of bone in zones 2 and 3 (bicuspid and the molar region, respectively). For patients where the zygoma implant is considered there is less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of residual maxillary alveolar bone remaining in the bicuspid and molar regions. Therefore, after placement of the zygoma implant, minimal bone-to-implant contact is achieved at the alveolar crest. Knowing that bone-to-implant contact (BIC) is limited at the maxillary crest, the questions become these: How important is BIC at the maxillary crest in distribution of the occlusal forces? Is there a benefit for having crestal maxillary bone at the implant platform?

Ujigawa and colleagues [27] in an elegant finite element analysis described the weight-bearing bones associated with the use of the zygoma implant. In their 2007 Finite Element Analysis paper, they reported that the zygoma bone, and not the maxilla alveolus, supports the simulated occlusal loads. However, in 2013 as well as 2015, Freedman et al. [28, 29] corrected the observation in the Ujigawa study. The highlighted area over the lateral cortex of the zygoma reported as the load-bearing
Fig. 8.5 Origin of the masseter muscle highlighted under function area in the Ujigawa study was instead the origin of the masseter muscle under activation (Fig. 8.5). Freedman et al. demonstrated in their papers that the maxillary crest plays a role in the distribution of the occlusal loads and the preservation and anchoring of the implant in the maxillary crest are recommended when possible.


# 8.5 Deformation Under Function

Past clinical reports [30] support the observation and highlight the importance of cross-arch splinting zygoma implants with other stable implants in the premaxilla to allow for a more favourable force distribution under function.

In 2013, the objective of the Freedman et al. study was to investigate the influence of maxillary alveolar bone on the stress distribution and the deformation of zygomatic implants under function. Two study models were created. The first model had the zygomatic implants placed in the skull supported by the zygoma and the maxillary alveolar bone with rigid cross-arch stabilization by a fixed bridge. The second model duplicated the first model; however the area of the maxillary alveolar bone supporting the zygomatic implants was removed. Occlusal and lateral forces were applied to both models and the maximum von Mises stresses were recorded. In the model lacking alveolar support higher maximum stresses were noted. Occlusal stresses were higher than lateral stresses in the model with no alveolar support. The zygoma bone demonstrated low stresses in both models. Therefore, the authors concluded that the maxillary alveolar bone support is beneficial in the distribution of forces for zygomatic implants.
Fig. 8.6 Computer-generated model of the extra-sinus technique with the maxillary crestal bone removed

In 2015, Freedman addressed the extra-sinus placement of the zygoma implant. The first model had two zygomatic implants placed in the skull in an extra-sinus position connected by a rigid cross-arch splinted bridge. The second model was the duplication of the first with the area of the maxillary alveolar bone supporting the implants removed, which is an inherent consequence of this type of implant placement (Fig. 8.6). Occlusal and lateral forces were applied with higher maximum stresses noted in the model with no alveolar support (Fig. 8.7a). Occlusal stresses were higher than lateral stresses in the model with no alveolar support (Fig. 8.7b). Occlusal stresses were lower than lateral stresses in the model with alveolar support. Low stresses were noted in the zygomatic bone in both models. They concluded that "Maxillary alveolar bone support is beneficial in the distribution of forces for zygomatic implants placed in an extra-sinus position".

# 8.6 Preoperative Considerations

The surgical procedure is usually performed in the office setting under IV sedation [15]. All patients are premedicated  $1\mathrm{~h}$  before the surgical procedure. The proper administration of sufficient local anaesthesia is critical in the management of these patients under IV sedation. The various infiltrations and nerve blocks include circumventibular infiltration of the maxilla, greater palatine blocks, and bilateral transcutaneous infiltration of the temporal areas over the zygomatic body. Bilateral inferior alveolar nerve blocks are considered to allow retraction of the lower jaw during the surgery without undue stimulation of the sedated patient. It is recommended that the path of the implant from the premolar area to the base of the zygoma be directly visualized whenever possible [15, 31]. Direct visualization of the base of the zygomatic body has also been advocated in clinicians who have used computer-assisted treatment planning and surgical templates for placement of the zygomatic implant [31]. Having a clear view of the path of the instruments needed in establishing the osteotomy and visualizing the path of the implant during its insertion prevent disorientation and potential complications associated with placement of the zygomatic implant. Generally, three potential trajectories of the implant are possible. The proper axis/trajectory is a path extending from the bicuspid region through the maxillary sinus, entering the mid-partion of the zygomatic body. If the entry

Fig. 8.8 Trajectory of the zygoma implant: The red line is the proper trajectory. Yellow line will be intra-orbital and purple line will be in the pterygomaxillary space point in the zygomatic body is more anterior to the described trajectory, potential for penetration into the orbit exists. However, if the line axis is posterior to the described trajectory, the potential for entering the pterygomaxillary space, leading to soft-tissue enveloping and subsequent lack of osseointegration of the implant, as well as the potential for unexpected haemorrhage exist (Fig. 8.8). The zygomatic implant has a unique design. The diameter at the apical two-thirds of the implant is  $4.0\mathrm{mm}$ ; at the alveolar one-third, the implant widens to a diameter of  $5.0\mathrm{mm}$ . The zygomatic implants are available in lengths ranging from 30 to  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$ . A specialized series of long zygoma drills are used to prepare the osteotomy (Fig. 8.9).


# 8.7 Surgical Options

In reconstruction of the edentulous maxilla with the zygomatic implant, two approaches are considered. The first is the traditional two-stage protocol [13, 15]. Clinicians may also consider the immediate-load protocol [15, 31]. The two-stage protocol requires the immediate cross-arch splinting of the zygoma implants at the time of the Phase II procedure. This can be accomplished efficiently by using the CAL technique (Fig. 8.10) for the fabrication of a passive bar before the uncovering procedure [30]. The patient's denture is adjusted to accommodate the CAL bar and after healing of the soft tissues final impressions of the implants are taken for the fabrication of definitive fixed hybrid prosthesis. An alternative and more contemporary technique for the cross-arch splinting of the zygoma implants at the time of uncovering, in a delayed loading protocol, is to splint the zygomatic implants with the premaxillary implants by conversion of the patient's existing denture into a fixed provisional bridge using the same direct or indirect conversion technique described for the conversion protocol used when immediate loading is considered.

# 8.8 Surgical Protocol

The surgical procedure begins by making a crestal incision across the edentulous maxillary arch. Bilateral releasing incisions are made over the maxillary tuberosity, similar to the hockey stick incisions for removal of maxillary wisdom teeth exposing the maxilla. Preparing the trajectory of the osteotomy for placement of the zygomatic implant is a critical step. There is only one trajectory of the zygoma implant as described by PI Branemark [32-34]. However, recently there has been a confusion of nomenclature and new recommended surgical protocol with the term "extra-maxillary" approach [23]. If the so-called extra-maxillary approach is used in cases of ZAGA 0, 1, 2, and 3, undo removal of the crestal bone at the maxillary alveolus will result potentially affecting the even distribution of the functional forces as described by Freedman et al. in their 2015 finite element study of the extra-maxillary technique [29].


Aparicio in 2011 described the various relationships the mid-partition of the zygoma implant may have with the lateral maxillary wall [26]. The lateral maxillary wall may be "straight" or "concave". If it is concave, then a portion of the mid-shaft of the zygoma implant may be "outside" the maxillary sinus. The classification described by Aparicio is ZAGA 0 (straight lateral maxillary wall with the mid-pportion of the zygoma implant inside the sinus) to ZAGA 4, which is the most extreme resorption of the maxillary sinus with a significant concavity where the mid-partition as well as the platform of the implant are "outside the maxillary sinus" due to the existing concavity of the lateral maxillary contour.

The authors emphasize that the trajectory of the osteotomy for the placement of the zygoma implant is to be followed as described by Professor Branemark. The intra- or extra-sinus relationship of the mid-partion of the implant (Fig. 8.11) is simply an observation after the placement of the implant following the Branemark's
Fig. 8.11 Various contours of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus in relationship to the mid-portion and the platform of the zygoma implant
Fig. 8.12 Potential for soft-tissue dehiscence of the buccal mucosa seen in cases where the implant is placed extra-sinus description of the starting and ending point of the osteotomy. It is the patient's lateral maxillary wall contour which determines whether a portion of the implant is extrasinus or not as well as whether there is crestal engagement of the implant platform or not. It is recommended that clinicians study the contour of the lateral maxillary wall and use the ZAGA classification in their treatment planning protocol.


The surgeon must appreciate that in cases where a significant concavity is present with the implant platform not having anchorage at the crest of the maxillary bone, the presence of the implant directly beneath the vestibular depth may lead to erosion of the mucosa and exposure of the implant shaft (Fig. 8.12). A limited number of case reports have been published for the management of these exposures [35, 36]. In extreme cases such as ZAGA 3, ZAGA 4, or in cases of total or partial maxillectomy, the zygoma implant will be immediately below the soft tissues of the vestibule and the occurrence of soft-tissue dehiscence cannot be prevented. In all other cases, attempts should be made to place the mid-portion within the sinus following the Branemark protocol. The inclusion of the buccal fat pad graft either at the time of the initial surgery or as a "preventative" measure against soft-tissue dehiscence only adds unnecessary morbidity for the patients. Therefore, it is the recommendation by the authors to continue the ad modum Branemark technique as described earlier in order to minimize the long-term response of the soft tissues if the patient's lateral maxillary wall contour allows.

Establishing the proper trajectory of the implant following the Branemark protocol may take several attempts by the surgeon. After exposing the posterior maxillary alveolar ridge and the lateral wall of the maxilla, the distal portion of the lateral maxillary wall as it turns medially to form the posterior maxillary sinus wall is identified. This is the vertical "corner" of the posterior portion of the maxillary sinus as represented with the "black dotted line" (Fig. 8.13). To begin the osteotomy, a rectangular opening through the lateral maxillary wall is made into the maxillary sinus with the posterior trajectory of the opening paralleling the "black dotted" line.

The Schneiderian membrane may be removed or reflected away from the inside of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus (Fig. 8.14). It is critical to be aware of the position of the Schneiderian membrane and to ensure that it does not attach to the zygomatic implant during its insertion into the body of the zygoma. Introduction of the soft-tissue Schneiderian membrane into the body of the zygoma will lead to non-osseointegration of the zygomatic implant.

Fig. 8.14 To allow direct visualization of the path of the drills and implant, the Schneiderian membrane may be removed or reflected
Fig. 8.15 The initial round drill is directly visualized as it makes a purchase point in the base of the zygoma bone

The osteotomy is initiated by the use of a round bur (Fig. 8.15), which enters the maxillary sinus through the crestal osteotomy. Its path is directly visualized through the bony window established through the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. To confirm the proper trajectory of the round drill, the shaft of the round drill should parallel the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus opening which in turn parallels the "black dotted" line. The round drill creates a small indentation in the base of the zygoma bone to prevent the  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  drill from chattering. At this point, the round drill is removed and the  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  drill enters the floor of the sinus. It travels through the maxillary sinus, enters the zygoma bone via the roof of the maxillary sinus, and eventually exits at the fronto-zygomatic notch. It is important to appreciate that the shaft of the  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  drill is also parallel to the posterior wall of the opening into the maxillary sinus (Fig. 8.16). A 2.9 to  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  pilot drill is used next to create a shallow osteotomy within the zygoma bone which stabilizes the  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  final drill used to complete the osteotomy both at the maxillary crest and at the body of the zygoma (Fig. 8.17).

If greater than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of crestal bone is identified, the alveolar portion of the osteotomy is completed by introduction of the  $4.0\mathrm{mm}$  twist drill. In cases where there is a limited crestal bone width and/or height, the  $4.0\mathrm{mm}$  drill is not used. Before implant placement and at all times during preparation of the osteotomy, the entire surgical paths of the drills and the implant are visualized (Fig.8.18).

Once the implant has been fully seated, its proper trajectory is confirmed by the distal portion of the zygomatic implant body being immediately adjacent and in intimate contact with the posterior wall of the lateral maxillary wall (Fig. 8.19). The platform of the zygomatic implant is generally in the second bicuspid or the mesial half of the first maxillary molar (Fig. 8.20). To facilitate implant placement, the premounted implant carrier allows for easy handling of the implant with the straight zygomatic hand piece (Fig. 8.21). The 45-degree angulations of the zygomaticus

Fig. 8.21 The preinstalled fixture mount "straightens" the implant allowing for its placement implant allow for the platform of the implant to be in the same plane as the vertically placed implants in the premaxilla. To ensure proper orientation of the angulated implant head, the premounted fixture carrier screwhead is used as a guide. Once the zygoma implant is placed to the proper depth a "stargrip" screwdriver is inserted into the head of the fixture mount screw. The shaft of this screwdriver must be at right angles to the edentulous ridge to ensure proper orientation of the implant platform (Fig. 8.22).


In patients where immediate loading is considered, the premaxillary implants are placed with an initial insertion torque setting of  $20\mathrm{Nm}$ . Upon "stalling" of the hand piece, the insertion torque setting is increased to  $40\mathrm{Nm}$  allowing complete insertion and seating of the implants.
Fig. 8.22 The shaft of the star-grip driver must be perpendicular to the alveolar ridge ensuring the proper orientation of the zygoma implant platform
Fig. 8.23 2 or 4 axial implants may be distributed evenly along the premaxillary arch length in Zone 1

The same protocol is followed for the placement of the zygoma implant with the additional use of the "onion" driver which allows the zygomatic implant to be hand driven to its final insertion depth, with the implant platform intimately in contact with the lateral wall of the maxillary alveolus. The criteria for the immediate loading of the premaxillary implants and the zygoma implants include a minimum of 40 Ncm of insertion torque [37]. A minimum of two premaxillary implants is required [38]. Four premaxillary implants may be considered if they can be distributed evenly within zone 1 (Fig. 8.23).

In procedures where immediate loading is not planned, and the two-stage protocol is adopted, the surgical wound is closed using 4-0 Vicryl. The denture base over the gingiva covering the platform of the zygomatic implants is relieved to prevent loading and wound breakdown. In patients planned for the immediate load protocol, 3-0 gut is used to close the soft-tissue wound, and the patient's existing full denture is converted to the immediate provisional fixed prostheses using multiunit abutments and titanium temporary cylinders (Fig. 8.24).

# 8.9 Prosthetic Conversion Technique

To provide the surgical patient with a fixed provisional prosthesis immediately following the surgical procedure, conversion of the patient's existing full denture or the conversion of the newly fabricated immediate denture is undertaken [37, 39]. The preoperative denture should be at the proper vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) and proper tooth position [40-42]. Once the implants have been placed with 40 Ncm insertion torque, healing abutments are connected. The heights of the healing abutments are chosen so that after suturing of the crestal incision,  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of the healing abutment is above the soft-tissue line. The multiunit abutments are seated and torqued to  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  (Fig. 8.25). The patient's denture is adjusted to allow passive seating without interference from the healing abutments and distortion of the soft tissues. Blue mouse bite registration is flowed into the denture as it is seated in the mouth, ensuring proper occlusion with the apposing dentition and proper midline orientation. This allows the positions of the healing abutments to be imprinted into

Fig. 8.25 Complete seating of multiunit abutments which are torque to  $35\mathrm{Nm}$ the blue mouse as it sets (Fig. 8.26). An acrylic bur is used to perforate the denture base, marking and relating the positions of the implants with the denture acrylic. Care must be taken not to make excessive holes or to fracture the denture base. The denture with the prepared holes is once again seated in the mouth in the proper position. To connect the prosthesis to the abutments, temporary multiunit titanium cylinders are used (Fig. 8.27). The temporary titanium cylinders are cold cured to the denture base using quick-setting denture repair acrylic (Fig. 8.28). Upon hardening of the acrylic, the denture is removed from the patient's mouth by unscrewing the retaining screws. The voids on the tissue surface of the denture base, around the

Fig. 8.30 Sealing of the prosthetic screw channels temporary titanium cylinders, are further reinforced with the quick-setting acrylic, ensuring that no acrylic is introduced into the seating surfaces of the cylinders (Fig. 8.29). The palate and the denture flanges are removed. Re-contouring of the acrylic on the intaglio surface of the prosthesis is completed in an attempt to remove all concavities, which may trap food. The patient's occlusion is checked, ensuring group function and uniform loading across the entire prosthesis in centric occlusion [43, 44]. To avoid bending moments in lateral excursions, bilateral equal group function with 0-degree teeth is used in the fabrication of this provisional prosthesis. A temporary material of choice is used to cover the retaining screw hole of the completed provisional bridge (Fig. 8.30).


# 8.10 Postoperative Care

Patients are asked to maintain a soft diet. Incising of food is discouraged for the first 3 months. Postoperative medications include oral antibiotics for 1 week and an analgesic of choice, as needed. All patients are asked to use  $2\%$  chlorhexidine rinse  $20\mathrm{min}$  before sleeping every night. A 1-week follow-up appointment is made to ensure proper occlusion, wound healing, and stability of the prosthesis. If screw loosening is encountered, occlusion is checked, eliminating hyperocclusion on selected areas and interference in lateral excursions. Patients are seen as needed over the next 6 months. Bruxism on occasion will result in the fracture of the provisional prosthesis. The prosthesis may be repaired intraorally or indexed and removed for a laboratory repair at the fracture site. The use of night guards made for the provisional prosthesis and the continual use of a new night guard made after the fabrication of the final definitive prosthesis may aid in management of the excessive forces generated by this group of patients.


# 8.11 Discussion

It is important for surgeons to recognize that there is a single trajectory of the zygoma implant as described by the Branemark ad modum technique. It is also important to recognize that Aparicio [26] has described the relationship of the zygoma implant to the varying anatomy of the lateral maxillary wall; the trajectory of the zygoma implant does not change regardless of the maxillary anatomy being ZAGA 0 or ZAGA 4. The zygoma implant is recommended when there is less than  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  in zones 2 and 3. Under function and in time, the minimal crestal bone may resorb. However, it is prudent to follow the ad modum Branemark technique to allow initial stabilization of the implant as well as better force distribution as described by Freedman and co-workers.
