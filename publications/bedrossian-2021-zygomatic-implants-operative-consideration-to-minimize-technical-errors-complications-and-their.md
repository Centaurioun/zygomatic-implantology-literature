# KEY POINTS

- Fundamental knowledge of the maxillofacial anatomy and physiology are necessary to perform this advanced procedure. Proper training including the understanding of the prosthetic and surgical biomechanical principles is paramount.
- The entire trajectory of the drill as well as the implant path is critical to avoid complications. The apex of the 2.9-mm drill must be directly visualized penetrating through the lateral cortex of the zygoma bone.
- Appreciation of the zones of the maxilla and the ZAGA classification, which outlines the contour of the lateral maxillary wall and the level of palatal resorption pattern of the maxillary crestal bone, is critical for the understanding of the intrasinus versus extrasinus position of the midportion of the implant.

Treatment of the edentulous maxillae with the zygoma implant requires extensive knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the maxillofacial region. This article highlights a few of the principles in the prevention and management of potential complications with the zygoma implants.

Zygoma trajectory: The starting and end points for the zygoma implant are definite and consistent regardless of whether it is placed intrasinus or extrasinus. The platform of the zygoma implant is generally in the second bicuspid/first molar region with the apex of the implant protruding through the lateral cortex of the zygoma bone (Fig. 1).

Whether the midportion of the implant is within the maxillary sinus or outside of the maxillary sinus depends on the contour of the lateral maxillary sinus wall (Fig. 2). The contour of the lateral maxillary sinus wall can be straight (blue line), concave (green line), or severely concave (red line) to missing as seen in maxillectomy cases.

As described by Freedman and colleagues in 2013 and 2015, presence of bone around the zygoma implant platform is most desirable because it is the primary support of occlusal forces under function (Fig. 3).

Zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) classification: Aparicio described the contour of the lateral maxillary sinus wall in their article on zygomatic anatomy-guided approach. However, the classification has been misinterpreted in the literature. This classification simply describes whether the lateral maxillary sinus wall is straight, slightly concave, very concave, or missing (Fig. 4); it is not a technique; it is simply a radiographic observation using the frontal view of the 3-dimensional radiographic study of patients. If the illustrations in Fig. 4 were superimposed on top of each other, the implant platform and the implant apices would exactly overlap on each other confirming that there is a single trajectory to the zygoma implant.


Understanding the relationship of the zygoma implant platform and the prosthetic screw access channel position in the provisional or the final prosthesis is important for the entire implant team. The team has to appreciate that the edentulous maxilla resorbs in the superior and the medial direction, yet the arch form contour remains constant.[8]

In a nonresorbed or a minimally resorbed maxillary alveolus, the implant platform represented by the black dotted line and the arch form representing by the red dotted line are coincident and superimpose on top of each other. Therefore, the prosthetic screw access channel will be in the center of the molars and the cingulum of the anterior teeth as seen in (Fig. 5).

However, in moderate to significantly resorbed maxillae, owing to the medial resorption pattern of the edentulous alveolus, the implant platform will be in the resorbed residual crest, the "new" position of the black dotted line, which is now lingual to the red dotted line. Therefore, the screw access channels will not be in the central fossa of the molar teeth or in the cingulum of the anterior teeth. Instead, the screw access channels will be in the pink portion of the hybrid prosthesis as seen in (Fig. 6).

To claim that for patients with moderate to severe resorption pattern of maxillary alveolar bone the zygoma implant platform can be placed with the screw access channel emerging through the central fossa of the posterior teeth is simply not true. Therefore, removing the crestal bone as described in the extrasinus technique is not in the best interest of the patient (Fig. 7).

Clinicians should be aware that a probable postoperative complication with the placement of the zygoma implant outside the maxillary sinus, as in the extrasinus technique, is the dehiscence of the overlying soft issues due to muscle pull (Fig. 8).

However, in cases of ZAGA 4 where the maxillary crest is severely resorbed or absent as in oncologic cases, the dehiscence of the soft tissues is unavoidable. In ZAGA 0, 1, 2, and 3 cases in which the engaging of the crestal bone with the implant platform is possible, it is difficult to objectively explain the occurrence of soft tissue dehiscence if objections are raised by patients or other clinicians in regard to the ongoing maintenance of the intermittent irritation and infections (Fig. 9).
Fig. 2 Midportion may be inside or outside the maxillary sinus.


Rescue concept<sup>10</sup>: Two sites are available for placement of two zygoma implants within the same zygoma bone. As described earlier, the trajectory of the zygoma implant is from the residual crest of the maxilla up into the body of the zygoma bone. In cases in which 2 zygoma implants are placed within the same zygoma bone, the apex of the zygoma implant in the posterior (premolar-molar) region is the lower position shown by the blue arrow. The apical position of the second zygoma implant placed in the anterior (lateral incisor-cuspid) position is shown by the green arrow (Fig. 10).

Understanding the trajectory of the 2 zygoma implants within the same zygoma bone allows the surgeon to remove a fractured or a failed zygoma implant; immediately replace it with a new zygoma implant keeping the implant platform in the original position, on the crest of the maxilla (Fig. 11); and

correct the trajectory of the osteotomy to allow for the placement of the apex of the new zygoma implant in the superior position.

The panorex demonstrates a fractured zygoma implant in position no 14 (Fig. 12). The treatment for the immediate replacement of the implant is removal of the fractured implant with immediate replacement with a new zygoma implant as described previously.

The plan (Fig. 13) is to cut the fractured implant at the base of the zygoma bone because attempts to trephine the implant would probably result in removal of the lower lateral portion of the zygoma bone in total.

To replace a fractured zygoma bone immediately with a new zygoma implant, after exposure of the lateral maxillary wall, the midportion of the implant is identified (Fig. 14).

The fractured implant is cut flush with the base of the zygoma bone (Fig. 15), and the new implant is placed with its apex in the superior position while keeping the implant platform as close to the original implant position as possible (Fig. 16).

After closure of the flap, the new zygoma implant is incorporated into the existing immediate load provisional (Figs. 17 and 18) and allowed to heal for 6 months before fabrication of the final prosthesis.

After allowing 6 months of healing time, the final prosthesis is fabricated (Fig. 19).

If a zygomatic implant fails before fabrication of the final prosthesis, the failed implant can be removed in total as it has not osseointegrated and the superior position within the same zygoma body can be used to stabilize the new zygoma implant (Fig. 20).

In preparation for the immediate replacement of a failed zygoma implant, a three-dimensional scan (Fig. 21) is taken and the potential for entering through the same crestal position (red dot) and extending the trajectory of the rescue zygoma implant following the white dotted lines is evaluated.

The information gained by the evaluation of the scan is transferred to the patient. A localized flap is made to expose the trajectory of the nonosseointegrated zygoma implant (blue dotted lines), and the new trajectory following the white dotted lines is planned.

If a crestal bony defect is present after placing the new zygoma implant, a resorbable membrane is placed and secured with the abutment and one to two 1.5-mm fixation screws securing the membrane (Fig. 22). The membrane is placed not for the purposes of regenerating bone; it is placed as a barrier to avoid an oral-antral communication in case of the soft tissue breakdown during the healing period.

The regional flap is closed in preparation to directly connect and pick up the position of the new titanium cylinder, which is used to incorporate the new implant with the existing provisional (Figs. 23 and 24).

After an additional 6 months of osseointegration for the rescue zygoma implant, the final prosthesis is fabricated (Fig. 25).

Sinus infection: Titanium does not induce a foreign body response within the maxillary sinus. $^{11-13}$  Titanium protruding into the maxillary sinus may cause hypertrophy of the Schneiderian membrane without clinical signs of infection. $^{14,15}$  Sinus infections are due to the blockage of the osteomeatal complex (OMC). Initial treatment is to prescribe routine home care including the use of humidified inhalation treatment and treatment with antibiotics and at times decongestants. However, in cases of chronic sinus infections wherein home care and medications do not resolve the congestion at the osteomeatal complex, physical enlargement of the OMC is accomplished by referral to an otolaryngologist for functional endoscopic sinus surgery, the FESS procedure. $^{16}$

Maxillary sinus infections in the presence of zygoma implants are generally unilateral (Fig. 26).
Fig. 34 Intraoral approach for apicoectomy of the overextended apex.

In order for the maxillary sinus to drain properly, a patent OMC is critical (Fig. 27). The OMC is composed of the bony uncinate process, middle meatus, and the lower portion of the ethmoid sinus complex on the same side. These bony boundaries are lined by soft tissues, and the inflammation of the soft tissues in response to allergens, infection, or neoplastic disease is the cause of the OMC blockage.

The edema caused by infection, results in the blockage of the OMC, the passageway, and therefore results in the failure of palliative chemotherapy (Fig. 28).

The FESS procedure removes the uncinate process and the middle meatus and unroofs the ethmoid air cells, increasing the volume of the bone passageway. As a result of the enlarged drainage path of the maxillary sinus, the soft tissue inflammation that may occur if future infections occur cannot occlude this patent, large, modified new OMC and therefore allows for the sinus to drain and respond to palliative chemotherapy as needed (Fig. 29).

Fig. 30 demonstrates the infected sinus before the FESS procedure. Fig. 31 represents the post-FESS procedure showing the clearance of the infection as the maxillary sinus can now drain through the enlarged, patent opening.

Overextension: Improper measuring of the length of the osteotomy from the maxillary crest to the lateral aspect of the zygoma bone can lead to irritation and/or infection of the overlying skin if the implant length is too long. $^{17}$  The apex of the zygoma implant may be flush with the lateral wall of the zygoma bone or extend beyond it for no more than 0.5 to  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  (Fig. 32).
Fig. 35 Extraoral approach for apicoectomy of the extended apex.
Fig. 36 (A) Soft tissue dehiscence and infection caused by overextension of the implant. (B) Radiographic presentation of extreme overextension beyond the lateral cortex of the zygoma bone.


Overextension of 2 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  may be an irritant for patients with thin overlying skin (Fig. 33).

If there are complaints from the patient due to irritation when washing the face or any other daily function, the apex of the zygoma implant can be removed by performing an apicoectomy either intraorally (Fig. 34) or via an extraoral approach (Fig. 35).

However, extreme overextensions as seen in Fig. 36 are unacceptable, and immediate removal of the implant should be performed as potential for infection and/or soft tissue erosion is predictable.

The treatment of the young patient with the aforementioned existing draining fistula included the removal of the overextended portion of the zygoma implant intraorally to avoid further potential deformation and scarring of the overlying soft tissues at the apex of the implant (Fig. 37).

The use of the zygoma implant is recommended in cases in which there is absence of zones 2 and 3 in the resorbed maxillae. In these cases, 2 axial implants are placed in the premaxilla (zone 1) in conjunction with zygoma implants in the right and left posterior maxilla (second bicuspid-first molar area). The absence of all zones, 1, 2, and 3, necessitates the use of 4 zygoma implants commonly referred to as the quad zygoma concept. $^{18}$


The zygoma implant concept has been well documented in the literature with more than  $97\%$  success rate.[19,20] However, it is certainly an advanced procedure requiring a comprehensive training and knowledge of the maxillofacial anatomy and physiology.

The management of potential problems associated with the zygoma implant also requires understanding of the physiology of the maxillary sinus and the associated structures in the midface to prevent or manage potential complications.

It is strongly recommended that clinicians engaging in the treatment of patients with the zygoma concept have the proper understanding and appreciation of the anatomy and the physiology of structures in the maxillofacial region. A command of the prosthetic principles for the rehabilitation of this group of patients with loss of teeth as well as the hard and soft tissues of the maxillae is also imperative.

Following the ad modum Branemark surgical protocol, with emphasis on patient to maintain a soft diet and keep periodic follow-up appointments to ensure stable cross-arch stability of the prosthesis with the implants is essential for favorable long-term prognosis.

# Clinics care points

- The direct visualization of the trajectory of the drills and the implant is absolutely necessary.
- The relationship of the midportion of the implant and the implant platform to the lateral maxillary wall and the maxillary crest is best described by the ZAGA classification.
- Copious irrigation of the sinus is indicated after completion of the osteotomy and before placement of the zygoma implant.
- Copious irrigation of the subperiosteal field above the zygoma bone is indicated before removal of the retractor from the frontozygomatic notch.
- Zygoma implants that are exposed into the oral cavity, should always be cross-arch splinted.
