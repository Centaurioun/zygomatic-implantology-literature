# Abstract

Purpose: To determine the survival rates of modern roughened surface dental implants in the pterygoid region.

Methods: This systematic review was an update from a previously published systematic review in 2011, which largely reported data on older machined surface dental implants. An electronic search for articles in the English language literature published from January 1, 2010 to December 8, 2021 was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and CENTRAL search engines. After applying a systematic search process in three stages, the final list of selected articles on roughened surface pterygoid implants was obtained. Data from the selected articles were collated with data from pertinent articles on roughened implant surface from the previous systematic review. The combined data were then used for calculating the interval survival rate and cumulative survival rate (CSR) of pterygoid implants.

Results: The initial electronic search resulted in 1263 titles. The systematic search process eventually resulted in 10 clinical studies reporting on modern roughened surface pterygoid implants. These 10 studies reported on a total of 911 pterygoid implants with 39 reported failures over a 6-year period. The majority of failures (37) were reported during the first year time interval and a majority of them (30) occurred before loading of the pterygoid implants. Only two late failures were reported after loading, during the sixth-year time interval. The majority of implants were used for rehabilitation of full-arch fixed implant-supported prosthesis. At the maximum follow-up interval of 6 years, the CSR of pterygoid implants with roughened surfaces was  $95.5\%$ , which was  $5\%$  higher than reported in the previous systematic review which combined machined and roughed surface pterygoid implants.

Conclusions: The survival rate of modern roughened surface dental implants in the pterygoid region is favorable at  $95.5\%$  over a 6-year period, and comparable to the existing evidence on survival of implants in other regions of the maxilla and mandible.

Pterygoid implants were first reported in 1989 by Tulasne, who credited Paul Tessier with the idea of placing implants in this region to serve as a rescue implant in a failed implant situation.[1,2] Pterygoid implant is defined as "an endosseous implant placed through the maxillary tuberosity and engaging the pterygoid plate; indicated for retention of a dental prosthesis or maxillofacial prosthesis in the maxillae."[3] Pterygoid implants typically encompass three bony regions: maxillary tuberosity, the pyramidal process of the palatine bone, and the region between the medial and lateral pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone.4 Bidra and Huynh-Ba have described in detail the differences between implants placed in the tuberosity region and implants that truly qualify as pterygoid implants.4


Over the past 30 years, the application of pterygoid implants has grown to overcome the need for maxillary sinus lift and grafting procedures, improving the anterior-posterior spread of implants for complete arch fixed implant-supported prosthesis (CAFIP) as well as for patients with maxillofacial defects. $^{5-14}$  The primary reason for using pterygoid implants is the availability of dense cortical sphenoid bone for engagement of the implant. This can allow improved primary stability and also allows immediate loading of the pterygoid implant. $^{4}$  However, the disadvantages of the pterygoid implant are the technique sensitivity related to the procedure, proximity to vital anatomic structures, learning curve, and difficulty in access for clinicians and patients. $^{4}$


Historically, all dental implants were manufactured as a "turned" or a smooth machined surface with minimal variations in geometry.[15] However, with improved knowledge and understanding of the osseointegration process, the importance of a roughened implant surface and surface chemistry became paramount. Roughened surface implants have significantly higher implant survival, especially in the maxilla.[15] From the year 2000 onward, most implant manufacturers made a paradigm shift in producing roughened surface implants, where the amount of roughening is variable and the technology to achieve the roughening is exclusive and proprietary to each manufacturer.[15] For pterygoid implants, Balshi et al conducted two consecutive studies, one on 356 machined surface implants for a cumulative survival rate (CSR) of  $88.2\%$  and a second study on 164 roughened surface implants for a CSR of  $98.6\%$ .[12,16] The authors concluded that the TiUnite roughened surface (Nobel Biocare) was the primary reason for the significantly improved survival rate.[12]

In a previous systematic review on pterygoid implants from 2011, Bidra and Huynh-Ba reported a CSR of  $90.9\%$  over a 6-year period. However, due to the paucity of data available at that time, the authors had combined data from machined and roughened surface dental implants across a total of nine studies. In light of new scientific evidence over a 10-year period that has exclusively described the use of modern roughened surface dental implants, it is necessary to understand the clinical outcomes of these implants in the pterygoid region. Additionally, it is necessary to know if these outcomes are different than the previous evidence. Therefore, the purpose of this updated systematic review was to determine the survival rates of modern roughened surface dental implants in the pterygoid region.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines method was used to perform an electronic search of the English-language literature using PubMed, Scopus, and CENTRAL search engines. The specific search strings used for the electronic search are described in Table 1. A previous systematic review published in 2011 had search dates of January 1, 1974-August 31, 2010. For this updated systematic review, to ensure no articles were missed, the search dates were January 1, 2010 through September 17, 2021. The PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) format was applied to develop the focus question: in patients with dental implants in the pterygoid region, what are the short-term and medium-term survival rates of roughened surface implants compared to other surfaces (if any)?


The inclusion criteria were: any English-language article or bilingual article with English as one of the languages in a peer-reviewed journal and any clinical study on humans involving any of the search terms listed previously. The exclusion criteria were: articles that did not pertain to implants in the pterygoid region, articles that did not clarify the type of implant surface, literature reviews on non-clinical articles without associated clinical trial and data, case reports/series/studies with less than 10 patients with endosseous implants in the pterygoid region, patients or data being repeated in other included articles, articles describing implants that were not endosseous in nature, article description that did not allow extraction of the required data, articles that did not clarify whether tuberosity implants engaged the pterygoid plates, and articles that did not study implant survival.

The electronic search process was systematically conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. First, the updated inclusion criteria were applied to the previous systematic review from 2011 and the qualifying articles were extracted. Then, specific search terms were used to develop a search string across three search engines (Table 1). Then, the three-stage process of the systematic search was conducted. In stage 1, the authors screened all relevant titles after duplicate records were removed by automation and search limits for human studies. In stage 2, the authors independently analyzed abstracts of all selected titles, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. Thereafter, the final list of articles was screened at stage 3 by the authors to obtain qualitative and quantitative data. The data from the final list of articles were collated and analyzed for short-term and medium-term survival rates of modern roughened surface pterygoid implants by using an actuarial method for life-table analysis.

In this systematic review, the authors defined "implant failure" as the reported absence of a roughened surface implant in the pterygoid region before, or after supporting a prosthesis. Short-term survival was defined as the absence of a failure 1-5 years after insertion, and medium-term survival was defined as the absence of a failure 5-10 years after insertion. By using the actuarial method for life-table analysis, the extracted quantitative data were used to calculate the interval survival rate (ISR) and the CSR. Both elements were used to compute the ratio of surviving implants in a group during a specific interval (ISR) or the ratio of surviving implants over the entire observation period (CSR). The calculation of the inter-reviewer agreement at the title and abstract stage was performed by using Cohen's kappa method. As none of the included studies had a consistent definition of implant success or did not report on implant success, this was not analyzed in this systematic review.

# RESULTS

Applying the updated inclusion and exclusion criteria to the previous systematic review from 2011 resulted in the extraction of five studies. The systematic electronic search process using the specific search strings shown in Table 1 yielded 1263 titles from which 484 duplicate records were removed to result in 779 articles for screening (Figure 1). After the systematic search process of reviewing abstracts and full-text articles, five articles were included that met the study criteria. Combining this with the five clinical studies from the previous systematic review resulted in a total of 10 full-text articles

(Table 2). Of these, six were retrospective studies and four were prospective studies; six studies were conducted in private practice settings and four studies in university settings (Table 3). The number of patients ranged from 15 to 392, and the number of implants ranged from 10 to 454 across the 10 studies. The most commonly reported surgical complication was hemorrhage (three studies) and misplaced implants (two studies). The most common roughened implant surface that was described was TiUnite (Nobel Biocare) in five studies. The implant lengths ranged from 11.5 to  $20\mathrm{mm}$  across the 10 included studies. Only one study reported the use of pterygoid implants for partially dentate rehabilitation, while the

The pooled data from all included studies showed 39 reported failures out of 911 pterygoid implants (Table 4). Out of these 39 failed implants, 30 failures occurred before loading, indicating that the pattern was a failure to osseointegrate. The remaining nine failures occurred after loading. There was no consistent definition or description of implant success in any of the 10 included studies.[17] Out of the nine failures, seven of them occurred during the first year since implant placement and two of the delayed failures occurred during the sixth-year interval. At the maximum follow-up interval of 6 years, the CSR of pterygoid implants was  $95.5\%$  (Table 5). No survival rate could be calculated beyond 6 years due to the lack of available data in the present review. Additionally, prosthodontic outcomes of prostheses supported by pterygoid implants could not be extracted due to a paucity of data. Similarly, risk of bias assessment could not be performed due to a lack of sufficient data or reporting in the included observational studies.[18]

# DISCUSSION

The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the survival rates of modern roughened surface dental implants in the pterygoid region. Findings from this review showed that roughened surface pterygoid implants have high CSRs of  $95.5\%$ , which are comparable to implant survival rates in other regions of the jaw. Compared to the previous systematic review published 11 years ago, the results are more favorable in this review, confirming that roughened implant surface plays an important role in implant survival.

In the previous systematic review, the CSR over a 6-year period for machined and roughened implant surfaces of 897 implants was  $90.9\%$ . However, 471 of these implants were machined surface implants, out of which 55 implants failed during the first year, yielding a survival rate of  $88.3\%$ .

It is important to note that the majority of failures of pterygoid implants occurred during the first year, and before loading, indicating that failure to osseointegrate is more common than the failure of osseointegration. This is likely due to the fact that pterygoid implants originate in the posterior tuberosity region where the bone quality is known to be trabecular and extremely soft, which may affect the primary stability of the implants. Nevertheless, the 6-year  $95.5\%$  CSR of pterygoid implants is comparable to the CSR of zygomatic implants (95.2% at 12 years) and the CSR of implants with sinus floor augmentation (97.7% at 6 years) reported in other systematic reviews.[19,20] It is also important to note that the literature identified in this systematic review had minimal descriptions related to implant success. This is a limitation of the systematic review and future authors should consider defining success criteria and render clarity on implant success versus implant survival.[17]

Systematic reviews of observational studies have been common in prosthodontics due to the limited number of randomized clinical trials.[18] With advancements in medicine and enhancements in technology occurring at a rapid pace, it is necessary to scrutinize and update systematic reviews, as the results of systematic reviews may become out of date and thereby provide misleading information.[21,22] Updating systematic reviews is generally more efficient than starting all over again when new evidence emerges.[22] Several systematic reviews have recently been updated and published in dentistry encompassing a wide range of topics that shed light and impact clinical practices.[23-26] Even the Cochrane collaboration supports the updating of systematic reviews and provides guidelines for updating.[21]

This updated systematic review provides promising data to the clinician to utilize pterygoid implants as a favorable alternative to sinus floor augmentation or zygomatic implants, both of which are more invasive, expensive, and may risk compromising sinus health.[19,20] Though the review did not find any articles that reported data beyond a 6-year period, it is expected that as the popularity of pterygoid implants increases, future investigators will report on long-term data on roughened surface pterygoid implants. Additionally, given the important finding that the majority of failures of pterygoid implants occurred during the first year, and before loading, it may compel implant manufacturers to provide innovative solutions for designing implants specific to the pterygoid region.

implants with roughened surfaces was  $95.5\%$ , which was  $5\%$  higher than reported in the previous systematic review which combined machined and roughed surface pterygoid implants. This is comparable to the existing evidence on the survival of implants in other regions of the maxilla and mandible. The majority of implant failures in the pterygoid region occurred during the first year and before the loading of the implants.
