Abstract: This article on the History of Dental Implants spans beyond the last 100 years of the AAOMS. It was not until materials and methods became less traumatic to the bone that implants became firmly attached to the surrounding bone. This phenomenon is now utilized to replace single and multiple teeth and restore the patient to function and well-being. Many of the methods used to increase denture function are still utilized with modification to augment the environment for an implant. Technological changes allow patients to be treated efficiently, with the same need for a good treatment plan and physical evaluation by the clinician.

# Introduction:

Humans have always had to face the problems associated with tooth loss. In ancient times the inability to effectively bite and masticate minimally processed food was a threat to one's survival. With advances in food processing, survival was no longer the concern; rather, the ability to enjoy a wide range of foods and food textures became the primary motivation to try to retain one's teeth or search for ways to replace missing teeth. In more modern times facial esthetic factors gained importance in both maintaining one's dentition, and with the rise of contemporary dental techniques, the replacement of missing teeth became possible and desirable.

The means of managing tooth loss have evolved over hundreds of centuries. Originally attempted by transplanting teeth from one individual to another, strategies to engineer an anchored dental root-form or other substructure have been tried for centuries. These early dental "implants" have variable success, with success typically measured in months before infection or loosening of the implant required its removal. Thus, supragingival removable prostheses and tooth-borne dental bridges were the mainstay of tooth replacement care.


Breakthrough biologically-based research in more recent decades brought the ability to truly replace the roots of lost teeth with a high likelihood of lifetime service; this has revolutionized implant dentistry.

This article chronicles the history of implant dentistry, with a focus on developments occurring during the past 100 years, as part of this Journal's celebration of the founding of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (AAOMS) and 75 years since the launch of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (JOMS).

Replacement of missing teeth has a long history; however, it was not until recent times that endosseous implants were manufactured with roughened surfaces, placed without trauma to the adjacent bone, and were restored with functional restorations that are projected to be successful long term. Preprosthetic surgery procedures used to treat edentulous patients for improved denture function have been modified for current use. Technological advances allow for efficient care with implant placement with high accuracy and high precision on every patient. However, the need for an accurate and thorough physical examination of the patient to provide them with a solution for their problems has been consistent over time.

# Ancient Implants

Ancient Egyptian and South American civilizations did fabricate implants to replace teeth. Some were placed post-mortem and some were placed during the lifespan of the recipient patients. The implants were made from other animal's teeth or carved ivory. It is doubtful that these implants functioned without early failure (1, 2).

Replacement of tooth roots was performed in Europe in the  $17^{\text{th}}$  century using a variety of materials and animals. In the next century teeth were transplanted from donors who sold their teeth to individuals desiring replacements. These transplants did not do well secondary to rejection (3). Shulman describes the problems with early implant designs which were placed in the 1800s. These were a variety of gold or lead devices placed into extraction sites; however these failed (4).

Early  $20^{th}$  century

Greenfield in 1913 developed a basket style endosseous implant composed of iridium with gold soldering. A trephine drill was used to prepare the site and the basket style implant placed and loaded with a crown. This implant was used as a single tooth replacement of a full arch replacement (5).

Adams in 1938 patented and developed a submergible threaded cylindrical implant with a smooth gingival portion and a healing abutment (6). The final prosthetic design was a ball-hitch type connection for an overdenture, with resiliency built in to simulate a periodontal ligament function. This concept is very similar to several current implant overdenture designs.

As metallic devices were being implanted elsewhere in the body, materials were adapted and developed as endosseous implants. Cobalt-chrome-molybdenum (Vitallium, Howmedica Corporation) was used by Strock in 1938 (7). This was a threaded design placed into a fresh extraction socket and covered with autogenous bone. The patient receiving the first such implant was reported to have successful function until he died in 1955 (7, 8) Figure 1.

A variety of endosseous implant designs followed which included wires in helical patterns, threads similar to common wood screws, all with various tooth bearing portions to offset functional loads (8).

In an effort to provide improved masticatory function for the edentulous patient, combined with the development of impression materials, the subperiosteal implant was developed (8). Dahl used a subperiosteal design to restore a maxilla and mandible (9).

Further development of the subperiosteal implant used a two stage method using an impression of the bone for laboratory fabrication of the implant gained popularity (8). However, late failures from settling of the framework into bone secondary to micromotion, combined with gingival recession, resulted in lack of further use in the more modern era. There were reports of long term success however the complications from loss of bone and implant settling were so severe that this method is no longer used (10-13). Endosseous implants that are currently used with an increase in predictability have replaced the subperiosteal implant.


# Development of current implant designs

In the early 1960s endosseous implants were designed with a variety of retention schemes. Titanium rods were drilled into the bone emerging in the area of the desired crown. The pins were bent and secured with resin. Intraoral welding of the titanium rods to each other was also used but the long term results were not predictable (14).

The majority of the implant designs in the early 1960s were one piece implants, either solid screws or a hollow basket design. These implants did not form an intimate connection between bone and implant. They developed a fibrous implant interface without bone integration. "Fibrointegration" was promoted as beneficial (15).

Blade implants as reported in 1987 (16) have had success; however, the predictability of the blade implant did not reach the levels of integrated implants (17). The blade implant preparation method used high speed drills to create a channel within which the blade implant was placed and tapped into final position. Clinical problems included apical settling of the blade implant with function resulting in complications related to nerve issues and gingival recession with bone loss. However, when placed without trauma to the bone some of these blades are still in function many years after placement.

In the mid-1970s another type of implant was introduced. The transosteal implant was placed in the anterior mandible for overdenture support. An incision was made in the submental fold exposing the symphysis. A drill jig was used to orient the implant with emergence of screws/pins into the oral cavity to provide retention and support for an overdenture. The mandibular staple had excellent clinical results with evidence base reporting (18). Bosker had a similar design using gold as the transgingival portion which was also very successful (19). However, the need for a general anesthetic, the incision in the skin, and occasional gingival issues made this type of implant less popular comparing these to more common endosseous implants. The interface of the screw thread through the gingiva did not create a sufficient seal in a significant number of patients resulting in progress bone loss over time, especially in the older patient who may not have had good follow up for hygiene maintenance.


In order to set criteria and establish standards for objective follow-up, the NIH co-sponsored a Dental Implant Consensus Conference in 1978. The proceedings of this conference outlined a variety of measures which could be used to objective follow up of a dental implant (20). This conference combined with Branemark's work has set the current standard for evaluation of implants.

The use of endosseous, osseointegrated implants was introduced to North America in 1982. In this conference, Branemark and colleagues presented 15 years of work which was highly evidence based with long term clinical follow-up. Success was measured by evaluating bone loss based on standardized radiographs, gingival health, function, and patient comfort (21, 22).

The Branemark designed implant and its use set several standards and is detailed in a book, which includes the critical evidence for implants used today (22).

1. The implant was fabricated from commercially pure (CP) titanium.
2. The implant had a rough surface with irregular roughness from the machining of the titanium.
3. The implant was placed with minimal bone trauma. There were a graduating sized set of drills with small increments of bone removal with each use. The implant site had threads formed by using a tap (Figure 2). The implant had an external hex which when connected to a driver mount allowed for passive implant placement. A 6-month period of time was allowed for bone to attach to the implant. The abutment did not engage the external hex. The superstructure was secured to the abutments with gold screws (Figure 3). These implants were initially designed for the edentulous patient

4. The mechanical solution by cross arch stabilizing implants to 5 implants in the mandible and 6 implants in the maxilla had excellent success regarding implant survival and prosthesis survival. By cross-arch connecting the implants, the compressive and tensile forces are distributed within physiologic limits of the implants and the bone-implant interface, which were osseointegrated (Figure 4). This cross-arch stabilization design is still used today with minimal modifications.

Cylindrical implants without threads were designed and placed in the 1980s and 1990s. These relied on titanium plasma sprayed surface coatings or hydroxylapatite coatings. However, crestal bone loss did occur with implant failure in a group of patients (23, 24). Currently most implants placed have a threaded design rather than a cylindrical "press-fit" design (25).

# Advances in Treatment Planning

There have been significant advances in methods for treatment planning. These advances are technological in nature. The clinician must still examine the patient.

Establishing the goals: There have been no changes over the years concerning the need to establish patient goals and expectations. Each patient must be individually assessed to determine their expectations. If they have an esthetic tooth which needs replacement, it is natural for the patient to desire the same level of esthetics that they had prior to tooth removal. If they have gingival recession, swelling, or an obvious pathological condition, the patient may still expect an ideal result. It is the responsibility of the clinician to accurately predict the final result, and communicate this with the patient. If the patient is missing their teeth they most likely desire a full arch fixed replacement which allows them function and a return to their prior appearance. This has not changed over time.

Data collection: There have been technical changes over time. These include but are not limited to cone beam computerized scanning, intraoral optical scanners, digital photography, merging of digital and analog data for virtual planning, milling technology to fabricate guide stents, provisionals and abutments, as well as the use of digital management systems within offices. Many offices do not have file rooms for paper charts. Many offices do not take models using impression materials; rather they use optical scans. Reduction of technological advances to practice is an ongoing adventure for all clinicians.


Diagnostic Methods, Implant designs, and Adjunctive procedures which have expanded restoration of the patient.

Implants must be placed in their ideal location. This starts with accurate diagnosis and planning. The use of a panoramic images combined with peri-apical films were used by most surgeons until the cone beam scanner became popular. The cone beam computerized tomogram (CBCT) provides cross section views, 3-dimensional imaging of the bones, axial, frontal, and sagittal projections, as well as provides a digital data set (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine or DICOM) which can be used for virtual planning. DICOM data was initially used for visualization of the bones and soft tissues, followed by import into software programs to virtually place implants, create surgical guide stents for static navigation, and fabrication of prostheses prior to the surgical placement of the implants (26).

Historical denture related protocols for preprosthetic and implant related procedures start by establishing the correct vertical dimension and functional positioning of the teeth. This is accomplished by fabricating provisional prostheses, often a new set of dentures. Once the arrangement and function of the teeth has been established, the new diagnostic denture prosthesis is used for imaging the patient and designing the implant - supported prosthesis with the best combination of implants and prosthetic components available. This has been done with analog materials such as stone models, and recently advanced to digital methods using scanners for intraoral or model digital files.

The use of intraoral scanners provide digital images as .stl files which allow superimposition of the patient's teeth or a model setup onto the CBCT scan for further virtual planning. The increase use of digital methods to plan implant positioning increases efficiency for the treating clinicians as well as the laboratory. All new methods take time to be incorporated into the mainstream of clinical use. The use of the CBCT rather than a routine panoramic film is an example of the time it takes to incorporate a new method into a routine for most clinicians (Figure 5).

Examples of historical development of patient care

Single tooth replacement: The most common tooth to be removed is a first molar. In the 1980's these teeth were removed and allowed to heal prior to implant placement. However in the maxilla, labial bone often resorbed resulting in the need for ridge augmentation. In order to maintain ridge form, xenografts and allografts were placed into the socket and allowed to form bone prior to implant placement. It is not clear that grafting the socket, in the presence of intact buccal bone, is necessary.

Allograft, when used to graft third molar sockets in patients, was found to form more bone in the socket compared to empty controls (27). Xenograft has been used to preserve alveolar form by placing it within an extraction site, with a fast resorbing collagen material placed over the crestal opening of the socket. This technique was used predominantly in the esthetic zone (28). The use of allograft or xenograft to graft the extraction socket continues into the current time period.

In posterior sockets with labial bone loss the graft tends to provide space maintenance for bone formation and replacement of the missing buccal bone (29, 30). In the anterior maxilla, due to expected resorption of the thin labial bone, the use of grafting materials with slow resorption rates is common. Many combinations of recombinant proteins, growth factors, resorbable and non-resorbable membranes, and variations have been used. With the advent of navigation the need for flap elevation has decreased to preserve ridge anatomic form by presumably maintaining the periosteal to bone interface.

# Patients missing teeth and bone

Historically grafting edentulous patients included onlays or inlays. Onlay grafts were harvested from ribs, iliac crest, or calvarium. When used as an onlay followed by denture use, the resorption of the graft reached at least  $50\%$ . When onlays are used to generate bone height, followed by implant placement and function, the resorption of the graft height seems less (31).

Inlay grafts, also termed interpositional osteotomies with grafting, can result in a stable vertical augmentation of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  or greater (Figure 6). After the bone heals the implant size can be determined using CBCT planning software (32, 33). Short implants may still be necessary depending on the amount of vertical augmentation achieved. Most of the augmentation procedures for vertical height will add 2 to 7 millimeters of bone height, allowing for short implants to be used. There have been reports of the use of lingual based, relaxed flaps to cover larger augmentations. Clinicians may find that the vertical augmentation procedure is technique sensitive. Short implants may be very useful in the current time period because the enhanced surface provides greater surface area for bone formation with excellent results.


Short implants of  $6\mathrm{mm}$  in length have comparable success rates compared to longer implants (34, 35). This is attributed to the increased surface roughness. The increased surface roughness increases fibrin adhesion, platelet aggregation, and osteogenesis on the implant's surface (36, 37) (Figure 7). The enhanced surface has a microsized and a nano level of roughness. There is recent evidence as per Davies (36, 37) that the rougher surfaces promote bone formation on the implant surface. The clinical ramifications are unclear because there is limited clinical trial evidence directly comparing blasted vs blasted and etched surface. In the early development of implants commercially pure titanium was used to fabricate the implants. Due to the development of internal interface designs, there have been strength issues due to thin areas on the platform/shoulder level of the implant. Thus a titanium alloy has been used to strengthen the implant. As long as the surface roughness is comparable to CP titanium, the alloy implants have had comparable success, with less implant breakage issues. Manufacturers must demonstrate to regulatory agencies that implants they fabricate have appropriate roughness.

# Horizontal width deficiency

There are multiple etiologies for a narrow alveolar ridge. Historically the denture patient with a thin ridge needed more tissue support. When considering denture stability, the horizontal ridge has been augmented with autogenous bone harvested from the iliac crest, calvarium, mandibular symphysis, or mandibular ramus. These grafts in general worked well but did have resorption rates that were unpredictable. The more cortical bone used, the more prone the graft was to fail due to late bone turnover and revascularization problems (40). Thinner cortical bone had less vascularization problems but more resorption. Because of these findings and morbidity from a second surgical site for bone harvesting and onlay graft resorption, non-resorbable alloplast augmentation was performed through tunnels to augment the narrow ridge. The tunneling method is now used for ridge augmentation prior to implant placement, but uses materials that are replaced with bone.

Tunneling for ridge augmentation is chosen if the vertical height is sufficient yet the ridge is narrow (38, 39). Open procedures can be used as well, including particulate or solid autogenous bone, with or without coverage with membranes. Titanium mesh or resorbable foils can be used to maintain ridge form, or a ridge split procedure can be used. In general autogenous bone onlays are prone to resorb over time. Autogenous grafts can be placed through tunnels with excellent results most likely due to appropriate technique and soft tissue coverage of the graft (40). The clinician will choose the procedure that results in the least morbidity yet achieves an optimal result, with long term maintenance (40). Currently the thin ridge with adequate vertical bone can be augmented with several techniques with a high level of success.

# Posterior maxilla:

A maxillary molar needs to be removed. In the past panoramic or periapical radiographs were taken to visualize the location of the sinus and adjacent bone. When using these older 2-dimensional radiographs, it was always difficult to visualize the bone in the furcation area. With the cross sectional images available with the cone beam scan (CBCT), the amount of bone available and presence of pathologic bone loss can be accurately determined prior to tooth removal. This has led to grafting at the time of tooth removal (41), simultaneous vertical bone augmentation through the use of intrusion of furcation bone (42, 43), and more accurate lateral window approaches to augment bone in this region.

In the past the molar tooth would be removed and allowed to heal for four to six months. Because of the thin facial bone over the buccal roots, horizontal bone resorption was common. To preserve the socket size, grafts containing allograft or xenograft or combinations are currently used to preserve the width. Because of the perceived anticipation of crestal width changes over time, implants are recommended to be placed preserving  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of buccal wall thickness. In the presence of exudate or bone loss the maxillary molar is removed and the socket grafted. If there is intact buccal bone after the tooth is removed, consideration is now given to immediate implant placement. If the thickness at the furcation region is limited, intrusion of the furcation with grafting can be used to augment the vertical height for later implant placement. If there is sufficient bone available the site is prepared and the implant is placed. If there are defects present where the tooth sockets are located, these defect are grafted. Unfortunately there is very limited clinical trials experience with these variations.


# Sinus Grafting

Placement of implants into the posterior maxilla requires an adequate amount of bone to stabilize the implant. In the edentulous patient, onlay autogenous grafts placed to improve ridge height resulted in over  $50\%$  resorption (44). Implants placed into onlay autogenous grafts also had an increased failure rate compared to implants placed into intact bone. Sailer used the Lefort 1 procedure to expose the maxillary sinus from the superior aspect. He harvested cortico-cancellous blocks of iliac bone and secured them to the maxillary sinus with immediate implant placement. These results were encouraging (45, 46). An early study using the dog model indicated that implants, when placed with penetration of the nasal floor or maxillary sinus, did well (47). Thus, there was evidence that bone could be formed on the superior aspect of the sinus floor either by grafting or by maintaining space when the sinus membrane was elevated from the sinus floor.

Boyne's initial work indicated that if the surgeon carefully elevated the sinus membrane and maintained a space between the membrane and underlying bone, bone formation would occur (48). This finding, using at first autogenous bone, was followed by several studies which replicated the findings that a graft could increase vertical bone height when placed into the sinus between the membrane and the sinus floor. Materials used included autogenous blocks of bone (49), with immediate implant placement to particulate autogenous bone (50) combined with allografts and

Xenografts.

In general, when the thickness of the bone between the maxillary sinus and the alveolar crest is less than  $9\mathrm{mm}$ , increasing the thickness of the alveolar sinus floor by bone grafting is one option that will support implants and prosthetic restoration. The graft material chosen must provide adequate viable bone to stabilize the implant initially and encourage osseointegration. Materials used for sinus floor grafting include autogenous bone, allogeneic bone, xenograft, and recombinant bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) (51). Long-term assessment of the amount of grafted bone in the sinus, remaining adjacent to implants placed into the grafts, has been reported within case reports, small case series, and limited retrospective reports (51-57).

In the recent times, clinicians have been using materials that eliminate or significantly decrease the need for using autogenous bone. Another alternative for the primary graft material is the use of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) (58). BMP can be placed within the sinus under an elevated membrane and forms bone within the sinus without the use of other materials.

Recombinant BMP is expensive and when used by itself can result in increased swelling in the patient.

The consensus conference sponsored by the Academy of Osseointegration (54) and other studies indicate that xenografts used by themselves or combined with autogenous bone worked as well as autogenous bone alone. This opened the spectrum of using a less morbid approach by avoiding hip or tibia bone harvesting to grow bone within the sinus to support dental implants.

Patient indications for grafting the maxilla have remained the same over the last several decades. Exclusion criteria still include smokers, patients with uncontrolled systemic disease, patients taking medications that adversely affect bone healing, and the presence of pathologic conditions within the sinus or adjacent to the surgical site.


The preoperative radiographic examination in the past utilized analog type radiographs to image the sinus. Current examination begins with a cone beam scan. The traditional panoramic radiograph has excessive magnification error and is unable to determine the cross section location of the bone and associate septi. A cone beam is the current method of choice to determine bone morphology and sinus disease prior to sinus augmentation.

# Surgical Technique

Lateral window approach: The surgical procedure involves the removal or medial rotation of a window of cortical bone from the lateral aspect of the maxilla without perforation of the sinus membrane (51). Patients, who have had recent molar extractions with sinus membrane scarring at the tooth's apex, or those with septi, may be more prone to sinus membrane tears when elevating the sinus membrane. A crestal approach with elevation of the floor with the membrane seems to have a smaller incidence of adverse sinus problems.

# Crestal Approach for Sinus Elevation

Crestal approach with no graft placement: Elevation of the sinus membrane without graft placement from a lateral window or crestal approach has been shown to result in bone formation between the elevated membrane and intact floor of the sinus. Maintenance of the space created after membrane elevation may be important for bone formation to occur (59-62).

Crestal approach with graft placement: There are studies (63-65) that evaluated augmentation of the ridge using allograft and xenograft, with “bone” gains ranging from 3.5 to  $6.0 \mathrm{~mm}$ . These studies confirm that placing a material to maintain space will result in bone gain.


In a series of over 120 patients who were treated with the crestal approach, there were no differences reported comparing the use of allograft or autograft (65). In general a narrow sinus will result in more predictable bone augmentation with the crestal approach compared to a wide sinus (66).

As time progresses the techniques for using the crestal approach will provide similar bone graft fill volumes compared to the lateral window approach, with less morbidity for the patient.

# Anterior maxilla

The crown of an esthetic tooth is surrounded by a frame of gingiva. The shape of the crestal tissue should mimic convex ridge form similar to the emergence of a tooth root. The presence of the anterior tooth root forms the convex ridge shape. The labial bone covering the root is very thin and prone to resorption after the tooth root has been removed. Thus the strategy for optimizing this site includes the use of a material that will simulate the root and labial bone shape without significant resorption.

How have the last 100 years evolved to current methods? In the past roots have been left in place to support a denture. As long as a root canal had been performed or the canals were sclerosed, the patients did well. Recent work by Heurzler and colleagues provide evidence that retaining the labial tooth surface in the esthetic zone can preserve ridge width and contour (67, 68). Thus it is evident that some of the older methods are still valid today.

As time evolved, the indications for implant placement at the time of tooth removal have expanded to those situations that do not have active exudate and also have sufficient bone for implant stabilization. Implants can be placed immediately after tooth removal. If the gingiva is supported by a healing abutment or provisional crown there is a gain of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of the gingival margin compared to using a cover screw and closing the crestal tissue (69). Papilla is preserved with immediate or delayed approaches as long as the distance from the contact to adjacent bone is  $5\mathrm{mm}$  or less (70).

In the anterior maxilla the thin labial bone is expected to resorb after tooth removal, with flattening of the contour of the ridge. Ridge contour grafting can be re-created with a predictable  $1\mathrm{mm}$  width change over time, using an onlay of xenograft with or without membrane coverage depending on the extent of ridge augmentation needed (71). There is a need to preserve ridge contour by placing a graft material within the socket. If the thin labial bone resorbs then the graft material, if still present, will preserve ridge contour. If the socket is not grafted immediately after tooth removal then an augmentation will be needed to recreate the missing ridge. If the anterior maxillary tooth is removed the clinician may delay implant placement or place the implant immediately after tooth removal. In delayed implant cases the socket is grafted to preserve the space for later implant placement (72). If there is no purulent exudate and the labial bone is present with adequate bone within the palatal aspect of the alveolus to allow for stable implant placement, the tooth can be removed and an implant immediately placed. The gap between the implant and labial bone is grafted with a material such as xenograft to maintain ridge contour (73-75).

The thickness of the gingiva plays an important role in establishing the esthetic frame of the crown. A thick gingiva is stippled and pink, with less translucence than thin gingiva. Thin gingiva is smooth, more red than pink, and prone to recession following resorption of the underlying bone. Historically recession of thin tissue goes back to many of the original reports involving osseous surgery to reduce periodontal pockets. It was observed that if bone levels changed in a patient with thin gingiva there was a high percentage of recession seen. This historical observation is used in current situations for treating the patient with implants in the esthetic zone. The clinician should plan on thickening thin gingiva to achieve natural esthetic appearance with minimal recession over time (76).

# Treatment of the edentulous patient

An understanding of the past treatment of the edentulous patient provides insight into many of the current methods used by clinicians today. Prior to the 1980's, preprosthetic surgery involved improving the base on which dentures were loaded. Many of these procedures are used today with modifications to fit the needs of an implant patient.


For example, maxillary tuberosity reduction is a procedure that is used to reduce the soft tissue bulk over the tuberosity to allow for denture seating. This approach is now used to harvest connective tissue grafts from the tuberosity for ridge contouring and to thicken the gingiva.

Vestibular extension methods have been used to provide a ridge with attached, non-mobile mucosa for improved denture retention. These vestibuloplasty procedures included keratinized grafts from skin, dermis, adjacent mucosa, or by using allografts or collagen. These procedures and approaches have been modified to provide adequate width keratinized gingiva around implants. In addition, the use of subepithelial connective tissue grafts have been added to the soft tissue procedure armamentarium to convert thin gingiva to thick gingiva.

Another example of an older technique modified for current use is the rotational flap used to cover cleft defects. This has been modified to rotate subepithelial connective tissue with a posterior pedicle to augment thin and deficient ridges in the esthetic zone (40).

When teeth are removed and the sites allowed to heal by the natural process of socket healing, there can be loss of vertical and horizontal bone volume because of remodeling of thin bone. As mentioned previously, onlay grafts or inlays (interpositional grafts) have been used to augment the vertical and horizontal ridge (Figure 8). The incision design used to provide tension free coverage of iliac crest grafts and the use of tunneling are methods that have been adapted to today's procedures.

Traditional skin or dermis graft vestibuloplasty procedures often lowered the floor of the mouth. The use of a blunt dissection of the lingual tissues allowed for movement of the lingual mucosa as well as movement of the mylohyoid muscle. Recent vertical augmentation procedures all utilize a similar relaxation dissection to mobilize the lingual mucosa for onlay graft usage (40). Traditional methods are being modified by surgeons who have had experience with these earlier methods.


Immediate provisionalization of implants started with extra implants being utilized to support a fixed restoration until the remaining implants integrated. This process was successful and began the movement in surgery and prosthodontics to immediately load full arch prostheses (77-79).

In the past maxillary full arch implant restorations relied on multiple implants strategically placed with prosthetics emerging from the implants identical to those on teeth. (Figures 8 and 9) These restorations were maintainable by the patient and had excellent long term results (80)

Traditional dental foundations of knowledge always advocate that functional stability and hygiene maintenance are critical factors for patients to retain their teeth. The same traditional principles are relevant to dental implants. In the most recent era materials are improving to allow for more practical full arch designs that provide access to implants for hygiene. Zirconia prostheses, as an example, can be fabricated to provide a restoration that is natural in appearance with minimal to no flange, with excellent esthetics, with cross arch stabilization of the implants (Figure 5e).

Implants can be placed at the time of tooth removal or staged. When Branemark brought to Toronto the concept of cross arch stabilization, data was shown that provided excellent evidence base justification for this method. Segmental arch supports without cross arch stabilization does not have the same data base for justifying segmentalizing implant support in the maxilla.

In patients who lost their teeth and bone, early attempts to restore bone volume using large autogenous grafts were successful but did include a long time span with the patient not wearing a maxillary prosthesis, as well as the morbidity from harvesting large iliac crest grafts in the maxillary edentulous patient. Branemark started using longer implants that span from the maxillary crest through the zygoma, combined with anterior implants to support fixed full arch prostheses. These zygomatic implants rely on the dense bone in the zygoma for integration. The long implants are cross arch stabilized to provide a tripod of support. Multiple zygomatic implants can be used if there is insufficient bone in the anterior maxilla (81, 82).

Variations of the original work by Branemark and colleagues still utilize the same engineering philosophies that include well designed, supported prostheses that are maintainable by the patient and dentist.

# The Use of Navigation to Guide Implant Placement

When implants were used in the late 1970s and 1980s, clinicians used panoramic and periapical radiographs, models of the arches, and physical evaluation to determine the presence of bone. When an implant was placed in the edentulous patient, a duplicated denture was often used to guide implant angulation, although the bone determined implant placement more than the prosthesis. This assumed a hybrid type prosthesis design which had flexibility to adjust for implant positioning. When osseointegration was achieved with implants, clinicians began using them for single tooth replacement and partial arch replacement. It became obvious that the implants serving as anchors for teeth needed accurate placement which was prosthesis dependent, not bone dependent. It became the responsibility of the surgeon to re-create loss bone for ideal implant positioning.

Computed tomography (CT) scans taken with radiographic stents in the mouth have been used with specific software to virtually place implants on a computer screen, with fabrication of a guide stent, which then allowed for prefabrication of prosthesis. Final prostheses were placed in the 1990s but small accuracy issues prevented them from being the method of choice.

When cone-beam scanners became available, the radiograph digital data file could be uploaded for implant planning and guide stent fabrication. This required a lab processed radiographic stent with fiducial markers, the use of CT planning software that often required training, the fabrication of a guide which delayed treatment for time needed to fabricate the guide stent, and the additional cost related to fabricating guides. Because of the time restraints on clinicians to learn and become proficient with the CT planning software, third party companies started working with clinicians to design the treatment plan. It was obvious and confirmed in the literature that static ct generated guides provides the means for accurate implant placement in selected cases.


The use of a static, CT generated guide stent with a coordinated system of specified drilling can result in less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  crestal and apical deviation from the plan, and angulation error less than 5 degrees (83-90). Free-hand methods for implant placement have significantly more error compared to navigation methods (91, 92).

# Dynamic Navigation

Dynamic navigation systems for dental implant placement utilize optical technologies to track the patient and the hand piece and to display images onto a monitor (91, 92). A patient tracking array with three fiducials is custom connected to the patient's teeth on the Jaw that will receive an implant. The CBCT is taken with the fiducials in place. The resultant CBCT data set is uploaded into the navigation system for virtual planning. Virtual teeth, identification of the inferior alveolar canal, and virtual placement of implants are accomplished within a few minutes. The patient is then ready for implant placement (Figure 10).

The advantages of the dynamic navigation method are improved accuracy (91, 92), less invasive flap reflection compared to free hand approaches, less trauma to the surgeon since posture is improved with less back and neck bending, and the ability to change implant size, system, and location during the surgical procedure. In a patient who has difficulty in opening, or in a second molar site which can be difficult to access, dynamic navigation allows implant placement relying on the navigation screen to guide the drills without direct visualization in the mouth. Dynamic navigation requires a team approach. Both the surgeon and the first assistant must learn to work together for efficient use of a dynamic navigation system. Navigation, whether static or dynamic, provides the clinician with a statistically significant improvement in implant placement accuracy, compared to freehand methods.

The past 100 years concerning implants:

1. Treatment planning is the same over time – we must examine our patients and discuss their needs and desires.
2. Technological advances have been significant. We can utilize digital optical and CT scanning to virtually plan the patient's reconstruction
3. Materials and methods for hard and soft tissue grafting are similar to those used for edentulous patients – but have been modified and improved.
4. Immediate treatment of the extraction site has moved from no intervention to immediate implant and prosthetic placement.
5. We no longer need to rely on freehand methods to place an implant – rather we can now use navigation methods.
