# Zygomatic Implants in Implant Dentistry

Justin Bonner

# Historical Perspective

The first use of implants placed into the zygoma for oral rehabilitation was by Branemark and colleagues in the late 1980s, and by 1998, a clinical protocol was developed and published [1]. During this time and beyond, zygomatic implants have allowed for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of patients with severe maxillary atrophy or the absence of the maxilla due to trauma, pathology, or post-surgical defects [2]. This is done without extensive grafting procedures and can allow for immediate loading of a prosthesis. Today, multiple dental implant companies manufacture zygomatic implants for a variety of clinical scenarios, and implant and prosthesis survival rates are superior to implants placed in grafted bone (Fig. 26.1) [3-6].

# Indications and Contraindications

Zygomatic implants are indicated for patients with inadequate posterior maxillary bone and who receive a prosthesis providing cross-arch stability [7]. This lack of bone is most commonly due to pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and resorption of the alveolus, but it may also result from numerous other reasons such as trauma, pathology, or prior surgery.

Zygomatic implants are contraindicated in the setting of maxillary or zygomatic pathology, as well as infection of the adjacent bone and sinuses. Caution should also be used in patients who may have been treated with bisphosphonates and head and neck radiation, are currently smoking, or may not have the ability to maintain a prosthesis.

# Anatomic Overview

The zygomatic bone, or cheek bone, is a paired bone of the midfacial skeleton that forms the prominence of the cheek. Its processes articulate with the frontal bone, sphenoid bone, maxilla, and temporal bone (Fig. 26.2).

The maxillary process of the zygomatic bone articulates with the maxilla to form the inferior orbital rim and the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. The temporal process of the zygomatic bone articulates with the temporal bone to form the zygomatic arch which overlies the temporalis muscle and represents the border between the temporal fossa above and the infratemporal fossa below. The frontozygomatic notch is formed between the frontal and temporal processes of the zygomatic bone and is a key landmark for dissection and retraction during zygomatic implant surgery.

The maxilla is a paired bone that is fused to create the majority of the midface. Within the body of the maxilla is the maxillary sinus which typically has thin overlying walls. The maxillary sinus's medial wall is also the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and the ostium of the maxillary sinus allows for communication between the two structures (Fig. 26.3). The posterior wall of the maxillary sinus is also the anterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa.

Below the inferior orbital rim on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus is the infraorbital foramen. The infraorbital neurovascular bundle exits the infraorbital foramen. The nerve gives sensation to the skin of the lower eyelid, lateral nose, upper lip, and cheek as the facial mucosa of the anterior maxilla.


# Case Selection and Pre-surgical Evaluation

Preoperatively the patient is evaluated systematically as described by Bedrossian and colleagues [8].

The first step involves determining whether the patient is only missing teeth or if they have a composite defect, which is present if they are missing hard and soft tissue in addition to their missing teeth. Patients with a history of periodontitis, for example, may be expected to have a composite defect given their loss of alveolar bone from the disease process.

When determining the presence of a tooth-only defect or a composite defect, it is critical to work backward from the ideal position of the maxillary teeth. If it was made with the correct tooth position and vertical dimension of occlusion, a patient's existing denture may be helpful in this assessment.

One technique is to duplicate the existing denture in clear acrylic using a Lang Denture Duplicator Flask. This clear denture can then be worn by the patient to show whether the denture teeth appear to sit on the ridge (indicating a tooth-only defect) or off the ridge (indicating a composite defect) (Fig. 26.4). If the patient's denture is not made with the correct tooth position and vertical dimension, it should be corrected prior to surgery.

If only teeth are missing, then a prosthesis replacing only the crowns of the teeth, such as a porcelain fused to metal bridge, is indicated. If the patient has a composite defect, then a prosthesis such as a hybrid prosthesis is planned.

The next step in the systematic approach is to determine whether or not the patient's gingiva is visible during maximum animation. This is critical because it indicates the transition line's position, which is the transition between a fixed prosthesis and the gingiva (Fig. 26.5).

When reconstructing a composite defect with a fixed prosthesis, the transition line must be hidden by the upper lip during maximum animation, or else the final result will be unaesthetic. The amount of alveoloplasty required to provide restorative space for the prosthesis should also be considered, and if the transition line would still be visible, then additional alveoloplasty should be planned. If this is not possible, then a removable restoration should be planned so that the flange of the prosthesis may hide this transition line.

The third step in the systematic approach is to determine the presence or absence of bone in each of the three zones of bone. Bedrossian et al. have described three zones of the maxilla - zone 1 is the premaxilla, zone 2 is the premolar/ bicuspid region, and zone 3 is the molar region (Fig. 26.6). A panoramic radiograph is used to screen these zones quickly,

Gingiva was visible during maximum animation and was concealed by the flange of his removable prosthesis. Transitioning to a fixed prosthesis without addressing this gingival display would be problematic and result in an unaesthetic prosthesis (b) and a CT or CBCT can be used to confirm the volume of bone in these zones. A duplicated denture with barium-impregnated teeth when making these radiographs may also be helpful.


The following algorithm provides a graftless approach to the implant reconstruction of the edentulous maxilla (Table 26.1): If bone is present in all three zones, then traditional axial implants are placed. If adequate bone is present in zones 1 and 2 only, then axial implants are placed in zone 1, and titled implants are placed in zone 2 in order to provide posterior support and minimize cantilevers. If adequate bone is only present in zone 1, then axial implants are placed in zone 1, and posterior support is achieved through zygomatic implants. If adequate bone is not present in any of the zones, a quad zygoma treatment plan is indicated (Fig. 26.7) [8].

In the case of a zygomatic implant treatment plan, a CT or CBCT is often evaluated to confirm the adequacy of bone in the zygomas, as well as to rule out pathology in the maxillary sinuses and demonstrate patency of the ostia (Fig. 26.8).

In preparation for surgery, some clinicians perform model surgery on a 3D printed model of their patient in order to aid in visualization and treatment planning.

Caution is advised with restricted surgical guides as a small deviation from the planned trajectory of the implant can lead to large deviations from the planned implant position. Intraoperative navigation has also been utilized in the placement of zygomatic implants, and all guidance systems should be viewed as an adjunct and not a substitute for the surgeon's ability to perform the procedure without such guides [9].

# Surgical Technique

Zygomatic implants may be placed using local anesthesia, IV sedation, or general anesthesia. Local anesthesia should include transcutaneous infiltration of the body of the zygoma and the frontozygomatic notch. The buccal vestibule and palatal gingiva should also be infiltrated, and the superior posterior alveolar and infraorbital nerves should be blocked. Some clinicians have noted improvements when a mandibular block is also given, allowing retraction and manipulation of the mandible with greater comfort.

A crestal incision with bilateral releases over the tuberosity areas is created. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is developed to expose the anterior and lateral maxillary walls. Caution is taken when dissecting superiorly to avoid the infraorbital neurovascular bundle.

The body of the zygoma is exposed, and a retractor is placed in the frontozygomatic notch – this retraction aids in direct visualization of the drills and implants which will follow. The importance of this retraction should not be overlooked. Adequate visualization helps prevent the inadvertent placement of the implant into undesirable locations such as the orbit.

Further aiding the visualization, an approximately  $10\mathrm{mm}$  by  $5\mathrm{mm}$  window is created in the lateral maxillary wall following the posterior maxilla contour. The sinus membrane may be elevated and preserved, though many surgeons make no special efforts to keep this intact [1]. If the maxilla's contour is such that the planned position of the implant will not enter the sinus, this step is omitted.

In most cases, the trajectory begins at the crest of the ridge in the first-second premolar region. It follows the contour of the posterior maxillary wall body of the zygoma. In cases of severe resorption or the absence of maxillary bone due to resection or trauma, the implant's coronal portion may not reside in crestal bone at all. Carlos Aparicio has proposed a classification to describe the zygomatic implant pathway [10].

Sequential osteotomies are created following the manufacturer's drilling protocol, taking care to maintain the instruments' visualization through the maxillary sinus and exiting through the zygoma (Fig. 26.9). A drill guard may protect the soft tissues while drilling, and lateral pressure should not be placed on the drills to prevent breakage.

A measurement is made to determine the implant's appropriate length, and after irrigation of all debris, the implant is placed. The implant is placed using either the surgical drilling unit or manually, taking care not to exceed the manufacturer's recommendations for insertion torque. After the correct placement is verified, the apex is irrigated to ensure no debris remains below the periosteum in the frontozygomatic region, and the retractor is removed.

Implant mounts are disengaged, and a cover screw may be placed. If adequate insertion torque has been achieved, a multiunit abutment may be placed for provisionalization with a prosthesis providing cross-arch stabilization.

Some surgeons choose to drape any extra-maxillary portion of the implant with the buccal fat pad [11, 12] prior to closure. The gingiva is closed with the operator's choice of suture, and the provisional prosthesis is converted.

# Complications

As with all surgical procedures, complications can occur in managing patients with zygomatic implants, and the clinician should be familiar with their prevention and management.

Zygomatic implants are considered to be reliable and generally have a high success rate [4, 6, 13]. Aparicio et al. reviewed 20 studies presenting clinical outcomes for zygomatic implant patients and found an overall survival rate of  $98.4\%$ , though it was noted that some studies covered the same patient groups and, therefore, the true numbers of unique [13]. Similarly, Block et al. reviewed 21 studies that demonstrated success rates of zygomatic implants ranging from  $90\%$  to  $100\%$  [14].

One of the most prominent concerns with the placement of zygomatic implants is the effect on the maxillary sinus, and this will be discussed in more detail below.

Another potential complication is the inadvertent placement of the implant into the orbit or the temporal fossa. This should be avoided by thorough knowledge of regional anatomy as well as adequate visualization of the implant's trajectory via a sinus window and retraction at the frontozygomatic notch.

Bleeding can occur intraoperatively and is typically managed with local measures. Postoperative hemorrhage may lead to a facial hematoma, which typically resolves spontaneously over the course of time. Blood may exit the nares for the first few days after treatment as the blood that had accumulated during surgery escapes the sinuses. This generally requires no treatment, but a brisk bleed may require nasal packing.

Paresthesia of the infraorbital nerve distribution may occur, typically from retraction [6]. As long as the nerve is kept intact, this should resolve over a few weeks or months. This should be minimized by gentle retraction near the infraorbital foramen and not traumatizing the nerve with a retractor inadvertently.


A lip laceration may occur during osteotomy creation and can be avoided by adequate retraction and protection of the soft tissues by using a drill guide [15].

Subcutaneous emphysema has also occurred after the placement of zygomatic implants [6], and patients should be cautioned against nose blowing and sneezing.

Similar to traditional endosteal implants, peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis can occur with zygomatic implants, and treatment should be focused on prevention. This should at least include (1) careful attention to creating a prosthesis that is cleansable by the patient (i.e., avoiding plaque traps), (2) meticulous home care by the patient, and (3) routine follow-up for removal of the prosthesis and professional cleaning of both the prosthesis and the fixtures. For implants whose crestal component is not encased in maxillary bone, coverage with the buccal fat pad at the time of placement may improve gingival outcomes [11, 12].

Inflammation may occur at the apex of the implant and can manifest overlying skin changes. Copious irrigation of the tissues overlying the apex and the frontozygomatic notch prior to closure may help prevent this. Treatment may require transcutaneous or transoral resection of a portion of the implant's apex, but the remaining parts of the implant are often stable and can be left in place.

An oroantral communication may occur at either an early or late stage and may be amenable to closure by traditional means such as a buccal fat pad flap.

# Zygomatic Implants and the Maxillary Sinus

Given the relationship between zygomatic implants and the maxillary sinus, a salient concern involves what effects they might have on the sinuses and the development of sinusitis.

It is important to recognize that the majority of zygomatic implant patients do not experience sinus symptoms [16]. It is also important to understand that sinusitis is common in the general population. In a 2012 survey of adults in the United States,  $12\%$  had been told by a doctor or other health professional in the past 12 months that they had sinusitis [17]. Accordingly, it should be expected that some degree of zygomatic implant patients will experience sinus symptoms at some point, just as the rest of the population does, and it has not been shown that zygomatic implant patients experience a higher rate of sinus symptoms than the general population [16].

Investigating the response of the maxillary sinus to a zygomatic implant, Petruson performed sinuscopy in 14 patients who had been functioning with their zygomatic implants for at least 1 year [18]. He found that the implants were either partially or totally covered in the mucosa, and there was no evidence of infection or increased secretions, suggesting that zygomatic implants do not cause a foreign body reaction. This finding is consistent with an animal study that examined the reaction of the sinus to implants placed into the sinuses of dogs [19]. However, radiographic thickening of the sinus mucosa in patients with implants in the sinus has been demonstrated [16, 20].


Regarding the treatment of the zygomatic implant patient who develops sinus symptoms at some point after surgery, Becktor et al. removed three implants due to sinusitis after failing treatment by an otolaryngologist consisting of sinus rinses and antibiotics. However, an attempt at functional endoscopic sinus surgery was not reported in these cases [21]. While removing the implant and draining the infection through the implant osteotomy may resolve the infection, it leaves the patient with a significant disability. In contrast, Branemark et al. reported the surgical management of sinusitis (inferior meatal antrostomy) in four zygomatic implant patients with recurrent sinusitis and found that the infection resolved in all cases without the need for removing the implant [22].

With this in mind, the management of the sinus in the zygomatic implant patient should involve treatment of preexisting sinus disease prior to implant placement and avoiding the creation of an oroantral fistula at the time of surgery. If a sinus infection develops after implant placement and is not resolved by oral antibiotics, functional endoscopic sinus surgery should be preferred over the removal of the implant.
