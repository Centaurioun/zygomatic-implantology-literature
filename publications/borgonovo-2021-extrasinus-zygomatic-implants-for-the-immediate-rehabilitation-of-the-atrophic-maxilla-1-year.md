# Abstract

Purpose: The use of zygomatic implants is an alternative to major grafting procedures for the treatment of the atrophic posterior maxilla. However, only few studies reported solid and correct data about the use of extrasinus zygomatic implants. Starting from these considerations, this study aims to investigate the one-year survival and success rates of extrasinus zygomatic implants immediately loaded in patients with severe atrophy of the posterior maxilla.

Methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients fully edentulous or with failing dentition in the upper arch and with a severe atrophy of the posterior maxilla were enrolled. All patients underwent to prosthodontic rehabilitation with the application of implants in both anterior maxilla areas and zygomatic bone. All the zygomatic implants were inserted with an extrasinus path. Primary outcomes were prosthesis and implant failures. Secondary outcomes were complications, bleeding scores, probing pocket depths and peri-implant marginal bone level changes. A total of 98 implants were inserted.

Results: During the one-year follow-up, no implant failure was reported as well as no pain and/or no sinusitis were detected. No other significant events were reported, except for minor soft tissue and technical problems. A maxillary sinus membrane rupture occurred during the surgical phase in 4 (17.4%) patients but healing was not compromised. Peri-implant mucositis were observed in 2 (8.7%) patients. 12 months after surgery, average bone loss around conventional implants was  $1.11 \pm 0.23$  mm. In addition, no peri-implant radiolucency was observed around zygomatic implants. Within the limits of this study, preliminary short-term data (1-year post-loading) suggested that extrasinus zygomatic implants represent a predictable treatment option for the atrophic maxillae. Further follow-up data ( $\geq 5$  years) are needed to confirm these results.

Conclusion: The present study supports the conclusion that extrasinus zygomatic implants for the immediate rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla have high success rate with minimal or no complications.

# Introduction

Implant-supported rehabilitation of the severe maxillary atrophy represents a challenge in clinical practice since a significant reduction of bone volume in the posterior area, especially when an immediate loading protocol is performed. Several bone grafting procedures, such as sinus floor augmentation and autogenous bone blocks, have been suggested as methods to rebuilt the architecture in patients with atrophic maxilla, allowing implant placement in resorbed sites  $^{1,2}$ . On the other hand, large full arch reconstructions often require an extraoral donor site, such as the iliac crest or the calvaria, which increases the morbidity, treatment time and biologic cost for the patient. An alternative to major reconstructive procedures for atrophic maxillary ridges is the zygomatic implant. Recent studies have observed that, compared to bone grafting procedures, the use of zygomatic implants may shorten treatment time and reduce morbidity without jeopardizing the outcome of the rehabilitations  $^{3-5}$ . In the original surgical procedure the zygomatic implants are usually inserted through the maxillary sinus and apically stabilized in the zygomatic bone  $^{6,7}$ . Although this technique showed high implant survival rates, it presents some limitations, such as difficult surgical visualization, risk for sinus disease, excessive palatal position of the implant head which results often in a bulky prosthesis followed by discomfort and problems with oral hygiene and speech. Stella and Warner  $^{8}$  proposed a simplified technique for placement of zygomatic implants in which the antrostomy and lifting of the sinus membrane were not necessary. This technique uses a slot in the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, minimizing the contact of the implant with the sinus mucosa. This technique reduced considerably the surgical time and improved the emergence prosthetic profile, moving the emergence of the platform of the zygomatic implant nearer to the residual crest. In addition, the extrasinus technique for installation of zygomatic implants have been reported, with high success rates  $^{9}$ . The extrasinus technique aims to simplify the surgical procedures and to improve prosthetic outcomes. According to this technique, zygomatic implants are installed out of the maxillary sinus, reducing surgical time and the risk of sinus adverse events, and improving surgical visualization. The prosthetic profile of the restoration is considerably improved, as well as the emergence of the implant head is positioned on the top of the crest, resulted in a more normal extension of the bridge framework.

A review of the literature on 1541 zygomatic implants reported a survival rate of  $97.86\%$  after a 3-year follow-up  $^{10}$ , and another review showed a 12-year cumulative survival rate of  $95.21\%$ $^{11}$ , but it should be pointed that there was heterogeneity in the data as a result of study design, number of patients treated, follow up times, surgical techniques and loading protocols. Studies that exclusively evaluated immediate loading showed a statistically lower zygomatic implant failure rate than studies evaluating delayed loading protocols  $^{11}$ .


Starting from these considerations, the main aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of extrasinus zygomatic implants immediately loaded in combination with standard implants to support full-arch screw-retained prostheses in the rehabilitation of atrophic maxillae. The present study reports the clinical outcome up to 1-year after loading. It is planned to follow-up this patients' cohort to the fifth year of function in order to evaluate the success of the procedure over time. The present article is reported according to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement for improving the quality of observational studies (http://www.strobe-statement.org).

# Material and Methods

The present multicenter prospective clinical trial was conducted in Italy in three different private practices between January 2018 and April 2019. All patients underwent surgical implant placement and immediate prosthesis delivery performed by clinicians (AB, TG, SV) with long-term experience in full-arch rehabilitations and immediate loading procedures.

The "Saint Camillus International University of Health Science" Ethical Committee approved this protocol with the reference number #1.2020. In addition, all methodologies and experimental procedures here described were achieved in agreement with the last Helsinki Declaration. At the preliminary visit, detailed information regarding the nature of the study and any possible alternative treatment was provided to all patients. Written informed consent was obtained before enrolled in the trial.

# PATIENT SELECTION

A total of 23 patients (13 female and 10 male) needed of a maxillary immediate rehabilitation for completely or partially edentulous maxillae with a terminal dentition were consecutively enrolled in the study. Specifically, patients were recruited and treated in 3 different private practices in Italy. One operator has treated 12 patients (AB), one operator has treated 8 patients (TG) and one operator has treated 3 patients (SV).

As showed by the following anatomical criteria no patient had enough bone posterior to the first canine to anchor and stabilize standard diameter implants (implant diameter  $\geq 3.7\mathrm{mm}$ ).-presence of bone width  $\leq 4\mathrm{mm}$  in the premolar area

- an anterior sinus wall that, due to its curvature, did not allow placing a tilted implant through the standard protocol using between a 30 and 45 degree angulation fully inside the bone
- and/or the inferior corner of the anterior wall of the sinus positioned anterior to the first premolar.

In these situations, zygomatic implants were used to support the posterior regions of the rehabilitation. The anterior area of the maxilla must present at least bone  $8\mathrm{mm}$  height to allow the placement of anterior implants with a minimum length of  $8\mathrm{mm}$ .

Bone dimensions were measured on preoperative orthopanoramic examination and computer tomography (CT) scans.

All the implants must be inserted with a sufficient primary stability (insertion torque  $\geq 45$  Ncm) in order to be included in the study.

The exclusion criteria were: the presence of systemic uncontrolled diseases that could represent a general contraindication to implant dentistry; emotional instability; undergoing maxillary radiation therapy; undergoing active chemotherapy; treatment with bisphosphonates at any time; heavy smoking habits (more than 20 cigarettes/day); severe bruxism; poor oral hygiene; patients with enough bone height bilaterally in the posterior maxilla that allowed the insertion of implants through the standard protocol; the presence of sinusitis or anatomical alterations of the maxillary sinus.

According to these criteria, 6 subjects were excluded.

Diagnosis and treatment planning included: study models articulated in a semi-adjustable articulator; clinical photographs, panoramic radiographs, and computerized tomography to identify the anatomical structures and visualize the presence of pathologies.

Patients were categorised into three groups according to what they declared: non-smokers, moderate smokers (up to 10 cigarettes per day) and heavy smokers (more than 10 cigarettes per day). All patients underwent at least one session of oral hygiene instructions and professionally delivered debridement when required prior to the intervention. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was obtained with  $1\mathrm{g}$  of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (or clarithromycin  $500\mathrm{mg}$  if allergic to penicillin) starting the night before intervention, twice a day, for 7 days.

# PROCEDURES

On the day of surgery, patients were treated under intravenous sedation procedure and simultaneous use of local anesthesia protocol. The procedure started with the infiltration anesthesia in the buccal vestibule from the central incisor to the third molar, using articaine with adrenaline 1:100,000, the block of the palatal posterior nerve and the infraorbital nerve block. When needed, tooth extractions, were performed as atraumatically as possible, attempting to preserve the buccal alveolar bone. Extraction sockets were carefully cleaned from any granulation tissue. A mid-crestal incision from one tuberosity to the other was made along with two vertical releasing incision in the zygomatic pillar region. A full thickness flap was elevated allowing a) visualization of the alveolar crest, b) the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus and c) the inferior rim of the zygomatic arch. The zygomatic implant osteotomy begins with a rounded drill which starts at the buccal aspect of the bone crest in the second premolar or first molar region. The drilling continues toward the zygoma bone along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus until it perforates the zygomatic bone and continues until the outer cancellous layer of the bone is surpassed. A depth indicator is then used to decide the correct length of zygomatic implants. When the trajectory of the zygomatic implant had been visualized, surgical drills were used to create a groove starting from the residual crest and proceeding on the buccal surface of the maxillary body. Once the sinus membrane had been exposed, manual instruments were used to gently push it inwards with the aim to maintain its integrity. The osteotomy was progressively widened using these drills in sequence: pilot drill  $2.8\mathrm{mm}$ , twist drill  $3.2\mathrm{mm}$ , twist drill  $3.6\mathrm{mm}$ . Then the zygomatic implant was placed and the insertion was completed manually trying to keep the implant body in the channel created between the membrane and the outer aspect of the maxillary sinus. The zygomatic implants emerged close to the top of the crest of the residual alveolar ridge (Figures 1 to 4). Two zygomatic implants in combination with two or three conventional fixtures in the anterior maxilla were inserted in all the patients. The zygomatic implants used in this study were hybrid implants with rough (sand blasted and acid-etched) threaded apex and machined (nonthreaded) body (JDZygoma, JDentalCare, Modena, Italy). These implants are 30 to  $60\mathrm{mm}$  long and have internal connection. In addition to one zygoma fixture on each side, two or three standard implants (JDEvolution Plus, JDentalCare) were positioned near to the midline keeping in mind a minimum inter-implant distance of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  was available. The decision to place two or three implants was based on the amount of available bone. During the protocol-formulation phase it was decided that implants should attain insertion torque of at least  $45\mathrm{Nm}$  to be included in the study. If implants did not reach an insertion torque of at least  $45\mathrm{Nm}$ , patients were to be excluded from the study. Final insertion torque was measured with calibrated torque wrench (JDTorque, JDentalCare). The wrench used was able to perform torque measurements within a range of 15 to  $80\mathrm{Nm}$ , with  $5\%$  precision. After closing and suturing the flap with  $4/0$  non-resorbable sutures, abutments were connected, and a provisional screw-retained restoration was placed. Provisional restorations were made by metal reinforced acrylic resin or milled from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Final screw-retained metal-composite prostheses were delivered 6 months post-surgically. Patients were enrolled in an oral hygiene programme with recall visits every 4 months for the entire duration of the study.


# OUTCOME MEASURES

Patients underwent the 1-year recall appointment to assess the following outcome measures.

Primary outcomes:

- Prosthesis failure: a prosthesis was considered a failure if it needed to be replaced by an alternative prosthesis.

-Implant failure: implant mobility and removal of stable implants dictated by progressive marginal bone loss or infection and/or mechanical complication rendering the implant unusable (e.g. implant fracture or deformation of the connecting platform). Implant stability was assessed after having removed the prosthesis by tightening the implant abutment screw with a 30Ncm force.

Secondary outcomes:

- Complications: any biological and mechanical complications that occurred during the entire follow-up time were recorded. Example of biological complications were sinus membrane perforation, peri-implant mucositis (heavily inflamed soft tissue without bone loss) and peri-implantitis (bone loss with suppuration or heavily inflamed tissues), soft tissue recession with oral exposure of the implant surface, fistulas and sinusitis.

Example of mechanical complications were fracture or loosening of prosthodontic components assessed clinically and radiographically, fracture of the framework and detachment of resin teeth.

- Bleeding of the peri-implant mucosa was assessed by inserting a periodontal probe  $1\mathrm{mm}$  into the sulcus (circumferentially around the implant/abutment) and recorded in an ordinal scale with values from 0 to 2: (0: no bleeding, 1: bleeding on probing, 2: spontaneous bleeding);

- Probing pocket depths (PPD) were assessed at four sites for each conventional fixture and at the mesiopalatal and distopalatal aspects for the zygomatic implants with a plastic periodontal probe (Perio Probe; Kerr Corporation, Bioggio, Switzerland). Sites with a probing pocket depth equal or superior to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  were noted.

- Peri-implant marginal bone level changes: a panoramic radiograph was taken at implant placement and 1 year after loading. Peri-apical films were obtained only for the anterior standard implants because of difficulties in achieving a proper film alignment in the posterior area due to the lack of palatal concavity in almost all cases. Radiographs were scanned, digitized in JPG format, converted to TIFF format with a 600 dpi resolution and stored in a personal computer. Peri-implant marginal bone levels were measured using Image J 1.42 software (National Institute

of Mental Health, Maryland, USA). The software was calibrated for every single image using the known implant diameter. Measurements of the mesial and distal crestal bone levels adjacent to each implant were made to the nearest  $0.01\mathrm{mm}$  and averaged at patient level. Reference points for the linear measurements were the most coronal margin of the implant collar and the most coronal point of bone-to-implant contact.

# DATA ANALYSIS

Statistical analysis was performed by using the statistical package StatView (version 5.01.98, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). Significance was considered at  $p < 0.05$ . The paired-samples t test was used to evaluate the bone level changes. The patient was the statistical unit of the analysis. Differences in bone level changes between different surgical operators were longitudinally analysed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for repeated measures.

# Results

A total of 29 subjects were screened for eligibility, but six subjects were not included for the following reasons: three subjects were hesitant to receive extra-maxillary implants, two patients had chronic sinusitis and one was treated with amino-bisphosphonates intravenously. Then, a total of 23 subjects (43.5% men) with a mean age of  $63.8 \pm 8.9$  (range 38 to 78 years) were considered eligible and were enrolled in the study. Patients were recruited and operated from January 2018 to April 2019. All patients were treated according to the allocated interventions. The main baseline patient features are reported in Table 1. Although 9 patients (39.1%) had medically controlled hypertension and 3 patients (13%) had controlled type 2 diabetes, patients enrolled in this study were generally healthy. Though. Ten of the included patients were smokers: 6 were moderate smokers (up to 10 cigarettes per day) and 4 were heavy smokers (more than 10 cigarettes per day).

Twenty-three patients received a maxillary full-arch fixed prosthesis supported by standard and extrasinus zygoma implants; ninety-eight implants were placed in total (17 subjects with four implants and 6 with five implants). All zygoma implants had a diameter of  $4.3\mathrm{mm}$  (table 2). As concern the implants length  $8.6\%$  (4/46) were  $37.5\mathrm{mm}$  long,  $47.8\%$  (22/46) were  $40\mathrm{mm}$  long,  $34.8\%$  (16/46) were  $42.5\mathrm{mm}$  long,  $6.5\%$  (3/46) were  $45\mathrm{mm}$  long and  $2.2\%$  (1/46) was  $47\mathrm{mm}$  long (table 2). The opposing dentition was a removable implant-supported prosthesis (2 cases), natural teeth and removable prosthesis (4 cases), implant-supported fixed prosthesis (10 cases) or fixed prosthesis on natural teeth (7 cases).

Forty-sixzygoma implants and 52 standard implants were inserted in total. All implants were inserted with a torque superior to  $45\mathrm{Ncm}$  and were all immediately loaded.

At the 1-year recall appointment no patients dropped out. All prostheses were in function and stable during follow-up period. No implants were lost to implant and prosthetic success rates of  $100\%$ . A maxillary sinus membrane rupture occurred during the surgical phase in 4 patients  $(8.7\%$  of the sinus cavities involved in this study) but healing was not compromised. Peri-implant mucositis were observed in two patients  $(8.7\%)$  around zygomatic implants during the follow-up period and were solved by a curettage and  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine mouthwash. No other soft tissue complications were observed in the other zygomatic implants. No patients developed sinusitis during the follow-up period. Minor mechanical complications as fractures or detachments of one or more acrylic teeth, which were all repairable, were observed in 2 implant-supported restorations and in 2 patients with fixed implant-supported restoration as antagonistic arch had loosening of the prosthodontic components. No other significant occurrences were reported. The mean  $\pm \mathrm{SD}$  bone loss around conventional implants was  $1.11\pm 0.23\mathrm{mm}$  (n=52 implants) after 1-year of function. No peri-implant radiolucency was observed around zygomatic implants at the orthopanoramic evaluation.


By comparing the outcomes of the three different centres, no significant differences have been observed observed for both complications (25.0% vs. 28.6% vs. 12.5%, p=0.45) and bone loss (1.01±0.26 vs. 1.05±0.30 vs. 1.03±0.24 mm, p=0.643).

Bleeding index and probing depth results are showed in Table 3.

# Discussion

The present study reports the outcomes after 1 year of function of immediate fixed prostheses supported by extrasinus zygomatic implants and conventional fixtures for the treatment of the severe maxillary atrophy. It is planned to follow-up this patients' cohort to the fifth year of function in order to evaluate the success of the procedure over time. The 1-year data were very promising showing  $100\%$  success rates for both prosthetic and implant. The good outcome of the zygomatic and conventional immediately loaded implants demonstrates the possibility to reduce the treatment time considerably. This is in line with the results reported by other investigations[12-18]. Indeed, several studies reported implant survival ranging from 96 to  $100\%$  for follow-ups of 1 to 7 years by using zygomatic implants in immediate function[12-18]. with. Also, applying the extra-maxillary technique used in this study, Malò et al achieved a  $100\%$  prosthetic success and a  $97\%$  implant survival after 5 years of function. Another trial reported success rates of immediately loaded extrasinus zygomatic implants, standard anterior implants and definitive prostheses, of 97.5, 95.9, and  $95.2\%$ , respectively, after 8-years of loading[20].

It is important to highlight that the technique used in this study for the zygomatic implant placement was extra-maxillary, representing a different approach and position of the zygomatic implant as compared to the classical technique first introduced by Branemark  $^{6}$ . In the extramaxillary technique  $^{21}$  the zygomatic implant osteotomy starts at the level of the residual crest, creating a groove on the buccal surface of the maxillary body toward the zygoma bone (avoiding perforation of the underlying sinus membrane). The implant is inserted externally to the sinus regardless the presence of a buccal maxillary concavity or convexity and its threaded apical portion is anchored into the zygomatic bone. On the contrary, in the standard technique developed by Branemark  $^{6}$  and its subsequent modification from Stella and Warner  $^{8}$ , the zygomatic implant osteotomy starts palatally to the residual bone crest and the implant should anchor in both the zygoma and the residual crest.

The advantage of the Branemark's approach is the presence of a bone collar at the implant head that can provide a coronal stabilization, reducing fixture bending under loading. Experimental studies demonstrated that this bone engagement around the implant neck contributes to a better distribution of mechanical loads  $^{22}$ . The coronal bone also avoids the creation of an oroantral communication and guarantees the support for soft tissue reducing the risk of dehiscence and inflammation. The disadvantages of the Branemark's approach are the high possibility of perforation of the sinus membrane which could lead to sinusitis and the palatal positioning of the zygomatic implant platform which results in a bulky dental bridge followed by patient discomfort and difficulties with hygiene procedures and speech.


The extra-maxillary approach significantly increases the possibility to keep the membrane intact during the drilling sequence and the placement of the zygomatic implant. If a small accidental injury and laceration of the sinus mucosa occurs, it is usually in the region of the zygomatic recess, far from the residual alveolar crest. Besides, only a small part of the implant body invades the sinus cavity, and when an immediate loading protocol is applied the final abutment is positioned at the time of surgery and never disconnected creating a stable biological seal around the implant neck. All these factors will reduce the incidence of sinus pathology, as reported in this study. In the extra-maxillary approach, the osteotomy starts at the top of the residual crest removing a certain amount of bone and this could reduce the coronal mechanical support for the fixture. The advantage for the surgeon is the greater flexibility of placing the implant platform along the osteotomy in order to have an optimal emergence of the prosthetic screw, especially in the case of centripetal resorption of the maxilla. However, the extrasinus technique could increase the risk of soft tissue inflammation and recession related with leaving a considerable portion of the implant exposed to the overlaying mucosa. In this study, peri-implant mucositis were observed in 4 patients around zygomatic implants during the follow-up period and were solved by a curettage and  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine mouthwash rinses. Bleeding index values and probing pocket depth registered throughout the study were low. The absence of severe inflammatory reactions could be related to the design of the zygomatic implant used in this study which has a coronal unthreaded long body ending with a threaded apical segment. The mucosa stays in contact with this polished portion of the implant and this could reduce the risk of periimplantitis. Moreover, a healthy mucosa was possible thanks to an adequate keratinized buccal mucosa width around the zygomatic implant and the well-maintained population and nice compliance of the evaluated subjects. Periodic professional hygiene (every 6 months) associated with strict biofilm control protocol probably improved our success rate and decreased the biological complications.

# Limits of the study

The main limitations of this study were the small sample size and the short follow-up. The surgical technique used in this study needs an adequate expertise of the clinician, based on the surgical skills ability and knowledge of the anatomy. Therefore, despite the limitations of the study, immediate rehabilitation of the severely atrophic maxilla with extrasinus zygomatic implants in combination with conventional implants consist in a predictable treatment option. The use of the extrasinus technique for the placement of zygomatic implants is an alternative to the standard intramaxillary protocol simplifying the surgical procedure, reducing the risk of sinusitis and improving the prosthetic outcome but further prospective studies with longer follow-ups and randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the long term outcome comparison between these two surgical techniques.


In conclusion, the present study supports the conclusion that extrasinus zygomatic implants for the immediate rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla have high success rate with minimal or no complications. Indeed, the present study reported reliable and accurate data about the survival and success rates of extrasinus zygomatic implants. However, it is clear that new studies on survival of implants at 5-year or more are needed.
