Purpose: The management of patients with a severely atrophic or resected maxilla with zygomatic implants can be surgically challenging, but postoperative complications are relatively uncommon. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the percentage survival rates of zygomatic implants placed over an 18-year period.

Materials and Methods: This study evaluated patients receiving zygomatic implants in primary-care (specialist referral dental practice) and secondary-care (hospital) settings over an 18-year period. Results: In total, 88 zygomatic implants were placed in 45 patients aged between 42 and 88 years. Of the 88 implants, 54 were immediately loaded. The implant survival rate was  $94.32\%$ , with five implants failing during the study period (implant-level cumulative failure rate:  $5.68\%$ ; mean follow-up: 7.5 years; maximum: 18 years). The failures were not significantly associated with sex, surface finish, implant length, zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) classification, or implant position (all  $P$  values > .05). All failed implants were fitted with fixed prostheses. Failures occurred between 6 months and 15 years after placement.

Conclusion: This study of zygomatic implants placed in patients with a severely atrophic and resected maxilla confirms that this approach is a predictable method for supporting fixed or removable prostheses up to 18 years, demonstrating high survival rates. Given the low number of failures, no potential risk factors for failure could be identified. INT J ORAL MAXILLOFAC IMPLANTS 2019;34:461-470. doi: 10.11607/jomi.6790

The severely atrophic maxilla can pose an extremely difficult treatment predicament. Extreme resorption of the maxilla can cause removable mucosa-borne prostheses to be unstable, making them unsuitable for efficient mastication and speech. A fixed prosthesis supported by dental implants can be used effectively to replace missing teeth. However, in a severely atrophic maxilla, shorter (8.5 to  $18\mathrm{mm}$ ) implants may not be a viable option. One of the main requirements for implant placement is that there is sufficient bone quality and volume to support an implant-retained prosthesis. Pneumatization of the sinus, alveolar resorption, and poor bone quality can all prevent predictable and successful implant placement.[2]


There are several methods to improve the conditions for implant placement, such as onlay bone grafting, alveolar ridge splitting, and sinus floor elevation. However, all these methods have complications that can be inconvenient for a patient, such as morbidity of the donor or operation site, the need for multiple surgical interventions, and a long healing and integration period.[3,4]

It is also widely accepted that grafts using donor bone generated from cadaveric or xenograft sources can result in lower-quality bone for implant placement than a patient's autogenous bone. In general, the posterior maxilla can be challenging to restore with standard-length implants because of poor bone quality and reduced bone volume. However, the use of zygomatic implants is generally reserved for patients who have considerable bone resorption in the premolar and molar regions where grafting and short implants cannot be used.

Techniques for the placement of zygomatic implants, which engage the zygomatic bone for support, were devised in the early 1990s by Brænemark as an alternative to the placement of shorter implants in patients with a severely resorbed maxilla who could not undergo bone augmentation surgery. Unlike alveolar bone, which is purely functional and resorbs after tooth loss, the zygomatic bone is not affected by alveolar bone resorption.[8] This approach has been shown to be a viable option for patients with a severely atrophic maxilla, demonstrating impressive success rates,[1,9-11] despite research showing that the zygomatic bone contains varying quantities of trabecular bone,[12] which is typically not favorable for implant placement.[13,14] The success of zygomatic implants was initially thought to be the result of engaging four cortices: the palatal cortex of the maxillary alveolus, the cortical floor of the maxillary sinus at the crestal portion of the implant, and the zygomatic bone cortices at the apex, to achieve good primary implant stability.[15] However, many implants are placed successfully in the absence of palatal and sinus floor cortical bone, such as in patients who have had total or partial maxillectomies.[1]


The placement of zygomatic implants is challenging due to the difficulty of navigating the complex anatomy during site preparation and the placement of relatively long (30 to  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) implants; however, postoperative complications are infrequent. Thus, zygomatic implants can be an attractive option for patients who do not want to rely on bone augmentation procedures, which can fail and cause considerable morbidity.[16,17] Zygomatic implants can be placed as a single implant (unilateral), a single implant in each maxillary process (bilateral), or two implants per maxillary process (quad). Quad zygomatic implants can be used when both maxillae are severely resorbed.[18] Bilateral zygomatic implants are not sufficient to absorb the full occlusal load of fixed or removable dentures; therefore, it is essential to pair them with shorter implants placed anterior to the zygomatic implant or to use a quad zygomatic configuration.[19] When in one of these configurations, implants can be loaded immediately, allowing a patient to leave the surgical procedure with a fixed prosthesis.[11] The placement and immediate loading of zygomatic implants also bypasses the time spent waiting for bone augmentation procedures to heal.[20]

The placement of zygomatic implants has traditionally been performed under general anesthetic or intravenous sedation. However, this procedure, which used to be exclusively performed in a hospital setting (secondary care), is now routinely performed in specialist dental practices equipped for implant surgery (primary care). This retrospective, observational study evaluated the survival rates of anodized- and machined-surface zygomatic implants placed by three practitioners at a primary-care setting and a secondary-care setting over a period of 18 years. Included patients had a wide spectrum of indications, including extreme bone loss from dentoalveolar and facial trauma; bone loss due to cancer; developmental defects, such as cleft lip and palate; and severe alveolar atrophy due to loss of natural dentition.


# MATERIALS AND METHODS

# Study Design and Setting

This study was conducted in accordance with STROBE guidelines. This retrospective observational cohort study investigated implants placed in consecutive patients in both primary- and secondary-care settings over an 18-year period. Surgeries were performed between June 1999 and November 2017 at Kingston Hospital NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE Foundation Trust (secondary care) and Elmfield House Dental Practice (primary care) with the approval of the clinical audit department at Kingston Hospital (reference number 138n, Audit Department Kingston Hospital KT2 7QB). Digital clinical notes were collated from paper records and Exact Software, reviewed, and imported into a zygomatic implant database in Microsoft Excel. Information fields and categories were standardized across the database.

# Participants

Patients were included if they had zygomatic implants placed to support prostheses following oral cancer or maxillofacial trauma or to replace failing dentition or unstable removable prostheses. All patients treated between 1999 and 2017 were included.

# Patient Preparation

After clinical examination, the maxilla and zygoma region of each patient was evaluated radiographically with orthopantomograms, occipitomental radiographs, computed tomography (CT), or cone beam computed tomography. The surgical site preparation and implant placement procedure used depended on several factors, including the desired emergence profile of the implant, the number of implants being placed, patient anatomy, and the type of prosthesis to be used. The orientation and location of implants were planned using an anatomy-guided approach, and all surgical planning in the primary-care setting used digital treatment-planning software (NobelClinician, Nobel Biocare). None of the implants were placed with CT-guided surgical stents.

The placement of zygomatic implants in a secondary-care setting was performed under general anesthesia with local infiltration of  $2\%$  lidocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline (Septodont) to achieve adequate mucosal vasoconstriction. In the primary-care setting, the procedure was performed either under intravenous sedation with midazolam (Hamelyn) and fentanyl (Pfizer) administered by anesthetist or with local anesthesia alone in nonanxious patients (determined using an in-house anxiety scale). Local anesthesia was achieved using  $4\%$  articaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline (Septodont) to achieve adequate mucosal vasoconstriction. Dexamethasone  $(16\mathrm{mg})$  and intravenous amoxicillin  $(1.2\mathrm{g};$  Alliance Healthcare) was administered perioperatively to prevent postoperative swelling and potential infections, respectively, in all patients regardless of setting.


# Surgical Protocol

In patients receiving bilateral implants, a full-thickness flap was raised from the right to the left maxillary tuberosity, and approximately 10-mm relieving incisions were made anterior to the maxillary tuberosity into buccal tissues, keeping the incision as far away from the Stenson's duct as possible. For patients receiving a unilateral zygomatic implant, a full-thickness flap from the appropriate maxillary tuberosity to the central incisors was raised to give adequate access and view during surgery. A palatal flap was also raised and held in place with a suture.

During osteotomy preparation, saline-cooled burs were used to avoid trauma to the surrounding bone. Initial osteotomy preparation was performed with a round bur, followed by a 2.9-mm and 3.5-mm twist-drill sequence with a steady in-and-out motion, according to the implant manufacturer's instructions. Copious saline irrigation was used to wash away debris and prevent overheating of the osteotomy site. An angled depth indicator was used throughout to verify the angulation and depth of drilling. A maximum speed of 2,000 rpm was used during osteotomy preparation. Direct visualization of the burs was maintained throughout the procedure.

The general trajectory of implant placement was from the area of the second premolar/first molar, traversing the maxillary sinus to reach the zygomatic bone. From December 2011 onward, the placement of implants in the primary-care setting was classified according to the zygomatic anatomy-guided approach concept (ZAGA),[22-24] which is based on intra-anatomical differences between implant placement into the zygoma as determined by the clinician's judgment. Implants were placed completely through the sinus (ZAGA 0), partially through the sinus (ZAGA 1, 2, and 3) or completely extra-maxillary of the zygomatic arch (ZAGA 4). ZAGA 4 placement was used in cases of complete or partial maxillectomy. To prevent damage and infringement of the orbit, efforts were taken to ensure adequate extra tension on the flap.

In cases where two implants were placed in the same zygomatic body, the anterior of the two implants was placed closer to the orbit, so the implant head emerged in the canine-lateral incisor region, and the second posterior implant head was positioned in the first molar/second premolar position. The anterior implant was placed prior to the posterior implant. In cases where implants were placed through the maxillary antrum, a  $10 \times 5$ -mm window was cut in the lateral wall of the sinus close to the infrazygomatic crest. The sinus mucosa was carefully manipulated to move it away from the area where the implant would pass, creating a void around the implant head and shaft. The void was filled in with xenograft bone and a collagen membrane. In situations where the threads of the zygomatic implant head and shaft were placed outside of the maxillary process (ie, ZAGA 4), the buccal threads were covered with xenograft bone and a collagen membrane. This procedure was performed from 2013 onward by one surgeon (H.C.). Xenograft material (Bio-Oss, Geistlich) and collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich) were used to cover exposed threads and perform additional grafting around osteotomy sites. In cases of closing a potential communication in an oro-antral site, bone was harvested from the iliac crest for grafting. Grafting was performed at the discretion of the surgeon, and their rationale was recorded in the patient's notes. Healing abutments were placed on implants and buried in cases of two-stage procedures. Surgical incisions were closed using 4-0 Vicryl Rapide absorbable sutures (Ethicon).


The implants were placed by hand and defined as stable based on hand-torque measurements. Machine-torque instruments were used to confirm that the torque was greater than 30 Ncm. Implant abutments were not torqued above 20 Ncm based on machine-torque measurements.

# Postoperative Care

Placement of zygomatic implants in the secondary-care setting was performed as a two-stage procedure in which the implants were left to osseointegrate for up to 6 months before prosthetic loading. These cases were often more surgically complex, such as cases of cleft lip and palate, cancer, and trauma. These cases could not have been feasibly performed under local anesthesia alone. Dual or quad zygomatic implant placement was performed under general anesthesia based on the surgeon's preference. Due to the complexity and risk of the cases carried out under general anesthesia, implants placed during those procedures were also left to osseointegrate for 6 months before prosthetic loading. The prosthesis comprised either a removable acrylic prosthesis retained with brass clips on a gold bar or a fixed metal acrylic prosthesis using a gold subframe and a heat-cured acrylic suprastructure.

Implants placed in a primary-care setting were all immediately loaded under local anesthesia. Patients
