# Abstract

Aim: The purpose of this clinical follow-up study was to report the clinical outcome of osseointegrated implants placed in extremely atrophied edentulous maxillae after Le Fort I osteotomy and interpositional autogenous iliac bone grafts.

Patients and methods: In a 10-year period (1995-2004), 39 patients, 18 males and 21 females, aged from 32 to 76 years, presenting with severely atrophied edentulous maxillae were treated with Le Fort I osteotomy and interpositional iliac bone grafts. Four to 8 months after the reconstructive procedure, 281 osseointegrated implants were placed in the reconstructed maxillae. Four to 8 months afterwards, abutments were connected and the prosthetic rehabilitation started. The mean follow-up period of implants after the start of prosthetic loading was 45.9 months (range: 12-108 months).

Results: The reconstructive procedure was successful in 38 of 39 patients. In one patient, partial loss of the inlay graft occurred before implant placement. Six patients (42 implants) dropped out of the study. Fifteen implants were removed during the follow-up period, due to loss of integration. Thirty-two implants, although integrated, presented with periimplant bone-level changes higher than those proposed for successful implants. Cumulative survival and success rates of implants were  $94.5\%$  and  $82.9\%$ , respectively.

Conclusion: Results from this study showed that Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafts followed by delayed implant placement is an acceptable means to rehabilitate edentulous patients affected by extremely atrophied edentulous maxillae. Survival rates of implants are consistent with those related to implants placed in native, non-reconstructed bone. Conversely, the success rate of implants resulted to be lower as compared with those obtained for implants placed in native bone.

Dental rehabilitation of partially or totally edentulous patients with osseointegrated implants has become common practice in the last decades, with reliable long-term results (Adell et al. 1981, 1990a, 1990b; Albrektsson et al. 1986, 1988; Van Steenberghe et al. 1990; Lekholm et al. 1994, 1999; Lindquist et al. 1996; Buser et al. 1997; Arvidson et al. 1998; Weber et al. 2000; Leonhardt et al. 2002). However, due to atrophy or periodontal disease, local conditions of edentulous ridges may be unfavorable for implant placement. In particular, severe atrophy of the edentulous maxilla (class VI according to Cawood & Howell 1988 classification), may cause not only insufficient bone volume, but also unfavorable vertical, transverse, and sagittal interarch relationship, due to the tridimensional resorption pattern of long-standing maxillary edentulism. Finally, maxillary sinus pneumatization may further reduce the available bone for a safe and reliable implant-supported dental rehabilitation. This may render implant placement impossible or incorrect from a functional and esthetic viewpoint. Well consolidated surgical procedures, such as: (a) onlay bone grafts (Breine & Branemark 1980; Keller et al. 1987, 1999a; Kahnberg et al. 1989; Adell et al. 1990a, 1990b; Jensen & Sindet-Pedersen 1991; Isaksson & Alberius 1992; Lundgren et al. 1997; Neyt et al. 1997; Schliephake et al. 1997; Van Steenberghe et al. 1997; Chiapasco et al. 1998, 1999; Lekholm et al. 1999; Becktor et al. 2004; Nystrom et al. 2004); (b) maxillary sinus grafting (Boyne & James 1980; Tidwell et al. 1992; Chiapasco & Ronchi 1994; Blomqvist et al. 1996; Block et al. 1998; Chiapasco et al. 1998; Jensen et al. 1998; Del Fabbro et al. 2004); and (c) guided bone regeneration (Lang et al. 1994; Chiapasco et al. 1999; Simion et al. 2001; Buser et al. 2002; Hammerle et al. 2002), if on one side, may create adequate volume for implant placement, on the other side may be insufficient to re-create correct intermaxillary relationship.



In this situation, Le Fort I osteotomy associated with autogenous interpositional bone grafts allows a forward and/or downward repositioning of the maxilla in order to correct intermaxillary vertical, anterior-posterior, and transverse discrepancies, while the interpositional bone grafts (inlay nasal and maxillary sinus grafts) allow enough bone augmentation to embed implants of adequate dimensions (Sailer 1989; Isaksson et al. 1993; Cawood et al. 1994; Krekmanov 1995; Li et al. 1996; Watzinger et al. 1996; Nyström et al. 1997; Kahnberg et al. 1999; Lekholm et al. 1999; Keller et al. 1999b; Stoelinga et al. 2000; Yerit et al. 2004). Despite the considerable number of publications and the favorable results reported as far as the survival rate of implants placed in the reconstructed maxillae with Le Fort I osteotomy is concerned, the analysis of available publications demonstrated, on average, a poor methodological quality with regard to completeness of follow-up and success rate of implants according to well-defined criteria.

The aim of this prospective, multicenter clinical study was to evaluate, according to well-defined criteria, the clinical outcome of implants placed in severely atrophic edentulous maxillae after Le Fort I osteotomy and interpositional bone grafts.


# Patients and methods

In a 10-year period (1995-2004), 39 systemically healthy patients, 18 males and 21 females, aged from 32 to 76 years (mean age: 53.3 years), who presented with severely atrophied edentulous maxillae (class VI according to Cawood & Howell 1988 classification), with relevant maxillary retrusion, increased interarch distance, and impossibility or difficulty to wear a traditional denture, were selected for treatment with Le Fort I osteotomy and interpositional iliac bone grafts, to correct unfavorable intermaxillary sagittal, transverse, vertical relationship, and to create adequate bone volume to allow the placement of osseointegrated implants. Patients were treated in three different centers: (1) the Unit of Oral Surgery (Head: Dr Matteo Chiapasco), Department of Medicine, Surgery, and Dentistry, S. Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Italy (patients #3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 33, 35-39); (2) the Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery (Head and Chairman: Prof. Roberto Brusati), Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Italy (patients #2, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32), and (3) the Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery (Head: Dr Paolo Ronchi), S. Anna Hospital, Como, Italy (patients# 1, 4-7, 10, 13-20, 24, 26, 27, 30, 34) (see Table I).

Patients were visited initially for evaluation and for collection of baseline data. The visit included: (a) general health evaluation, (b) analysis of the oral status, remaining dentition of the opposite arch, and relationship between the jaws, (c) preoperative radiographic evaluation with panoramic radiograph, prophile radiograph, and computed tomography of the maxilla; (d) impressions for dental study casts and waxing-up, (e) explanation to the patient of the planned treatment, including risks and possible complications of treatment, potential benefits, and alternative treatment procedures. An informed consent was signed before the start of treatment by all patients.

Using radiographic imaging and dental study casts mounted on articulators, the anterior and downward movement of the maxilla was determined according to the estimated intermaxillary relationship, the expected occlusal plane, the estimated position of the implants, and the facial esthetic improvement.


As far as opposing arch dentition is concerned, 14 patients presented with edentulous mandibles: of these, one wore a removable denture, 11 wore implant-supported overdentures, and two wore fixed implant-supported prostheses. Fifteen patients presented with partial edentulism of the mandible: of these, three wore removable partial prostheses and 12 fixed prostheses supported either by implants or residual dentition.

Patients' exclusion criteria were: (a) tobacco abuse (more than 20 cigarettes/day); (b) severe renal and liver disease; (c) history of radiotherapy in the head and neck region; (d) chemotherapy for treatment of malignant tumors at the time of the surgical procedure; (e) noncompensated diabetes; (f) active periodontal disease involving the residual dentition; (g) mucosal disease, such as lichen planus in the areas to be treated; (h) poor oral hygiene; (i) noncompliant patients; (j) extreme atrophy of the maxilla and palate with extreme retrusion and upward resorption associated with scarry and hypovascularized soft tissues, typically due to chronic infection, long-lasting edentulism, or previously failed attempts of implant therapy. This latter aspect has been deemed important by the authors, because excessive forward repositioning of the osteotomized maxilla in the presence of scarry and hypovascular tissues may cause prolonged ischemia or disruption of the maxilla vascular supply, with a high risk of maxillary necrosis. In such situations, patients were treated with revascularized fibula free flaps (Chiapasco & Gatti 2004), as suggested also by other authors (Nocini et al. 2002; Jaquiery et al. 2004).

Identical clinical report forms (including initial screening data, inclusion and exclusion criteria, type of radiographic evaluation, survival and success criteria of implants, peri-implant clinical parameters, patient's satisfaction of facial contour changes) were used in the three centers.

# Surgical procedure

All patients were treated under general anesthesia with naso-tracheal intubation.

The procedure started with the bone harvesting procedure. A bicortical bone block was harvested from the anterior iliac crest, after elevation of a bone trapdoor formed by the most superficial part of the iliac crest and pedicled to periosteum and muscles of the lateral side of the anterior ilium, in order to reduce postoperative gait disturbances. After bone harvesting, the trapdoor was repositioned in the original position and stabilized with titanium screws and/or metal wires. Surgical access was finally closed in layers after adequate hemostasis and positioning of a vacuum drainage.

Access to the atrophic maxilla was obtained through a crestal incision from molar region of one side to the opposite one. A full-thickness flap was elevated and the anterolateral walls of the maxilla and the inferior part of the piriform aperture were exposed. After elevation of the nasal mucosa from the inferior and lateral walls of the piriform aperture, a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed with oscillating saws and thin chisels. Bone cuts included the anterolateral wall of the maxilla, the medial sinus walls, the nasal septum, and the maxillary-ptererygoid sutures. No attempt was made to preserve the maxillary sinus mucosa, whereas attention was dedicated to keep the nasal mucosa intact. The maxilla was then mobilized and brought downward and forward. The maxillary sinus mucosa was removed from the down-fractured part of the maxilla, while care was taken to preserve the mucous membrane of the cranial part of the maxillary sinuses. The autologous bone block taken from the anterior ilium was then cut in pieces and shaped to fit into the anterior and lateral part of the down-fractured nasal floor and maxillary sinuses. The down-fractured maxilla and bone blocks were then stabilized with titanium plates and screws (Gebrüder Martin GmbH & Co. KG, Tutlingen, Germany). All remaining spaces between the down-fractured maxilla and the bone blocks were filled with particulated iliac bone. The quantity of downward and forward movement of the maxilla was decided following indications of a surgical template previously created on study casts. Periosteal releasing incisions of the mucoperiosteal flap were then performed to obtain a tension-free and watertight suture.

Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafts was sufficient to correct atro phy and unfavorable intermaxillary relationship in 32 of 39 patients. In two patients (#2 and 26), due to extreme maxillary retrusion and relative mandibular protrusion, Le Fort I osteotomy was associated with a setback bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). In five patients (#3, 8, 21, 28, 39), due to extreme horizontal atrophy of the maxilla, buccal onlay grafts were placed and fixed with titanium microscrews, to improve bone volume for the following implant placement phase.


Antibiotic prophylaxis was started at the time of anesthesia induction and then continued for 6 days postoperatively. Non-steroidal analgetics were administered postoperatively. Post-operative instructions included a soft diet for 2 weeks and appropriate oral hygiene with  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine mouthrinse.

Sutures were removed 7-10 days postoperatively, both intraorally and at the donor site. Removable prostheses were not allowed in the reconstructed areas for 2 months after surgery. From the third month until implant placement, patients were allowed to wear removable prostheses refined with soft prosthetic materials. A soft diet was also suggested.

# Implant placement and prosthetic rehabilitation

Four to 8 months after the reconstructive procedure, 281 osseointegrated implants were placed in the reconstructed maxillae (4-10 implants per patient). Three implant systems were used: (a) Nobelbiocare (Goteborg, Sweden); (b) Friadent (Mannheim, Germany); and (c) Straumann Dental Implant System (Basel, Switzerland). Four to 8 months afterwards, abutments were connected and the prosthetic rehabilitation started. Nineteen patients were rehabilitated with full-arch implant-supported fixed prostheses, while 20 patients with implant-supported overdentures. Anagographic data and clinical features of patients and implants are reported in Table 1.

No specific criteria for the selection of different implant systems were used: rather, the implant system was selected according to the requests of the prosthodontists involved in the rehabilitation of the treated patients.

Patients were followed with clinical examinations at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the start of prosthetic loading, and annually thereafter. Routine radiographic documentation was obtained with panoramic radiographs taken immediately after the reconstructive procedure, at the time of implant placement, immediately after implant placement, at the completion of prosthetic rehabilitation, and annually thereafter. Intraoral periapical radiographs were taken immediately after implant placement, at the time of prosthetic loading, and then annually. The mean follow-up period of implants after the start of prosthetic loading was 45.9 months (range: 12-108 months). The following parameters were evaluated: (1) radiographic evaluation of peri-implant bone-level changes; (2) implant survival and success rates; (3) peri-implant clinical parameters; (4) patient's satisfaction of facial contour changes; and (5) patient's satisfaction of esthetics and function of the implant-supported prosthesis.


# Radiographic evaluation of peri-implant bone-level changes

Peri-implant bone-level changes were recorded by comparing standardized periapical radiographs made perpendicular to the long axis of the implants (using conventional film holders), and where the platform and threads were clearly visible. Radiographs were taken immediately after implant placement, at the time of prosthetic loading, and then annually. Measurements of bone-level changes were evaluated mesial and distal to each implant by means of a transparent millimeter ruler, measuring the distance between the top of implant head shoulder and the most coronal level of direct bone-to-implant contact. The bone-level measured on periapical radiographs taken immediately after implant placement was considered the baseline for further measurements. The measurements were recorded to the nearest  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ . Because of the small number of implants, medians and quartile ranges have been reported.

# Implant success and survival rates

Successful implants were considered those characterized by the following criteria: (a) absence of persistent pain; (b) absence of perimplant infection with suppuration; (c) absence of mobility; (d) absence of continuous peri-implant radiolucency; (e) periimplant bone resorption less than  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the first year of function and less than

0.2 mm in the following years (Albrektsson et al. 1986).

Surviving implants were considered those fulfilling criteria (a)-(d), but with peri-implant bone resorption greater than the values proposed for successful implants (4) (i.e.  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the first year of function and  $< 0.2\mathrm{mm}$  annually in the following years).

# Peri-implant clinical parameters

Modified plaque index (MPI) and modified bleeding index (MBI) were recorded at four sites of each implant (mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual/palatal) (Mombelli et al. 1987). Probing depth (PD) measurements were performed at four sites of each implant (mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual/palatal) to the nearest millimeter using a calibrated plastic probe (TPS Probe by Vivadent - FL, 9494 Schaan, Liechtenstein). Measurements were recorded every 12 months after initial prosthetic loading.

# Patient's satisfaction of facial contour changes

Upon the completion of the prosthetic rehabilitation, patients were asked to subjectively evaluate their facial appearance using a three-point rating scale:  $\mathrm{r} =$  fully satisfied;  $2 =$  partially satisfied; and  $3 =$  unsatisfied.

# Patient's satisfaction of esthetics and function of the implant-supported prosthesis

Upon the completion of the prosthetic rehabilitation, patients were also asked to subjectively evaluate esthetics and masticatory function of their maxillary implant-supported prostheses using a three-point rating scale:  $1 = \text{fully satisfied}$ ;  $2 = \text{partially satisfied}$ ; and  $3 = \text{unsatisfied}$ .

# Results

The mean hospitalization was 2.5 days (range: 2-5 days). In two patients present ing with extreme atrophy (#2 and 35), during down-fracturing of the maxilla after Le Fort I osteotomy, a fracture of the palatal vault occurred, but it was still possible to complete maxillary reconstruction and prosthetic treatment afterwards. Postoperative recovery of the reconstructive phase was uneventful in 36 patients. Extensive hematomas of the face and limited intraoral wound dehiscences occurred in two patients, but healed spontaneously and had no consequences on the final treatment outcome. In one patient (#29), complaining persistent pain in the anterior maxilla, exposure of the anterior part of the bone graft in the nasal fossae occurred 3 months after the reconstruction. The graft placed in the piriform aperture area was removed. Despite this complication, it was still possible to place six implants in the lateral parts of the reconstructed maxilla, six months after the reconstructive procedure and to successfully rehabilitate the patient with an implant-supported fixed prosthesis. Therefore, only one partial failure of the reconstructive procedure was observed. In two patients, where Le Fort I osteotomy was associated with buccal onlay grafts, despite an adequate consolidation of the osteotomized maxilla, a certain amount of resorption of the buccal onlay grafts was observed. In the first patient (#3), implants were placed despite moderate resorption, but buccal dehiscence on one implant had to be corrected by packing particulated autogenous bone taken locally and covered by a expanded polytetrafluorethylene (e-PTFE) membrane. The membrane was removed at the time of abutment connection and excellent regeneration was found. In the second patient (#28), a relevant resorption of the buccal grafts was observed, despite adequate healing of Le Fort I osteotomy, and it was necessary to regraft the resorbed areas (three implant sites) with autogenous bone


blocks taken intraorally and implant placement had to be postponed. Three months later, it was possible to place the previously programmed number of implants in an adequate position in the regrafted areas.

As far as donor site recovery is concerned, all patients reported relevant, albeit temporary, pain and/or discomfort in dehambulation, lasting from a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 12 weeks. Two patients reported temporary decreased sensitivity on the lateral part of the thigh, corresponding to innervation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve branches, lasting from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 10 weeks. Ten patients developed subcutaneous seromas after removal of the iliac drainage, which healed with no further consequences after evacuation by aspiration.

Postoperative recovery after implant placement was uneventful in all patients. During the follow-up period, six patients (42 implants) dropped-out of the study, 1-4 years after the start of prosthetic loading. Of these, two patients (#22 and 36) did not present at recall visits, three (#12, 14, and 17) died because of systemic complications related to malignant tumors, and one (#29) died because of aortic aneurisma disruption (Table 1).

During the follow-up period, 15 implants in 10 patients were removed. Of these, five implants in three patients failed to integrate before the start of prosthetic loading and were removed at the time of abutment connection. Ten implants in seven patients were removed 1-3 years after the start of prosthetic loading, due to loss of integration (see Table 1 for further details). Four implants in three patients were replaced, while in the other patients the lost implants were not substituted and the implant-supported prostheses were adapted to the remaining implants. In one of these patients (#9), the original fixed prosthesis, due to the loss of two implants, was

substituted with an implant-supported overdenture. Thirty-two implants in 17 patients, although integrated, presented with peri-implant bone-level changes higher than those proposed for successful implants (means, standard deviations, medians, and quartile ranges of peri-implant bone-level changes are reported in Table 2). Thus, cumulative survival and success rates of implants at the end of the observation period were  $94.5\%$  and  $82.9\%$ , respectively (Table 3).

Means, standard deviations, medians and quartile ranges of MPI, MBI, and PD at different time intervals are reported in Table 4.

Thirty-six of 39 patients  $(92.3\%)$  were fully satisfied of both the change of facial appearance and function/esthetics of their prosthetic restoration. Two patients (#28 and 29) were partially satisfied by the final prosthetic result, because they expected a fixed restoration instead of a removable implant-supported restoration. The third one (#20) was unsatisfied with both facial appearance and function/esthetics of her prosthesis. In addition, she reported temporomandibular joint chronic pain, which appeared after the completion of prosthetic rehabilitation, and although ameliorated after modifications of the upper jaw prosthesis, it was still present 2 years after.

A case treated with Le Fort I osteotomy is presented in Fig. 1(a)-(j) (patient #3).

# Discussion

Extreme atrophy of the edentulous maxilla still represent a challenge as far as prosthetic rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses is concerned. This is due not only to insufficient bone volume for implant placement, but also to unfavorable vertical, transverse, and anterior-posterior intermaxillary relationship, due to the centripetal resorption pattern of the maxillary bone. Infact, well consolidated surgical procedures to augment the residual bone such as maxillary sinus augmentation and onlay grafting procedures may allow the correction of insufficient bone volume, but are frequently not sufficient to correct also severe maxillary retrusion and/or relevantly increased interarch distance. This may lead to poor results from an esthetic and functional viewpoint.

Results from this study showed that Le Fort I osteotomy in association with interpositional iliac grafts is a reliable surgical means to reposition severely atrophic edentulous maxillae (class VI according to Cawood and Howell classification) in a correct intermaxillary relationship and to create adequate bone volume for secondary implant placement and implant-supported prosthetic restorations. In this study, the survival rate of implants placed in the reconstructed maxillae  $(94.5\%)$  is not only consistent with those reported by other publications on the same topic (range:  $67 - 95\%$ ) (Sailer 1989; Isaksson


et al. 1993; Cawood et al. 1994; Krekmanov 1995; Li et al. 1996; Watzinger et al. 1996; Nyström et al. 1997; Kahnberg et al. 1999; Keller et al. 1999a, 1999b; Lekholm et al. 1999; Stoelinga et al. 2000; Yerit et al. 2004], but also with those related to implants placed in native, non-reconstructed edentulous maxillae (Adell et al. 1981, 1990a; Albrektsson et al. 1986; Van Steenberghe et al. 1990; Lekholm et al. 1994, 1999; Branemark et al. 1995; Lindquist et al. 1996; Buser et al. 1997; Arvidson et al. 1998; Weber et al. 2000; Leonhardt et al. 2002]. All implant failures occurred in the first 3 years after implant placement, while no other failures were observed in later phases. However, some considerations have to be made.


The success rate of implants placed in reconstructed maxillae after Le Fort I osteotomy reported in this study  $(82.9\%)$  was comparable with that reported by other publications on the same topic (range:  $81 - 91\%$ ), but significantly lower than that obtained for implants placed in edentulous, but non-reconstructed maxillae (Albrektsson et al. 1986, 1988; Adell et al. 1990a, 1990b; Van Steenberghe et al. 1990; Lekholm et al. 1994, 1999; Lindquist et al. 1996; Buser et al. 1997; Arvidson et al. 1998; Weber et al. 2000; Leonhardt et al. 2002). This was mainly due to the relevant peri-implant bone resorption which involved 32 out of 281 implants in the reconstructed maxillae (up to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  after 3 years of loading). However, it is worth noting that there is a paucity of data related to this aspect. Peri-implant bone changes were evaluated only in a few publications (Watzinger et al. 1996; Stoelinga et al. 2000). Conversely, the majority of publications reported only survival rates of implants placed in down-fractured maxillae after Le Fort I osteotomy (Sailer 1989; Isaksson et al. 1993; Cawood et al. 1994; Krekmanov 1995; Li et al. 1996; Nyström et al. 1997; Kahnberg et al. 1999; Keller et al. 1999a, 1999b; Yerit et al. 2004).

It was also observed that the highest rate of peri-implant bone resorption occurred within the third year after loading, while these values tended to stabilize in the following years, with no further significant variations. One may speculate that, despite a successful reconstructive procedure, temporary or prolonged ischemia of the osteotomized maxilla may espouse to late resorption of the residual alveolus of the downfractured maxilla.

Another consideration which has to be done is that, while the majority of the publications are in agreement as far as indications for Le Fort I osteotomy are concerned, some controversy still exists as far as the preservation of sinus mucosa during the downfracturing procedure and the timing of implant placement are concerned. Some authors (Krekmanov 1995; Yerit et al. 2004) consider the preservation of sinus mucosa a critical factor for reducing the risk of graft infection/resorption, although others reported  $100\%$  success rate of the grafting procedure despite total removal of the sinus mucosa (Sailer 1989; Isaksson et al. 1993; Nyström et al. 1997; Keller et al. 1999b). Results from this study seem to demonstrate that sinus mucosa preservation is not a critical factor for the success of the reconstructive procedure. In the present study only one case of graft infection occurred (#29), but in the area of the piriform aperture, where nasal mucosa was preserved.


Also the choice between placement in conjunction with the reconstructive procedure or in a second surgical time (after consolidation of the osteotomized maxilla and grafts has occurred) is still controversial. Those authors who advocate immediate implant placement (Keller et al. 1987; Isaksson et al. 1993; Krekmanov 1995; Lekholm et al. 1999; Yerit et al. 2004) underline the following advantages: reduction of surgical procedures and shortening of rehabilitation times.

Those who advocate a staged implant placement (Cawood et al. 1994; Kahnberg et al. 1999; Keller et al. 1999a, 1999b; Nystrom et al. 1997; Stoelinga et al. 2000) stress the following: (a) easier and more precise implant placement with the aid of prosthetically driven templates; and (b) less risk of implant failure, due to the period of significant ischemia that follows down-fracturing of the maxilla, which may compromise osseointegration of implants. Infact, not only the residual bone of the down-fractured maxilla may be initially ischemic, but also almost all the grafted bone. Moreover, the supplementary trauma determined by implant site preparation and implant placement may further reduce local vascularity. In case of resorption/infection of the graft, loss of both bone and implants may espouse patients to an unacceptable biologic and economic cost. For these reasons, in this study a staged approach was always chosen.

Another issue, which is worth mentioning is the choice of number and dimensions of implants to be placed in the reconstructed maxillae. As far as the number of implants is concerned, the majority of authors suggested 6 to 8 implants, but no specific explanation of this choice has been found in the literature (Sailer 1989; Isaks son et al. 1993; Cawood et al. 1994; Krekmanov 1995; Li et al. 1996; Watzinger et al. 1996; Nyström et al. 1997; Kahnberg et al. 1999; Keller et al. 1999a, 1999b; Lekholm et al. 1999; Stoelinga et al. 2000; Yerit et al. 2004]. In the present publication, the authors followed the same strategy, and the number varied according to type of prosthetic rehabilitation chosen (fixed or removable implant-supported prosthesis) and local conditions after the reconstruction. On average, a higher number of implants (up to nine implants per patient) were used for fixed restorations, although in some patients a removable, implant-supported prosthesis was fabricated, also if eight implants were placed. This choice was dictated by economic reasons or by the need of improving esthetics, upper lip support, and oral hygiene simplification.


Although it has been demonstrated that short implants can successfully support dental restorations, it is worth noting that these studies were all related to implants placed in native, non-reconstructed bone (Ten Bruggenkate et al. 1998; Friberg et al. 2000; Tawil & Younan 2003; Feldman et al. 2004; Griffin & Cheung 2004; Ndir et al. 2004). As far as implant dimensions placed in reconstructed maxillae with Le Fort I osteotomy are concerned, no clear indications have been found in the literature, although a tendency toward longer implants, which can engage the entire volume of the grafted bone, has been suggested by the majority of authors (Isaksson et al. 1993; Cawood et al. 1994; Krekmanov 1995; Li et al. 1996; Watzinger et al. 1996; Nyström et al. 1997; Kahnberg et al. 1999; Keller et al. 1999a, 1999b; Lekholm et al. 1999; Stoelinga et al. 2000; Yerit et al. 2004). In fact, a higher failure rate was found with shorter implants (Krekmanov 1995; Keller et al. 1999a, 1999b). In the present study, the length of implants varied from 10 to  $18\mathrm{mm}$  (with the majority of implants ranging from 12 to  $15\mathrm{mm}$ ), due to the wide range of clinical situations and available bone. However, the length was chosen as to engage the entire volume of the grafted bone.

As far as peri-implant clinical parameters are concerned, it was observed that mean and median values of MBI, MPI, and PD were consistent with those related to implants placed in native bone (Mericke

Stern et al. 1994; Levy et al. 1996; Nishimura et al. 1997; Behneke et al. 2000; Leonhardt et al. 2002). Only in those patients presenting with higher peri-implant bone resorption rates (32 implants), higher PD values were recorded (up to  $6.5\mathrm{mm}$ ).

# Conclusion

Results from this study seem to demonstrate that Le Fort I osteotomy with downward/forward repositioning of the maxilla in association with inlay grafts followed by secondary implant placement is a relatively safe and predictable means to rehabilitate patients affected by severe atrophy of edentulous maxillae with implant-supported prostheses. The survival rate of implants obtained in this study  $(94.5\%)$  is consistent with that reported in case of implants placed in native bone. Conversely, success rate obtained in this study  $(82.9\%)$  was lower than that reported for implants placed in native bone. Patients' satisfaction as regards improvement of facial esthetics and masticatory function was also high  $(92.3\%)$ . However, due to the relevant morbidity and higher technical complexity, this procedure should be limited to severe atrophy of edentulous maxillae, with relevant retrusion and increased interarch distance, when simpler techniques such as onlay grafts, inlay grafts (maxillary sinus grafting procedures), or guided bone regeneration may be not sufficient for adequate correction of bone volume and intermaxillary relationship.
