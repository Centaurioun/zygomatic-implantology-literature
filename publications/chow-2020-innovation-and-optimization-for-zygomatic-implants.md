# Innovation and Optimization for Zygomatic Implants

James Chow and Andrew Dawood

# Original Protocol with Zygomatic Implants ad modum Brænemark and Associated Limitations

Zygomatic implants when first introduced were utilized as a rescue solution to manage failed implant cases in patients with extremely resorbed maxillae. In a retrospective study published by P-I Brænemark and coworkers [1], a high implant survival rate was reported with zygomatic implants used in 28 consecutively treated patients. All these patients were classified as difficult cases who had undergone major grafting procedures and had received implants previously without success. Despite the favorable treatment outcomes reported in the above-mentioned retrospective study, zygomatic implants were associated with certain well-known problems. Because of the length of the instrumentation designed for these longer than usual implants, (ranging from  $30\mathrm{mm}$  to  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$  in length), surgical access is often more difficult posteriorly. As a consequence, the entrance location for the implant is usually situated in the premolar region, resulting in a distal cantilever arm on the prosthesis. In addition, the head of the zygomatic implant is often located at a more palatal position and this may affect patient comfort, especially when the zygomatic implants are not symmetrically distributed in a bilateral case, also potentially compromising speech, and oral hygiene maintenance may be compromised. In general, zygomatic implant surgery is technically a challenging and complex procedure; therefore, it is usually performed by specialists in oral and maxillofacial surgery.

Another uncommon, but significant, problem associated with zygomatic implants is maxillary sinusitis. Among the 28 patients treated by P-I Branemark in the

Since there was a concern regarding the intra-sinus path of a zygomatic implant, P-I Branemark worked in close collaboration with ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist colleagues to investigate sinus health after treatment. An endoscopic study [2] conducted by Branemark's ENT colleagues showed that contact with the exposed titanium surface did not lead to infection or inflammation of sinus mucosa. The etiology of the sinus infection in patients who have received zygomatic implants is not well understood. However, it is understood that development of an oral-antral communication is a significant risk factor that may predispose patients to develop maxillary sinusitis during zygomatic implant therapy. This may be precipitated by resorption of the thin residual crestal or palatal bone surrounding the neck of a zygomatic implant, such that separation of the maxillary sinus cavity from the oral cavity is solely reliant upon a soft tissue seal. This soft tissue barrier might not be sufficiently robust to withstand the shear forces produced by the movement of the long flexible zygomatic implant under functional loading, and may be vulnerable to oral bacteria. If this soft tissue barrier breaks down, the resulting portal for invasion of the maxillary sinus by oral bacteria may result in sinus infection (Fig. 1).

Sinus infection may be managed medically or surgically, by prescribing oral antibiotics and a nasal decongestant or by open drainage and lavage. However, if an oral-antral communication develops, sinus infection may become a recurrent problem and can be difficult to manage. In his retrospective study of 28 patients, Brænemark developed a procedure together with his ENT colleagues called "inferior meatal antrostomy." This established permanent drainage between the maxillary sinus and the nasal cavity, and effectively managed the sinus infection on all four symptomatic patients.

# Modified Protocols for Zygomatic Implant Installation

In order to address the above-mentioned problems in relation to the original surgical protocols for zygomatic implants, it is important to understand their etiology. In particular, the intra-sinus path might predispose the high-risk patient to recurrent maxillary sinusitis. Therefore, there are various external techniques being introduced to keep the zygomatic implants extra-sinus.

Chow et al. published a new method for placing zygomatic implants with the intention of avoiding maxillary sinusitis [3]. They performed an extended sinus lift on 16 consecutive patients before preparing the zygomatic implant osteotomy. The extended sinus lift procedure created a large lateral window from the maxillary sinus floor to the root of the Zygoma bone (Fig. 2). The bone wall was kept attaching on the sinus mucosa during sinus membrane elevation and the Zygomatic implant osteotomy was completed with an extra-sinus path. As such, all these patients received Zygomatic implants that were external to the lifted maxillary sinus membrane (Fig. 3). Two important observations with significant clinical implications resulted from this study: First, none of the 16 patients developed sinusitis during the period of investigation. Second, de novo bone formation was observed radiographically around the body of the zygomatic implants in some patients (Fig. 4a–c). This new bone formation was thought to be related to the osteoconductive TiUnite&trade; implant surface and the osteogenic potential of the exposed bone surface of the maxilla after elevation of the Schneiderian membrane.

Malo and his team published a 7-year follow-up describing their extra-maxillary technique [4]. However, simply by keeping the zygomatic implants extra-maxilla failed to eliminate the sinus infection completely; in their study,  $7\%$  of their patients developed maxillary sinusitis. Malo and his team suggested that the majority of these patients suffered from preexisting maxillary sinusitis, which was not an exclusion criterion in their study. Another possible explanation was that the convexity of the lateral maxillary sinus wall in some patients might still create an oral-antral communication upon implant osteotomy for the extra-maxillary technique.


# Immediate Loading of Zygomatic Implants

The original Brænemark Zygomatic implant protocol employed a two-stage approach. Stage one surgery was performed under general anesthesia with nasoendotracheal intubation. The atrophic maxilla was exposed by using a Le Fort I osteotomy vestibular incision and a mucoperiosteal flap was raised and reflected toward the palatal side. Patients receiving zygomatic implants usually had an extremely resorbed maxillary ridge and already had difficulty wearing a maxillary complete denture, and retention and stability of the denture was further compromised following the extensive flap surgery for conventional and zygomatic implant placement. In order to improve the quality of life and restore oral function for these patients, there was a constant quest to develop a method of immediate loading with zygomatic implants. Since 2004, we started loading zygomatic implants immediately and instead of using a vestibular incision, we changed to a crestal incision to facilitate one-stage surgery. When zygomatic implants were not submerged for healing, it was recommended that the implants should be immediately splinted with the anterior dental implants so as to avoid inappropriate individual loading of the implants with an unstable denture. The necessity for splinting zygomatic implants provided an essential foundation for immediate loading. Moreover, we made use of computer-based planning and sometimes stereolithographic templates for guided surgery and immediate loading of zygomatic implants in selected cases. Patients with stable complete dentures and with sufficient bone volume in the anterior maxilla were chosen for the guided approach. In 2006, the first five consecutive patients undergoing the guided immediate loading protocol were reported [5]. These patients received conventional implant osteotomy and zygomatic implant osteotomy using a minimally invasive approach through a mucosa-supported surgical guide (Fig. 5). The anterior implants were installed by flapless surgery through the sleeves on the surgical guide, whereas the zygomatic implant osteotomy was performed under direct visualization after exposing the postero-lateral aspect of the maxilla and the zygomatic buttress via a short buccal vestibular incision at the premolar-molar region (Fig. 6). When the zygomatic implant osteotomy was completed, a zygomatic implant was installed by free hand without the surgical template. A provisional prosthesis with acrylic teeth and a cast metal framework was prefabricated based on the computer planning. This provisional prosthesis had openings corresponding to the planned implant positions. After all implants had been installed, definitive abutments were connected. Then, the prosthesis was attached to the titanium cylinders attached to the abutments using auto-polymerizing acrylic resin. Once the acrylic resin was polymerized, the opening of each titanium cylinder was located and opened, and the provisional prosthesis was converted into a screw-retained abutment-level provisional prosthesis for immediate loading (Fig. 7). The immediate loading protocol was a significant improvement of the original zygomatic implant protocol. However, this guided approach was premature because the surgical guide effectively was only a pilot drill guide for the zygomatic implant osteotomy. More importantly, there was no effective mechanism to precisely control where the tip of the zygomatic implant twist drill was directed. Therefore, the risk of intrusion into the orbital cavity or the infra-temporal fossa could not be eliminated.

# Optimal Positioning of Zygomatic Implants

Optimal positioning of zygomatic implants is crucial. As a tilted implant, we have to control the entrance position, the exit location, and the trajectory of the implant. The entrance should be prosthetically driven, whereas the exit should be located where there is adequate bone anchorage with a low risk of intrusion into the orbit or infra-temporal fossa. A prosthetically driven approach would ideally avoid a palatal position of the implant head and reduce or even eliminate a distal cantilever of the prosthesis (Fig. 8a, b). The entrance should be located at the molar region with a crestal position or even a slight buccal bias. If it is a bilateral case, then symmetrical positioning of the implants appears to be more comfortable for the patient. Restricted surgical access particularly where mouth opening is limited may compromise prosthetically driven positioning of the point of entry of a Zygomatic implant, particularly if the opposing arch is dentate. The exit location should allow for good bony anchorage with high primary implant stability for the apical part of the zygomatic implant, facilitating an immediate loading protocol. In a bilateral case, it is recommended to install the tip of the zygomatic implant at the upper half of the Zygoma bone where the bone is usually thicker. Hung et al. conducted a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) study to investigate what is the best location of the Planning for zygomatic implant treatments takes place routinely with the use of 3D data from CBCT or CT, giving the surgeon ready access to DICOM data. Whilst computer simulation is always recommended, the DICOM data may be readily converted to a STL file for 3D printing of a physical maxillary model. There are many possible technologies that may be used to produce detailed maxillary models, ranging from low-cost SLA or fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers to more sophisticated industrial selective laser sintering (SLS) printers. Having access to a 3D printed model allows for more tangible planning, including trial surgery which may be particularly important where anatomy is unusual, for example, when carrying out revision surgery or where a congenital/acquired defect is present.

In order to enhance the primary stability upon installation, a tapered apical portion of the zygomatic implant was recently introduced by Nobel Biocare. The trajectory of a zygomatic implant is dependent on the local anatomy of the maxilla. According to the ZAGA classification proposed by Aparicio in 2010 [6],  $69\%$  of zygomatic implants could take an intra-sinus trajectory when a prosthetically driven treatment plan is adopted (Fig. 9). For these  $69\%$  of cases, one effective way to keep the zygomatic implants external to the maxillary sinus is by elevating the sinus membrane before performing the implant osteotomy. By performing an extended sinus lift, the path of the implant is always external to the maxillary sinus despite an intra-sinus trajectory. Heinze et al. advocated immediate sinus grafting around the Zygomatic implants after extended sinus elevation [7]. They believed that sinus augmentation would provide for a thicker bony barrier between the sinus cavity and the oral cavity and would prevent maxillary sinusitis as a consequence. Finite element analysis to compare load distribution in zygomatic implant cases with and without alveolar bone support around the coronal portion of the implants showed that when there is alveolar bone support, load distribution is more favorable [8]. We have been performing extended sinus lift and grafting for Zygomatic implant in ZAGA type 0 and type 1 patients since 2008. In those patients who also received grafting after sinus lift, none of them developed sinus infection during the follow-up period. More importantly, there was no radiological sign of sinus pathology such as membrane thickening and blocked ostium among them (Fig. 10).

An additional advantage of placing the entrance location between the first and second molar is that the trajectory of the Zygomatic implant takes a postero-anterior direction, which is opposite to an antero-posterior direction when an entrance is located at the premolar region. This postero-anterior direction minimizes the risk of intrusion into the infratemporal fossa.

Because optimal positioning is so important, guided surgery has some important advantages. However, as yet, there is no effective mechanism available for guided surgery with zygomatic implants. Chow published an article on a novel device called the "Zygoma drill guide" [9], which is an apparatus to guide the long twist drill for the Zygomatic implant osteotomy at both the entrance and exit. This apparatus is a two-piece device with drill sleeves at both ends that are aligned along the same axis (Fig. 11a, b). The design and production of this novel device made use of the latest digital technologies including CAD software and additive manufacturing. Titanium prototypes and the final optimized device were produced using SLS.

When a surgical guide is employed for preparation of a zygomatic implant osteotomy, a major limiting factor is inadequate surgical access for the long twist drills, making it challenging to achieve adequate mouth opening for a correctly orientated drill within the guide. As the use of surgical guides for zygomatic implants is not fully validated by any implant software provider, the surgical guide may be produced for pilot drilling only. Marking the starting point for the osteotomy must also help to carry out the procedure according to a plan developed in software, even if subsequent site preparation takes place using a freehand approach. While the use of a fully guided protocol for a zygomatic implant may not be possible, overall treatment may be simplified if guided surgery is used for any conventional implants planned. In an approach reported by Dawood et al., a pre-positioned zygomatic implant may be used to provide stability for a surgical guide to allow dental implants to be placed in sites which cannot be exploited in any other way [10]. The introduction of the zero-degree NobelZygoma&trade; implant by Malo et al. [11] may make the installation of this new form of zygomatic implant through a surgical guide more practical.

Because of the significant problems associated with the use of a surgical guide, real-time navigation may be an alternative (for more details, please refer to Chap. 7).

# Innovation and Evolution in Zygomatic Implants

Minor alterations in implant design may make a significant difference to handling at the time of surgery and may have far-reaching implications for long-term success. The first commercially available zygomatic implant was supplied by Nobel Biocare; this blunt-tipped implant had a machined surface and was threaded along its entire length, with a step to a wider diameter coronally (from  $\varnothing 3.76\mathrm{mm}$  to  $\varnothing 4.4\mathrm{mm}$ ). The wider coronal part has a  $45^{\circ}$  platform and a typical external hex connection. The abutment screw connection continued through the implant in order to provide sufficient space for a standard-length abutment screw. The next iteration from Nobel Biocare saw the introduction of a TiUnite&trade; surface and a shorter abutment screw recess, for a shorter dedicated abutment screw. Both these implant types had an apical chamber intended to allow for the sequestration of bone chips produced during the insertion of the implant. Though present in versions by Straumann/Neodent, which are similar to the Nobel Biocare original implants, this apical chamber is absent from other zygomatic implant designs. The apical chamber feature may be associated with the rare complication of extra-oral infection over the tip of the implant (this has been treated in the past by removal of the tip of the implant to eliminate the chamber [12] (Fig. 12a-d).

Brænemark's original patents for the zygomatic implant also described a long implant with separate parallel threaded elements at tip and neck, with an intervening un-threaded shaft. With expiration of the patent, a similar design was made available by Southern Implants, which has a machined shaft and threaded neck ( $\varnothing 4.3 \mathrm{~mm}$ ), while the shaft and threaded apex have a narrower diameter ( $\varnothing 3.4 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) intended to facilitate quad zygoma treatment; like all the Southern Zygomatic implant range, this implant has a  $55^{\circ}$  platform with the intention of reducing the need for angle correction.

# Customized Implants and Implants with Unthreaded Shafts

For oncology patients or patients with large maxillary defects, the use of commercially available implants for the remote anchorage of prostheses using the zygomatic bone as a site was not ideal, as the threaded shaft of the zygomatic implant would be an exposed and unhygienic irritant to the tissues. In the UK, our first experience of implants with unthreaded shafts was for the treatment of oncology patients with patient-specific customized devices made for us by the prototype workshop at Nobel Biocare. These first implants initially took the form of a conventional Brænemark implant of length chosen to match the specific anatomical anchorage site, extended with the addition of a machined and later TiUnite&trade; surfaced shaft of the prescribed length. The commercial need for an implant with an unthreaded shaft for this specific patient group was first met by the Introduction of the Oncology implant by Southern, which has a machined shaft in various lengths with the characteristic  $55^{\circ}$  platform. With the use of these implants, it became evident that there might be a compelling argument for the use of these types of implants in our more typically atrophic patient group.

In an attempt to avoid complications associated with exposure of the threaded shaft and soft tissue inflammation and bony remodeling around the threads, further development from Nobel Biocare, Southern, and later other manufactures, such as Norris Medical and JDental Care, saw the evolution of implants with unthreaded shafts, specifically intended for a more "extra-"maxillary approach to surgery and implant positioning. For Nobel Biocare implants, the shaft has an anodized (TiUnite&trade;) surface, whereas other manufacturers offered a machined finish. As well as a version with an unthreaded shaft ( $0.4.1\mathrm{mm}$ ) and the more usual  $45^{\circ}$  platform, with a slightly narrower tapered/threaded tip for anchorage, Nobel Biocare also provides a  $0^{\circ}$  version with a wider ( $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) tapered and threaded tip for anchorage and a narrower ( $0.4.1\mathrm{mm}$ ) shaft. The wider diameter tapered tip provides aggressive anchorage while the narrower shaft reduces prominence, although this larger tip may be more difficult to use in a quad-zygoma configuration in a patient with a smaller zygoma. An advantage of the  $0^{\circ}$  design is that it allows the use of standard abutments screws, as the screw recess extends along the shaft of the implant;  $45^{\circ}$  and  $65^{\circ}$  abutments are also available for this implant. Other manufacturers, for example, Norris Medical and J Dentalcare also produce  $0^{\circ}$  zygomatic implants; both of these have particularly tapered/threaded tips. There is indeed a general trend amongst implant manufacturers to have a more tapered threaded section with a more pointed tip, to improve operator feedback, as the tip of the implant is located into the prepared site, and for more aggressive anchorage into the zygoma; a consequence of this is that choosing the correct implant length is particularly important because anchorage will steeply decline if there is any uncertainty in positioning and the implant is slightly unscrewed. Furthermore, overextension of the implant tip beyond the zygoma has the potential to cause a palpable and potentially irritating prominence beneath the skin overlying the zygoma.

Most manufacturers treat the threaded portion of their zygomatic implants with the surface commonly used on their dental implants. Most zygomatic implants are made from type 4 titanium (the narrow-shaft versions from Southern have been cold worked to improve strength), while the  $0^{\circ}$  implant from Norris Medical is made from a Ti-6Al-4Va alloy.

To overcome the problem of surgical access affected by mouth opening, Dawood and his co-workers developed an extra-oral approach to place a specially designed "reverse" zygomatic implant in a patient who had undergone a partial maxillectomy [13]. The osteotomy for this implant could be carried out extra-orally, from the Zygoma bone or orbital rim toward the edentulous ridge through the jaw defect. Dawood and his team emphasized the importance of customizing treatment to address individual patient needs. In this special case, they took full advantage of digital technology including CBCT images, additive manufacturing, and the CAD/CAM process. The successful outcome of this treatment served as proof of concept to support the use of this new approach (Fig. 13a-d). Subsequent development led to the use of an extra-/ intra-orally guided approach, using a 3D printed facemask, and attached intra- and extra-oral guides (Fig. 14a-f). These first cases suggest that the implant may serve a useful purpose in advanced maxillofacial reconstruction for selected patients.


# Conclusion

Zygomatic implants are well documented as a predictable treatment for the rehabilitation of patients with advanced atrophy or significant maxillary defects. The complications encountered early in our experience of this treatment modality have been a driver for continuous innovation and development. The current zygoma concept consists of external techniques and an evolving array of implant designs, many of which have little in the way of long-term follow-up. Immediate loading protocols further improve the results of treatment by minimizing biological risk and maximizing the functional and aesthetic outcome. Innovative ideas from committed clinicians and the continued development of digital workflow capabilities and protocols may facilitate the establishment of an effective guided and/or navigated approach for future zygomatic implant treatment. The ultimate goal is to benefit our patients who are the candidates for zygomatic implants.
