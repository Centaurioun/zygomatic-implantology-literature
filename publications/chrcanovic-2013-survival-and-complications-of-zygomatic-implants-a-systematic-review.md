# Abstract

Purpose This systematic review attempted to answer the focused questions: "What is the survival rate of zygomatic implants (ZIs)?" and "What are the most common complications related to surgery of zygomatic implants?"

Methods An electronic search without date or language restrictions was undertaken in PubMed in March 2012. Titles and abstracts from these results  $(n = 123)$  were read for identifying studies that meet the eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting clinical series of zygomatic implants (ZIs). Because of the scarcity of articles with high-level grades of evidence, all articles, including studies with few case reports, were considered for inclusion. All reference lists of the selected and review studies were hand-searched for additional papers that might meet the eligibility criteria. Simple case report articles were not included. Review articles without original data were excluded. Quantitative data extracted from the included studies that provided data for the period of failure of ZIs were used for the calculation of interval survival rate during each follow-up period and cumulative survival rate (CSR) over a 12-year period.

Results Thirty-seven studies were identified without repetition and five more studies were included by hand-searching, giving a total of 42; 12 evaluated the use of ZI applied with immediate function protocols and 3 for rehabilitating patients after maxillary resections for tumor ablations. These latter three studies showed smaller ZI success. Postoperative complications reported were as follows: 70 cases of sinusitis, 48 of soft tissue infection, 15 of paresthesia, and 17 cases of oroantral fistulas. However, this number may be underestimated, since most of the studies did not mention the presence or absence of these complications. Most ZI failures were detected at the abutment connection phase (6 months after the surgery of implant placement) or before. The CSR over a 12-year period was  $96.7\%$ .


Conclusions Despite the high survival rate observed, there is an impending need for conducting randomized controlled clinical trials to test the efficacy of these implants in comparison with the other techniques to treat the atrophic maxilla. Thus, the findings reported in the review must be interpreted with considerable caution. Moreover, more studies with longer follow-up periods involving adequate number of ZIs are needed. This will help to obtain a better understanding of the survival of ZIs in a long term. It is suggested that multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trials and longer clinical studies should be implemented in this area, before recommending routine use of ZIs for patients could be given. The placement of zygomatic implants requires very experienced surgeons because it is not risk free since delicate anatomic structures such as the orbita and brain may be involved.

# Introduction

Although the prevalence of edentulism is diminishing in some parts of the world, the longevity of populations worldwide and other factors contribute to sustain the actual number of edentulous patients [1]. Dentures, especially in atrophic jaws, are associated with different kinds of morbidity (stomatitis, traumatic ulcers, and irritation-induced hyperplasia), psychological alterations (depression), and social problems (reduced social interactions, educational opportunities, and job opportunities) [1].


Rehabilitation of the masticatory function with dental implants can be achieved with predictable success in various clinical situations, and acceptable long-term results have been presented in patients with sufficient bone volume. However, the problem of insufficient height and width of the alveolar ridge at the implant site remains [2]. The severely atrophied maxilla constitutes a challenging therapeutic problem because bone augmentation is required to enable placement of a sufficient number and length of implants [2]. Advanced posterior alveolar resorption combined with increased maxillary sinus pneumatization often leaves insufficient bone for implant anchorage [3]. Even more challenging are conditions such as cleft deformities, maxillary sinus aplasia, and maxillectomy defects which present a discontinuous maxilla and complex bony and soft tissue anatomy [4-8].

Various techniques have been described to treat the atrophic maxilla, including the use of angled implants in the parasinus region [9], implants in pterygoid apophysis [10], grafting of the maxillary sinus floor [11, 12], short [13] and wide [14] implants, and zygomatic implants (ZIs).

Prospective studies [15-20] showed that ZIs can be used for successful rehabilitation of patients with atrophic maxillae. The ZI, when placed in conjunction with premaxillary implants, can facilitate surgical rehabilitation of patients presenting with severe maxillary resorption [2]. Treatment with the ZI in extensive maxillary defects looks very promising and could, in some cases, be the only treatment solution [21, 22].

Two reviews on ZIs were previously published [23, 24]. The first one was published in 2005 [23] and tested the hypothesis of no difference in outcomes between ZIs with and without bone augmenting procedures in comparison with conventional dental implants in augmented bone for severely resorbed maxillae. The authors observed at the time that ZIs seemed to yield high survival rates; however, complications are common and may increase over time. The authors further stated that until convincing evidence is available, ZIs should not be used routinely. The second paper [24] was published in 2011 and reviewed the literature published over the previous 6 years to evaluate treatment success with ZIs in patients with atrophic posterior maxilla. The authors concluded that ZIs have a high success rate and constitute a suitable alternative to treat severe posterior maxillary atrophy.

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes and complications of case series of ZIs. The questions for this systematic review were "What is the survival rate of zygomatic implants?" and "What are the most common complications related to surgery of zygomatic implants?"


# Materials and methods

Data source and search strategies This systematic review was made following to the PRISMA statement [25] suggestions. An electronic search without date or language restrictions was undertaken in March 2012 in PubMed website (U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health). The following terms were used in the search strategy:

{Subject AND Adjective}

{Subject: (zygomatic OR zygoma OR zygomaticus [Title])

AND

Adjective: (implant OR implants OR fixture OR fixtures [Title])}

All reference lists of the selected and review studies were hand-searched for additional papers that might meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this study. The titles and abstracts (when available) from these results were read for identifying studies that meet the eligibility criteria. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained and assessed.

Inclusion criteria Eligibility criteria included studies reporting clinical series of ZIs. The studies had to be conducted on patients who have an atrophic maxilla that cannot be rehabilitated with conventional dental implants due to lack of bone, including patients subjected to cancer ablation surgery and irradiation therapy. Patients can be partially or totally edentulous. The study could have applied immediate function protocols or not. Randomized controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and case series were included. Because of the scarcity of articles with high-level grades of evidence, all articles, including studies with few case reports, were considered for inclusion.

Exclusion criteria Simple case report articles were not included. Review articles without original data were excluded, although references to potentially pertinent articles were noted for further follow-up.

Outcomes and variables For each of the identified retrospective and prospective studies included, the following data were then extracted on a standard form: year of publication, number of patients in whom ZIs were placed, patients' age range and average, follow-up period range and average, number of ZIs placed and failed, number of additional conventional implants placed and failed, and postoperative complications reported, including sinusitis, soft tissue infection, paresthesia, and fistula formation.


Analysis Agreement between the two reviewers was determined for the inclusion or exclusion of reports. Due to the absence of controlled studies, a meta-analysis was not performed. Descriptive statistics were utilized to report the data. In order to standardize and clarify ambiguous data, dental implant success (percentage of implants that remained osseointegrated at the end of the each study, i.e., percentage of implants that were not lost) was reported for the publications.

The survival rate analysis was also calculated. In biomedical applications, survival analysis is used to study the length of time until an event occurs. Here, the event studied was ZI loss. The surgery of placement of ZIs was considered the initiating event. Quantitative data extracted from the included studies that provided data for the period of failure of ZIs were used for calculation of interval survival rate (ISR) during each follow-up period and cumulative survival rate (CSR) over a 12-year period. ISR is an entity that represents the proportion of surviving items in a group, during a specific time interval only. CSR represents the proportion of items existing at the beginning of a time interval that survive till the end of the interval being studied. A life table survival analysis for the total number of implants surviving over a 12-year period was performed to study these two elements.

# Results

The search strategy outlined above identified 123 studies. Of these, the reviewers agreed on 39 for full-text review. Two were cited in more than one research of terms. Thus, 37 studies were identified without repetition. Additional hand-searching of the reference lists of the selected studies and review studies yielded five additional papers. The results of the 42 included studies are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Two were global multicenter studies, and the other 40 studies were carried out in 14 countries: 10 in Spain; 6 each in Sweden and in the United States; 3 each in Brazil, Belgium, and Germany; 2 in China; and 1 each in Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, and UK.

The publications included 1,145 patients and 2,402 ZIs. A total of 56 ZIs were reported as failures. Most failures  $(n = 32)$  were detected at the abutment connection phase (6 months after the surgery of implant placement) or before.

Seven failures were not informed when they occurred. An additional 2,879 conventional implants were placed in the anterior region, 115 failed (Table 1). It is important to note here that not all studies reported the additional (standard) implants performed. Therefore, this number is probably underestimated. Postoperative complications reported (Table 2) were as follows: 70 cases of sinusitis, 48 cases of soft tissue infection around the implants, 15 cases of paresthesia (infraorbital or zigomaticofacialis nerves), and 17 cases of formation of oroantral fistulas. One more time, not all studies reported complications. Thus, this number may be underestimated.

Between these 42 studies, 12 evaluated the use of ZIs applied with immediate function protocols [18-20, 26-34], showing a high survival of ZIs (95.8-100 %, Table 1). These publications reported 642 ZIs in 290 patients and 9 implant failures. Three clinical series reported the use of ZIs for rehabilitating patients after maxillary resections for tumor ablations [22, 35, 36], with a success rate ranging from 78.6 to  $91.7\%$ . An observation about the study of Landes et al. [36] is important. The authors treated 15 patients with 36 ZI; however, 12 of the 15 reported patients had resections for tumor ablations and were treated with the other 29 ZI. The other three patients were treated with seven ZIs due to bilateral cleft lip and palate, and these three patients and seven ZI were not computed. Thus, these three publications reported 85 ZIs in 33 patients and 13 implant failures.

Six prospective studies were identified [15-20]. Two of these papers [15, 17] describe the same study at different postoperative follow-ups. However, no control-treatment group was identified in any of these six prospective papers. No published randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials were identified.

Pooled data from the 39 articles showed a total of 49 failures over varying time periods. Thirty-two of these failures occurred before the implants were loaded and were reported to have occurred within the first 6 month interval of implant placement (most part detected at the abutment connection phase). This resulted in a 6-month ISR of  $98.4\%$  (the lowest ISR). The highest ISR was recorded as  $100\%$  at different time intervals (Table 3). Three studies (seven ZIs failures) were not included [37-39] because the time point when these failures occurred was not reported and the authors could not extract the total number of implants that were followed up to the time of failure. The CSR over a 12-year period was  $96.7\%$ .

# Discussion

The development of ZIs has allowed the reconstructive specialist to overcome the regional hard tissue deficiency by engaging bone at distant sites (i.e., the zygoma) for

Three studies were not included [37-39] because the time point when these failures occurred was not reported and the authors could not extract the total number of implants that were followed up to the time of failure increased stability/retention of a maxillary obturator/prosthesis after maxillary resection [22]. Maxillary rehabilitation can be further improved by using the vascularized bone graft and ZIs [40] or can mostly circumvent the need for vascularized osseomyocutaneous grafts or these grafts in combination with nonvascularized free bone grafts [41]. Sometimes, the implant placement at the time of initial resection surgery also allows for endosseous implant integration prior to commencement of postoperative radiotherapy [41], since irradiated tissues have impaired bone healing. Reconstitutions of the buttresses system ensure a stable base for occlusion, which is essential to optimal functional and esthetic maxillary rehabilitation [40].


However, there is a considerable disadvantage in the use of ZIs in large resections. Such a design places the implant at a significant biomechanical disadvantage given the long lever arm and the small amount of bone integration. Unfortunately, there are few options available for obturator retention for these patients. Reconstruction of such defects is surgically and prosthodontically difficult. The quality and quantity of the remaining bone available for osseointegration following an extensive maxillectomy are compromised. Because of this biomechanical disadvantage, it is possible to place two zygomaticus implants bilaterally, not only allowing for distribution of occlusal and retentive forces but also permitting a single implant on one side to be used should one implant fail [22].

Four factors for failure of ZIs for rehabilitation of patients after (hemi)maxillectomy after resection of tumors were identified by Landes [35]: overloading leverage in extensive maxillectomies, overgrowth of local soft tissue preventing abutment connection, recurrent infection, and tumor recurrence. Thick soft tissue overlapping the implant head can create problems when it comes to the prosthetic phase of rehabilitation [35]. The situation is worse if the implants extend through soft tissue flaps after palatal reconstruction, creating deep peri-implant pockets, which are sites predisposed to infections [35, 36]. All these factors and radiotherapy could have influenced the smaller percentage of success found in studies evaluating ZIs in patients after resection of tumors [22, 35, 36]. These studies were accomplished in patients who underwent resection maxillectomy for tumor ablation, and some of them received radiotherapy. Clearly, radiotherapy impacts on the success of zygomaticus implants and has a clear impact on the reparative capacity of bone [42]. The success rate for standard endosseous implants is lower in the irradiated oral and maxillofacial region. Parel and Tjellström [43] reported a success rate of  $61.1\%$  for craniofacial implants placed in irradiated bone. With the use of ZIs after resections surgeries, Schmidt et al. [22] reported  $78.6\%$  of success, Landes [35]  $85.7\%$ , and Landes et al. [36]  $91.7\%$  (Table 1).


Moreover, often, the only bone available for the integration of the zygomaticus implant is the zygomatic bone at the junction of the temporal and frontal process. The quality and quantity of the remaining bone available for osseointegration after an extensive maxillectomy are compromised. Generally, with standard endosseous implants, the occlusal force is parallel to the long axis of the implant. In zygomaticus implants, the implant is at a  $30^{\circ}$  to  $60^{\circ}$  angle relative to the occlusal force. These biomechanical requirements can contribute to zygomaticus implant failures in patients following extensive maxillectomy. However, one finding from the study of Schmidt et al. [22] that argues against biomechanical factors as the etiology of failure is that all implant failures occurred at stage II surgery, before loading. This finding further points to radiotherapy as a contributing factor to implant failures in these cases [22].


The results from the present study indicated that in 42 studies presenting clinical outcomes with the use of ZI (1,145 patients and 2,402 ZIs), a total of 56 implants were reported as failures. However, as was well stated by Aparicio et al. [44], it should be noted that some studies in part cover the same patient groups, and therefore the true numbers of unique patients and implants are not known in detail. Nevertheless, the data show that the ZI technique is highly predictable and results in good clinical outcomes.

When ZIs are installed in patients with resorbed maxillae but no maxillary resection, higher success rates have been reported. The reason seems to be that in such cases the palatinal alveolar crest and the sinus floor become part of the implant site. The result is the use of four cortical portions compared to one or a maximum of two cortical portions with conventional implant placement in the maxilla [45]. The engagement of as much cortical bone as possible has been advocated as a decisive factor for the success of dental implants because it provides more stability than a larger amount of less dense trabecular bone [46]. A number of authors have reported on the placement of ZIs in smokers, with no increase in failure rates [16, 17, 38, 39, 47, 48].

The present study identified 12 studies which evaluated the use of ZIs applied with immediate function protocols [18-20, 26-34] (Table 1). The high survival rate presented in these studies  $(95.8 - 100\%)$  Table 1) implies that ZIs can be used with immediate function protocols. The reasons for the good results reported may be because of careful patient selection and concern about primary stability. It can also be because that the implants can be placed in an arch form that counteracts bending forces [34]. The critical factor for immediate occlusal loading is initial implant stability. Thus, it is important to connect all implants when the immediate function protocol is chosen. Once the implants are linked together with a rigid connector, the individual implant will become part of an integrated system to distribute and share the occlusal loading [27]. The advantages for the patient are obvious since only one surgical procedure is needed and the patient will get an instant esthetic appearance as well as immediate function is possible [34]. With immediate occlusal loading, the morbidity and time of treatment can be substantially decreased and the patient's acceptance increased [27, 28]. However, these good results in survival of ZIs with the immediate protocol should be examined with caution, since most of these studies performed a follow-up of less than 3 years.


Concerning the complications with the ZI/ZI surgery, it is worthwhile to consider some observations. The reaction of the sinus mucosa to the zygoma implant penetrating the maxillary sinus cavity has been studied by Petruson [49]. He followed patient cases with an endoscopic technique. Mucosa covered the implants in some cases, whereas in other cases, the implants were partly covered. At visual inspection, the mucosa was normal with no signs of increased secretion or infection around the implants. Even after these results and considering that most of the surgical techniques to implant pass through the maxillary sinus, Aparicio et al. [44] stressed that any pathosis of the maxillary sinus should preferably be treated prior to installation of the zygomatic fixture.

Still, some problems related to ZIs were reported, including infections/sinusitis in the maxillary sinus after ZI installation [2, 3, 15-17, 28, 30, 31, 36, 48, 50-54], intraoral soft tissue problems [15, 55], removal of ZIs due to recurrent sinusitis [2], oroantral fistula formation [2, 15, 17, 19, 50, 55], periorbital hematoma, orbital injury [19, 29], temporary sensory nerve deficits [3, 15-18, 54], moderate nasal bleeding for 1-3 days [16], and inadvertent intracranial penetration of ZIs [56]. In the present review of retrospective and prospective studies on the use of ZIs, few cases of the four postoperative complications evaluated were reported (70 cases of sinusitis, 48 cases of soft tissue infection around the implants, 15 cases of paresthesia, and 17 cases of formation of oroantral fistulas). However, this number may be underestimated, since most of clinical cases studies did not mention the presence or absence of these complications. The risk of soft tissue complication at the abutment level and sinusitis should not be underestimated. Thus, with this treatment, the patient needs to be informed beforehand of the possible complications involved.

It was speculated that deficient osseointegration of the coronal part of the ZI results in the formation of an oroantral fistulae and infection. The problem may be due to lack of contact between the residual alveolar crest and the implant, thereby creating a communication between the oral and sinus cavities [16]. Because of that, caution must be taken to avoid extensive countersink preparation and to avoid fracture of the thin alveolar crest during insertion [34]. Since the ZI situation is unique with parts of the implant exposed to the maxillary sinus, controlling of the health of the maxillary sinus should be part of the maintenance program. The relatively smooth machined surface is preferred in this environment to minimize the colonization of bacteria [16]. It has been hypothesized that in a one-stage procedure with connection of the definitive abutments on the day of the surgery could lead to a better establishment of the soft tissue barrier and a decreased risk of oroantral communication [30, 53, 57].


The reason for the sinusitis observed in the studies can be attributed to several factors [2]. It can be assumed that all operated sinuses filled up with blood and are radiologically opaque for some time after surgery and a transient or persisting effect on the ciliated antral mucosa could be expected as a result of zygoma implant placement surgery [58]. Moreover, studies on sinus reactions to implants penetrating the sinus cavity, without sinus augmentation, indicate that implant protrusion into the maxillary sinus cavity can cause sinus membrane thickening around the implants with no clinical signs of sinusitis [59]. It seems that titanium implants do not act as a foreign body causing chronic sinusitis when they protrude or transverse the maxillary sinus [49, 57, 59]. The explanation could be the absence of mobility of these implants, which therefore does not cause irritation of the mucosa and/or obstruction of the meatal complex with consequent sinusitis [60]. Furthermore, only 70 cases of sinusitis were observed in 2,402 ZIs reported in the present literature review. This implies that there is no mechanical interference of the implant with the sinus clearance mechanisms [57]. However, physical blockage of the maxillary ostium with postsurgical debris left inside the sinus may also contribute to postsurgical maxillary sinus infection without involvement of the ethmoid of sphenoid sinuses [18]. One more time, however, this number may be underestimated, since most of clinical cases studies did not mention the presence or absence of these complications. Moreover, most studies did not provide long term follow-up. Sinusitis may develop several years after the placement of ZIs [51].

The reason for the sinusitis could be perforation of the sinus membrane, leakage at the level of the maxilla due to a hole in the ZI leading to migration of bacteria from the mouth to the sinus [54]: in another words, it is more likely that problems with sinusitis are more related to oroantral communications rather than to exposed implant threads per se [2]. Becktor et al. [2] had to remove three of 31 implants because of recurrent sinusitis, in spite of the implants being clinically stable. They proposed two explanations for their problems: either the internal threaded abutment screw chamber of the ZI created a communication from the oral cavity into the maxillary sinus, which may have resulted in sinusitis, or a lack of osseointegration occurred at the marginal level in the palatal area, which resulted in transversal mobility of the ZI and a pump effect during function. The lack of osseointegration, bone-to-implant contact, at the marginal level in the palatal area and the functional loading, results in transversal mobility of the long coronal part of the ZI. This could implicate a higher risk of communication between the antrum and the oral cavity and thereby introduce sinusitis [2].

The relationship between the ZI and the maxillary sinus structures remains controversial. In several studies [2, 3, 15,

16, 51, 52, 61], there is a lack of information related to preexisting sinus conditions from the clinical and radiological point of view. Therefore, it is difficult to elucidate a clear relationship between the implant and the infection of the antrum [57]. One more recent study [57] correlated the findings of preoperative and postoperative maxillary sinus CT scans in patient submitted to ZIs. A thickening of sinus mucosa around the implants without clinical consequences was found in 12 (of 26) patients. However, this was also found in the preoperative CT of eight of these patients.

Four studies [31, 33, 39, 62] proposed placing of the ZIs completely outside the displaced maxillary sinuses, in order to avoid antral problems. Although these studies reported no instances of maxillary sinusitis, studies placing ZIs passing through the maxillary sinus also reported no instances of maxillary sinusitis [19, 34, 61, 63]. Moreover, as the removal of ZI in case of serious infection is not as easy as with common implants, the ZIs placed by this exteriorized approach have the advantage of easier removal when needed. Despite its reported incidence in several clinical studies, it seems that sinusitis is not a factor to preclude osseointegration of the ZI [57], since this isolated complication (without oroantral fistula) has not been associated with loosening of the implant, in most of the studies [3, 15, 16, 51, 61].

In the cases of sinusitis, the treatment is administration of antibiotics and/or meatotomies and repositioning the soft tissue without the removal of the stable ZI [3, 31, 51]. If the infection does not resolve with one or two rounds of oral antibiotic therapy, there may be a concern that the implant is acting as a foreign body and is responsible in part for the persistence of the infection, and its removal may be indicated [18]. Failure of conservative treatment to solve these infections with antibiotics warrants consideration of functional endoscopic sinus surgery to establish a patent osteomeatal complex allowing the drainage of the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoidal sinuses [18].

In the histological specimens of an anatomical study [45], the zygomaticofacial nerve is encountered frequently. Therefore, it seems that during the clinical procedure of implant placement, a damage of this nerve is likely to occur. The same may occur with the infraorbital nerve, due to reflection of the soft tissue over it. Sensitivity disorders of the malar skin following implant placement in the zygomatic bone have been reported [15-18, 54].

Although an isolated report, a case of aspergillosis (an opportunistic fungal infection that occurs relatively rarely in patients who are not immunocompromised) of the maxillary sinus after ZI placement was described [64]. The implant and the fungus mass were later removed surgically without recurrence. The authors observed that it is possible that the sinus was infected by airborne fungus during surgery, as the sinus membrane was perforated. Quoting Barone et al. [65], they also stated that a sinus membrane perforation facilitates bacterial and fungal invasion and causes disturbance in the physiological mucociliary action that can lead to failure to clear bacteria and secretions from the sinus.


Kahnberg et al. [17] stressed that, if an additional implant in cases of two ZIs in each side is desired, the anterior zygoma implant in these cases can sometimes involve the wall of the orbit. Special attention is advocated to protect the orbit content [17]. Penetration of the orbital cavity has been described in two clinical studies [19, 29] and in one study in human cadavers [66].

Considering the angle of installation, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of accuracy of the installation angle of the implant when custom-made drill guides are used. A small angular error may result in significant positional errors at the end of the tool trajectory [50, 66]. The implant placement in the zygoma bone is difficult due to the variable anatomy and varying degrees of atrophy possible in the maxillofacial region [50]. The surgery is not without risk because the drill path is close to the critical anatomical structures such as the maxillary sinus, the nasal cavity, and the eyes [21, 50, 66]. If the implant is placed too far laterally, it will emerge in the infratemporal fossa. If it is placed too far mesially, it will end up in the nasopharynx or the sphenoid sinus. If the implant is inclined too far cranially, it will enter the pterygopalatine fossa. For an implant directed too horizontally, no bony structures will be encountered [50].

Moreover, one case of intracerebral penetration of a ZI was reported [56]. After two zygomatic and two standard implants were inserted under general anesthesia, the patient immediately developed severe persistent headaches. However, no additional treatment or radiologic assessment was performed at that time by the treating surgeon. An episode of acute left maxillary sinusitis occurred shortly after insertion of the fixed denture 3 months after the surgery, developing to a chronic sinusitis because a treatment with antibiotics proved insufficient. After a neurologist appointment, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the intracerebral penetration of the implant. This case demonstrates that postoperative computed tomography assessment should always be performed after ZI surgery. Moreover, it is important that any neurologic impairment of the patient after surgery should be investigated immediately [56].

After the process of data extraction, it was observed that there is a lack of studies with considerable number of ZIs followed up for more than 3 years. Most failures (32/49) occurred before implant loading (most part detected at the abutment connection phase). Taken together, the ISR for each interval and the CSR over a 12-year period are encouraging, but these results have to be interpreted with caution. There are insufficient data about failures that occurred beyond the third year interval, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the survival of these implants beyond the 3-year timeline. Thus, more studies with longer follow-up periods, involving adequate number of ZIs, are needed.


The use of ZIs can shorten the treatment time considerably, reduce morbidity (elimination of graft donor site morbidity), reduce the number of implants required supporting fixed bridge prosthesis, and reduce the patients' costs. However, the technique also has disadvantages. The ZI technique should be regarded as a major surgical procedure and proper training is, of course, needed. With this treatment, the patient needs to be informed beforehand of the possible complications involved. The risk of soft tissue complication at the abutment level and sinusitis should not be underestimated. Due to the palatal location of the implants in some surgical approaches, a more complex restorative design is needed. Implant failure may also require more complicated treatment compared with the nonzygomatic procedures.

# Conclusions

Most ZIs failures were detected at the abutment connection phase (6 months after the surgery of implant placement) or before. Clinical series evaluating the use of ZI applied with immediate function protocols have a high ZI success; the same thing did not occur in clinical series with patients rehabilitated with ZI after maxillary resections for tumor ablations. Despite the high survival rate observed, there is an impending need for conducting randomized controlled clinical trials to test the efficacy of these implants in comparison with the other techniques to treat the atrophic maxilla. Thus, the findings reported in the review must be interpreted with considerable caution. Moreover, more studies with longer follow-up periods, involving adequate number of ZIs, are needed. This will help to obtain a better understanding of the survival of ZIs in a long term. It is suggested that multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trials and longer clinical studies should be implemented in this area, before recommending the routine use of ZIs for patients could be given.

The placement of zygomatic implants requires very experienced surgeons, is not risk free since delicate anatomic structures such as the orbita and brain may be involved, and may not be sufficient to avoid bone augmentation procedures. The main complication which seems to occur with zygomatic implants is sinusitis which may develop several years after their placement. In case of complications, it is rather difficult to remove zygomatic implants.
