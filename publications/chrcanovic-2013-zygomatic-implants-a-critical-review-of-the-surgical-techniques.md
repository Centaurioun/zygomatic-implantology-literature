Results Five different surgical approaches were identified: (1) the classical approach, (2) the sinus slot technique, (3) the exteriorized approach, (4) the minimally invasive approach by the use of custom-made drill guides, and (5) the computer-aided surgical navigation system approach. When the maxilla is severely resorbed, the concavity formed by the ridge crest is small, and the original classical technique should be used. When maxillary resorption generates a large concavity, it would be better to exteriorize the zygomatic implant. The externalized technique has fewer surgical steps than the classical and sinus slot methods, is less invasive, and reduces surgical time. It is recommended that utilization of the sinus slot technique together with the CT-based drilling guide would enhance the final results. Although the technique that uses the computer-aided surgical navigation system approach may produce an improved precision in the clinical procedure, its use is expensive, prolongs the operation time, and is limited to centers that have the necessary equipment for the surgery.

Conclusions Preference for one technique over the other should take into consideration the concavity formed by the ridge crest, maxillary sinus, and region of implant insertion in the zygomatic bone.

# Introduction

Rehabilitation of the masticatory function with dental implants can be achieved with predictable success in various clinical situations, and acceptable long-term results have been presented in patients with sufficient bone volume. However, the problem of insufficient height and width of the alveolar ridge at the implant site remains [1]. The severely atrophied maxilla constitutes a challenging therapeutic problem because bone augmentation is required to enable placement of a sufficient number and length of implants [1]. Advanced posterior alveolar resorption combined with increased maxillary sinus pneumatization often leaves insufficient bone for implant anchorage [2, 3]. Even more challenging are conditions such as cleft deformities and maxillectomy defects, which present a discontinuous maxilla and complex bony and soft tissue anatomy [2, 4].


Various techniques have been described to treat the atrophic maxilla, including the use of angled implants in the parasinus region [5], implants in pterygoid apophysis [6], grafting of the maxillary sinus floor [7], short [8] and wide [9] implants, and zygomatic implants (ZIs). The use of ZIs after ablative tumor surgery with resection of the maxillary bone, trauma, congenital defects, unsuccessful autogenous bone grafts, gunshot wounds, and in patients who refuse autogenous bone grafting is valuable in providing new zygomatic buttresses that play a key role in the form of the midface and in oral rehabilitations [4, 10, 11].

ZIs can still be considered a relevant alternative to short implants and implants of conventional length placed following sinus floor elevation. Concerning the use of short implants, Renouard and Nisand [12] observed that in sites associated with jaw bone resorption, a prevalence of short implants and/or wide-diameter implants might be used. However, in these particular situations, failure rates may be increased due to poor bone density commonly associated with these areas. Moreover, clinical investigations have shown better survival rates for implants with greater length than shorter ones [13]. Concerning the sinus floor elevation, bone grafting usually requires two surgical sites when host bone is used, which can make the postsurgical period uncomfortable. In addition, the use of removable dentures during the healing period may be contraindicated. Finally, the treatment may demand considerable time until definitive prostheses are delivered [14].

Since the classical description of surgical placement of ZIs in 1998 by Brænemark [15], some authors have made improvements and modifications to the original technique. The purpose of the present study is to identify and describe the different surgical techniques for placement of ZI reported in the literature and discuss the differences and advantages between them.

# Materials and methods

An electronic search without date or language restrictions was undertaken in July 2011 in PubMed website (US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health). The following search terms were screened with its appearance limited to title of the article: (a) "zygomatic implant," (b) "zygomatic implants," (c) "zygoma implant," (d) "zygoma implants," (e) "zygomatic fixture," (f) "zygomatic fixtures," (g) "zygoma fixture," (h) "zygoma fixtures," and (i) "zygomaticus." Articles identifying the used surgical technique for the placement of ZIs were included. Reference lists of the included studies were also screened for potentially relevant research. Search strategy development, study selection, and data collection were done by one author (B.R. C.). Based on a review of these articles, the following focused questions were raised and will be discussed: What are the surgical techniques reported in the literature for placement of ZIs? What are the advantages and disadvantages of one technique over the others?


# Results

The searches resulted in 22 citations from (a), 56 from (b), eight from (c), ten from (d), one from (e), three from (f), two from (g), one from (h), and 27 from (i). The titles and abstracts (when available) from these results  $(n = 130)$  were read for identifying studies, which reported surgical techniques for the placement of ZIs, which resulted in 45 articles. Three studies were excluded because the patients were rehabilitated after maxillary resections for tumor ablations. Thus, no specific technique was used. One study did not report which surgical technique was used. In the remaining 41 articles, five different surgical approaches were identified: (1) the classical approach or Branemark approach [1, 3, 11, 15-37], (2) the sinus slot technique [30, 38-41], (3) the exteriorized approach [14, 42-45], (4) the minimally invasive approach by the use of custom-made drill guides [37, 46-48], and (5) the computer-aided surgical navigation system approach [49-51].

Table 1 summarizes the success rate with respect to the surgical technique for the placement of ZIs. Three observations must be made. Aparicio et al. [52] placed 47 ZIs in 25 patients, using the classical approach in seven patients and the exteriorized approach in 18 patients. However, they did not mention how many ZIs were used in each technique. Thus, the data from this study were not added. Davó et al. [30] used the sinus slot technique to place 15 ZIs and the classical approach to place another 66 ZIs. Stiévenart and Malevez [37] used the classical approach to place 72 ZIs and the minimally invasive approach by the use of custom-made drill guides to place eight ZIs.

The different surgical techniques will be briefly described and the differences between them will be discussed.

# Description of the surgical techniques

The classical approach

The classical approach was first introduced by Branemark in 1998 [15] and was also used by many other authors [1, 3,

11, 16-37] in clinical studies. The operative technique [15, 19] begins with a similar vestibular Le Fort I incision, made between the first molar regions. A palatal flap is raised to expose the alveolar crest and the hard palate. The nasal mucosa is dissected to increase visibility and to provide detailed comprehension of the local anatomy. The dissection is continued along the infrazygomatic crest towards the zygomatic bone (ZB). The infraorbital nerve is localized and the zygomatic region exposed. The periosteum of the medial part of the zygomatic body and the zygomatic arch is then raised. A window is opened in the uppermost lateral aspect of the sinus wall in the extension of the infrazygomatic crest, using a round bur. The sinus mucosa is then reflected (no special effort is made to keep it intact). The window provides direct visibility of the roof of the sinus and enables localization of the optimal point for entrance of the drill into the ZB (Fig. 1). From a prosthetic point of view, the optimal entrance is as far posterior and close to the crestal midline as possible. The entrance on the palatal side of the crest is marked, and a round bur  $(\varnothing 2.9\mathrm{mm})$  is used to penetrate the crest and mark the entrance in the roof of the sinus. The entire site in the zygoma is then prepared with a twist drill  $(\varnothing 2.9\mathrm{mm})$ . A  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  pilot drill is then used to enlarge the site. To ensure that the wider drill do not deviate from the planned direction, it is equipped with a non-cutting tip  $2.8\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter. The preparation continues with a  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  twist drill with a cutting apex. A depth indicator is inserted into the site to decide the correct length of the zygoma fixture. A  $4\mathrm{-mm}$  countersink drill may be used only when the palatal bone is thick or dense because of the risk of excessive widening of the palatal entrance. The ZI is inserted slowly until its apical portion is anchored in the alveolar crest, and it is manually inserted to adequate depth and positioned in an optimal way from the prosthetic point of view. The muscles that were released from the lower anterior aspect of the zygoma should be carefully repositioned to avoid the formation of a retrozygoma space. The submucous tissue should be reattached with individual absorbable sutures that connect to the lateral horizontal incision over the distal aspect of the maxilla, so that tissue with periosteum provides a cover over the window in the upper anterior maxillary body. The initial incision is then closed with individual mattress non-absorbable sutures. In this protocol, adequate alveolar bone must be present in the anterior maxilla to permit placement of two to four anterior maxillary implants combined with the ZIs and involves rigid splinting of the fixtures [15, 19].


# The sinus slot approach

The sinus slot approach was first introduced by Stella and Warner in 2000 [38] and have been used by other authors in clinical studies [30, 39-41]. The operative technique [38] begins with a crestal incision extending from one maxillary tuberosity to the contralateral tuberosity. A vertical releasing incision is made bilaterally at the posterior extent of the incision. Thus, a Le Fort I exposure is accomplished, and it extends around the base of the piriform rim, up to inferior aspect of the infraorbital nerves, and around the inferior one half of the body of the zygoma bilaterally. The palatal mucosa is reflected only to expose the crest of the ridge. A fissure bur is then used to make a hole through the bone and into the sinus cavity at the superior extent of the contour of the zygomatic buttress. The depth gauge is placed in the bur hole and positioned to simulate the angle of approach of the implant twist drill. A second bur hole is made on this line  $5\mathrm{mm}$  above the crest of the ridge. A slot is then made that connects the two bur holes. The superior aspect of the slot extends to the base of the zygoma, while the inferior extent of the slot approximates the floor of the maxillary sinus. This slot is made directly through the buttress wall without concern of compromise to the sinus membrane. The slot results in a smaller antrostomy that will serve to orient the twist drills for implant placement. With a round bur, a small purchase point is marked at the ideal location on the crest of the maxillary ridge, which lines up with the sinus slot. This places the implant abutment in the first molar region. The tip of the zygomatic twist drill  $(0.29\mathrm{mm})$  is placed in the purchase point, directly over the crest of the ridge, and the drill is directed such that it extents directly through the sinus slot that was previously fabricated. The tip of the drill is guided through the center of the slot under direct visualization. The drill is advanced superiorly toward the junction of the lateral orbital rim and zygomatic arch. The  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  pilot drill and  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  twist drill are then used in the same fashion, being directed through the center of the sinus slot. The depth of preparation is checked with the depth gauge, and the appropriate length implant is chosen. As the implant is being placed, it can be seen directly, cutting threads on either side of the sinus slot (Fig. 2).

# The exteriorized approach

The exteriorized approach was first introduced by Migliorana et al. in 2006 [42] and is also called of "extramaxillary implants" or "extrasinus zygomatic implants" [14, 42-45]. The operative technique [14, 42] begins with a supracrestal incision joining both tuberosities, along with two vertical releasing incisions in the zygomatic pillar region. A mucoperiosteal flap is reflected, allowing the anatomical structures to be visualized. The ZIs are placed outside the sinus (Fig. 3), contacting the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, as distal as the anatomy of the patient allows, preferably in the second premolar or first molar region. No maxillary antrostomy is necessary. The osteotomies for the ZIs begins with a spherical drill, which penetrates the residual ridge near to the top of the crest, from palatal to buccal, transfixes it, and emerges in the buccal aspect of the ridge, external to the maxillary sinus. The drilling continues toward the ZB along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus until it reaches the ZB in its lateral portion. With the same drill, the ZB is perforated until the outer cancellous layer of the bone is surpassed. The depth indicator is then used to determine the length of the ZI, which is defined as  $2\mathrm{mm}$  less than the obtained measurement. The osteotomy is progressively widened using these drills in sequence: twist drill,  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$ ; pilot drill,  $2.9/3.5\mathrm{mm}$ ; and twist drill,  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$ . The implants are placed with an initial insertion torque of  $40\mathrm{Ncm}$ , after which insertion is completed manually. The platform of ZIs emerges over or close to the top of the crest of the residual alveolar ridge.

The minimally invasive approach by the use of custom-made drill guides

In the minimally invasive approach the transfer of the preoperative plan to the patient is realized by custom-made drill guides. The technique combines preoperative computer tomography with the use of a customized drill guide produced by stereolithography [46-48]. Computed tomography data for each patient are imported to a planning software, allowing the surgical team to simulate implant placement on the 3D model. Once the implant is planned, its angulation can still be adjusted and its dimensions adapted to obtain the optimal position of the implant. The finalized treatment plan is then used to fabricate the maxilla model and a surgical drill guide with skeletal support, using stereolithography technology. The aim is to create an individualized drill guide that is suited to the patient's bone profile. A CAD/CAM program uses the shape of the bone and the 3D information of the planned drill paths to design the drill guide. The drill guide is then produced by stereolithography. The drill guide consists of a resin backbone with cylindrical openings into which stainless steel tubes can be fitted. Each cylinder's position and direction corresponds exactly to the position and direction of the planned implants. This surgical drill guide is fitted onto the maxilla and is fixated with osteosynthesis screws. Then, the drilling procedures are performed with the use of appropriate drills (Fig. 4).

The computer-aided surgical navigation system approach

Another possibility to establish the relationship of the operation-site with computer-generated additional information is the use of tracking technology, which continuously registers the position of patient and surgical tools by means of special sensors (computer-aided navigation) [53]. The use of a computer-aided surgical navigation system to specifically place ZIs was first introduced by Schramm et al. [49]. Based on spiral computed tomography data, a navigation system can be installed for the preoperative planning and intraoperative control of insertion of the implants. The preoperative planning is supported by 3D visualization of the anatomic sites and virtual positioning of the implants [49]. To compute a mathematical transformation that conveys the coordinate system of the CT scan to the patient, an LED emitter array can be attached to the skull or directly to the maxilla of the patient. All position data of surgical tools are reported relative to the position of this emitter array [50]. Constant visualization of the drill trajectory on the computer screen can be seen, while deviation from the preoperative plan position is detected and displayed in real time [50, 51]. By guiding the drill in the intended direction, the clinical procedure of the implant placement can be carried out with an improved precision [49].

# Discussion

After describing the surgical techniques for placement of ZIs, it is important to discuss the differences between the techniques. Generally, the studies in the literature describe the advantages of the more recent techniques in comparison with the classical technique. However, the great importance of the classic technique described by Brânemark in 1998 was to be the pioneering technique. Thus, it opened the door so that improvements could be made from subsequent surgical techniques.

The sinus slot technique [38] was the first one which tried to "surgically improve" the classical one. The sinus slot is a guide window made directly through the buttress wall of the maxilla, whereby the zygoma implant is guided through the maxilla to the apex insertion at the junction of the lateral orbital rim and the zygomatic arch. A slot is formed, which results in a smaller antrostomy [38]. This lateral window allows direct vision to the base of the ZB, helps control the implant position by direct vision [24], allows greater potential for bone-to-implant interface because of this lateral position, and eliminates the sinus window and sinus lining elevation for placement of the implant [39]. Less than half the amount of implant is exposed with the sinus slot method than with the classical approach, and therefore, a greater bone-to-implant interface exists with the sinus slot technique than with the classical protocol [38]. The dissection is narrower than the original Branemark protocol, and the palatal mucosa is reflected only to expose the crest of the ridge. Thus, minimizing dissection also facilitates recovery time by reducing postoperative edema and ecchymosis [38]. It is accomplished when crestal emergence of the implant is a priority, especially in patients with a well-preserved alveolar process [38]; this technique allows a more vertical zygomatic angle and thus allows the position of the implant more buccally, bringing the head of the implant into better alignment with the resultant prosthesis (the implant platform stays directly over the crest of the ridge in the first molar region). The technique was later criticized by Boyes-Varley et al. [11], who stated that the sinus slot does not provide adequate visualization of the base of ZB and argued that visualization of the entrance of the implant into the ZB is important to avoid complications.


The exteriorized technique [42] was the next technique that tried to surgically improve the classical one. One advantage of the exteriorized technique is that the perforation of the maxillary sinus membrane is performed at a higher and more posterior point in the maxillary sinus, when compared to the classical technique. Moreover, this approach eliminates the need for maxillary antrostomy or the creation of a slot, improves surgical visualization, and results in the emergence of the ZI next to or on the top of the alveolar ridge crest, improving prosthesis design and biomechanics [14]. ZI placement with an intrasinus path may be impossible in patients with pronounced buccal concavities at the lateral aspect of the maxillary sinus [54]. In these cases, the exteriorized technique is a good choice. The implants are placed externally to the maxilla and anchored only in the ZB, making this technique an option for all types of maxillae with bone atrophy. With this approach, most of the implant length will be outside the maxilla but covered with soft tissue [43]. The exteriorized technique has fewer surgical steps than the classical and sinus slot methods, is less invasive, reduces surgical time, and provides a shorter cantilever as the implant position where the implant emerges is located on the crestal ridge in the first molar region [55].

According to the authors of four clinical studies [14, 43-45], in which the exteriorized technique for placing ZI was exclusively used, this approach does not cause sinusitis, since the implant (or most part of it) is placed outside the maxillary sinus. Although these studies reported no instances of maxillary sinusitis (290 ZIs in 140 patients), studies placing ZIs passing through the maxillary sinus also reported no instances of maxillary sinusitis (165 ZIs in 68 patients) [36, 40, 41, 52].

Corvello et al. [55] aimed to compare the classical technique and the exteriorized technique in relation to the length of the drilling holes in the ZB for placement of ZIs, the most frequently used ZI length, and the most frequent position where the implants emerged in the ZB. The length of the drilling holes in the ZB varied as a function of surgical technique. The mean value of the exteriorized technique was significantly higher than that of the original classical technique. In relation to implant length, no significant difference was found between the two techniques. For both techniques, the most commonly used implant lengths were

30 and  $35\mathrm{mm}$ . Another study showed that the most frequent implant lengths were 40 and  $47.5\mathrm{mm}$  [32]. Differences in the position where the implants emerge (second premolar and first molar) and ethnic characteristics may explain part of these discrepancies. In the exteriorized technique, the lateralized placement of the ZI with the position where the implants emerging in the first molar region provides more penetration of the implant in the ZB, which may provide higher initial mechanical stability for ZIs than the classical technique [55]. Moreover, in an already resorbed maxilla, a sinus window used in the classical approach could further compromise the precarious bone support of the remaining dental alveolus [38]. Furthermore, the final position of the ZI with a palatal placement can affect the configuration of the prosthesis [38].

However, according to one study that applied three techniques (classical, sinus slot, and exteriorized), no differences were found with regards to success rates of implants [30]. Moreover, most implants would have bone contact to only one third of the total ZI length, independently of the surgical technique [55]. This ratio does not seem to represent a clinical problem with sufficient implant fixation in zygomatic and maxillary cortical layers [56], even when ZIs are placed with a large angulation.

The use of custom-made drill guides makes flapless surgery possible at the crestal/peri-crestal entry point level. However, it is advisable to have the exit point prepared under direct vision to prevent the long ZI from coming too close or even perforating to the orbit [24]. Two studies [46, 47] showed good precision with the technique for ZIs (custom-made drill guides). However, one more recent study [48] demonstrated that the use of the ZI, in the context of the technique that uses customized drill guide produced by stereolithography, should probably be reevaluated because some large deviations were noted. Thus, it is recommended that utilization of the sinus slot technique together with the CT-based drilling guide would enhance the final results.

In contrast to the approach with drilling templates, a computer-aided surgical navigation approach offers constant intraoperative visualization of the tip of the drilling bur. This enables the surgeon to precisely guide the drill to control the implant axis and ensure optimum bone use, as well as feedback regarding the accuracy of the template or the position relative to the anatomic structures [57]. Schramm et al. [49] were the first to use a navigation system for preoperative planning and intraoperative control of the insertion of ZIs, reporting the use in three patients. One year later, Watzinger et al. [50] assessed the precision of a computer-aided surgical navigation system dedicated to the placement of endosteal implants in the maxillofacial area. The study was conducted in five cadaver specimens, which underwent hemimaxillectomy. The accuracy of the implant position compared with the planned position was  $1.3 \pm$

$0.8\mathrm{mm}$  for the external perforation of the zygoma and  $1.7\pm 1.3\mathrm{mm}$  for the internal perforation. This result is better than the accuracy reportedly achieved using drilling templates [46-48].

In another study [51], an image-guided oral implantology system that encompasses the 3D medical modeling, preoperative surgical planning, registration, and intraoperative tracking were presented. According to the authors, with the aid of this system, the precision achieved in the planning phase can be transferred to the operating theatre so that the feasibility and reliability of oral implant surgery can be achieved in anatomically complex operation sites. Although very accurate, only one clinical case was showed in their article. Prospective studies with more clinical cases are needed in order to demonstrate its feasibility and reliability. Moreover, on-site navigation is expensive and prolongs the operation time, though theoretically it supports exact placement of the implant and optimal bone use [58].

All surgical techniques showed a high success rate, between  $92.0\%$  and  $99.0\%$  (Table 1). To date, there is only one clinical series reported in the literature with the computer-aided surgical navigation system approach, but with only three patients and five ZIs [49], and no follow-up data were provided. The lowest success rate found with the minimally invasive approach by the use of custom-made drill guides  $(92.0\%)$  was influenced by the three ZIs lost in the same patient in the study of Stievenart and Malevez [37].

# Conclusions

Preference for one technique over the other should take into consideration the concavity formed by the ridge crest, maxillary sinus, and region of implant insertion in the ZB. When the maxilla is severely resorbed, this concavity is small, and the original classical technique should be used. When maxillary resorption generates a large concavity, it would be better to exteriorize the ZI. The externalized technique could be considered one of the best surgical approaches, as has fewer surgical steps than the classical and sinus slot methods, is less invasive, and reduces surgical time. Concerning the technique that uses customized drill guide produced by stereolithography, one study demonstrated that the use of the ZI, in the context of this protocol, should probably be reevaluated because some large deviations were noted. Thus, it is recommended that utilization of the sinus slot technique together with the CT-based drilling guide would enhance the final results. Although the technique that uses the computer-aided surgical navigation system approach may produce an improved precision in the clinical procedure, its use is expensive, prolongs the operation time, and is limited to centers that have the necessary equipment for the surgery.
