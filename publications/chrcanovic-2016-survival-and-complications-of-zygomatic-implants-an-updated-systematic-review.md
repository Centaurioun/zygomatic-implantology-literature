# Survival and Complications of Zygomatic Implants: An Updated Systematic Review

Bruno Ramos Chrcanovic, DDS, MSc,\* Tomas Albrektsson, MD, PhD, and Ann Wennerberg, DDS, PhD

Purpose: To assess the survival rate of zygomatic implants (ZIs) and the prevalence of complications based on previously published studies.

Materials and Methods: An electronic search of 3 databases was performed in December 2015 and was supplemented by manual searching. Clinical series of ZIs were included. Interval survival rate and cumulative survival rate (CSR) were calculated. The untransformed proportion of complications (sinusitis, soft tissue infection, paresthesia, oroantral fistulas) was calculated by considering the prevalence reported in the studies.

Results: Sixty-eight studies were included, comprising 4,556 ZIs in 2,161 patients with 103 failures. The 12-year CSR was  $95.21\%$ . Most failures were detected within the 6-month postsurgical period. Studies  $(n = 26)$  that exclusively evaluated immediate loading showed a statistically lower ZI failure rate than studies  $(n = 34)$  evaluating delayed loading protocols  $(P = .003)$ . Studies  $(n = 5)$  evaluating ZIs for the rehabilitation of patients after maxillary resections presented lower survival rates. The probability of presenting postoperative complications with ZIs was as follows: sinusitis,  $2.4\%$  (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-3.0); soft tissue infection,  $2.0\%$  (95% CI, 1.2-2.8); paresthesia,  $1.0\%$  (95% CI, 0.5-1.4); and oroantral fistulas,  $0.4\%$  (95% CI, 0.1-0.6). However, these numbers might be underestimated, because many studies failed to mention the prevalence of these complications.

Conclusion: ZIs present a high 12-year CSR, with most failures occurring at the early stages postoperatively. The main observed complication related to ZIs was sinusitis, which can appear several years after ZI installation surgery.

The combination of increased maxillary sinus pneumatization with advanced posterior alveolar resorption often results in insufficient bone for implant anchorage, $^{1}$  constituting a therapeutic challenge. Bone augmentation is usually required in these conditions to enable the placement of sufficient numbers and lengths of implants. $^{2}$  Maxillectomy defects, maxillary sinus aplasia, and cleft deformities are even more challenging conditions. $^{3,4}$

The installation of zygomatic implants (ZIs) is one of the various techniques described in the literature to treat the atrophic maxilla, and several prospective studies have reported successful outcomes. A previous review on the survival of ZIs observed that most failures were detected 6 months after surgery, with a high 12-year cumulative survival rate (CSR). The use of ZIs has several advantages, such as a considerable shortening of treatment time, decreased morbidity because the technique eliminates the necessity of a graft (and thus a graft donor site), a smaller number of implants necessary to support fixed prostheses, and a decrease of the patients' costs. ZIs have enabled the surgeon to overcome the local osseous deficiency by engaging hard tissue at the distant zygomatic bone, allowing increased retention and stability of an obturator or prosthesis.[13] However, the technique does have some disadvantages. First, the installation of ZIs is a major surgical procedure and should be performed only by properly trained clinicians. There is considerable risk of soft tissue complications around the abutments and of sinusitis. A more complex prosthetic design might be necessary when ZIs need to be placed in a more palatal location. Second, an eventual failure of a ZI might require a more complex and invasive treatment compared with failures of conventional implants.


The aim of the present systematic review was to report an updated survival rate of ZIs and the prevalence of complications based on previously published clinical studies. The present review is an update of a previously published article.[12]

# Materials and Methods

The present study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. $^{14}$

# OBJECTIVE

The purpose of the present systematic review was to assess the survival rate of ZIs and the prevalence of complications based on previously published clinical studies. The focus question was elaborated using the PICO format (participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes): what are the clinical outcomes (survival rate and complications) of partially and totally edentulous patients undergoing prosthetic rehabilitation supported by at least 1 ZI?

# SEARCH STRATEGIES

An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in December 2015 in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register. The following terms were used in the search strategies, refined by selecting the term: subject (zygomatic OR zygoma OR zygomaticus) AND adjective (implant OR implants OR fixture OR fixtures).

An additional manual search of related journals was conducted. The reference list of the identified studies and the relevant reviews on the subject were scanned for possible additional studies.

# INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA

The inclusion criteria consisted of clinical human studies reporting clinical series of patients receiving ZIs. The patients could have had an atrophic maxilla bone, partial or total edentulism, or surgery for cancer ablation or radiotherapy. Randomized and controlled clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case-and-control studies, and case series were considered. For this review, implant failure represents complete loss of the implant. Exclusion criteria were case reports, technical reports, biomechanical studies, finite element analysis studies, animal studies, in vitro studies, and reviews.

# STUDY SELECTION

The titles and abstracts of all reports identified through the electronic searches were read independently by the authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among the authors.

# DATA EXTRACTION

Data were extracted from each of the identified eligible studies, including year of publication, number of patients, patients' age range and average age, number of ZIs and additional conventional implants placed and failed, follow-up time, and the following 4 postoperative complications: sinusitis, soft tissue infection around the ZIs, paresthesia, and oroantral fistula formation.

# ANALYSES

Implant survival was reported for each publication. The interval survival rate (ISR) of ZIs was calculated using the information for the period of failure extracted from the included studies, and the CSR was calculated over the maximal period of follow-up reported. Moreover, the untransformed proportion of complications (sinusitis, soft tissue infection, paresthesia of infraorbital or zygomaticofacial nerves, oroantral fistulas) was calculated by considering the prevalence reported in the studies. Data were analyzed using the software OpenMeta[Analyst].<sup>15</sup>

# Results

# LITERATURE SEARCH

The study selection process is presented in Figure 1. The search strategy resulted in 1,414 articles and 712 articles were cited in more than 1 search of terms (duplicates). The 3 authors independently screened the abstracts for those articles related to the focus question. Of the resulting 702 studies, 504 were excluded

for not being related to the topic, resulting in 198 entries. Additional manual searching of the reference lists of selected studies yielded 1 additional study. The full-text reports of the remaining 199 articles led to the exclusion of 131 because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (57 were case reports, 22 were reviews, 15 were finite element analysis studies, 12 described surgical techniques, 7 were anatomic studies, 6 concerned dry cadaver skulls, 4 were follow-ups of the same study, 2 did not evaluate failures, 2 were computed tomographic studies, 1 was a phantom experiment, 1 was an orthodontic study, 1 study had been published in another journal, and 1 used ZIs for nasal prosthesis). Thus, 68 publications were included in the review.

# DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES AND ANALYSIS

One randomized clinical trial, 16 prospective studies, and 51 retrospective analyses were included. The only randomized clinical trial was randomized for the performance of inferior mental antrostomy. One was study was a multicenter approach performed in several countries, $^{7}$  whereas the other 67 studies were performed in 15 countries: 13 in Spain; 9 in the United States; 8 in Sweden; 6 in Brazil; 5 each in China, Germany, and Italy; 4 in Portugal; 3 in Belgium; 2 each in Colombia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom; and 1 each in Japan, Norway, and Switzerland. Detailed data of the 68 included studies are listed in Table 1.


The publications included 2,161 patients and 4,556 ZIs, with a total of 103 ZI failures. According to the untransformed proportion, the probability of an event (ZI failure) was  $1.3\%$  (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.6; standard error, 0.2;  $P < .001$ ; heterogeneity,  $\tau^2 = 0.000$ ,  $\chi^2 = 69.183$ , df = 67, I² = 3.155%,  $P = .404$ ). Fifty-three studies provided information on the total number of placed and failed additional conventional implants in the maxilla, with a failure rate of  $3.29\%$  (182 of 5,535). Because not all studies reported the number of additional (standard) implants used, these figures might be underestimated. Fourteen studies were not included in the lifetable analysis of ZIs because there was no information on when the ZIs failed in relation to the implant installation surgery, there was no information about the total number of ZIs followed to the failure time

Pooled data from the 54 articles reporting the time point when ZI failures occurred showed a total of 65 failures over different periods, with most failures  $(n = 40)$  occurring within 6 months after installation surgery or at the abutment connection (6-month ISR,  $98.64\%$ ; 12-yr CSR,  $95.21\%$ ; Table 2).

Of 68 studies, 26 exclusively assessed ZIs that were loaded immediately, showing a high survival rate (1,074 patients; 2,219 ZIs; 37 failures;  $1.67\%$ ). Of the other 42 publications, 34 exclusively assessed ZIs with delayed function protocols, with 1,592 ZIs in 781 patients (50 failures;  $3.14\%$ ). The difference of the ZI survival rates between the immediate and delayed protocols were shown to be statistically significant ( $P = .003$  by Pearson  $\chi^2$  test). Eight studies applied the so-called extramaxillary ZI, placing the implant completely outside the maxillary sinuses, comprising a total of 1,241 ZIs in 592 patients (13 failures,  $1.05\%$ ).[11,19,21,23,25,54,65,72] ZIs were used for the rehabilitation of patients with resected maxillas in 5 studies,[13,36,52,64,73] with a ZI survival rate ranging from 78.6 to  $94.1\%$ .


Altogether, the studies reported 127 cases of sinusitis (total, 3,707 ZIs), 67 events of gingival infection around the implants (total, 2,190 ZIs), 28 events of paresthesia, and 25 episodes of formation of oroantral fistulas (Table 3). According to the untransformed proportions, the probability of a maxillary sinus presenting sinusitis after ZI placement was  $2.4\%$  (95% CI, 1.8-3.0; standard error, 0.3;  $P < .001$ ; heterogeneity,  $\tau^2 = 0.000$ ,  $\chi^2 = 72.533$ , df = 52,  $\mathrm{I}^2 = 28.309\%$ ,  $P = .031$ ), the probability of a ZI presenting a soft tissue infection around it was  $2.0\%$  (95% CI, 1.2-2.8; standard error, 0.4;  $P < .001$ ; heterogeneity,  $\tau^2 = 0.000$ ,  $\chi^2 = 83.511$ , df = 41,  $\mathrm{I}^2 = 50.905\%$ ,  $P < .001$ ), the occurrence of paresthesia of infraorbital or zygomaticofacialis nerves after a ZI surgery was

1.0% (95% CI, 0.5-1.4; standard error, 0.2;  $P < .001$ ; heterogeneity,  $\tau^2 = 0.000$ ,  $\chi^2 = 20.354$ , df = 23,  $\mathrm{I}^2 = 0\%$ ,  $P = .620$ ), and the formation of oroantral fistulas after a ZI surgery was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1-0.6; standard error, 0.1;  $P = .002$ ; heterogeneity,  $\tau^2 = 0.000$ ,  $\chi^2 = 29.081$ , df = 36,  $\mathrm{I}^2 = 0\%$ ,  $P = .787$ ).

# Discussion

The 68 studies included in the present review described 4,556 ZIs in 2,161 patients, with only 103 failures (12-yr CSR,  $95.21\%$ ). These numbers suggest that the technique has high predictability with good clinical results.

Twenty-six studies assessed ZIs by immediate loading. $^{8-11,18-21,23-25,27,39,44,45,47,48,50,56,59,61,62,65,69,71,72}$

The high survival rate presented in such conditions suggests that ZIs can successfully be loaded immediately. However, these good results must be interpreted with caution, because few studies followed the patients for more than 5 years. Concern about primary stability and careful patient selection are the possible reasons for these high survival rates. When a ZI is involved in an oral rehabilitation, there usually is a prosthetic connection of all maxillary implants with a rigid connector, which will result in a better distribution and sharing of the occlusal loading.[18] It has been suggested that placing the implants in an arch form could counteract bending forces.[20]

There was a statistically relevant lower survival rate of ZIs with delayed loading protocols than when the ZIs were loaded immediately after considering all ZIs from the studies that exclusively evaluated distinct function protocols. This could be related to a generally longer follow-up period observed in studies performing delayed loading protocols, because a longer follow-up can lead to an increase in the failure rate. Moreover, the immediate loading protocol was adopted only after 7 to 8 years of publications of clinical trials applying ZIs with delayed loading protocols. Surgeons involved in more recent studies (mostly using immediate protocols) might have taken advantage

* Fourteen studies were not included because the time point when these failures occurred was not reported, the authors could not extract the total number of implants that were followed to the time of failure,[28,35,54,55,57,60,63,64,66,67,69,71,73] or the lifetable survival of implants was reported at the patient level, not at the implant level.[72]

of the enhancements and improvements of the surgical technique over the years, which could have increased the survival rates. Furthermore, most studies applying ZIs in maxillary defects after resection surgery used delayed loading.

Recurrent infection, overgrowth of soft tissue surrounding the implant impairing the abutment connection, overloading leverage in extensive maxillectomies, and tumor recurrence are factors that can contribute to a lower survival rate of ZIs used in patients with resected maxillas.36 The use of ZIs in large maxillary defects after tumor resection can be considered a drawback owing to the biomechanical disadvantages of a long lever arm, the  $30^{\circ}$  to  $60^{\circ}$  angle relative to occlusal forces, and the small volume of available bone for anchorage and osseointegration.13 The soft tissue around the implant head and abutment can create deep periimplant pockets, predisposing the site to infections.36,52 Radiotherapy also can affect the success of ZIs and impair bone reparative capacity.75,76 The survival rate of standard implants is negatively affected by irradiation of the maxillofacial region.77 All these factors might have influenced the survival rates of ZIs placed in patients after the ablation of neoplasias.13,36,52,64,73 Schmidt et al13 reported a survival rate of  $78.6\%$  Landes36 reported  $89.3\%$  Landes et al52 reported  $91.7\%$

Huang et al[64] reported  $88.9\%$ , and Pellegrino et al[73] reported  $94.1\%$ . In contrast, higher survival rates have been reported with ZIs placed in patients with no resected maxillas. One reason seems to be that in such cases there is engagement of more cortical bone—the palatina alveolar crest and sinus floor cortical portions also are used—compared with fewer cortical portions (1 or 2) when conventional implants are installed.[78] The anchorage of an implant in more portions of the cortical bone provides a great deal of stability and has been considered an important factor influencing the survival of implants.[79]

The literature reported several complications related to ZI surgery, including sinusitis and infections in the maxillary sinus, $^{1,2,68,10,16,17,19,26,27,34,35,40,41,44,46,47,49,51-53,60,61,63,65-67,69,70,72}$  intraoral soft tissue infection, $^{2,7,10,11,17,26,27,34,36,40,47,49,52,53,58,61,66,67}$  removal of ZIs because of recurrent sinusitis $^{2}$  or continued pain, $^{59}$  formation of an oroantral fistula, $^{2,7,10,17,26,27,33,47,58,61,63,65,72}$  facial or periorbital hematoma, $^{26,61,69,74}$  gingival hyperplasia, $^{74}$  orbital cavity penetration, $^{27,45,59}$  temporary sensory nerve deficits, $^{6-8,16,26,43,53,61,63,69,70}$  moderate nasal bleeding for 1 to 3 days, $^{6}$  and subcutaneous malar emphysema. $^{16,63}$  Not many events of complications were reported. However, the prevalence of these complications is probably underestimated, because

several publications did not report the presence or absence of these conditions.

The problem of oroantral fistula is believed to be caused by the weak sealing between the thin and compromised alveolar bone and the implant head, which can result in a communication between the maxillary sinus and the oral cavity. Extensive counter-sinking preparations and fracturing of the thin alveolar crest during implant installation must be avoided. It has been hypothesized that a hole for the abutment screw in the machined Branemark ZI also could lead to oroantral communication. Some have suggested that connecting the definitive abutments together with the implants in a 1-stage procedure could decrease the risk of oroantral communication by establishing a better soft tissue barrier.

Concerning sinusitis, virtually all operated maxillary sinuses will fill up with blood and become radiopaque for some time after surgery,[81] and the protrusion of implants into the maxillary sinus can cause thickening of the sinus membrane around the implants but without clinical signs of sinusitis,[82] a fact that was observed by several studies.[80,82,83] This could be explained by the absence of mobility of these implants, thus not causing irritation of the sinus mucosa or obstruction of the meatal complex.[84] However, 3 clinically stable ZIs had to be removed in the study by Becktor et al[2] because of recurrent sinusitis. Events of sinusitis after ZI surgery still do occur, and they can be attributed to several factors,[2] such as the presence of postsurgical debris inside the sinus causing blockage of the maxillary ostium,[8] perforation of the sinus membrane bringing bacteria from the mouth,[53] and a lack of osseointegration at the marginal level in the palatal area resulting in transversal mobility of the ZI and a pump effect during function.[2] Thus, sinusitis might be related more to oroantral communications than to exposed implant threads.[2]

The prevalence of sinusitis might be underestimated owing to lack of information provided and short-term follow-up studies. Sinusitis can be established years after ZI surgery.[34] Another important point is the fact that there is no consensus on how to report a diagnosis of sinusitis in the dental literature.[61] In most studies using ZIs, the term used to describe the sinus pathology was sinusitis, without clarifying the type, associated signs and symptoms, or whether computed tomography or endoscopy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. For these reasons, it was not possible to determine sufficient useful details of the sinusitis described.[61] Furthermore, there are difficulties in establishing any clear relation between the sinus infection and the implant,[80] because several studies[1,2,6,9,25,26,34,41,46,61-63,67-69,74] did not report the pre-existing clinical and radiologic conditions of the sinus. Although there seems to be a higher risk of maxillary sinus infections when rehabilitating patients with a previous diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis,[72] there is still no scientific evidence supporting a cause-and-effect relation between ZIs and the development of maxillary sinusitis. One study analyzed computed tomograms of the maxillary antrum before and after the placement of ZIs and found that  $46\%$  of patients (12 of 26) showed a thickening of the sinus mucosa around the implants, but there was no clinical consequence.[80] However, thickening of the mucosa was already present before the installation of ZIs in 8 of these 12 patients. Because isolated sinusitis without the occurrence of an oroantral fistula has not been associated with loosening of the implant in several studies,[1,6,10,16,27,34,40,44,46,49,51,53,60,63,65-67,69,70,72] sinusitis might not be an important factor to impair the osseointegration of ZIs.[80]


Eight studies preferred extramaxillary placed ZIs, $^{11,19,21,23,25,54,65,72}$  a surgical technique first proposed by Miglioranca et al $^{85}$  in 2006, which aimed to decrease the prevalence of problems in the maxillary sinus. Although there were no episodes of sinusitis in 7 of these studies (Maló et al $^{65}$  reported 5 cases, all with previously diagnosed sinusitis before surgery, and in all a maxillary sinus membrane rupture occurred during the surgical procedure), there were no cases of sinusitis in several studies on intrasinus ZIs. $^{9,20,24,37,46,55,58,62,68,74}$

Sensitivity disorders after ZI installation surgery were reported in several studies.68,16,26,43,53,61,63,69,70 Because a reflection of the soft tissues in the malar region is expected, damage of the zygomaticofacial and infraorbital nerves is likely to occur during the clinical procedure of implant placement.78

Atypical complications of ZI surgery reported in isolated reports include an infection by aspergillosis,[86] orbital cavity penetration,[27,45,59] and intracerebral penetration.[87] Concerning the aspergillosis infection, the sinus membrane was perforated, leading the investigators to consider that the sinus was possibly infected by airborne fungus during surgery.[86] With regard to accidental cavity penetrations, a small drilling angular error can result in important positional errors at the end of the tool trajectory, especially when custom-made drill guides are used.[17,88] In the particular case of orbital penetration, if a second ZI is planned to be placed on the same zygoma, there is a risk that the anterior ZI could involve the orbital wall.[7]

# LIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT STUDY

The results of the present study have to be interpreted with caution because of its limitations. First, all confounding factors might have affected the outcomes. When very long implants are inserted in the zygomatic buttress, the impact of these variables on the implant survival rate is difficult to estimate if these confounding factors are not identified separately to perform a meta-regression analysis. The real fact is that individual patients sometimes present with more than 1 risk factor, and groups of patients are typically heterogeneous with respect to risk factors and susceptibilities, so the specific effect of an individual risk factor might not be isolated for the individual studies or for the present review.[89] Second, most included studies had a retrospective design, manifesting problems such as gaps in information and incomplete records. Third, some included studies are characterized by a low level of specificity, where the assessment of ZIs was seldom the main focus of the investigation. In addition, much of the research in the field is limited by small cohorts and short follow-up periods. Taken together, the ISRs and the 12-year CSR are encouraging, but there are not many studies including a reasonable number of ZIs in which the patients were followed for at least 5 years. A longer follow-up period could lead to an increase in the failure rate, especially if it extends beyond functional loading, because other prosthetic factors can influence implant failure from that point onward. This might have led to an underestimation of actual failures in some studies. More studies including a larger number of ZIs followed for longer periods are needed to draw more definitive conclusions on these matters.


Most ZI failures occurred within the 6-month postsurgical period or at the abutment connection. The 12-year CSR was  $95.21\%$ . ZIs placed according to an immediate loading protocol presented a statistically important higher survival rate than ZIs placed according to delayed loading protocols. Studies applying ZIs in patients with resected maxillas showed the lowest survival rates among all clinical series. The main complication that seems to occur with ZIs is sinusitis, which can develop several years after their placement.
