# Abstract

Background: Placement of extrasinus zygomatic implants to support implant-supported rehabilitation is still controversial due to the scarcity of data.

Purpose: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of 94 extrasinus zygomatic implants, installed laterally to the maxillary sinus, for rehabilitation of the edentulous atrophic maxillae.

Materials and methods: A total of 42 patients (mean age 58 years) with severely atrophic maxillae were treated between November 2010 and July 2011, and followed up until July 2014. A total of 273 implants (94 zygomatic implants and 179 conventional implants) were used. The patients were followed in a standardized clinical and radiographic method.

Results: During the 3-year study period, 1 zygomatic implant and 4 conventional implants failed, resulting in a survival rate of  $98.9\%$  and  $97.7\%$  respectively. All restorations with titanium-welded bars were installed either 3 days after surgery (immediate loading) or 6 months after surgery (delayed loading), and were successful until the last follow-up appointment, except for minor technical problems. No patient presented any type of sinus adverse event. No other significant occurrences were reported.

Conclusion: This 3-year clinical follow-up study indicates that extrasinus zygomatic implants represent predictable treatment option atrophic maxillae. Further longitudinal prospective clinical studies are necessary to confirm these results.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Full-arch implant-supported rehabilitations are one of the most well reported implant treatments, with high long-term success rates. $^{1,2}$  However, tooth loss leads to continue, cumulative, and irreversible bone loss mainly in the maxilla. $^{3-5}$  The resorbed residual ridge and the presence of the maxillary sinus in the maxilla make dental implant placement for implant-supported rehabilitation a challenge.

Several bone grafting techniques, such as sinus lifting and autogenous onlay bone grafts, have been described as methods to restore the architecture of the atrophic maxillae, allowing implant placement in resorbed sites.[6,7] Complementary, autogenous bone grafting procedures for full-arch reconstructions often require an extraoral donor site, such as the iliac crest or the outer table of the calvarial bone, which increases the morbidity of the reconstructive procedure, demanding considerable time until final fixed prostheses can be delivered.


An alternative to major reconstructive procedures for atrophic maxillary ridges is the zygomatic implant. High success rates have been reported for these implants in full-arch fixed rehabilitations. $^{8}$  The original surgical technique oriented the installation of the zygomatic implants inside the maxillary sinus, so that they could be apically anchored in the zygomatic bone. $^{9}$  Although this technique showed high implant survival rates, it presents some backsets, such as poor surgical visualization, long surgical time due to the necessity of lifting of the sinus membrane, risk for sinus adverse events, poor and/or inadequate emergency profile of the prosthetic abutment due to the palatal positioning of the platform of the zygomatic implants, and reduced anchorage in the zygomatic bone.


Stella and Warner $^{10}$  have described a simplified technique for installation of zygomatic implants in which the antrostomy and lifting of the sinus membrane were not necessary. This technique uses a lateral slot outside of wall of the maxillary sinus, avoiding or minimizing the contact of the implant with the sinuses membrane. This technique reduced considerably the surgical time and improved the emergence prosthetic profile, moving the emergence of the platform of the zygomatic implant nearer to her crest of the residual ridge, in an optimal 3-dimensional position for the implant-supported restoration.

In addition, the extrasinus technique for installation of zygomatic implants have been reported, with high success rates.[11] The extrasinus technique is meant to simplify the surgical procedures, and to improve prosthetic outcomes. According to this technique, the zygomatic implant is installed outside the maxillary sinus, reducing surgical time and the risk of sinus adverse events, and improving surgical visualization. The prosthetic profile of the restoration is considerably improved, as the emergence of the platform of the zygomatic implant is positioned on the crest of the residual ridge.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a 3-year clinical follow-up to evaluate the success rates of extrasinus zygomatic implants used to retain full-arch screw-retained prostheses in the rehabilitation of atrophic maxillae.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

# 2.1 | Presurgical evaluation

All patients included in this study presented completely or partially edentulous maxillae, with remaining teeth indicated for extraction. The indications for extractions in the partially edentulous subjects included longitudinal fractures, advanced periodontal disease, and endodontic failure.

The inclusion criteria were: need for rehabilitation of the maxilla with a complete fixed implant-supported prosthesis; the patient's ability and willingness to follow the study protocol; a good state of general health and oral hygiene. Maxillary bone volume was assessed by means of radiographic and tomographic measurements. The atrophy of the maxillary bone for inclusion in this study should be Division C or D, $^{12}$  or higher. The posterior maxillary bone height immediately distal to the canine pillar should range from 1 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$  maximum, not enough to allow the placement of conventional implants, even tilted distal implants. In these situations, zygomatic implants were used to support the posterior regions of the rehabilitation. The anterior are of the maxilla must present at least bone  $8\mathrm{mm}$  height to allow the placement of anterior implants with a minimum length of  $8\mathrm{mm}$ . When the height was inferior to  $8\mathrm{mm}$ , zygomatic implants were also used to support the anterior portion of the rehabilitation (Figure 1). The exclusion criteria were: general and local health conditions that prevented the use of general anesthesia and/or intraoral surgery; general conditions that could lead to osseointegration problems, such as patients in use of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or oncologic treatment; parafunctional habits, such as bruxism; poor oral hygiene. Smoking was not utilized as an exclusion criterion.


No bone grafting procedures were performed. All possible treatment options were offered to the patients. Patients enrolled in the study chose and authorized the procedure by signing a consent form according to the Helsinki Declaration (1975, revised in 2000). Guarulhos University Clinical Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. Diagnosis and treatment planning included: study models articulated in a semi-adjustable articulator; clinical photographs, panoramic radiographs, and computerized tomography to identify the anatomical structures and visualize the presence of pathologies.

# 2.2 | Surgical protocol

Patients were medicated with  $2\mathrm{g}$  of cephalexin intravenously before the surgical procedure. For patients who were allergic to cephalosporin,  $500\mathrm{mg}$  ciprofloxacin was administered intravenously. Immediately before surgery, patients rinsed with  $2\%$  chlorhexidine. General anesthesia was used for all surgical procedures, and pulse, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry were monitored by physician. A local anesthetic of  $2\%$  mepivacaine with 1:100 000 epinephine was infiltrated supracrestally, to reduce bleeding and perform additional local pain control. A supra-crestal incision up to the first molar region and 2 vertical releasing incisions in the zygomatic pillar region were made. A mucoperiosteal flap was deflected, allowing visualization of the anatomical structures related with the surgical procedure. The osteotomy for the installation of the conventional implants was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The insertion torque was adjusted with drilling equipment at an initial insertion torque of 45 Ncm. Follow, the implants were manually inserted with a torque wrench, until it was completely seated.

The zygomatic implants were placed extrasinuously, contacting the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, preferably in the second premolar or first molar region (Figures 1 to 5). No maxillary antrostomy was necessary. The osteotomies for zygomatic implants started with a spherical drill penetrating the residual ridge near to the top of the crest, from palatal to buccal, transfixing it, and emerging in the buccal aspect of the ridge, externally to the maxillary sinus. The drill was moved toward the zygomatic bone, along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, until it reached the zygomatic bone, in its lateral portion. With the same drill, the zygomatic bone was perforated until the outer cancellous layer of the bone was surpassed, at upper portion. The depth indicator was then used to determine the length of the zygomatic implant, which was defined as  $2\mathrm{mm}$  less than the obtained measurement. The osteotomy was progressively widened using these drills in sequence: twist drill  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$ , pilot drill  $2.9/3.5\mathrm{mm}$ , twist drill  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$ . The platforms of the zygomatic implants emerged over or close to the top of the crest of the residual alveolar ridge. Straight multiunit abutments were tightened to the implants with a  $32\mathrm{Ncm}$  torque.

The surgical wounds were sutured with 4-0 silk after the abutment placed. If one or more implants (conventional or zygomatic) did
FIGURE 1 A and B, Initial radiographic evaluation of the totally edentulous maxilla not reach an installation torque of 45 Ncm, cover screws were installed over the implants, and primary wound closure was performed.


The patients were asked to rinse with  $2\%$  chlorhexidine, 3 times daily after surgery. Amoxicillin  $875\mathrm{mg}$  was prescribed 2 times a day for 7 days. For penicillin-allergic subjects,  $500\mathrm{mg}$  ciprofloxacin twice a day for 7 days was prescribed. Ibuprofen  $600\mathrm{mg}$  was also prescribed twice a day for 5 days.

# 2.3 | Implant-supported restoration

All implant-supported restorations were fabricated post-surgically. The implant-supported screw-retained prostheses were delivered in 2 different ways, varying according to the loading time, determined by the primary stability obtained during implant installation: immediate or late. $^{13}$


Impressions of the implants and residual ridge were taken right after surgery with open-tray transfers, splinted with a low-shrinkage modeling resin. Impressions were taken with plastic trays perforated in the sites of the transfers. Only the putty soft addition silicon material was used; no light body material was used to avoid penetration of the light material in the surgical wound, which could cause local irritation and further complications. Working casts were obtained, and implants-screwed wax rims were fabricated in these models. All maxillary-mandibular relations were recorded in these screw-retained wax rims

in the day after surgery. Esthetic and functional try-ins of the artificial teeth were performed, titanium bars welded to titanium cylinders were fabricated, based on the position determined for the acrylic teeth. The teeth were remounted over the titanium bars, and tried in for passive fit and esthetics. The passive fit was assessed manually as follow: screw at terminal abutment were tighten to verify discrepancies at the other abutments. Follow, the remaining screws were tightened one by with torque of 10 Ncm until complete screw seating. If some screw abutment presented some resistance or did not reach final seating, the bar was adjusted or changed by a new one. In addition, a radiographic inspection was made at the delivery of the restoration. The occlusal adjustments were performed according to the antagonist arch: for complete removable dentures, bilaterally adjustment occlusion was provided. Teeth, fixed prosthesis and partial removable denture and teeth received a mutually protected occlusion adjustment. The full-arch implant-supported restorations were manufactured and installed until 72 hours after surgery.


Delayed loading was performed in implants did not reach primary stability, with installation torques below 45 Ncm. Throughout 5 months of healing period, patients wore conventional removable prostheses refined with a soft silicon liner (Ufi Gel, VOCO GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany), to avoid contact of the acrylic interim prosthesis with the submerged implants. The fixed prostheses were constructed 5 months after implant installation, following a second-stage surgery.

# 2.4 | Clinical evaluation follow-up

Patients were followed up for 3 years after implant loading. The success criteria utilized in this study were: absence of pain; stability of the fixation; pain, bone resorption; and radiographic evaluation. Clinical

Note that the emergence of the right zygomatic implants is almost in the buccal position of the alveolar ridge, resulting in a favorable further emergence profile for the restoration outcomes were assessed in all follow-up appointments. For biofilm control, all patients were instructed to use interdental brushes, dental floss, and an oral hygiene system based on high-pressure water spray twice a day. Professional control took place every 3 months in the first year, and thereafter each 6 months until the end of the 3 years' period. Panoramic radiographs were taken before and after surgery, after prosthesis placement and at each 6-month interval appointments. After 6 months of implant installation, prostheses were removed at every appointment for professional intraoral hygiene and laboratory polishing of the prostheses.



At each reinstallation, new prosthetic screw abutments were placed. The inspection in the follow-up appointments included assessment of oral hygiene, soft tissue health (presence or not of periimplant pockets, pain and suppuration) using a North Caroline periodontal probe, radiographic aspects of bone/implant interface, implant and prosthesis stability, screw loosening, and other possible complications.

Peri-implant bone loss was assessed by linear measurements using panoramic radiograph. The radiographs were captured with a digital camera and transferred to a personal computer. Image processing software was used to store the digitized images. Subsequently, the images were displayed on a monitor and linear measurements were taken with a software (Image Pro-Plus 4.5, Media Cybernetics Inc, Silver Spring, Maryland). The distance from implant-abutment connection to first visible bone-to-implant contact were adjusted according to the known height and width of each dental implant (for both conventional and zygomatic implants). Radiographic monitoring was performed between baseline and 36 months.

# 3 | RESULTS

Forty-two patients (10 men and 32 women), with ages ranging from 37 to 79 years (mean: 58 years) were included in this study, and clinical data were collected from 2010 to 2014. Each patient was treated with a minimum of 4 implants, including at least 1 zygomatic implant. A total of 273 implants (94 zygomatic implants and 179 conventional implants) were installed. Twenty-seven patients presented edentulous maxillae and fifteen were partially dentate with remaining teeth indicated for extraction. Eight patients were smokers  $(19.04\%)$ . The opposing arch (mandible) presented these types of antagonist occlusion: natural dentition (9 patients); partial removable prostheses associated with natural remaining teeth as abutments (4 patients); complete removable dentures (14 patients); overdentures (1 patient); implant-supported fixed prostheses (14 patients).


The conventional implants used in this study presented 2 types of macro-geometry: 113 were conic (Nobel Biocare, Yorba Linda, California) and 66 were cylindrical (Conexao, Arujá, São Paulo, Brazil). The connection types were external hex (128) and internal hex (51). All conventional implants used presented roughened acid-etched surfaces. All zygomatic implants were cylindrical (Conexao, Arujá) with external hex connections, and machined surfaces.

All 42 patients were treated with a combination of conventional and zygomatic implants supporting fixed full-arch screw-retained dental prostheses (Table 1). The number of zygomatic implants used in each patient is listed on Table 2. Thirty-four patients had their implants immediately loaded with screw-retained fixed prostheses 72 hours
FIGURE 5 Clinical view of frontal (A) and occlusal (B) aspect of the implant-supported fixed prosthesis after 3 years after the surgery. The remaining 8 patients had their implants submerged, and fixed prostheses delivered after second-stage surgery, 6 months after implant installation. The implants of late restoration presented low insertion torque (<45 Ncm) at implant placement surgery. All patients received and maintained a fixed full-arch denture during the 3-year follow-up of this study.


Table 3 showed the survival rates of zygomatic and conventional implants. Four conventional implants, being 2 immediately and 2 late loaded, failed during the study period, resulting in a survival rate of  $97.7\%$ . The 2 failed implants after 6 months of unloaded healing were placed in smokers. One zygomatic implant failed after 35 months of loading, resulting in a survival rate of  $98.9\%$ . This failed zygomatic implant present teeth as antagonistic arch. None of the surviving conventional implants showed signs of peri-implantitis (probing depth  $>5$  mm, bleeding on probing and or suppuration, vertical bone loss  $>3$  mm) or soft tissue

One surviving zygomatic implant showed a soft tissue dehiscence in the cervical portion of the implant, approximately to the level of the second thread of the implant; no signal of irritation or inflammation was observed in this implant, neither in the other surviving zygomatic implants. No other soft tissue complications were observed in the other zygomatic implants. Minor technical complications as fractures or detachments of one or more acrylic teeth, which were all repairable were observed in 5 implant-supported restorations (14.7%), all with fixed denture implant-supported restoration as antagonistic arch. No other significant occurrences were reported.


Marginal bone changes were observed for both zygomatic and conventional implants. The mean  $\pm$  SD bone loss around zygomatic and conventional was  $1.34 \pm 0.23 \, \text{mm}$  and  $1.10 \pm 0.58 \, \text{mm}$  respectively.

# 4 DISCUSSION

Rehabilitation of atrophic maxillae using zygomatic implants installed with intrasinus techniques has been reported with high success rates, ranging around  $97\%$ .[14-17] The extrasinus technique also presented high success rates,[18-21] ratifying the aforementioned studies with the intrasinus techniques. The survival rate obtained in this 3-year clinical follow-up study of extrasinus zygomatic implants  $(98.9\%)$  agree with the previous studies[20,22,23] which indicates that the extrasinus technique may also play a role as an alternative for rehabilitating atrophic edentulous maxillae.

The extrasinus technique for installation of zygomatic implants used in our study<sup>11</sup> simplifies the original techniques previously proposed.<sup>10,24</sup> The extrasinus approach eliminates the need of maxillary antrostomy, membrane lifting, or the confection of a slot. In addition, this approach provides emergence of the zygomatic implant next to, or in the top of the alveolar ridge crest, improving prosthesis design and biomechanics. The palatal implant emergence, typical of intrasinus techniques, may increase the risk of occlusal overload and make oral hygiene more difficult.


The extrasinus technique eliminates the presence of the implant in the interior of the maxillary sinus; thus, the incidence of sinusal problems with this technique tends to be smaller or absent, at least at 3-year follow-up. Complementary, as the drilling is performed extrasinusly, the surgical visualization is improved and the surgical time is reduced compared to the intrasinus techniques.

However, the extrasinus technique employed in this study, presents some potential problems related with leaving a considerable portion of the implant exposed to the overlaying soft tissue such as dehiscence, irritation, inflammation, and other soft tissue complications. In this study one zygomatic implant presented a dehiscence in the cervical portion of the implant, to the level of the second thread, which was not associated with irritation or inflammation. The absence of inflammatory reactions in this dehiscence area, as well as in the other implants studied, is possible to the well-maintained population and nice compliance of the evaluated subjects. Periodic professional hygiene associated with strict biofilm control protocol probably improves our success rate and decreased the biological and technical complications.

In addition, the effectiveness of the zygomatic implants in atrophic edentulous maxillae rehabilitations depends on a rigid connection among implants, that must be provided by a 1-piece, rigid prosthesis involving all the implants.[25] In this study, the implant-supported prostheses were reinforced by welded-titanium bars, which provided adequate resistance to the prostheses, with a reasonably short fabrication time in comparison to conventional cast metal bars. This fact also allowed assume implants placed on extraction sockets presented the same conditions that those placed at healed sites showing a unique occlusal environment and stable peri-implant bone margins.

In the cases with conventional implant failures, new conventional implants were installed, when possible, in the same site of the failed implant, or in adjacent sites, to reestablish an adequate support for the prostheses. In the case with the zygomatic implant failure, a new one was installed adjacent to the failed implant site.

Finally, this surgical technique employed in this study needs an adequate expertise and know-how of the surgeon, based on the surgical skills ability and knowledge of the anatomy of the recipient bone site fact that needs a relative learning curve to proceed with this technique, as previously suggested.[26]

# 5 | CONCLUSION

This 3-year clinical follow-up conducted in well-maintained subjects suggested that zygomatic implants installed according to the extrasinus technique, combined with conventional implants, supporting full-arch, screw-retained prostheses, consist in a predictable treatment option for the atrophic maxillae. However, further prospective clinical studies with long-term follow-ups (5 years or more) are necessary to confirm these results.
