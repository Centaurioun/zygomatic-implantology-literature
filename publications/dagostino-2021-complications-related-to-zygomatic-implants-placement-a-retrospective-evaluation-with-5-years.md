# ABSTRACT

This retrospective study assessed zygoma implants in patients treated for upper maxilla extreme atrophy, trauma, cleft palate, or failed reconstruction.

The implants were placed using Quad (4 zygoma implants) or mixed (zygoma and conventional implants in premaxilla) surgical technique, with intra-sinus or extra-sinus approach, followed by immediate or deferred loading. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were carried out at 5-year follow-up from loading. Implant survival, symptoms and signs of sinusitis, radiological alterations in terms of mucosal thickening or obliteration of the maxillary sinuses, oroantral communications, and peri-implant soft tissues were examined.

A total of 42 patients, with 116 zygoma implants, were included in the study. The cumulative survival rate was  $97.41\%$ . One zygomatic bone fracture was assessed. Eight patients reported sinusitis, and two showed oro-antral communications. A comparison between mean pre- and post-operative Lund-Mackay scores showed a statistically significant increase of sino-nasal disease in the post-operative scores  $(p = 0.0019)$ . Mucositis and gingival recession was observed in 21 and 8 implants respectively. Average recession was  $2.52 \pm 2.35 \mathrm{~mm}$ .

According to our results, placement of zygoma implants has proved to be a predictable procedure, with a lower rate of severe complications compared to other treatment options in extreme upper jaw atrophy.

# 1. Introduction

Post-extraction advanced bone resorption, trauma, neoplasm, infection and the presence of heavily pneumatised maxillary sinuses are factors that determine an inadequate amount of bone tissue necessary for anchoring conventional endosseous implants (Adell et al., 1990; Tolman and Laney, 1993). Several methods have been proposed in the literature for the rehabilitation of patients with severe atrophy, including bone grafts (Chiapasco et al., 2011; Sjöström et al., 2007), guided bone regeneration (GBR) (Chiapasco and Zaniboni, 2009; Dahlin et al., 1988; Kostopoulos and Karring, 1994), Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafting (Chiapasco et al., 2007; D. De Santis et al., 2012; Nocini et al., 2011;

Nocini et al., 2014; Nyström et al., 2009), fibula free flaps (G. De Santis et al., 2004; Sjöström et al., 2007), and zygoma implants (Hirsch et al., 2004; Kahnberg et al., 2007).

The concept of zygomatic fixtures was introduced by Brænemark in 1988: long titanium implants (30-52.5 mm) were placed across the alveolar crest and cortically anchored in the zygomatic bone, in order to optimize the use of residual anatomical bone in the upper jaw and zygomatic bone, through alternative insertion angles and consecutive fixed prostheses (Farzad et al., 2006).

Zygoma implants were initially designed for the prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with extensive maxillary defects due to tumour resections, traumas and congenital defects. Their use was later extended to severe upper jaw atrophies (Cawood-Howell class

The use of zygoma implants is currently indicated in patients who are not eligible for or refuse bone reconstruction surgery and in whom significant rehabilitation time and reduced compliance are expected. The technique requires just one surgical procedure and allows to application of an immediate prosthetic load, thus considerably shortening rehabilitation time. There is no need for mucogingival surgery or donor sites for bone harvesting, thus ensuring less morbidity, less invasiveness and less discomfort for the patient (Balshi et al., 2010; Mozzati et al., 2008). An adequate rehabilitation is therefore provided in certain patients, restoring function, improving aesthetics, and allowing patients to return to a normal social life (Trevisiol et al., 2016).

In the literature, there are a considerable number of scientific studies concerning the long-term stability of zygoma implants placed using various methods (Nocini et al., 2016; Trevisiol et al., 2016), although not many authors have analysed the complications following this type of surgery.

The aim of the present research study was to evaluate the implant survival rate and the interrelations between the positioning of zygoma implants and the radiological and clinical signs of sino-nasal disease in the post-operative period, as well as the condition of peri-implant soft tissues.

# 2. Materials and methods

# 2.1. Study design and inclusion criteria

In order to investigate the research question, a longitudinal retrospective study was designed and implemented. The population under study consisted of patients referred to the Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the University of Verona and undergoing upper jaw rehabilitation using Branemark System ZygomaTiUnite zygoma implants (Nobel Biocare AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) from January 2005 to November 2017. The retrospective study complies with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Verona (Prot. Code ZYGOMACOMPLICATION, date of approval 9/01/2019). All patients provided signed written informed consent.

The study enrolled patients with the following inclusion criteria: rehabilitated with osseointegrated zygoma implants due to class V, VI atrophy according to Cawood-Howell (Cawood and Howell, 1988; Chiapasco, 2013); rehabilitated with osseointegrated zygoma implants due to history of maxillofacial trauma; rehabilitated with osseointegrated zygoma implants due to history of cleft/palate surgery; rehabilitated with osseointegrated zygoma implants due to history of failed reconstruction; over 18 years of age; who underwent facial CBCT evaluation and a post-operative visit at least 6 months after surgery.

On the other hand, the study excluded patients with the following exclusion criteria: those with cancer and/or with history of head and neck cancer; and those lacking complete clinical documentation.

# 2.2. Surgical protocol and follow-up evaluation

After pre-operative radiographs (panoramic radiographs, teleradiography, or computed tomography [CT]) and pre-operative tests (blood tests, electrocardiography [ECG], chest X-ray), patients received general anaesthesia, followed by local infiltration anaesthesia. Surgical access was performed by crest incision from tuber to tuber and release incisions, which allowed lifting and detaching the mucoperiosteal flaps to expose the alveolar crest, the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus and the lower edge of the zygomatic arch.

The implant site was planned with the entry point at the level of the alveolar crest, generally in the region of the second premolar/ first molar. When inserting 4 zygoma implants (Quad technique) (D'Agostino et al., 2013; Nocini et al., 2016; Trevisiol et al., 2016), the mesial implants would emerge in the premolar-canine area; in the mixed technique 2 zygoma implants and 2 conventional premaxillary implants were placed. The implant also engaged the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus while being inserted into the zygomatic bone. When an intra-sinus rather than extra-sinus approach was planned, a vertical  $5 \times 10 \mathrm{~mm}$  bone window was created in the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, and the Schneiderian membrane was then carefully detached from the sinus walls.

A sequence of burs was used to penetrate the alveolar crest and the zygomatic bone, ideally following the line that runs to the zygomatic angle that forms between its frontal and temporal processes. The first step involved the use of a rosette bur to make a notch on the internal cortical layer of the zygomatic bone, thus facilitating the next steps. The length of the implant to be inserted was estimated using a depth probe. The implant was inserted by using an implant motor or manually, to obtain an implant platform parallel to the occlusal plane. After verifying parallelism, a cover screw was placed on the implant and the mucoperiosteal flap was sutured in a double layer with resorbable submucosal stitches and simple non-resorbable mucosal stitches. After surgery, all patients received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin  $875\mathrm{mg}$  and clavulanic acid  $125\mathrm{mg}$ ,  $2\mathrm{g}$  per day for 6 days.

Ice packs (in the first  $24\mathrm{h}$  after surgery), hot moist packs (from the third day, if there was swelling), soft, lukewarm diet in the first  $72\mathrm{h}$ , painkillers as needed, and rinsing with  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine mouthwash (twice a day for 7 days) were recommended; in the same period, mechanical brushing of the surgical site and, possibly, smoking were forbidden.

In most patients, deferred prosthetic loading was applied after 4-6 months. All subjects underwent facial cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) at least 6 months after surgery.

Some selected patients underwent immediate loading, with a temporary fixed prosthesis without extensions within  $24\mathrm{h}$ , and definitive restoration after 8-10 months. Patients were also instructed to follow a soft diet for at least 4 months (Aparicio et al., 2010).

Patients underwent periodic follow-up visits during the postoperative period and followed a maintenance programme with oral hygiene sessions every 4 months.

# 2.3. Study variables

Demographics included the following patient characteristics: sex, age at the time of surgery, smoking, clinical history and health status. Implant-based variables were intrasinusal or extrasinusal localization of the implants (Aparicio, 2011), pure zygomatic or hybrid surgical technique, and timing of prosthetic load (immediate or deferred) (D'Agostino et al., 2013; Nocini et al., 2016; Trevisiol et al., 2016).

# 2.4. Outcomes

# 2.4.1. Implant survival rate

The cumulative survival rate was evaluated on average at 5 years after prosthetic loading (range 12-162 months), considering failures as the need for implant removal, before or after loading.

# 2.4.2. Signs or symptoms of sinusitis

The clinical manifestations of sinusitis due to the placement of zygoma implants, similar to other types of sinusitis, are characterised by nasal obstruction, facial pain and congestion, hyposmia, headache, halitosis, dental pain, and fatigue (Aparicio et al., 2014a,b). Sinusitis is also diagnosed by performing instrumental examinations, such as nasal endoscopy or CT scan, which shows opacity of the sinus lumen. The prescription of antibiotic therapy to treat sinus-related symptoms and the execution of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in the period following the placement of zygoma implants, were the criteria used in the study to assess the presence of established sino-nasal disease in the clinical history of patients.

# 2.4.3. Oroantral communication

The lack of osseointegration of the implant head in the thin and impaired alveolar crest and the functional forces exerted on the implant may increase the risk of oroantral communication and the subsequent development of sinusitis (Molinero-Mourelle et al., 2016). Excessively wide implant site preparations and fractures of the thin alveolar crest during implant placement should therefore be avoided (Davó et al., 2008).

# 2.4.4. Degree of opacity of the maxillary sinuses

The presence of sinus pathology or mucous alterations was evaluated at CT, based on Lund and Mackay's rhinological staging system (Fig. 1a and b). The severity of inflammation of the sinus mucous membrane or accumulation of fluid can be marked as 0 (fully radiolucent), 1 (partially radiolucent) or 2 (fully radiopaque). The 10 sinus scores of one side are added to the score of the ostiomeatal complex to determine a bilateral score. Total Lund-Mackay score (LMS) may vary from 0 (complete radiolucency of all the sinuses) to 24 (complete opacity of all the sinuses) (Lund and Mackay, 1993). For the purposes of this study, the LMS applied solely to the maxillary sinuses was considered and thus varied from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 4 (Basu et al., 2005; Hopkins et al., 2007; Sharp et al., 1999).

# 2.4.5. Peri-implant soft tissues conditions

The stability of the peri-implant soft tissues was assessed by means of a millimetre-gauged periodontal probe, applying a force of mild intensity (0.2 N). For each implant site, four soft tissues parameters were considered.

The measurements of the peri-implant probing depth (PPD), the bleeding index (mBI) and the peri-implant plaque index (mPLI), with the latter two modified as reported in the literature by Mombelli (Mombelli and Lang, 1994), were recorded on the vestibular and palatal sides of each implant, distinguishing three sites on each side (mesial, central and distal). The amount of keratinized tissue (KT) was assessed by measuring the distance between the zenith of the vestibular gingival margin and the mucogingival line (in millimetres [mm]). Recession was always assessed in millimetres as a measure of the apical displacement of the free gingival margin from the junction between the metal and the prosthetic material (Fig. 2).

Inflammation of the peri-implant soft tissues, detectable in at least one of the six sites considered for each implant, was defined as moderate mucositis (mBI greater than 2, PPD less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , and mPLI greater than 2) or severe mucositis (mBI greater than 2, PPD greater than or equal to  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , and mPLI greater than 2) (Zitzmann and Berglundh, 2008). The presence of suppuration was also assessed (Fig. 3).

# 2.4.6. Success rate

Zygoma implants do not have defined success criteria, and using conventional implants success criteria to evaluate zygoma implants is not a validated process. According to Pellegrino et al. (2020), the criteria for implant clinical success were fulfilled when the implant remained intact in situ without pain, rotation, bleeding/pus, or soft tissue inflammation. Every incidence of inflammation that did not undergo complete regression with oral hygiene and application of a local disinfectant (chlorhexidine digluconate  $0.2\%$  solution) was classified as unsuccessful.

Prosthetic success was also evaluated according to Pellegrino et al.: the prosthesis was considered successful when it remained in situ with the support of all the placed implants with the denture extension up to the first molar, and when there was no need for the prosthesis extension to be reduced from the day of delivery to the final follow-up.

# 2.5. Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed using the MedCalc software (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium).

The severity of sino-nasal symptoms, the degree of maxillary sinus opacity, and the presence of alterations of the peri-implant soft tissues were considered as dependent variables.

It was therefore possible to carry out the Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney test for independent variables to investigate whether these variables may have been affected by: age, sex, smoking, surgical technique, number of implants, and immediate or deferred loading.

The paired-samples Wilcoxon test was adopted to determine the differences between post-operative Lund-Mackay scores and the pre-operative values.

The statistical data were considered to be significant at  $p < 0.05$ .

# 3. Results

A total of 42 patients, 16 male and 26 female, met the inclusion criteria, for a total of 116 zygoma implants. Eight patients were smokers. The average age of patients at implant placement was  $54 \pm 10$  (range 24-76) years. The average age of the patients at the

follow-up visit was  $63 \pm 10$  (range 29-81) years. The average follow-up was 5 years (60 months), with a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 162 months.

The zygoma implants were placed in: 31 patients with extreme upper jaw atrophy, 1 patient with outcomes of facial trauma, 2 patients with cleft lip and palate outcomes, and 8 patients with failed implant rehabilitation or prior reconstruction. All patients received facial CBCT at least 6 months after surgery. With regard to the surgical techniques adopted, an intra-sinus method was adopted in 32 patients, while an extra-sinus method was adopted in 10 patients.

A total of 16 patients were rehabilitated with 4 zygoma implants (Quad technique), while 21 patients were rehabilitated with zygoma implants and conventional implants, with the latter varying in number from 2 to 5 (mixed technique). 5 patients received the placement of 2 or 3 zygoma implants without the insertion of conventional premaxillary implants. A total of 70 conventional implants were placed.

While 6 patients received immediate loading Toronto, 36 patients underwent a delayed procedure, consisting in a provisional mobile prosthesis (from 15 days after surgery to surgical uncovering and healing abutment placement), afterwards a definitive prosthesis (Toronto or overdenture) were delivered. Type of prosthesis was fixed in 31 patients, overdenture in 11 patients. (The forementioned outcomes are summarized in Table 1).

In the present study, we reported the failure of 3 zygoma implants  $(2.59\%)$ ; therefore, the cumulative implant survival rate with an average follow-up of 60 months (range 12-162months) was  $97.41\%$ . These implant failures were due in 1 case to an intraoperative error of implant placement: the non-osseointegrated zygoma implant was removed 1 month after surgery. The other 2 implants were lost in 1 patient at 6 months and at 56 months after implant placement. The first implant was extracted because it was not osseointegrated, and the second was removed because of a severe peri-implant infection. The patient, who was a heavy smoker and neglected oral hygiene at home, had previously undergone rehabilitation with conventional implants, which later failed due to severe peri-implantitis. In the same session, the patient also underwent FESS.

One patient reported an intraoperative fracture of the right cheekbone; in addition, 9 patients reported sino-nasal complications: in particular, 8 patients were treated with antibiotics or FESS for confirmed symptomatic sinusitis, while oroantral communication was found in 2 patients. One patient had both sinusitis and oroantral communication.

As for the post-operative radiological evaluation, 2 patients presented with bilateral radiopacity of the maxillary sinuses at CT  $(\mathrm{LMS} = 2 + 2)$ . Four patients showed a totally radiopaque sinus and a totally radiolucent sinus  $(\mathrm{LMS} = 2 + 0)$ , while 3 patients showed total radiopacity on 1 side and partial radiopacity on the other  $(\mathrm{LMS} = 2 + 1)$ . Three patients showed partial bilateral radiopacity  $(\mathrm{LMS} = 1 + 1)$ , while 9 patients showed partial unilateral radiopacity  $(\mathrm{LMS} = 0 + 1)$ . The remaining 20 patients showed bilateral radiolucent maxillary sinuses  $(\mathrm{LMS} = 0)$ . In 1 patient only, who lost both zygoma implants, the calculation of the LMS was not considered significant.

Overall, in the post-operative evaluation of 82 maxillary sinuses, 53 maxillary sinuses had an LMS equal to 0; 18 maxillary sinuses had an LMS equal to 1; and 11 maxillary sinuses had an LMS equal to 2 (Fig. 4).

All patients had undergone a CT scan in the pre-operative period. Overall, in the pre-operative evaluation, there were 71 maxillary sinuses with LMS equal to 0, 11 sinuses with LMS equal to 1, and 2 maxillary sinuses with LMS equal to 2. Based on the paired samples Wilcoxon test, there was a statistically significant increase  $(p = 0.0019)$  in post-operative radiological evidence of sino-nasal disease compared to the pre-operative findings.

No statistically significant correlations were found between sinus opacification rate and sex, smoking, and surgical technique.

A total of 29 zygoma implants showed peri-implant soft tissue alterations. There were 8 cases of recession and 21 cases of peri-implant inflammation, consisting of 3 implants with severe mucositis and 18 implants with moderate mucositis; 6 implants also showed suppuration. Recession was found mostly in the anterior sectors, with an average value of  $2.52 \pm 2.35 \mathrm{~mm}$ . The mean value of KT in the study sample was  $1.51 \pm 2.84 \mathrm{~mm}$ . Implants with moderate peri-implant mucositis presented with a mean PPD of  $4.02 \pm 0.34$ , a mean mBI of  $2.56 \pm 1.27$ , and a mean mPLI of  $2.17 \pm 0.08$ . Implants with severe peri-implant mucositis had a mean PPD of  $5.94 \pm 0.01$ , a mean mBI of  $2.87 \pm 1.35$ , and a mean mPLI of  $2.21 \pm 0.15$ .

The success criteria were met in 107 of 116 implants, with an average follow-up of 60 months. The resulting implant-based success rate therefore was  $92.24\%$  (107/116), considering 3 failed implants, plus 6 of 21 implants affected by mucositis with suppuration and consequently treated with systemic antibiotic administration.


Prosthetic success was also evaluated according to the criteria of Pellegrino et al.: Prosthesis was considered successful when it remained in situ with the support of all the placed implants with the denture extension up to the first molar and when there was no need for the prosthesis extension to be reduced from the day of delivery to the final follow-up. Of 116 implants, 3 were removed in 2 patients; 1 patient lost 2 posterior implants, which led to the loss of the posterior sectors of the prosthesis, and 1 patient lost an anterior implant, which led to a modification in the prosthesis even if the occlusion was not modified. The prosthetic based success rate was  $95.23\%$ .

# 4. Discussion

The aim of this research study was to evaluate the relationships between the positioning of zygoma implants and the possible long-term related complications.

The following outcomes were specifically identified: implant survival rate, clinical and radiological signs of post-operative sinonasal disease and clinical alterations of the peri-implant soft tissues.

With regard to implant survival, several authors have calculated the cumulative survival rate (CSR) to evaluate the longevity of zygoma implants in the long term. Several studies have reported a high CSR, making atrophic maxillary rehabilitation with zygoma implants a predictable procedure and a viable alternative to other severely atrophic upper jaw rehabilitation procedures, such as interpositional grafts with Le Fort I osteotomy or fibula free flaps (Aparicio et al., 2014a,b). In the long term, some authors argue that the CSR of zygoma implants is comparable with that of conventional implants (Aparicio et al., 2014a,b; Chrcanovic and Abreu, 2013; Maló et al., 2008).

According to a study by Aparicio et al. which analysed 131 zygoma implants, CSR over a period of 5 years was  $100\%$  (Aparicio et al., 2006). In another study by Aparicio et al. with a 10-year follow-up, on 41 zygoma implants and 131 conventional implants, a cumulative survival rate of  $95.12\%$  for zygoma implants was reported (Aparicio et al., 2014a,b). This was also confirmed by the literature review by Chrcanovic et al. which evaluated 4556 zygoma implants, calculating a CSR of  $95.21\%$  over a 12-year period and most failures occurring within 6 months of implant placement (Chrcanovic et al., 2016). The literature review by Goiato et al. showed a CSR of  $97.86\%$  for 1541 zygoma implants, reporting 33 failures, caused by sinusitis, infections, or surgical errors (Goiato et al., 2014). Finally, according to a previous study from our group, conducted in 2016 on 65 zygoma implants with a follow-up of 12-90 months, the cumulative survival rate was  $98.5\%$  (Lombardo et al., 2016), with only 1 case of implant failure due to lack of osseointegration. According to a literature review by Chrcanovic in 2013, the 12 studies that applied an immediate loading protocol reported survival rates much higher than the average  $(95.8\% -100\%)$  with an average CSR of  $96.7\%$  (Chrcanovic and Abreu, 2013). However, this outcome should be examined with caution, because in this review, studies with immediate loading are more recent and therefore have a shorter follow-up (less than 3 years) than studies with a deferred loading protocol.

Our analysis, with 3 implants lost before loading, showed a cumulative survival rate (CSR) of  $97.41\%$ .

With regard to sino-nasal complications, 8 cases of confirmed sinusitis were treated with antibiotic therapy or FESS. At the radiological evaluation,  $51.2\%$  of patients and  $35.4\%$  of maxillary sinuses had some form of radiographic opacity. These results show that the positioning of zygoma implants was associated with variable degrees of altered sino-nasal homeostasis, although almost always limited to a subclinical level. The severity of the symptoms described by our sample of patients did not differ from the values reported on studies concerning the general population (Dykewicz and Hamilos, 2010).

According to the results reported in the literature, the incidence of sinusitis associated with zygoma implant placement ranges from  $0\%$  to  $26.6\%$  (Davó et al., 2008; Fernández et al., 2014). Such a wide range is probably due to lack of uniformity in the criteria adopted for the classification of sino-nasal disease. Other difficulties in the analysis of these complications consist in establishing a clear correlation between sinus inflammation and zygoma implants, as many authors did not report the pre-existing clinical and radiological conditions (Chrcanovic and Abreu, 2013; Chrcanovic et al., 2016).

Although a straightforward causal relationship between the placement of zygoma implants and the development of sino-nasal complications has not yet been demonstrated, it is widely suggested the anatomical condition of the patient and the surgical techniques for implant insertion may contribute to altering sino-nasal homeostasis (CIT). Surgical techniques to minimise sinusitis risk have been described in the literature, basically using an extrasinus approach for patients with a compatible upper jaw anatomy and seeking in any case to preserve the integrity of the Schneiderian membrane (Aparicio et al., 2014a,b; Aparicio et al., 2010; D'Agostino et al., 2013; D'Agostino et al., 2016; Malo et al., 2008; Molinero-Mourelle et al., 2016; Nocini et al., 2016; Trevisiol et al., 2016). Another method used to decrease the risk of sino-nasal complications is preventive meatal antrostomy at the time of the first surgery (Branemark et al., 2004; D'Agostino et al., 2019; Fernandez Olarte et al., 2015). The focus of most of the studies which have analysed this particular type of complication was usually on patients who presented clinical signs of some relevance and with a follow-up limited to the short to medium term. Although most patients treated with zygoma implants do not develop any clinical signs of sino-nasal disease in the postoperative period, the results of this analysis, in accordance with those of major studies that have adopted similar methods, reveal that there are a considerable number of patients who develop opacity of the maxillary sinuses, which, although asymptomatic, can be a precursor to more serious clinical conditions.


In 2004 Brænemark et al. treated 28 patients with zygoma implants for the rehabilitation of severe maxillary resorption, with a minimum follow-up of 5 years: 4 patients had symptoms of recurrent sinusitis during the period. Symptoms were resolved by a drainage of the maxillary sinuses through a new accessory opening in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. Sinusitis was radiologically diagnosed in another 4 patients in the post-operative period, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, with spontaneous resolution of the inflammatory process (Brænemark et al., 2004).

In 2008, a study by Davó and colleagues evaluated the clinical and radiographic reaction of the maxillary sinuses following the insertion of zygoma implants: as regards the clinical signs of sinusitis, 36 patients with 71 implants with immediate loading were analysed, with a follow-up ranging from 13 to 42 months after surgery. In the pre-operative period, no patient developed opacity of the maxillary sinuses; in the post-operative period, 2 patients had at least 1 radiopaque maxillary sinus  $(7.7\%)$  (Davó et al., 2008).

Aparicio et al. evaluated a consecutive series of 22 patients, with minimum follow-up of 10 years, who underwent rehabilitation of severe atrophy of the upper jaw with zygoma and conventional implants, for a total of 41 zygoma implants. All zygoma implants were placed using the intra-sinus approach. Among the various parameters taken into consideration, the extent of post-operative sino-nasal disease was evaluated with the Lund-Mackay score for the radiological findings and through the Lanza-Kennedy questionnaire for the clinical findings. At radiological evaluation,  $45.45\%$  of patients had some form of sinus opacity, while  $9.1\%$  based on the questionnaire administered, reported sinusitis symptoms (Aparicio et al., 2014a,b).

The study by Bothur et al. analysed a series of 14 patients with severe upper jaw atrophy rehabilitated with zygoma and conventional implants, with a total of 58 zygoma implants and an average follow-up of 9.3 years (range 5.8-12.0). In this study as well, the zygoma implants were placed using an intra-sinus approach and the radiological findings were assessed by CBCT. The parameters considered were the neo-osteogenesis of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinuses, used as an index of osteitis, the presence of any accessory ostia and the patency of the main ostium, and the degree of sinus opacity evaluated with the Lund-Mackay score. Signs of osteitis were found in all but 1 patient. Similarly, in all patients but 1, a certain degree of sinus opacity, at least monolaterally, was found. In 9 maxillary sinuses, the main ostium was obstructed; in 7 cases there were accessory ostia. In terms of symptoms, only 2 patients reported some form of sino-nasal symptoms. In conclusion, the authors stated that most of the patients were asymptomatic, but showed subclinical alterations, with possible future indications for endoscopic surgery (Bothur et al., 2015).

A previous study conducted by our group (D'Agostino et al., 2016) aimed to analyse the relationship between the insertion of zygoma implants and the symptomatic and radiological maxillary sinus modifications. In the pre-operative period,  $12.2\%$  of patients had a Lund-Mackay score greater than 0, while at the postoperative evaluation the rate increased to  $46.3\%$  of the patients. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20). The results showed that in the pre-operative period  $12.2\%$  of patients had a SNOT-20 score greater than 11 and  $14.6\%$  in the post-operative period. Therefore, according to the authors, the placement of zygoma implants does not seem to be associated with serious sino-nasal complications but, in any case, asymptomatic radiological alterations of the paranasal sinuses occurred in a considerable number of patients.

The results of our study are coherent with the findings of the above-mentioned papers.

Furthermore, our analysis reported a moderate prevalence of implants (29) with altered conditions of the peri-implant tissues, of which 8 were recessions and 21 mucositis; this prevalence is higher than in other studies in the literature.

According to the previously cited literature review by Chrcanovic et al. (2016), which analysed 68 studies for a total of 4556 zygoma implants, the rate of infections of peri-implant soft tissues was  $2\%$ ; in fact, 67 cases of infection were found around implants (Chrcanovic et al., 2016). This outcome is comparable with the results obtained from the systematic review proposed by Molinero-Mourelle et al., according to which the prevalence of such complications is  $4\%$  (Molinero-Mourelle et al., 2016). According to Aparicio et al. intraoral soft tissue infections associated with zygoma implants range from  $3.8\%$  to  $6.5\%$  (Aparicio et al., 2008). More specifically, a study by Al-Nawas et al. reported that 9 of 20  $(45\%)$  zygoma implants were associated with bleeding and increased probing depth, possibly caused by difficulties in ensuring adequate home hygiene due to the placement of the implant head and the shape of the prosthetic device (Al-Nawas et al., 2004).

The analysis by Farzad et al. however, evaluated 11 patients for a total of 64 implants, of which 22 were zygoma implants, with a follow-up of 18-46 months after implant placement. The authors reported moderate inflammation in 12 zygoma implants, while 2 others showed severe inflammation; 4 zygoma implants  $(18.2\%)$  had 4 to 5 threads of bone loss, while 5  $(22.7\%)$  had no marginal bone support (Farzad et al., 2006).

Malò et al. performed an analysis in 352 patients, rehabilitated using 747 zygoma implants, with a follow-up of 6 months-7 years: 54 implants and 54 patients reported peri-implant pathology, i.e., increased probing depth  $(>4\mathrm{mm})$  and probing bleeding and/or plaque deposits. The situation was resolved in 43 patients: in 34 cases, with non-surgical treatment with scaling and chlorhexidine washes; in 4 cases, with non-surgical treatment associated with antibiotic therapy; and in 5 patients, with surgery. On the other hand, the problem was not solved in 11 patients (Malò et al., 2015).

Yates et al. conducted a study of 43 zygoma implants, placed in 25 patients, with a follow-up of at least 5 years: globally, 6 zygoma implants with 2- to  $4\mathrm{-mm}$  peri-implant mucosal recessions were found (Yates et al., 2014).

Finally, a study by Lombardo et al. (2016) evaluated 65 zygoma implants, analysing 4 sites for each implant: 51 implants had bleeding on probing, but only  $9.6\%$  of the sites had significant periimplant infection, i.e., increased probing depth  $(>4\mathrm{mm})$  and bleeding on probing and/or plaque deposits, and no suppuration was observed (Lombardo et al., 2016).

Since there are no guidelines defined by a validated consensus to evaluate zygomatic implants, the success rate was evaluated following the criteria by Pellegrino et al. (2020). Our success rate is low if compared with that achieved with conventional implants  $(92.24\%)$ ; however, patients were affected by conditions which made conventional implants unviable. Moreover alternatives to zygomatic implants to treat maxillary atrophy (free flaps, LFI, and interpositional grafts, etc.) are associated with important comorbidities. On the other hand, our results are in line with outcomes reported by other authors (Pellegrino et al., 2020) using zygoma implants.

The retrospective nature of this study has limits within its own design; moreover the prosthetic rehabilitation was performed by dental practitioners working outside the Maxillo-Facial Surgery unit of Verona University, so the procedures were not standardized, and it was not possible to evaluate patient satisfaction. The success rate in this study was calculated according to a paper by Pellegrino et al. however, unlike conventional implants, there is not consensus on success criteria for zygomatic implants.


Further investigations with a larger sample size, including also oncology patients and assessing oral health-related quality of life, are desirable.

# 5. Conclusions

In light of the results of the present study, the placement of zygoma implants appears to be a predictable procedure, as it is associated with less morbidity, shorter treatment time, and less discomfort for patients with respect to other upper jaw rehabilitative procedures in extreme maxillary atrophy such as class VI in the Cawood classification.

Of course, the complication rate associated with zygomatic implants is not negligible, as they represent an alternative to complex upper jaw reconstructions rather than to conventional implants. The implications/influence on sino-nasal homeostasis and peri-implant health must be taken into account during the follow-up time.

Further research ideas may come from continued follow-up and the large-scale correlation of sinus findings with surgical technique, as well as from a more detailed assessment of the periimplant soft tissues. Prospective studies are required to confirm these data.
