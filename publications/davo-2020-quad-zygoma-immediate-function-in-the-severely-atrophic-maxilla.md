# Quad Zygoma: Immediate Function in the Severely Atrophic Maxilla

Rubén Davó and José E. Maté Sánchez de Val

# Introduction

The 'quad zygoma' concept, also known as 'all on four' using zygoma implants, involves insertion of four zygomatic implants, with adequate anteroposterior spread and correct inclination for the distribution of forces, as a means of rehabilitating patients presenting insufficient bone height in the anterior and posterior maxilla. The technique has been clinically tested using protocols for immediate function, obtaining promising short- and long-term results.

# Background

Severe maxillary bone atrophy is an increasingly common clinical occurrence due to patients' increased life expectancy. Consequently, there is growing demand for treatment among elderly age groups [1, 2].

Following dental loss, a series of phenomena affect the alveolar bone, leading to severe atrophy and a decrease in volume, making it difficult to insert dental implants using traditional protocols [3] (Fig. 1). This bone loss follows a predictable pattern that has been widely studied generating abundant literature. Resorption of the buccal and lingual walls at the extraction site occurs in two overlapping phases. During the first phase, bundle bone is resorbed and replaced by woven bone; the buccal crest undergoes remodelling and suffers vertical loss. In the second phase, advanced resorption occurs from the end of the bony walls.


To address this situation, three different treatment approaches are available: removable dentures; the placement of bone grafts for augmentation in the area where implants are to be inserted; and the use of implants with anchorage in non-alveolar bone, such as zygomatic or pterygoid implants [4, 5] (Fig. 2). Historically, these patients have been treated with dentures, an approach that frequently does not meet the functional, psychological and social needs of many patients [6].

Bone augmentation techniques are widely used and supported by a notable body of scientific evidence. Nevertheless, they continue to suffer a series of limitations, both clinical and biological, that prevent success rates reaching those of the alternative approach based on extra-alveolar implants [7]. In clinical practice, the presence of hyperplastic maxillary sinuses with uncontrollable infectious processes, severe alveolar atrophy, or other clinical situations such as accidents or the treatment of tumour pathology requiring severe resective surgery, means that the only possible treatment is by means of zygomatic implants [8].

From the biological point of view, autologous bone grafts are considered the gold standard, but can experience complications such as morbidity at the donor site, resorption when subjected to loading and problems deriving from clinically challenging techniques. In addition, the need to achieve adequate vascularization, both internally and externally, makes the augmentation technique difficult to apply in cases of large vertical atrophy; in other words, achieving adequate internal and peripheral vascularization of the graft in large vertical reconstructions is often unattainable [9].

Furthermore, few studies have investigated the use of grafts (bone grafts or other biomaterials) to regenerate bone in severely atrophied maxillae. A recent randomized clinical trial conducted with this type of patient suggested that, while use of biomaterials might be possible, rehabilitation takes an average of 430 days. In contrast, zygoma implants yield better outcomes and constitute a much faster means of rehabilitation [10].

Non-alveolar implants offer a predictable alternative to bone augmentation techniques in situations of severe alveolar atrophy; the placement of implants in bone of different embryological origin favours high survival rates derived from the absence of bone resorption and atrophy.

Zygomatic implants were introduced for the rehabilitation of patients with extensive bone atrophies derived from tumoral, traumatic or congenital pathologies. They exploit alternative osseous structures and processes for stabilization, specifically using the zygomatic bone that provides reinforcement and buttressing for the facial bones. Zygomatic implants may be combined with intra-alveolar implants or used alone to support a prosthetic rehabilitation. Several anatomical studies have validated the excellent quality of zygomatic bone and have stressed the importance of the cortical portion of zygomatic bone for anchoring implants. It has also been documented that the area of zygomatic bone typically used for implant insertion has wider and thicker trabecular bone, and this may explain the good initial primary stability of zygomatic implants, and the suitability for immediate loading. For this reason, another advantage of this type of implant is its potential for immediate prosthetic loading, which rehabilitates a patient's quality of life very quickly [6].

# Indications and Contraindications of Zygomatic Implants

# Indications

Zygomatic implants are suitable for a patient with a severely atrophic edentulous maxilla (Fig. 3) who desires rehabilitation by means of a fixed prosthesis and who either lacks sufficient bone volume for traditional endosseous dental implants across

Some controversy exists as to the convenience of combining short implants in the anterior maxilla with zygoma implants for the posterior maxilla. In our experience, it is prudent to perform a quad zygoma whenever it is not possible to place conventional implants of at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in the anterior maxilla.

# Contraindications

- General contraindications to implant surgery.  
- Irradiation to the head and neck region of more than  $70\mathrm{Gy}$ .  
- Immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients.  
- Patients who have been treated or are under treatment with high-dose intravenous amino-bisphosphonates.  
Patients presenting untreated periodontal disease.  
- Poor oral hygiene and motivation.  
- Uncontrolled diabetes.  
Pregnant or lactating women.  
- Addiction to alcohol or drugs.  
Psychiatric problems.  
- Restricted mouth opening (less than  $3\mathrm{cm}$  inter-arch anteriorly).  
- Acute or chronic infection/inflammation in the area intended for implant placement.  
- Abnormalities at the level of the zygoma bone (in a cadaver study, it was demonstrated that two implants can be placed at the level of the zygoma bone in the vast majority of cases) (Table 1) [13].  
- Sinus illness (must be treated before implant placement).

# Zygoma Quad: Current Technique (Description and Clinical Photos)

Quad zygoma is a 'prosthetically driven' technique in which complete prosthetic preparation takes place before implant placement. The prosthesis will largely determine surgical planning and treatment planning involves scanning both the patient and the prosthesis (ideally by means of the double CT scan) in order to

- Design a good surgical guide.  
- Prepare a good provisional prosthesis.

# Preoperative Prosthetic Preparation (Fig. 4)

The planning and preparation of the prosthesis take place following conventional procedures, accounting for determining factors such as the vertical dimension of occlusion, position of the midline, the smile curve/line, desired size of the artificial teeth and the vestibular/buccal corridors. In addition, other key factors must be considered such as restoration of masticatory function, speech/phonation, and aesthetics; in other words, all the same criteria that traditionally ensure the quality of any complete prosthesis [14] (Fig. 5).

Once the provisional prosthesis has been fabricated, a surgical guide with palatal support is prepared based on the assembly of the teeth and used for guidance during implant surgery. The surgical guide is fabricated from transparent acrylic resin and will also be used later to register implant positions for fabricating the definitive prosthesis in the laboratory [15].

# Tomographic Study

Tomography is used for radiological analysis using approximately  $1\mathrm{mm}$  sections to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction. The anatomy of the zygomatic processes should be analysed, their position and volume, the amount of residual alveolar ridge and the approximate location of implant emergence, as this will provide a reference point for the surgical procedure. The length of the implant to be used is also determined by radiological analysis. Coronal slices are added to conventional CBCT/CT scans to assess the osteomeatal complex and sinus epithelium conditions.

# Surgical Technique (Fig. 6)

The surgical technique has been described by several authors [6, 16]. General anaesthesia usually is used and surgery is performed preferably in a hospital setting (with intraoral infiltrative local anaesthesia in the implant working area to facilitate haemostasis and reduce the amount of analgesia required). Antibiotics are prescribed before, during and after surgery.

A full-thickness palatal-crestal incision is made in the alveolar ridge tissue from first molar to first molar. Two oblique distal releases are made on each side of the incision to allow a wide dissection and to provide full visibility of all the anatomical structures involved, specifically the lateral wall of the maxilla in the area of the maxillary sinus, base of the nostrils and pyriform holes, base of the orbit and infraorbital foramen and rim of the zygomatic process. Additionally, part of the palate is dissected to facilitate access and visibility [15]. The procedure continues by creating an oblique lateral window of  $5 \times 1.5 - 2$  cm in the external wall of the maxillary sinus, in order to detach the sinus membrane, and to provide visual or tactile access to the internal cortex of the zygomatic bone. This window can be made using diamond ball burs or an instrument adapted for surgical ultrasound. Once the Schneiderian membrane has been carefully moved, the field is ready for implant insertion.

The direction, angulation and emergence of the implants are decided based on both prosthetic and anatomical factors (the zygoma and residual maxillary ridge) and should be based on previous radiological planning. The objective is to achieve adequate implant anchorage in the zygomatic bone, with emergence in the maxilla that will allow for ideal prosthetic construction (i.e. as mid-crestal as possible).

First, the most anterior implants are placed with emergence at the level of the canines or lateral incisors; the posterior implants present emergence in the molar or premolar areas. Ideally, implants are evenly distributed in the zygoma bone and positioned so that there is a safe distance between them.

The drilling sequence corresponds to the manufacturer's recommendations [17], progressively increasing the diameter of the drills to avoid overheating the bone and to facilitate insertion of the implant which is cylindrical (of consistent diameter). Drilling begins with a  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  round drill and continues with 2.9- and  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  diameter cylindrical cutters (this depends on the manufacturer and diameter of the implant). The entire drilling process is carried out with abundant irrigation to avoid overheating.

After implant insertion, standard abutments are placed to support the prosthetic rehabilitation. Trans-epithelial abutments are often used to correct potential lack of parallelism between the implants and facilitate screw-retained anchorage of the prosthesis without the need for subsequent implant disconnection. Finally, after placing the abutments, dissected soft tissue is sutured, ensuring adequate union of the margins. The procedure continues with prosthesis connection.

# Prosthetic Phase: (Fig. 7)

During the prosthetic phase, it is preferable if the patient is fully conscious and impressions made only a few hours after surgery. Impressions can also be made while the patient is still unconscious (under general anaesthesia), but this is more difficult technically. Impression copings are attached to the implants or abutments, and the transparent surgical guide can be used for impression transfer, placing and joining it by means of general purpose GC pattern acrylic resin (GC America., Alsip, IL, USA). The same guide is used to register centric relation and other pertinent maxillomandibular relationships. Once an inter-occlusal registration is obtained, and the guide fixed, the space between the impression copings and the surgical guide is filled with fluid silicone. As soon as the material has hardened, the copings are removed in conjunction with the guide and the trans-epithelial abutments are covered with protective caps. The provisional prosthesis is fabricated in the conventional manner, casting a model and connecting laboratory analogues. Six months after implant surgery, the patient is reassessed, checking the osseointegration of the implants and healing of soft tissues before moving forward to fabrication of the definitive prosthesis [18, 19] (Fig. 8).

# Evolution of the Technique: Intra-Sinusal vs. Extra-Sinusal

According to the scientific literature, there is a lack of consensus as to the ideal surgical technique for the placement of zygoma implants. Nevertheless, all of the different approaches share a common goal: To insert the apical part of the implant into zygomatic bone. To do this, all protocols involve similar incisions that are designed to expose the surgical site. Nevertheless, the relationship between the remaining parts of the implant and the sinus membrane, sinus cavity, and lateral wall of the maxilla varies from one technique to another. These different approaches have evolved and developed in order to

- Minimize potential sinus complications.  
- Improve the emergence of the implant at the alveolar crest without compromising the reported high survival rates for this implant.  
- When it comes to the quad zygoma approach, crestal implant emergence is a key goal for fabrication of a satisfactory prosthesis.

There are several alternative approaches to intra-sinusal zygoma implant placement:

(a) The classic exteriorized approach.  
(b) Extra-maxillary approach (described by Maló et al. [20]).  
(c) Extended sinus lift (proposed by Chow et al. [21]).

# Classic Exteriororized Approach

A spherical drill is used for osteotomy, penetrating the residual ridge near the top of the crest from palatal to buccal. The ridge is then transfixed, with the drill emerging in the buccal aspect of the ridge, external to the sinus. No maxillary antrostomy is required in some cases and particularly in patients with a pronounced concavity at the lateral wall of the maxilla. Drilling continues along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the sinus until reaching the lateral portion of the zygomatic bone, which is perforated, penetrating the bone's outer cancellous layer. The platform of the zygomatic implant emerges close to, or over the top of, the crest of the residual alveolar ridge [22].

# Extra-Maxillary Approach (Fig. 9)

In 2008, Maló et al. presented a newly designed, extra-long implant, placed externally to the maxillary bone (implant only accommodated in the maxillary bone) and anchored in the zygomatic bone. This implant is  $5\mathrm{mm}$  wide and is devoid of threads on the coronal two-thirds of the implant. The maxillary bone is prepared to allow the burs direct access to the zygoma's inferior edge, but is not used for implant anchorage, the implant being anchored exclusively in the zygomatic bone. The main conceptual difference between this approach and the others is that no osseointegration is required within the remnant maxillary bone, despite the implant being placed at this level [20].

# Extended Sinus Lift (Fig. 10)

Chow et al. [21] proposed a new approach to zygomatic implant placement to eliminate the risk of maxillary sinusitis associated with the procedure. In this technique, an extended sinus lift is performed with a retained bone window. This aims to keep the sinus membrane intact during the zygomatic implant osteotomy by leaving the bone window attached to the sinus membrane.

The potential advantages of this new method are that:

- It could eliminate the risk of maxillary sinusitis.  
- It could increase zygomatic implant stability by preserving and using as anchorage a portion of alveolar bone and by promoting spontaneous bone formation beneath the elevated maxillary sinus membrane.

After a flap is raised and retracted, an extended rectangular bone window is cut according to the level of the sinus floor and sinus roof. The purpose of this bone window is to allow adequate exposure of the entry and exit points for zygomatic implants at crestal/palatal level and the zygomatic bone, respectively. The bone window is retained in the underlying mucosa while the sinus membrane is slowly and carefully elevated from the sinus walls. The entire osteotomy procedure is completed under direct visual control using the drill sequence described previously.

# Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA) (Fig. 11)

In 2011, Aparicio [23] developed a classification system based on skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest complex and possible implant pathways suited to these categories in relation to different clinical situations. The zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) comprises five groups, named ZAGA 0-4, and is useful for classifying zygomatic implant cases, including operative planning and follow-up.

The authors identified these basic skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest complex and subsequent implant pathways from a sample of 100 patients, whereby ZAGA 0 represented  $15\%$ , ZAGA 1  $49\%$ , ZAGA 2  $20.5\%$ , ZAGA 3  $29\%$ , and ZAGA 4  $6.5\%$  of the patient sample. The authors proposed different implant placement procedures specifically optimal for each of the five different anatomical categories. Any of these ways of zygoma implant placement can be employed when it comes to the quad approach.

# Key Points

- Implants must be well distributed in the maxillary arch to obtain adequate anterior and posterior support.  
- Implant platforms should be located at the level of the maxillary crest with stable anchorage in the zygomatic bone. In order to meet these criteria, any of the approaches described above may be followed.  
- Quad zygoma represents a 'cross arch stabilization system' in which the provisional prosthesis offers a means of immediate post-surgical implant stabilization. Although insertion torque over  $35\mathrm{N / cm}$  for every single implant is always a goal, it is not required mandatory.  
- It is not mandatory for the implant to have vestibular bone at its coronal part: the implants can be 'allocated' to the maxilla. Therefore, in some circumstances, slight bending (but not rotational) movement can be expected for some implants, which will cease as soon as the prosthesis is connected.  
- Stereolithographic templates, either bone-supported or mucosa-supported, have been used to install zygomatic implants in the planned position based on computer-assisted planning. However, there is no effective mechanism to physically control the drilling trajectory for the zygomatic implants. Therefore, deviation between the actual and planned implant position is inevitable, especially when extremely resorbed maxillae are treated with the quad approach. A novel device designed to increase the precision of the guided surgical placement of zygomatic implants has been recently published [21].  
- With the currently available data, guided surgery for quad zygoma should be considered as unavailable or experimental. Some research groups have published data on real-time surgical navigation for zygomatic implant insertion in patients with severely atrophic maxillae. Initial results seem to be promising [24].

# Postoperative Care

Postoperative care is similar to that of any implant surgery with the addition of inhalation and nasal-sinus decongestants. Postoperative follow-up visits are scheduled 1 and 2 weeks after surgery and then at 2, 3 and 6 months after surgery. After 4-6 months of loading, the acrylic resin provisional prosthesis is removed and adequate healing outcomes of implants, hard tissues and soft tissues are checked before fabrication of the definitive prosthesis.

# Complications of the Technique

Possible complications of zygomatic implant surgery requiring attention are as follows:

(a) The technique is susceptible to a learning curve and requires adequate training and experience. Of note, it is possible to penetrate the orbital cavity, especially in the presence of zygomatic bones less than  $1.8 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  wide [6]. Although no serious consequences have been published following this penetration, caution should be taken to avoid it.

(b) Complications associated with implant transmucosal penetration: Periimplant mucositis, peri-implantitis with active pocket establishment, retraction of vestibular peri-implant tissue, implant fracture (very infrequent) and recurrent sinusitis. These complications partly depend on the approach selected for implant placement. In a retrospective study, Aparicio et al. [1, 2] compared the classic intra-sinusal approach with ZAGA. Both procedures obtained similar clinical outcomes with respect to implant survival. However, the ZAGA concept appeared to minimize the risk of maxillary sinus-associated pathology, and also yielded less bulky, more comfortable and easier-to-clean prostheses. With the exteriorized approach, the coronal one-third to two-thirds of the implant is only covered by soft tissue. The relationship between soft tissues and this part of the implant remains controversial, as it may cause inflammation and leads to soft tissue retraction/recession, particularly at the level of the vestibular oral mucosa, when the implant is placed on the crest with no underlying alveolar bone. For this reason, Maló introduced new zygoma implants  $(45^{\circ}$  and  $0^{\circ})$  by eliminating the threads in the coronal two-thirds of the implant in order to improve soft tissue stability around the implant. It has been shown that there is normally attachment of the gingiva at this level and it minimizes the risk of infectious complications [25] (Fig. 12).

(c) Infection at the implant apex followed by a cutaneous fistula (a very infrequent complication). This complication may be treated with systemic antibiotics and minimal intervention to drain and clean the affected area, performing extirpation of the implant apex (via an intra-oral or extra-oral route).  
(d) Sinusitis: The prevalence of sinus pathology associated with zygomatic implant surgery remains controversial. It would appear that the risk can be reduced by performing a meticulous study of the sinuses before implant placement, treating any factors that will predispose the patient to sinus pathology, and by using an extra-sinus approach. When this complication appears, the implant must not be removed (e) Complications related to the transmucosal passage of the abutment/prosthesis complex: Loosening of the transepithelial abutments, loosening of the prosthesis fixation screws, fracture of the prosthetic teeth or prosthetic structure.


# Evidence-Based Quad Zygoma Data

Duarte et al. [15], analysed 12 patients who received 48 zygomatic implants, found that one implant failed to achieve osseointegration by the 6-month follow-up. Stiévenart and Malevez [16] reported a clinical series of 20 patients with extremely resorbed maxillae rehabilitated with four zygomatic implants, 10 of which underwent two-stage implantation procedure and the remaining 10 underwent one-stage implantation procedure. The cumulative survival rate after 40 months was  $96\%$ . A 5-year prospective study [11, 12] obtained high long-term survival rates with very few complications. Furthermore, the oral health-related quality of life of these patients was found to be normal. A recent meta-analysis

[24] showed quad zygoma to be a reliable technique, and prestigious institutions such as the Cochrane review and Foundation for Oral Rehabilitation (FOR) recommend have described this treatment modality [26].

A recent randomized clinical trial comparing immediately loaded cross-arch maxillary prostheses supported by zygomatic implants with conventional implants placed in augmented bone suggests that immediately loaded zygomatic implants are associated with significantly fewer prosthetic and implant failures (one out of 36 patients with zygomatic implants compared with 6 out of 37 patients with conventional implants) as well as a shorter time required for functional loading (1.3 days with zygomatic implants compared with 444.3 days for conventional implants). Even when more complications were reported for zygomatic implants, the evidence compiled to date suggests that they may offer a superior rehabilitation modality for severely atrophic maxillae. Nevertheless, long-term data are needed to confirm or dispute these preliminary observations [10].

# Conclusions

Provided the surgeon has broad clinical experience, the use of four zygomatic implants with an immediate loading protocol is a viable option for rehabilitating patients with severe maxillary atrophy and appears to offer an excellent alternative to bone grafting procedures.
