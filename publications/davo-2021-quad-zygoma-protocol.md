# Introduction and indications

Severe maxillary atrophy is becoming more common because of the aging population (Fig. 1). The use of 4 zygoma implants (quad zygoma), in which 2 implants are placed bilaterally with appropriate anterior and posterior spread and inclination, has been a great advance in the rehabilitation of severe alveolar bone atrophy (Fig. 2). $^{1,2}$

Quad zygoma is indicated as a first-choice treatment in severe maxillary atrophy and as a rescue treatment after bone grafting and implant failure. The indication of using short implants anteriorly combined with a zygoma implant posteriorly remains unclear, and in the authors' experience it seems advisable to perform a quad zygoma whenever the bone loss anteriorly precludes placement of conventional implants of at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in length (Fig. 3). Fixed or removable prostheses can be used for rehabilitation (Fig. 4).

Specific oral contraindications include untreated periodontal disease, poor oral hygiene, restricted mouth opening  $(< 3\mathrm{cm}$  anterior interarch distance), acute or chronic infection/inflammation in the proposed implant sites, acute or chronic sinusitis with obstruction of the osteomeatal complex, and malar bone abnormalities.

# Surgical procedure

Preoperative prosthetic treatment planning is critical for success. Imaging studies include standard orthopantomography, cone beam computed tomography, and the use of an implant planning software with virtual three-dimensional assessment of the implant lengths and appropriate positioning (Fig. 5).

Details of the surgical procedure of quad zygoma have been previously reported.2-5 The operation is performed under intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, with local anesthesia, and administration of antibiotics preoperatively.

Briefly, the main steps include a full-thickness palatal-crestal incision on the alveolar ridge from first molar to first molar, bilateral distal vertical releasing incisions, careful subperiosteal dissection with preservation of the infraorbital neurovascular bundle, pending anatomy and oblique osteotomy in the lateral wall of the maxilla adjacent to the sinus with elevation of the Schneiderian membrane, preparation of the osteotomy site and a drilling sequence according to the manufacturer's instructions, placement of the implants, placement of the abutments, and flap coaptation to provide a collar of keratinized tissue around the implants.

Abundant irrigation at the crest and the apex of the malar bone is crucial to prevent overheating. Extraoral palpation of the malar bone while drilling the osteotomy is advisable.

In relation to positioning of the zygoma implants, the goal is to place 2 implants into a finite space with appropriate prosthetic emergence and as midcrestal as possible. This placement can be achieved in most cases given the height and width measurements of a typical malar bone. It should be noted that the anterior implants are placed first emerging at the level of the canines or lateral incisors, followed by the posterior implants emerging in the molar or premolar areas. The position of the implants is inside or outside the sinus depending on the patient's anatomy, specially the curvature of the lateral wall of the maxilla. Crestal implant emergence is highly recommended for the design of the appropriate prosthesis.

# Surgical techniques of placement of 4 zygoma implants

The ideal surgical technique has not been established. Minimization of potential sinus complications and tissue retraction at the crest of the ridge as well as improvement of the implant emergence at the alveolar crest without compromising survival rates are the main objectives of the different surgical protocols. The following techniques have been described and can be used to achieve the most appropriate anatomically guided placement of the implants. $^2$

# Classic Branemark approach

The implant passes through the maxillary sinus, and the prosthetic platform is on the palatal crest of the alveolus. The lateral antrostomy window perforates through the sinus allowing direct visualization of the sinus roof (Fig. 6).

# Sinus slot approach

The implant follows the path of the slot made through the zygomatic buttress, with minimal invasion into the sinus. This approach involves a more crestal position of the prosthetic platform.

# Classic exteriorized approach

A spherical drill is used for the osteotomy penetrating the residual ridge near the top of the crest from palatal to buccal. The ridge is then transfixed with the drill emerging in the buccal aspect of the ridge external to the sinus.[7,8] A maxillary antrostomy is not always necessary. Drilling continues along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the sinus until reaching the lateral portion of the zygomatic bone, which is perforated, surpassing the bone's outer cortex. Implants are placed outside the sinus (Fig. 7).

# Extramaxillary approach

The lateral wall of the maxilla is prepared by design of a groove to allow burs direct access to the body of the zygoma.[9,10] The implant is anchored exclusively in the zygomatic bone and allocated in this groove.

# Extended sinus lift

To maintain the integrity of the maxillary sinus membrane during osteotomy preparation, an extended sinus lift is performed in which the bone window is retained. This technique potentially eliminates the risk of sinusitis and may increase implant stability by promoting bone formation adjacent to the elevated sinus membrane and bone window (Fig. 8).

# Zygoma anatomy-guided approach

Zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) is a classification system of 5 categories (from 0 to 4) based on the skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest complex, which drive the implant pathways and the corresponding implant placement technique.[12] This technique/approach is described in detail in a preceding article in this issue. In fact, whether the implant runs completely or partially in the sinus, lateral to the sinus, or lateral to the maxilla is entirely dependent on the patient's anatomic characteristics. Quad zygoma approach is typically reserved for severe maxillary atrophy (ZAGA 3 or 4), and frequently a significant portion of the implants will be exteriorized or extramaxillary. Anatomic features of ZAGA 3 include a concave anterior maxillary wall with maintenance of the horizontal dimension, whereas in ZAGA 4, the maxillary wall exhibits extreme vertical atrophy and the horizontal dimension is significantly reduced (Fig. 9).

Key points applicable to all surgical procedures are as follows:

- Implants must be well distributed in the maxillary arch to obtain adequate anterior and posterior support.
- Implants should be positioned on the maxillary crest with stable anchorage in the zygomatic bone.
- Quad zygoma represents a cross-arch stabilization system in which the provisional prosthesis offers implant stabilization immediately after surgery. Although insertion torque greater than 35 Ncm for each implant is ideal, it is not mandatory.
Good band of keratinized tissue surrounding the implants.
- Given that in many scenarios there is lack of implant integration at the crest, a slight bending (but not

rotational) movement can be expected with some implants. This ceases as soon as the prosthesis is connected.

# Prosthetic Phase

Following abutment placement, impression copings are attached to the implant abutments and the transparent surgical guide is used for impression transfer. The implants are joined by acrylic resin. The same guide is used to register occlusion and jaw relationship. Once the occlusion has been registered and the guide secured, the space between the impression copings and the surgical guide is filled with fluid silicone. As soon as the material has hardened, the copings are removed in conjunction with the guide and the transepithelial abutments are covered with protective caps. The provisional prosthesis is fabricated in the conventional manner casting a model and connecting laboratory analogs. Another technique makes use of the patient's denture. If the patient has a conventional denture that fulfills all the prosthetic requirements, this may be used as a guide for the surgical template and also may be used in the conversion process to an all-acrylic bridge for immediate loading. Two to four of the titanium copings are picked up in the mouth. An impression is then made using an impression tray. The last implants are picked up on the model (if less than 4 were initially picked up), and the intaglio surface is filled in making use of the model to ensure an appropriate cleansable convex surface. After 4 to 6 months of loading, the acrylic resin provisional prosthesis is removed to assess implant osseointegration and the status of the soft tissues before fabrication of the definitive prosthesis.


Postoperatively, analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents are administered as needed, and 1-week antibiotic treatment is recommended. Follow-up visits are scheduled at 1 and 2 weeks after surgery and subsequently at 2, 3, and 6 months (Fig. 10).

# Complications

Appropriate training and experience, careful preoperative planning, and in-depth anatomic knowledge are essential requirements to prevent complications. These include penetration into the orbital cavity (particularly in zygomatic bones  $< 1.8 - 2$  cm in height), $^{2,13}$  peri-implant mucositis, periimplantitis, retraction of buccal/labial peri-implant tissue, $^{14}$  infection at the implant apex, sinusitis, oroantral communication, paresthesia/dysesthesia, and implant fracture.

Inflammation and tissue retraction may occur when the implant is placed on the crest without being surrounded by bone. Zygoma implants without threads in the coronal two-thirds of the implant may minimize soft tissue complications in these scenarios. In addition, having a good band of keratinized tissue surrounding the prosthetic platform will also minimize soft tissue complications.

Infection of the implant apex appears as an extraoral swelling just lateral to the malar bone with or without a cutaneous fistula. This complication may be avoided by ensuring appropriate implant length with the apex engaging the outer zygoma cortex.

Sinusitis is a common complication, the risk of which can be reduced by meticulous preoperative assessment of the status of the sinus. The exteriorized or extramaxillary approach or the extended sinus lift approach can be used in selected cases.

Oroantral communication may result from thin or virtually nonexistent alveolar bone, from slight overpreparation of the osteotomy site, or from bone loss over time at the alveolar

crest. Caution in preparing the osteotomy in the alveolar area is crucial. Oroantral communication may be treated with the buccal fat pad or bone morphogenetic protein. $^{15,16}$

Temporary or permanent altered sensation in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve or loss of feeling over the check may be associated with intraoperative trauma of the neurovascular bundle and the zygomaticofacial nerve, respectively.

Fracture of the implant due to inappropriate implant positioning resulting in overloading and biomechanical failure is rare.

Prosthetic complications include loosening of the transepithelial abutments or the prosthesis fixation screws, fracture of screws, and fracture of the prosthetic teeth or prosthetic structure (Figs. 11 and 12).

New designs of implants have been introduced during the last few years to try to overcome some of these complications. Further clinical studies are needed (Fig. 13).

# Evidence of the quad zygoma technique

There is still little evidence of the quad zygoma technique.

In 2007, Duarte and colleagues[17] reported a series of 12 patients in whom 48 zygomatic implants were placed followed by immediate loading. Osseointegration failure occurred in one implant at 6-month follow-up, and osseointegration was maintained for the reaming implants at 30 months. In 2010, Stievenart and Malevez[4] achieved a cumulative survival rate of  $96\%$  at 40 months in 20 patients rehabilitated with 4 zygomatic implants (2-stage procedure in 10, one-stage procedure in 10).

In a 5-year prospective study, Davo and Pons obtained high survival rates for implants (98.5%) and prostheses (100%), with few complications, and normal quality of life even with the passage of time.

In the meta-analysis of Wang and colleagues, it was concluded that quad zygoma is a reliable procedure for maxillary rehabilitation, with a weighted mean survival rate of  $96.7\%$ .

In the systematic review and meta-analysis of Aboul-Hosn Centenero and colleagues,[19] no significant differences in survival and failure rates were seen between 2 zygomatic implants combined with regular implants compared with the quad zygoma.

A recent randomized trial compared immediately loaded cross-arch maxillary prostheses supported by zygomatic implants with implants placed in augmented bone. The immediately loaded zygomatic implants were associated with significantly fewer prosthetic and implant failures, as well as with a shorter time for functional loading.[20,21]

Complications were reported in all studies. Surgeons should be well trained, and all technical precautions should be taken. In addition, patients should be aware of the potential adverse outcomes associated with the quad zygoma technique.

Although results of the different surgical quad zygoma techniques have not been compared in prospective randomized clinical trials, in our opinion and, in agreement with others, it seems advisable to select the most appropriate surgical approach based on individual anatomic characteristics, the ZAGA concept. To date, stereolithographic templates, either bone-supported or mucosa-supported templates, have been used to insert zygomatic implants in the designated positions based on computer-assisted planning. However, there is no effective mechanism yet to physically control the drilling trajectory and ensure precision of placement. A novel device that increases the precision of guided surgical placement of zygomatic implants has recently been designed, but, at present, guided zygoma surgery is still in the early stages of development.[22] The initial results of surgical navigation systems for zygomatic implant placement in patients with severe maxillary atrophy are promising.[23]

# Summary

The quad zygoma is an efficient procedure for rehabilitation of the severely atrophic maxilla, but must be performed by highly experienced surgeons for successful outcomes and minimization of complications. The quad zygoma technique enables implants to be placed in an alternate anchorage site eliminating the need for more complex reconstructive surgeries of the maxilla.

# Clinics care points

- Quad zygoma is a cross-arch stabilization system with ideal placement of anterior implants in the area of lateral and canine teeth and posterior implants in the area of premolar and molar teeth.
- Adequate placement must to maintain appropriate distance between ipsilateral implants within the body of zygoma.
- Ideal placement aims to minimize sinus involvement and midcrestal position of the implant platform. Presence of adequate band of keratinized tissue is required for appropriate healing and function.
- Minor bending at the crest may be expected with some implants. Provisional prosthesis provides implant stabilization thus facilitates osseointegration.
- Consideration of individual patient anatomy with help of 3D printed models serves as means of verifying implant placement direction and implant length.
