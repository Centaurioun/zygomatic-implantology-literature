# Abstract

The "quad zygoma" concept involves the insertion of four zygomatic implants, with adequate anteroposterior spread and correct inclination for the distribution of forces, as a means of rehabilitating patients presenting insufficient bone height in the anterior and posterior maxilla. The technique has been clinically tested using protocols for immediate function, obtaining promising short- and long-term results. Non-alveolar implants offer a predictable alternative to bone augmentation techniques in situations of severe alveolar atrophy. Other alternatives, like bone grafting procedures present certain complications derived from the technique itself and from the waiting times of the patients, which make alternatives such as zygomatic implants take more strength as a choice in patients with severe maxillary atrophies. Based on this, and in the literature and clinical experience, the use of four zygomatic implants with an immediate loading protocol is a viable option for rehabilitating patients with severe maxillary atrophy and appears to offer an excellent alternative to bone grafting procedures.

# Quick reference/description

Loss of teeth causes a series of changes in the alveolar bone and ultimately leads to severe atrophy and reduced bone volume. The 'quad zygoma' approach, also known as 'all on four' approach, involves the placement of four zygomatic implants for the rehabilitation of patients with severe maxillary atrophy. It is considered an excellent alternative to bone grafting procedures and provides favorable outcomes with immediate loading protocols.


# Indications

Teeth loss eventually causes severe atrophy and reduced bone volume, making dental implant placement using traditional techniques quite difficult. Severe atrophy of the maxilla has become prevalent due to the increased life expectancy of the patients. The increasing demand for treatment among elderly patients has made the rehabilitation of atrophied maxillae necessary.

Placement of non-alveolar implants is a predictable approach for the management of extensive alveolar atrophy. Implant insertion in the bone of different embryological origins has higher survival rates. Zygomatic implants have been proposed for holistic management of patients with severe maxillary atrophy due to congenital, traumatic or tumoral pathologies. These implants utilize alternative bone structures and processes for stabilization. Zygomatic implants can be used alone or in combination with intra-alveolar implants to support a prosthesis.

The following indications are to be considered for the quad zygoma approach (Fig. 1):

- Rehabilitation of a severely atrophic edentulous maxilla with a fixed prosthesis in case of:
- Inadequate bone volume for traditional endosseous dental implants across the arch
- Adequate bone for the placement of only two short implants in the anterior region
- Bone atrophy due to tumoral, traumatic or congenital pathologies
- If residual bone height coronal to the maxillary sinus is less than  $2 - 4\mathrm{mm}$
- If the placement of conventional implants of at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  in length is not possible in the anterior maxilla

# Procedure

Quad zygoma is considered a reliable approach for the rehabilitation of atrophic maxillae by prestigious institutions like the Foundation for Oral Rehabilitation and the Cochrane review. Immediately loaded cross-arch maxillary prostheses supported by zygomatic implants are shown to be associated with lesser prosthetic and implant failures and shorter time requirement for functional loading. It is a 'prosthetically driven' approach that involves complete prosthetic preparation prior to implant insertion. The prosthesis largely governs surgical and treatment planning. It involves scanning (ideally using a double CT scan) of the patient and the prosthesis to:

- Design a surgical guide
Prepare a provisional prosthesis

# Preoperative prosthetic preparation

Planning and preparation of a prosthesis is performed using conventional procedures like (Fig. 2):

- Consideration of determining factors like the position of the midline, smile curve or line, vertical dimension of occlusion, preferred size of artificial teeth and vestibular or buccal corridors
- Accounting of factors like restoration of masticatory function, esthetics and speech or phonation
- After fabricating the provisional prosthesis, a surgical guide with palatal support is also fabricated over the teeth arrangement and utilized for guidance during implant surgery. The guide is made of transparent acrylic resin and is also used to demarcate the implant positions while fabricating the definitive prosthesis.

# Tomographic study

Radiological analysis is performed using tomography. Sections of about  $1\mathrm{mm}$  are used for three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 3). It is used to analyze the anatomy of the zygomatic bones including their volume and position, the amount of residual alveolar ridge and the approximate site of implant emergence, as it provides a reference point for future surgery. It also aids in determining the desired implant length.

Sinus epithelium conditions and the osteomeatal complex can be evaluated by adding coronal slices to conventional CBCT/CT scans.

# Surgical technique

Many authors have described the surgical technique for quad zygoma. The surgery is preferably performed under general anesthesia in a hospital setting (Fig. 4). Adjunctive intraoral infiltrative local anesthesia is administered in the implant working region to promote hemostasis and decrease the required amount of analgesia. Administration of antibiotics before, during and after surgery is mandatory.

A full-thickness palatal-crestal incision is made in the tissue overlying the alveolar ridge extending from the first molar on the right side to the first molar on the left side. On either sides of the incision, two oblique distal releases are made to facilitate a wide dissection and provide a complete view of all involved anatomical structures, like lateral wall of the maxilla in the region of the maxillary sinus, rim of the zygomatic process, infraorbital foramen, base of the orbit, base of the nostrils and pyriform holes (Fig. 4a). A part of the palate is also dissected to improve visibility and access.

To detach the sinus membrane, an oblique lateral window of  $5 \times 1.5 - 2$  cm is created in the external wall of the maxillary sinus using diamond ball burs or an instrument adapted for surgical ultrasound (Fig. 4b). It also facilitates visual or tactile access to the internal cortex of zygomatic bone. The site is ready for implant placement after meticulous shifting of the Schneiderian membrane.

The anatomic and prosthetic factors (residual maxillary ridge and zygoma) determine the angulation, direction and emergence of implants. It should also depend on prior radiological planning. Implant planning aims to accomplish sufficient implant anchorage in the zygomatic bone and appropriate emergence in the maxilla. This facilitates ideal mid crestal prosthetic construction.

Even distribution and positioning of the implants in the zygomatic bone is essential to ensure safe distance between them.


During implant surgery, the manufacturer's recommendations of drilling sequence should be followed. The diameter of the drills should be increased progressively to prevent bone overheating and aid the placement of cylindrical implants of consistent diameter. The drilling sequence includes initiation with a  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  round drill followed by cylindrical cutters of 2.9 and  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  diameter as per the manufacturer and implant diameter. Copious irrigation is mandatory throughout the drilling process.

Standard abutments are placed over the implants to support the prosthesis. Transepithelial abutments help to rectify the potential absence of parallelism between the implants and also assist the screw-retained anchorage of the prosthesis with no requirement of implant disconnection. Suturing of dissected soft tissues is performed after placement of the abutments to confirm the appropriate union of the margins (Fig. 4i, j).

# Prosthetic phase

To carry out the study, an immediate loading protocol was used in the first 48 postoperative hours. The type of prosthesis used was a resin-reinforced provisional prosthesis with a preformed metal structure, screwed using Multi-Unit type fixings (Nobel Biocare, Kloten, Switzerland). These abutments were placed immediately after surgery and were not removed at any time, since the prosthesis was loaded within  $48\mathrm{h}$  and during that time, a passivity and aesthetic test was performed at  $24\mathrm{h}$ . Multi-unit abutments are not removed to facilitate placement in trials and to avoid unnecessary disconnections.

During the first  $48\mathrm{h}$ , the patient wore multi-unit healing abutments, thus avoiding soft tissue collapse.

In cases where angulation had to be corrected, an angled abutment was used to make the correction. All the pillars were fixed with a minimum torque of  $10\mathrm{Nw}$  recommended by the manufacturer.

Impression taking was performed immediately after surgery using open tray impression posts and direct silicone technique. The connection of the impression abutments was made on the transepithelial abutments, using specific abutments for multi-unit.

The impression abutments were splinted using silk and light-curing resin to achieve the highest possible stability.

The bite registration was performed using wax previously preformed in the laboratory, to be as accurate as possible. A completely conscious patient is preferred for the prosthetic phase. Ideally, impressions should be made only a few hours following surgery. Making impressions in an unconscious patient is technically difficult. Impression copings are connected to implants or abutments. A transparent surgical guide can aid in impression transfer, placement and joining using general-purpose
Fig. 5 Making impressions using the surgical guide

GC pattern acrylic resin (GC America., Alsip, IL, USA) (Fig. 5a). Registration of centric relation and other important maxillomandibular relationships is done using the same guide. Following inter-occlusal registration and fixation of the surgical guide, fluid silicone is used to fill the gap between the guide and the impression copings (Fig. 5b). After the silicone sets, the guide and the copings are removed, and protective caps are placed on the trans-epithelial abutments (Fig. 5c).

Fabrication of the provisional prosthesis is performed in a conventional manner by casting of a model and connection of laboratory analogues (Fig. 6a-c). Six months following implant placement, the patient is re-evaluated for implant osseointegration and soft tissue healing before fabrication of the definitive prosthesis (Fig. 6d-f).

# Evolution of the technique: intra-sinusal vs. extra-sinusal

There is no ideal surgical approach for the placement of zygomatic implants. All surgical techniques aim to insert the apical portion of the implant in the zygomatic bone. The different surgical protocols follow similar incision designs for surgical site exposure. Every technique has a different association between the remaining implant parts and the lateral wall of the maxilla, the sinus membrane and the sinus cavity. The development and evolution of these techniques have occurred to:
Fig.6 a-c Provisional prosthesis. d-f Definitive prosthesis

- Minimize potential sinus complications
- Improve implant emergence at the alveolar crest without compromising the survival of the implant
- Ensure crestal implant emergence with the quad zygoma technique for fabrication of a satisfactory prosthesis

The alternative techniques to intra-sinusal zygoma implant placement are:

- Classic exteriorized approach
- Extra-maxillary approach (described by Maló et al.)
- Extended sinus lift (proposed by Chow et al.)

# Classic exteriorized approach

In the classic exteriorized approach, the osteotomy is performed by penetrating the alveolar ridge close to the top of the crest from palatal to buccal using a spherical drill. The ridge is transfixed as the drill emerges on the buccal side of the ridge, external to the sinus. Maxillary antrostomy is not needed in some cases like a prominent concavity at the lateral wall of the maxilla. Drilling of the bone is continued along the outer side of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus up to the lateral portion of the zygomatic bone. This bone is then perforated up to the outer cancellous layer. The platform of the zygomatic implant emerges close to or over the top of the crest of the residual alveolar ridge.

# Extra-maxillary approach

Maló et al. introduced a new design of an extra-long implant having a width of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in 2008. The coronal two thirds of this implant is devoid of threads. It is placed external to the maxillary bone and is anchored in the zygomatic bone. As the implant is supposed to be anchored in the zygomatic bone, the maxillary bone is prepared to permit direct access for the burs to the inferior edge of the zygoma

(Fig. 7). The distinguishing factor between this technique and the others is that osseointegration in the residual maxillary bone is not required, even though the implant is placed at this level.

# Extended sinus lift

A new technique of zygomatic implant placement for eliminating the risk of maxillary sinusitis was proposed by Chow et al. This approach involves an extended sinus lift and a retained bone window to maintain an intact sinus membrane during the zygomatic implant osteotomy by keeping the bone window attached to the sinus membrane (Fig. 8). The potential benefits of this technique are:

- Elimination of the risk of maxillary sinusitis
- Increased stability of the zygomatic implant by preserving and using a part of alveolar bone as anchorage and by facilitating spontaneous bone formation below the elevated sinus membrane

As per the level of the sinus roof and floor, an extended rectangular bone window is cut after elevation and retraction of a flap. The bone window facilitates sufficient exposure of the entry and exit sites for the zygomatic implants at the palatal or crestal level and the zygoma, respectively. The bone window is retained in the underlying mucosa. Simultaneously, the sinus membrane is gradually and meticulously elevated from the sinus walls. The entire osteotomy is performed under direct visual control.

# Zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA)

A classification system depending on the skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest complex and possible implant pathways befitting these categories (b) (c) (d) (e)

Fig. 9 Zygoma anatomical guide approach according to the different clinical situations was developed by Aparicio in 2011. The zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) consists of five groups (ZAGA 0-4) (Fig. 9). It is helpful in classifying cases of zygomatic implants, especially for operative planning and reassessments. The authors have proposed different procedures of implant insertion particularly suited for each of the five distinguished categories. In case of the quad zygoma approach, any of these ways of zygomatic implant insertion can be implemented.


# Postoperative care

The postoperative care following zygomatic implant placement is the same as after any implant surgery. Additionally, inhalation and nasal-sinus decongestants are prescribed. Recommended postoperative follow-up visits are at 1 and 2 weeks after surgery followed by visits at 2, 3 and 6 months after surgery. About 4-6 months after implant loading, the provisional prosthesis is removed. Healing of hard and soft tissues and osseointegration of implants are evaluated prior to fabricating the definitive prosthesis.

# Key points of consideration for the quad zygoma approach

- Even distribution of the implants in the maxillary arch is essential for adequate anterior and posterior support
- Location of implant platforms should be at the level of the bony crest with stable anchorage in zygomatic bone
- Quad zygoma depicts a 'cross arch stabilization system' that provides immediate postoperative implant stabilization in the form of the provisional prosthesis. Ideally, the insertion torque should be above  $35\mathrm{N/cm}$  for every single implant but it is not mandatory
- Presence of vestibular bone at the coronal portion is not mandatory for the implant. The implants can be 'allocated' to the maxilla. In some cases, implants can exhibit slight bending (not rotational) movement that will stop after connecting the prosthesis
- Computer-assisted planning and mucosa-supported or bone-supported stereolithographic templates can be used to place zygomatic implants. As there is no effective mechanism for physically controlling the drilling trajectory for zygomatic implants, deviation between the planned and actual implant position is unavoidable. It is more prominent in severely resorbed maxillae being treated

with the quad approach. A novel device has been designed and advocated to improve the precision of guided surgical placement of zygomatic implants.

- Real-time surgical navigation for zygomatic implant placement in patients with severe maxillary atrophy has shown favorable outcomes.

# Pitfalls and complications

- The quad zygoma approach has a steep learning curve requiring sufficient training and experience. If the zygomatic bones are less than  $1.8 - 2\mathrm{cm}$  wide, penetration of the orbital cavity during implant placement can occur.
- Implant transmucosal penetration can cause complications like peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis with active pockets, retraction of vestibular peri-implant tissues, recurrent sinusitis and rarely, implant fracture. The approach chosen for implant insertion is a major contributing factor for these complications. The ZAGA technique can reduce the risk of maxillary sinus-associated pathology. It also results in less bulky, more comfortable and hygienic prostheses. The coronal one-third to two-thirds of the implant surface has only soft tissue coverage when placed using the exteriorized approach. The association of the soft tissues with the implant can cause inflammation and soft tissue retraction/recession, especially at the level of the vestibular mucosa, if the implant is placed on the alveolar crest without underlying bone. This led to the introduction of new zygoma implants  $(45^{\circ}$  and  $0^{\circ})$  by Maló. The implants do not have threads in the coronal two-thirds to promote peri-implant soft tissue stability. Gingival attachment is normally seen at this level, which decreases the risk of infectious complications.
- Maxillary sinusitis is another complication of quad zygoma and can be recurrent.
- Development of infection at the implant apex leading to a cutaneous fistula is a rare complication of the quad zygoma technique.
- The complications associated with transmucosal passage of the abutment/prosthesis complex are loosening of the transepithelial abutments or prosthesis fixation screws, fracture of the prosthetic teeth or structure.
