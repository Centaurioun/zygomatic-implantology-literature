# Abstract

Introduction: The objective of the study was to provide long-term clinical outcomes and complications in the severely atrophic edentulous maxillae treated by means of the quad zygoma protocol (QZP) using the Anatomy-Guided Approach (AGA).

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients with severely atrophic edentulous maxilla and insufficient bone height and width in the anterior and posterior regions bilaterally, who underwent rehabilitation with the QZP between May 2006 and December 2021. All patients were followed for at least 1 year. All zygomatic implants (ZIs) were placed by the same surgeon. The primary endpoint of the study was the implant survival rate. Secondary endpoints were implant success rate, prosthesis success rate, complications, and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life using the OHIP-14 questionnaire.

Results: A total of 56 patients (men 16, women 40) with 224 ZIs (Nobel Biocare,  $n = 204$ ; Straumann,  $n = 16$ ; Southern Implant,  $n = 4$ ) placement were included with a mean follow-up period  $8.8 \pm 3.9$  years (range, 1.2-17.0). The survival (success) rate was  $97.7\%$ . Five ZIs in four patients failed. The mean time between implant placement and failure was 8.6 years (range, 0.5-13.3). All patients received immediate loading with acrylic prosthesis. The successful rates for the definitive prosthesis were  $98.2\%$ . Forty-two patients received posterior cantilever for rehabilitation of fixed definitive prosthesis. Local orofacial inflammation  $(35.7\%)$  and Sinusitis  $(12.5\%)$  were the most common complications, occurring at a mean follow-up of 10.0 (range, 4.2-14.9) and 10.3 (range, 4.3-16.2) years, respectively. In 48 patients, the mean score of

the OHIP-14 questionnaire was  $1.7 \pm 2.6$  with the follow-up period of 9.0 ± 4.1 years.

Conclusions: The rehabilitation of severely atrophic edentulous maxilla using the QZP has shown a predictable and high survival rate in the long term. The implementation of an immediate loading protocol offers potential benefits in stabilizing ZIs with cross-arch stabilization. Moreover, the use of a posterior cantilever in reconstruction can effectively establish functional occlusion through well-distributed ZIs, eliminating the need for additional implant placement.

# Summary Box

# What is known

- Rehabilitation of edentulous patients with severely atrophic maxilla can represent a clinical challenge due to limited bone availability and treatment alternatives, particularly difficulties for using standard implants and complexity of bone augmentation procedures.
- The quad zygoma protocol (QZP) that involves placing two zygomatic implants (ZIs) on each side of the zygoma, with a well-distributed anterior-posterior configuration that enables immediate functionality after surgery is a feasible and effective option, but there is limited data on the long-term outcomes.

# What this study adds

This is the first study that presents long-term outcomes and complications in the QZP with 224 ZIs in 56 patients with severely atrophic maxilla.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Rehabilitation of extremely resorbed maxillae poses a difficult challenge with serious limitations for conventional implant placement and frequent complications, morbidity, and a high rate of resorption with time for extensive bone grafting reconstruction. Zygomatic implants (ZIs) have been considered a valuable treatment option for rehabilitation of severely atrophic edentulous maxillae with a high survival rate. $^{1}$  The consensus report of the International Team for Implantology (ITI) on  $\mathsf{ZI}^{2}$  includes the definition and indications of quad zygoma (two ZIs bilaterally placed) as an alternative when conventional implants cannot be placed in the posterior and anterior maxillary regions, and grafting alternatives are not feasible, predictable, or preferred by patients. Moreover, as stated in the consensus, this definition is based on evidence reported in the literature. $^{2}$  The quad zygoma approach avoids complex massive bone grafting in cases of full-arch severely resorbed maxilla. $^{3,4}$  It involves placing two ZIs on each side of the zygomatic bone, with a well-distributed anterior-posterior configuration that enables immediate functionality after surgery.

The quad zygoma protocol (QZP), was initially described in 2007 by Duarte and colleagues<sup>5</sup> and further detailed by Stiévenart and

Malevez $^{6}$  in 2010, based on the Brænemark's intrasinus procedure. This protocol was subsequently followed by the clinical series conducted by Davó and colleagues, $^{7-9}$  using the Anatomy-Guided Approach (AGA), which yielded high success rates. According to this protocol, $^{4}$  the position of ZI is determined by the anatomical circumstances of the Maxillary-Zygomatic complex for each individual patient, with the aim of achieving a crestal emergence of the ZI, thus aligning with prosthetic goals. $^{7}$  The specific position of the ZI can vary, either inside or outside the sinus, depending on factors such as the curvature of the maxillary wall and the extent of alveolar atrophy. This position can be categorized as intra-sinus, lateral wall of the maxilla, or extra-sinus. A recent systematic review of 24 studies compared the original surgical (Brænemark's) technique (OST) and AGA in severely atrophic edentulous maxillae rehabilitation, showing high implant survival rates (90.3%–100%) and higher rates of complications in the OST as compared with AGA, including sinusitis 9.3% versus 4.4%, soft tissue infection 7.5% versus 4.3%, paresthesia 10.8% versus 4.3%, oroantral fistulas 4.6% versus 0.6%, and direct surgical complications 6.9% versus 1.6% after a variable follow-up period usually limited to the short term. $^{10}$  On the other hand, 1-year post-loading results of a randomized controlled trial showed that immediately loaded ZIs were associated with fewer prosthetic and implant failures as well as time needed to functional loading versus conventional implants placed in augmented bone. $^{11}$  Also, prosthetic reconstruction in both function and anatomy experienced by patients treated with ZI rehabilitation is achieved through a less invasive surgical intervention. $^{12}$


Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) following rehabilitation with ZI-supported reconstruction using specific outcome scales to oral health $^{13}$  have gained increasing interest. $^{9,14}$  Although subjective evaluation of treatment and quality of life have shown positive and promising results, there is a lack of studies of quad ZIs with large sample sizes assessing survival rates, complications, and oral health-related quality of life. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies with 166 patients with edentulism and severely atrophic maxillae in whom quad ZIs were inserted, a pooled implant survival rate was  $98\%$  (95% confidence interval [CI] 97% to  $99\%$ ). $^{15}$  However, it should be noted that most of the studies only provided short- to mid-term follow-up data. $^{5-9}$

The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the clinical outcomes, complications, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) associated with QZP over a long follow-up period of up to 17 years. Having such long-term data could enhance the robustness of the existing evidence of the clinical effectiveness of quad ZIs inserted in patients with severely atrophic edentulous maxillae.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

# 2.1 Design and study population

This was a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients who underwent rehabilitation with the QZP between May 2006 and December 2021 in the Department of Implantology and Maxillofacial Surgery of Medimar International Hospital in Alicante, Spain. The follow-up period ended in July 2023. All patients were followed for at least 1 year. The manuscript was prepared according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE guidelines). The principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki on clinical research were adhered to, and approval from the review board of the hospital to use human data for the study was obtained. Signed written informed consent was obtained from all individuals who participated in the study prior to the surgical procedures.

Inclusion criteria were severe atrophic edentulous maxilla with insufficient bone height and width in the anterior and posterior regions bilaterally; maxillary posterior bone height ranging between 1 and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in the premolar and molar regions (classes IV-VI of the Cawood and Howell classification) $^{17}$ ; insufficient bone width in the anterior maxillary area to place regular diameter implants without additional extensive bone grafting or insufficient bone height for regular length implants  $(8\mathrm{mm})$  even with a titled approach; totally edentulous patients with history of unsuccessful bone grafting or failure to conventional implants; and a minimum  $15\mathrm{mm}$  width of the zygomatic bone necessary for the placement of two ZIs. $^{2}$  The measurement of zygoma width was performed making a line passed through the most lower point on the infraorbital margin and a line passed through the most lateral point on the orbital margin. The intersection point angular bisector of these two lines and extended a line from orbital margin to infra zygoma was measured as the width of zygoma bone. Exclusion criteria included general contraindications for implant surgery; history of radiation therapy in the head and neck (>70 Gy); current heavy smoking (>20 cigarettes/day); restricted mouth opening (<3 cm vertical distance); and untreated maxillary acute and chronic sinusitis.


# 2.2 Preoperative evaluation

A panoramic and computed tomography (CT) or cone beam CT (CBCT) scan were acquired for diagnosing the degree of maxillary atrophy and prosthetically driven planning with a dedicated software (Nobel Clinician, Nobel Biocare AB, Sweden) were performed (Figure 1). The degree of atrophic maxilla was categorized according to the Cawood and Howell classification. $^{17}$  The occlusal relationships, mouth opening, intermaxillary distance, and status of the mandibular dentition were assessed on physical examination. Patients diagnosed with periodontitis in the lower jaw, in whom the affected teeth were to remain in the mouth, were treated with antibiotics preoperatively. Patients diagnosed with sinusitis were treated by an otorhinolaryngologist. The diagnosis of sinusitis was based on characteristic clinical manifestations, which may include facial pain/pressure, facial congestion/fullness, nasal obstruction, hyposmia, nasal purulence, maxillary dental pain, fever, halitosis, otalgia, etc., combined with anterior rhinoscopy, transillumination of the sinuses, and other microbiological or imaging studies at discretion of the otorhinolaryngologist specialist. Complete symptom resolution was required before proceeding with the implant therapy.

All smokers were educated on the possible negative impact of smoking on the success of treatment. Every patient received an acrylic diagnosis provisional prosthesis for evaluating the implant position and esthetics overview. The planning of ZI was following the AGA for the prosthetically driven implant $^{7-9}$  (Figure 2).

# 2.3 Surgical protocol

All ZIs were placed by the same surgeon (R.D.). The zygomatic area was exposed via a mid-crestal/palatal incision followed by vertical releasing incisions along the posterior part of the infra-zygomatic crest and anterior to the surgical site. The intraoral coronal entry points of the anterior and posterior implants should be at or near the top of the remaining alveolar crest at the level of lateral incisor/canine region and the second premolar/first molar region, respectively. The extraoral apical points of the anterior and posterior implants were on the surface of zygomatic bone, and implants were kept contactless. The protocol for ZI insertion followed the AGA approach with three trajectories corresponding to different relationship between ZI body and sinus wall (intrasinus, extrasinus, or lateral wall of the maxilla pathway).
FIGURE 1 The planning of quad zygome protocol (QZP) was performed in a software based on three dimensional images from patient's preoperative computed tomography (CT) and/or cone beam CT (CBCT).
FIGURE 2 The surgical planning for the Quad Zygoma was performed by following the Anatomy-Guided Approach (AGA) for every implant. The trajectories of the AGA include: intra-sinus (A), in the wall of the maxilla (B), and extra-sinus (C).

Four ZI systems were used, including Nobel Branemark TiUnite system (Nobel Biocare AB, Sweden), NobelZygoma 45 (Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden), Straumann ZAGA zygomatic implant (Straumann, Switzerland), and Southern Implant system (Southern Implants Ibérica, Barcelona, Spain). A series of drills was used to penetrate the alveolar process and the zygomatic bone as well as a depth indicator to assess the correct length of the implant. The drilling sequence included only three burs: a  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  spherical bur and cylindrical burs in  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  (Nobel Biocare, Straumann and Southern Implant) and  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  diameter (Nobel Biocare). The drilling was performed under constant water irrigation to prevent overheating. For the intrasinus trajectory, the sinus membrane was carefully dissected through a small lateral bone window to try to keep the integrity.[18] ZIs were engaged at the zygomatic bone level, and any critical anatomical structure, such as orbital cavity and the infra-temporal fossa was avoided. Implants were normally inserted with a handpiece, but the last adjustments to place the implant properly were done manually.

Simple interrupted 4-0 resorbable sutures (Vicryl, Ethicon FS-2, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) were used.

Postoperatively, patients were given oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (875/125 mg) or clindamycin (300 mg) in patients allergic to penicillin, twice a day for 1 week; ibuprofen (600 mg) four times a day during meals for 1 week (patients were instructed not to take ibuprofen in the absence of pain); xylometazoline hydrochloride (nasal decongestant) 1 mg, five drops twice a day for 2 weeks; and  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine rinses twice a day for 2 weeks. A soft diet for 2 weeks was also recommended.

# 2.4 | Provisional/definitive prostheses and follow-up

The multi-unit abutment was delivered after implant placement with straight/angulated connection. The impression for the design of the immediate loading prosthesis was made using standard impression copings screwed on the abutments, and silicone impression material (Aquasil Monophase Ultra, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) after suturing. The provisional prostheses were fabricated using acrylic resin (Lucitone, Dentsply DeTrey), reinforced with metal wire (Remanium, Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany), and placed between 24 and  $48\mathrm{h}$  after surgery.


Once the provisional prostheses were loaded, patients were visited at 1 week and at 1, 3, and 6 months thereafter. At 6 months, a new impression was made to begin fabrication of the definitive implant-supported fixed prosthesis. In some cases, the acrylic bridge was realigned and adapted to function as a definitive prosthesis. After the definitive prosthesis was delivered, patients were followed annually. Radiography studies were performed on an individualized basis at discretion of the attending clinician.

The rehabilitated range of maxillary arch was at least from the first molar to first molar and could be extended to the second molar area depending on the lower arch dentition. The added of cantilever for the molars was related to the position of posterior Zl, and the condition of mandibular dentitions. Anterior cantilever compensated maxillomandibular discrepancy and upper lip supported was designed when necessary.

Panoramic radiographs were acquired at each follow-up visit, and CT or CBCT were taken in patients with suggestive symptoms of complications, such as orofacial pain, swelling, local inflammatory or infection signs, and sinus disorder. The prosthesis was demounted once a year or when patients experienced any complication.

# 2.5 Outcome endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was the implant survival rate. A failed implant was defined as an implant that had to be removed for different reasons, such as sinusitis, oroantral communication, failure or loss of osseointegration, rotational movement with failure of stability, infection, pain, or fracture. Secondary endpoints were implant success rate, prosthesis success rate, complications, and OHRQoL. For the purpose of this study, the criteria for ZI success included: (1) confirmed individual implant anchorage in the zygomatic bone by means of antero-posterior (A-P) cranial radiograph or occipitomental projection; (2) the implant acting as a anchoring for the functional prostheses (favorable positioning); (3) no suppuration, pain, or ongoing pathologic process at maxillary and zygomatic level, including peri-implant mucositis, bleeding, progressive mucosa recession, and extraoral infective process; (4) confirmed individual implant stability, considering that when a zygoma implant is not connected to another implant, a slight mobility at the coronal aspect of the implant can be expected in some cases (without rotation).<sup>19</sup> Also, the insertion torque may be used as an indirect measurement of the primary stability, and 20 Ncm was considered the minimum insertion torque to consider an implant as stable. A successful prosthesis was defined as a prosthesis that was functioning as intended. Failure to meet success criteria included prosthesis to be out of the mouth for up to 2 weeks during the study period. A prosthetic failure included loss of the supporting implants or fracture of the reconstruction leading to repair.


The OHRQoL was measured by means of the self-administered questionnaire OHIP-14 at least 6 months after loading of the definitive prosthesis.[20] All measurements were taken by an independent assessor not previously involved in the study. The OHIP-14 is a 14-item instrument that explores the subject's perception of the social impact of oral disorders and well-being. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = never, 1 = hardly ever, 2 = occasionally, 3 = very often, 4 = fairly often), where 0 corresponds to no impairment and 4 to the highest degree of impairment. The final score is the sum of all particular items and ranges from 0 to 56. The domains and questions of the OHIP-14 are shown in the Supplementary Material.

Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages, and quantitative variables as mean  $\pm$  standard deviation. The Student's t test was used for the comparison of continuous variables. Statistical significance was set at  $p < 0.05$ .

# 3 | RESULTS

The study cohort included 71 patients (24 men, 47 women) with a mean age of  $57.0 \pm 9.3$  years who underwent 284 ZIs placements during the study period. However, 15 patients were excluded because they were lost to follow-up ( $n = 9$ ) or died ( $n = 6$ ). Therefore, the study population consisted of 56 patients (16 men, 40 women) who received a total of 224 ZIs (Nobel Brænemark TiUnite,  $n = 136$ ; NobelZygoma  $45^{\circ}$ ,  $n = 68$ ; Straumann ZAGA Flat,  $n = 6$ , Round,  $n = 10$ ; and Southern Zygan Implant,  $n = 4$ ), with a mean length of  $44.76 \mathrm{~mm}$  (range 32.5 to  $52.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ ). In case of Straumann and Southern Implants, the most appropriate designs for each patient were chosen. Implants placed anteriorly were significantly longer than those placed posteriorly (48.16 mm vs.  $40.64 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $p < 0.05$ ). In relation to Cawood and Howell classification, $^{17}$  7 patients presented class IV and the remaining 49 patients had classes V and VI. Overall, 7 patients had a natural antagonist lower dentition, while 40 had implant supported restoration, 8 patients had mixed dentition, and 1 had a removable overdenture. A previous implant treatment with or without bone grafting (Figure 3) had failed in 9 patients. The general characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1.

The mean length of follow-up was  $8.8 \pm 3.9$  years (range 1.2-17.0 years). Nine patients  $(16.1\%)$  had a mean follow-up of less than 5 years, 27  $(48.2\%)$  between 5 and 10 years, and 20  $(37.5\%)$  of more than 10 years.

# 3.1 | Implant survival and loading protocol

The implant survival rate was  $97.8\%$ $(n = 219)$ . Five ZIs in four patients failed and required to be removed (Table 2). The mean time between implant placement and failure was 8.6 years (range 0.5-13.4 years).
FIGURE 3 Surgical view of quad zygoma protocol (QZP) in a patient with previous failed sinus floor augmentation and failed guided-bone regeneration in the maxilla prior to be treated by means of conventional implants.

Primary stability was obtained in  $96.4\%$  of implants  $(n = 216)$  (torque  $>35~\mathrm{Ncm}$ ). Eight ZIs (Nobel Biocare TiUnite,  $n = 6$ ; Straumann ZAGA,  $n = 2$ ) in six patients were inserted less than  $35~\mathrm{Ncm}$ . Ten ZIs exhibited slight bending movement in the coronal part without rotational movements after insertion. In the early phase (0.5 year), one ZI had rotational movement and was considered as failure. It was removed 6 months after placement. All the remaining ZIs were considered as successful.

All patients received immediate loading with a cross-arch stabilization acrylic prosthesis in the first  $48\mathrm{h}$  after surgery, including the eight ZIs in which an insertion torque of at least  $35\mathrm{Nm}$  was not obtained (20-35 Ncm).

# 3.2 Definitive prosthesis

In the overall population of 56 patients, the prosthesis success rate was  $98.2\%$  ( $n = 55$ ) with 1 failed prosthesis. Most patients ( $96.4\%$ ) received implant-supported fixed prostheses. Only 2 patients ( $3.6\%$ ) received overdenture due to failed ZI removal and patient's requirement. In relation to the material of restoration, 34 patients ( $63\%$ ) received hybrid bridge with metal/titanium framework (Figure 4) and 20 ( $37\%$ ) an acrylic bridge.

Twelve patients  $(22.2\%)$  did not receive any posterior cantilever for rehabilitation in the fixed prosthesis. For the restorations with cantilever, 32 of 54 patients  $(59.2\%)$  received bilateral cantilever and 10  $(18.5\%)$  unilateral cantilever (right side,  $n = 5$ ; left side,  $n = 5$ ). The additional teeth unit of cantilever was  $1.4 \pm 0.5$  and  $1.3 \pm 0.4$  in the right and left sides, respectively.

# 3.3 Complications

A summary of patient-related and ZI-related complications is shown in Table 3.

Local orofacial inflammation characterized by pain, facial swelling, and/or intraoral soft tissue tenderness, was the most frequent complication and in 20 patients  $(35.7\%)$  at different times over the course of follow-up with a mean of  $10.0 \pm 4.3$  years (range 4.2-14.9 years). All patients recovered successfully with anti-inflammatory medication and antibiotics. A protocol for the management of patients presenting local orofacial symptoms is shown in Figure 5.


Mechanical complications were diagnosed in eight patients  $(14.3\%)$  and included fracture of the prosthetic screws or the prosthetic structure, or chipping of the veneering in the posterior area. All cases were fixed by repair or remanufacturing.

Sinusitis was diagnosed by means of CT or CBCT in seven patients (12.5%) with acute symptoms after a mean of 10.3 ± 4.9 years (range 4.3–16.2 years) after surgery. All patients were successfully treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, nasal decongestants, and menthol inhalations, but functional endoscopic nasosinus surgery (FENS) was necessary in two patients. These two patients were initially managed with medical treatment but symptoms recurred and a new CT/CBCT scan showed sinus opacity. Surgery was successful and relapse did not occur.

Hypoesthesia of the infraorbital nerve in the immediate postoperative period was reported by five patients  $(8.9\%)$ , and all recovered in 1-3 months.

Loss of osseointegration was observed in three ZIs (1.3%) from two patients (Table 2). The implants removed due to rotational mobility and loss of osseointegration after a mean of  $9 \pm 2.2$  years (range 0.5-13.3 years) after surgery. Also, during preparation of two anterior ZIs (0.9%) in two patients, the orbital cavity was penetrated, which was solved with a new drilling direction and a new anchorage site for the implant placement without any clinical consequence.

Three ZIs (1.3%) from three patients presented cutaneous fistula at the level of zygoma anatomical region (Figure 6), after a mean time of  $9.6 \pm 2.2$  years (range 8-12.2 years). The apex of the implants that protruded from the zygomatic bone surface were removed with local anesthesia. In two patients an extraoral approach was used and in one implant an intraoral approach.

Orosinusal fistula occurred in one ZI (0.4%), with the orosinusal connection at the abutment level after 10.5 years of ZI placement. A palatal connective tissue grafting was performed but failed to cover the fistula site and the implant was then removed and replaced by a pterygoid implant.

Soft tissue recession occurred in 18 ZIs  $(8.0\%)$  from 12 patients. Twelve ZIs  $(5.3\%)$  from eight patients had buccal soft tissue recession around 1 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , which remained stable and attached to the bone/implant surface, and no esthetic issue was found due to the high level of transition zone. Six ZIs  $(2.7\%)$  from four patients had more than  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of recession of the soft tissues and without a firm attachment to the implant surface. An implantoplasty was performed to flat and smooth the buccal threads if necessary (Figure 7). This circumstance mostly happened when using of ZI designed with threads down to the neck of the implant (TiUnite, Nobel Biocare). Restabilize of the mucosa and progressive disappearance of the symptoms was observed at follow-up.

Finally, one ZI (0.4%) fractured after 5.2 years of placement. The fractured ZI was partially removed, since the apical part remained integrated at the zygoma bone.

# 4 DISCUSSION

This retrospective study presents the long-term results of the QZP for the rehabilitation of edentulous patients with severely resorbed maxillae. It shows a high survival rate for immediately loaded ZIs, successful prosthesis outcomes, and almost no impairment in the OHRQoL. The most common complications were sinusitis and local orofacial inflammation, which were successfully solved without affecting the outcomes. These favorable long-term data add evidence of the advantages of the QZP as compared with removable dentures or conventional implant-supported restorations which often involves complex staged bone augmentation.[21,22]


The AGA technique for the placement of the implants in the QZP defines three trajectories, intra-sinus, extra-sinus, and lateral wall of

FIGURE 5 Management approach for patients with local orofacial symptoms. After demount of the prosthesis, a CT/CBCT scan is performed to assess the status of the sinuses, and stability of ZIs and abutment and peri-implant soft tissue are evaluated. Final treatment may include functional endoscopic nasosinus surgery (FENS) if recurrence of symptoms after sinus medical treatment, removal of failed ZI in case of implant rotation, and implantoplasty in the presence of recession over  $3\mathrm{mm}$  after peri-implant therapy due to peri-implant mucositis.

the maxilla. $^{7,23}$  Generally, the position of the anterior implant is placed in the crestal ridge to avoid an unfavorable palatal emergence with excessive anterior cantilever. Consequently, the trajectories of anterior Zls are typically through a groove path in the lateral wall of the maxilla or extra-sinus. The posterior implant is also often placed extrasusally or within the wall of the maxilla, reflecting the

anatomical characteristics of patients with maxillary bone atrophy. Intra-sinus trajectories tend to be avoided for the risk sinusitis. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the cumulative incidence of sinus complications in patients with ZIs placed using an intrasinusal technique was  $7.2\%$  which significantly higher than with the extrasinusal technique  $(1.8\%)$ .<sup>24</sup>

The QZP requires in-depth anatomical knowledge and expertise due to the limited amount of bone at the maxillary bone and at the level of the zygomatic bone. $^{3,18}$  Anatomical studies of the zygomatic bone have reported average thickness and width of 4-8 and 25-32 mm, respectively, $^{25-28}$  which do not represent a limitation for the placement of two ZIs in most patients. This is consistent with our study, in which the width limit of  $15\mathrm{mm}$  was used. However, orbital cavity penetration while drilling occurred in two patients with narrow zygomatic bones (no less than  $15\mathrm{mm}$ ), but the drills were redirected without clinical consequences. Recent studies have focused on using different guiding techniques to assist with ZI placement to increase intraoperative accuracy and safety. $^{29-33}$  Placement of ZIs has become

more accurate with the use of surgical navigation systems, while also allowing for implementation of the restorative plan into the implant position. $^{34}$  A study by Wu and colleagues $^{32}$  in a total of 221 ZI placements in atrophic edentulous using the commercial dynamic navigation system, showed a deviation of  $2.64^{\circ}$ . For the static surgical guide, $^{29,30}$  a modified customized template with double sleeves has been recently used and achieved acceptable accuracy in placing ZI. More clinical studies need to be investigated of the feasibility of dynamic and static systems for QZP. $^{34}$  A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has shown acceptable clinical accuracy of ZI placement with the assistance of static dynamic systems through real-time visualization and tracking techniques. $^{34}$

The amount of bone at the maxillary level was very limited, and most patients  $(87.5\%)$  presented with classes V and VI of the Cawood and Howell classification of maxillary atrophy.[17] Extreme alveolar atrophy can lead to insufficient alveolar bone in the implant head leading to a slight bending movement after placement. Although the importance of adequate zygomatic and maxillary alveolar bone for the primary stabilization and long-term functionality of ZIs has been emphasized,[35,36] we found that 10 ZIs with appropriated primary stability exhibited slight bending movement in the coronal part without rotational movements after insertion.[7,8] This slight bending movement could be stabilized with an immediate cross-arch stabilization prosthesis.[7] However, future research should evaluate the correlation between stabilization of ZIs and the remaining alveolar bone, particularly, when using extra-sinus techniques in which the implant body is embedded in the lateral wall of the maxilla. Additionally, more studies are needed to assess the role played by the immediate cross-arch stabilization prostheses in the short- and long-term success of the QZP.

The insertion torque and primary stability of ZI are mainly provided by the anchorage in the zygomatic bone.[37,38] In this study, six patients received immediate loading prostheses with eight ZIs exhibiting less than  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  of insertion torque, and none of them failed. It seems that achieving primary stability may not be indispensable for using an immediate loading protocol in QZP, which is consistent with other studies on conventional implants.[39,40] In a retrospective analysis of 120 implants inserted with  $<30\mathrm{Ncm}$  of torque in full-arch maxillary rehabilitations using the All-on-4 concept, the cumulative implant success rate was  $98.3\%$  and marginal bone loss at 1 year of  $1.14 \pm 0.38\mathrm{mm}$ , with no differences compared to 212 implants inserted with insertion torques of  $\geq 30\mathrm{Ncm}$ .[39] Moreover, in a study of 10 patients with a total of 40 implants followed for 1 year, a high insertion torque was not necessary when using the so-called "M-4" treatment scheme (four-implant distribution pattern using  $30^{\circ}$  angulations for all four implants) in combination with cross-arch stabilization from a prosthesis.[41]


Sinusitis has been recognized as one of the most common complications associated to QZP, $^{3,14}$  and ZI in general, $^{40}$  which occurred in  $12.5\%$  of our cases after a mean ZIs functioning of 10.3 years. However, the actual incidence of sinusitis could have been underestimated as all patients presented with acute symptoms and potential cases of chronic sinusitis or detected by primary imaging techniques of the paranasal sinuses were not evaluated. A clear correlation between sinusitis and trajectories of the ZIs could not be established, but sinus infection did not lead to loss of ZI osseointegration in the zygomatic bone. $^{3,8}$

Orofacial inflammation was the most frequent complication in our study (35.7%) occurring in 20 patients at different intervals after surgery. A few studies have reported this complication or provided an explanation of the etiology.[6,42-44] In a series of 302 adult patients in whom a total of 940 ZIs and 451 standard implants were placed, infection of soft tissue cheek occurred in 72 patients with ZIs at 3.2 years with a complication rate of  $23.8\%$ .[41] Occasional tenderness/inflammation without infection in the maxillary region can occur probably due to pressure from the implants with extrasinus pathways on the mucosa and soft tissue above them. Of the 20 patients with occasional orofacial inflammation,  $26.2\%$  had the ZI in an extrasinus position and  $65\%$  within the sinus wall. However, the possible origin of inflammatory complications, such as the surgical technique, the implant design or other factors remains unknown.

Numerous studies have reported short- to mid-term survival outcomes of using the standard QZP with different loading protocols. [3,4,14,45-47] Our study confirm that immediate loading protocol in the QZP is associated with successful short- and long-term results. A recent systematic review has demonstrated that performing the ZI therapy with immediately functional prosthesis show higher survival rates than delayed loading protocol. [47] On the other hand, a recent trend involves placement of two additional pterygoid implants to avoid posterior cantilevers within the QZP. [48] In the present study, cantilevers were used for the definitive prosthesis in  $77.7\%$  of restorations with high prosthetic success rate. Three pterygoid implants were placed as rescued implants for the three patients who experienced ZI failures. Additional implants for QZP do not seem to be necessary in cases with well-distributed ZIs.


The OHRQoL using the OHIP-14 questionnaire was also assesses in  $85.7\%$  of the patients with a mean follow-up of  $9.0 \pm 4.1$  years. The mean overall score of the OHIP-14 of  $1.3 \pm 2.0$  indicates that the use of QZP rehabilitation fulfills the functional, esthetic, and expectations of patients in the long-term. These findings are in agreement with results of a systematic review showing substantial increases in OHRQoL among patients restored with ZI (with scores in terms of general satisfaction, especially in chewing ability and esthetics) after a mean follow-up time of 46.5 months.[49] Other studies that investigated PROMS using the OHIP-14 questionnaire in patients rehabilitated with ZIs also reported marked improvements in OHRQoL. In a study of 10 patients with maxillary atrophy and 10 oncological patients with bone defects, the quality of life improved by  $71.3\%$  in the atrophic group and by  $82.9\%$  in the oncologic group, with overall scores decreasing from  $30.4 \pm 9.5$  preoperatively to  $6.4 \pm 3.8$  at 60 months after positioning the ZIs.[14] In another study of 18 patients treated with the hybrid zygoma concept,  $72\%$ ,  $89\%$ , and  $94\%$  of patients declared that they were satisfied with their phonetic ability, chewing ability, and esthetics, respectively, after a mean follow-up of 36 months.[50]

Limitations of the study include the retrospective design, the fact that preoperative data of the OHIP-14 questionnaire were not evaluated and that postoperative CT/CBCT scans were only performed in patients with complications. The OHIP-14 instrument was introduced in our clinical practice in 2010 and for this reason preoperative values in all patients were not available.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

The rehabilitation of severely atrophic edentulous maxilla using the QZP has shown a predictable and high survival rate in the long term. The implementation of an immediate loading protocol offers potential benefits in stabilizing ZIs with cross-arch stabilization. Moreover, the use of a posterior cantilever in reconstruction can effectively establish functional occlusion through well-distributed ZIs, eliminating the need for additional implant placement.
