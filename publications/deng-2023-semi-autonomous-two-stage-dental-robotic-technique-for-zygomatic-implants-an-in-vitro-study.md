# ABSTRACT

Objective: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of a semi-autonomous two-stage dental robotic technique for zygomatic implants.

Methods: Twenty-six zygomatic implants were designed and randomly divided into two groups using 10 three-dimensionally printed resin models with severe maxillary atrophy. In one group, the conventional drilling technique was used, in the other group, the drilling process for the alveolar ridge section (first stage) was completed, after which drilling for the zygoma section (second stage) was done. Based on preoperative planning combined with postoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), coronal, apical, depth, and angle deviations were measured. Zygomatic implant placement technique-related deviations (sinus slot, intrasinus, and extrasinus) were also recorded and analyzed.

Results: The two-stage technical group's coronal, apical, depth, and angle deviations were  $0.57 \pm 0.19 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $1.07 \pm 0.48 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $0.30 \pm 0.38 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $0.91 \pm 0.51^{\circ}$ , respectively. The accuracy of the two-stage technique was significantly higher than that of the conventional one-stage technique ( $p < 0.05$ ). The apical deviation in the intrasinus group was  $1.12 \pm 0.56 \mathrm{~mm}$ , which was significantly better than that in the other two groups ( $p < 0.05$ ). The angle deviation in the sinus slot group was  $1.96 \pm 0.83^{\circ}$ , which was significantly worse than that in the other two groups ( $p < 0.05$ ).

Conclusion: Using the semi-autonomous two-stage dental robotic technique for zygomatic implants is feasible and is more accurate than using the conventional one-stage technique.

Clinical significance: The two-stage technique enabled the semi-autonomous robot to overcome the mouth-opening restriction for zygomatic implants and improved accuracy.

# 1. Introduction

Utilizing zygomatic implants (ZIs) is an alternative rehabilitation method for severe maxillary atrophy that avoids excessive trauma and long bone-grafting periods [1]. Numerous studies have shown that ZIs have a success rate of  $>95\%$  [2,3], but severe complications and complicated surgical procedures restrict their use. ZIs are inserted from the alveolar ridge through the maxillary sinus into the zygoma [4]. Poor visualization and the use of longer implants lead to implant deviation, resulting in implant penetration into the orbit or inferior temporal fossa [5-7]. Thus, improving the accuracy of ZI placement is critical.

Digital technology has been widely used in implantology and has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of implant placement. Static surgery guides have been used for ZI placements to date [8-11]. While dynamic navigation techniques have been successful in assisting in ZI placement [12-14], both techniques (static surgery and dynamic navigation) still rely mainly on the surgeon's experience. In contrast to humans, where physiological tremors and fatigue are caused by continuous operation, which may reduce the accuracy of implant drilling, robotic systems have higher accuracy and stability, and provide an effective alternative to freehand operation [15]. The first surgical robot used in assisted oral implantation, YOMI, was approved by the

FDA in 2017 [16]. In the same year, Zhao et al. developed an autonomous dental robot system for oral implant placement [17]. Autonomous surgical robots are currently clinically applied [18], but are limited to regular implants, and no studies have reported on robotic placement of ZIs in a clinical situation. In 2020, Wu et al. reported a robot system for placement of ZIs, and a model experiment showed that the robot system was more accurate than was manual surgery [15]. However, restrictions related to the patient's mouth-opening and soft tissue obstruction did not allow the robotic arm to carry the long drill into the mouth in its entirety and complete position adjustment. Therefore, the reported approach may not be clinically feasible.

In this study, we present a novel semi-autonomous two-stage dental robotic technique for ZI placement. Drilling of the alveolar ridge section was first completed using regular implant drills. The long zygomatic drill was manually placed through the prepared part, and the drilling performance in the zygomatic section was assessed after installing the drill into the robotic arm intraorally and then making postural adjustments. This technology enables semi-autonomous robots to overcome the limitations of patients' mouth-opening, enabling their application in ZI placement. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of this technique in clinical applications.

# 2. Materials and methods

# 2.1. Instruments and devices

The Remebot semi-autonomous implant robot system (Beijing Baihui Weikang Technology Co., Beijing, China), NobelReplace® Tapered Surgery Kit and zygoma surgical kit (Nobel Biocare, Kloten,

Switzerland), implant handpieces (DSG201L; NSK, Tokyo, Japan) and three-dimensional (3D) printers (Union Tech, Shanghai, China) were used in this study. The robot system included a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm (Universal Robots, Odense, Denmark), an optical tracker (Claron Technology, Toronto, Canada), RemebotDent surgical design navigation software (Beijing Baihui Weikang Technology Co.), an instrument cart, a surgical positioning piece, and a drill calibration plate (Fig. 1).

# 2.2. Preoperative preparation

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) data of patients eligible for ZIs were obtained from the imaging database of the Fourth Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital and were stored in digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format. The selected DICOM data were imported into RemebotDent software for 3D reconstruction. Image sections related to the mandible and redundant parts of the maxilla were removed, and the reconstructed data were stored in standard tessellation language (STL) format (Fig. 2B). The reconstructed STL data were used as input to a 3D printer to customize the fabrication of an experimental model using a photosensitive resin (Somos EvoLVe 128; Stratasys, Rehovot, Israel) (Fig. 2D). To realize the real-time tracking function of the surgical robot, a custom surgical positioning piece was designed and printed for each model, and 8-12 ceramic beads were distributed separately as reference marks for registration. The distribution of the reference markers was as follows [19]: (1) The reference markers could not be in the same plane, and avoided a linear or nearly co-linear arrangement. (2) The reference markers were located at widely dispersed points. (3) The center point of

the reference marker distribution was as near to the operative area as possible. (4) Additional reference markers were placed around the target area. (5) The number of beads was required to be more than seven. A plate was designed to attach the markers (black-and-white block) to the custom surgical positioning piece (Fig. 2C, E). The optical tracker could identify the coordinates of the marker and obtained the real-time position of the model through transformation of the spatial relationship.

# 2.3. Preoperative planning and design

The sample size software PASS 15.0 (https://www.ncss.com/download/pass/updates/pass15/) was used to establish the sample size needed to compare the contrast null hypothesis H0:  $\mu 1 = \mu 2$ , with  $90\%$  power and a significance level of  $5\%$ . In the pilot trials, the means of the two groups were 1.68 and 0.85, respectively, and the overall standard deviation was 0.55. Considering that the models may be damaged during the experiment, the actual sample size of each group was set to 13. The custom surgical positioning piece was fixed to the model using screws, and CBCT was performed at  $90\mathrm{kV}$ ,  $3.00\mathrm{mA}$ , and  $10.80\mathrm{mAs}$  (NewTom, Imola, Italy), with a field of view of  $10\mathrm{cm} \times 10\mathrm{cm}$ . The data were stored in DICOM format (Fig. 2F, G). The CBCT data were imported into RemebotDent software for 3D reconstruction and design of the ZI type and placement (Fig. 2H). The planning was saved in STL format and was imported into the surgical navigation software to set up the robotic operating procedure. The robotic drilling process was set up to divide the ZI placement procedures into a one-stage (control group) and a two-stage (experimental group) procedure group.

# 2.4. Experimental operations

The model was fixed to the experimental platform to ensure that the marker on the custom surgical positioning piece was within the field of view of the optical tracker. The robotic arm was connected to the implant handpiece, which was installed on the implant handpiece (Fig. 2K). The robotic arm was moved around the model, and the model marker and calibration plate were within the field of view of the optical tracker. Six different positions were selected to complete the registration of the robotic arm. The coordinate relationship between the reference markers and marker on the surgical positioning piece was determined. When the surgical positioning piece was fixed to the model for CBCT scanning, the coordinates of the model and the reference markers were obtained within the same space. In the registration process, the optical tracker was moved to above the model and captured the position of the marker to establish an actual coordinate system. The virtual coordinate system based on the image was established based on the coordinate relationship between the reference markers and the surgical positioning piece marker and the coordinate relationship between the model and reference markers. Using the optical tracker and marker, the registration process was completed by fusing the actual and virtual coordinate systems by means of an algorithm. After completing the registration, the robot system could identify the real-time spatial position of the robotic arm using the coordinate transfer algorithm and the parameters of the robotic arm.


# 2.4.1. Experimental group

The drilling trajectory for the ZI was divided into two stages. The robotic system completed the drilling process of the alveolar ridge section using regular drills, according to preoperative planning (Fig. 3A, B). After first stage preparation (alveolar ridge section), the zygomatic drill was manually inserted into the implant socket formed during the first stage drilling in the alveolar ridge. The purpose of this step was to avoid the robotic arm carrying the drill directly into the mouth, which would be impeded by mouth-opening restrictions (Fig. 3C, F). The robotic arm was brought in close approximation to the zygomatic drill, and the drill was then installed, intraorally, onto the implant handpiece in auto-alignment mode (Fig. 3D). Auto-alignment was maintained until the robotic arm held the drill, completing the alignment, after which the robot started the second-stage (zygomatic section) drilling directly. All drilling of the zygomatic section with zygomatic drills followed the same procedure until this drilling was completed (Fig. 3E, G). After the preparation, the apical part of the implant was first manually placed into the socket, after which the robotic arm was dragged into the mouth and connected to the implant. Then the remaining part of the implant was placed by the robot, to ensure that the implant depth was consistent with the planning and to observe possible deviations in the process.

# 2.4.2. Control group

The robotic system completed the drilling process through the alveolar ridge to the zygoma in a conventional approach according to preoperative planning. The implants were fitted directly to the robotic arm, which performed the entire placement process according to preoperative planning.

The ZIs were divided into three groups according to their relationship with the maxillary sinus: intrasinus, extrasinus, and sinus slot implants.

# 2.5. Postoperative accuracy analysis

Postoperative CBCT was merged with preoperative planning data to obtain the spatial coordinates of the shoulder center point and the root center point of the actual and virtual implants. The deviation between the two shoulder center points was defined as the coronal deviation of the implant. The deviation between the two root center points was defined as the apical deviation of the implant. The angle between the implant center axis was defined as the angular deviation of the implant. The depth deviation was defined as the vertical deviation of the actual and virtual implants (Fig. 2M).


# 2.6. Statistical analysis

Measurements were repeated twice to avoid errors in image combining and in data calculation. The results were imported into SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Each deviation in the one- and two-stage techniques was analyzed using an independent-sample  $t$ -test, and each deviation in the three maxillary sinus relationships was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Analysis of implant deviation between the two techniques

To assess the feasibility and accuracy of the new semi-autonomous two-stage dental robotic technique for ZI placements, 26 ZIs were designed on 10 models, and drilling performance was evaluated with the robot using the conventional approach as well as the new technique proposed in this study. After the drilling process, the implants were inserted and postoperative CBCT scans were performed to analyze the accuracy.


The results (Table 1) showed that the coronal, apical, depth, and angular deviation with the two-stage technique were  $0.57 \pm 0.19 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $1.07 \pm 0.48 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $0.30 \pm 0.38 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $0.91 \pm 0.51^{\circ}$ , in contrast to the one-stage technique of  $1.22 \pm 0.76 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $2.13 \pm 0.83 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $1.09 \pm 0.77 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $1.58 \pm 0.88^{\circ}$ , respectively. The results obtained with the two-stage technique were significantly better than those obtained with the conventional one-stage technique ( $p < 0.05$ ).

# 3.2. Analysis of accuracy in relation to the maxillary sinus

According to the relationship between the ZIs and the maxillary sinus, the ZIs in this study can be classified as intrasinus or extrasinus implants, or sinus slot approaches. The deviations of the implants in the three classifications are shown in Fig. 4. The apical deviation of the implants in the intrasinus approach was  $1.12 \pm 0.56 \mathrm{~mm}$ , which was better than that in the extrasinus  $(1.93 \pm 0.91 \mathrm{~mm})$  and sinus slot  $(2.10 \pm 0.89 \mathrm{~mm})$  approaches. No significant difference was observed between the extrasinus and sinus slot approaches. The angular deviation in the sinus slot approach was  $1.96 \pm 0.83^{\circ}$ , which was worse than that in the intrasinus  $(0.88 \pm 0.45^{\circ})$  and extrasinus approaches  $(1.15 \pm 0.77^{\circ})$ . No significant difference was observed between the extrasinus and extrasinus approaches.

# 4. Discussion

ZIs can be an effective alternative treatment to avoid complicated bone-grafting procedures while obtaining a good implant position distribution in cases of severe maxillary atrophy [20], particularly in cases where partial removal of the maxilla is required due to tumors or trauma [8,9]. ZIs can provide adequate support and retention for immediate restorations. However, the zygomatic region cannot be fully exposed to the surgeon's visual field through the flap, making this type of surgery a "semi-blinded" operation. The maximum length of the zygomatic drill is  $100\mathrm{mm}$ ; therefore, a small deviation at the entrance to the alveolar ridge is significantly enlarged in the zygoma region. The special anatomical slope and thick cortical layer of the zygoma make the long zygomatic drill susceptible to slippage and deviation when it begins to contact the zygoma during drilling. All these factors can lead to unacceptable deviations or even serious complications.

Computer-assisted surgery is used to guide the drilling process for ZI placement through preoperative CBCT image reconstruction and planning, to improve the accuracy and predictability of ZI placement [21]. Static-guide surgery is widely used for regular implant placement because of its economic convenience and acceptable deviation [22,23]. The use of a specially designed static surgical guide for ZI surgery followed by partial maxillary resection has also been reported [8,9]. Grecchi F et al. used zygomatic implant rehabilitation with fully digital surgical and prosthetic workflow for an oncologic patient and achieved good outcomes, demonstrating that static guides can guide zygomatic implants in some cases and can improve accuracy [24]. However, the retention of the static guide and the blockage of the cooling water path into the operative area limit its use [25], and the conventional static

$^{*}p <   0.05$ $^{**}p <   0.01$ guide can only limit deviation of the drill to a restricted area at the entrance. This disadvantage is further exaggerated when using long zygomatic drills. Moreover, the space occupied by the guide and the limits to patient's mouth-opening further restrict the use of static guides when using long zygomatic drills. Dynamic navigation of ZIs has been widely researched, and has yielded promising results [12-14]. The reconstruction of CBCT data and real-time tracking during surgery allows observation of the drill and possible deviations during the procedure, and allows the surgeon to modify the surgical plan in real time during the procedure. However, the transfer of information from the screen image to the patient requires a high level of hand-eye coordination, which imposes a significant learning curve on the surgeon [26]. The dynamic navigation system provides only a visual navigation function, but does not place a restraint on the drilling trajectory, implying the need for a great deal of manipulative ability to avoid deviation during the drilling process. A semi-autonomous dental robot system can autonomously perform drilling without additional human control based on preoperative planning and design, thereby eliminating deviations caused by freehand operations. Real-time tracking during the procedure shows the progress of the drilling performance and automatically adjusts the drilling strategy to reduce deviations according to the intraoperative situation.


The robot system used in this study consisted of an optical tracking system, robotic arm, and computer control system. Currently available tracking systems are divided into optical- and electromagnetic-based systems. Optical system tracking is preferred for applications in dentistry, which is further divided into active optical tracking and passive optical tracking [12,27]. The tracking system used in this study was a passive optical tracking system, which captures a black-and-white block marker using an optical tracker to obtain the spatial coordinates of the model through a coordinate transfer algorithm. Establishing a relationship between the real coordinates of the patient and the planned coordinates in virtual space involves a registration process [28]. The registration type applied in this study is the most common paired-point registration used in implant navigation, in which reference marks (ceramic beads) are fixed to the model, and a CBCT scan is performed. Registration was completed by capturing the position of the intersection point under the optical tracker by utilizing the coordinate relationship between the marker and the reference marks. Some errors may occur during registration, including fundamental localization error, fundamental registration error, and target registration error (TRE) [29]. These errors are mainly related to the size of the image voxels and the size, number, and distribution of the reference marks. CBCT may have a higher accuracy than conventional multi-slice computed tomography in real-time ZI navigation procedures according to one study [21], whereas another study found no significant difference in TRE when more than six reference marks, distributed in a polygon, were used [30]. The robotic arm used in this study was a UR5 six-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm with an average positioning accuracy of  $0.156\mathrm{mm}$ $(0.071 - 0.204\mathrm{mm})$  and an average repeat positioning accuracy of  $0.033\mathrm{mm}$ $(0.028 - 0.038\mathrm{mm})$  [18]. These errors were acceptable.

The relationship between the ZI and the maxillary sinus is critical. In a retrospective longitudinal cohort study [31], among 25 patients suffering from zygomatic peri-implantitis with 33 sinus slot implants, 7 extrasinus implants, and 5 intrasinus implants, the implants that ultimately failed were 10 sinus slot implants, 5 extrasinus implants, and 1 intrasinus implant. Postoperative pain, swelling, septicemia, and maxillary sinus clouding have also been reported to be relatively rare with the extrasinus approach, which has more advantages than the intrasinus approach [32]. In addition to concerns about postoperative complications, attention to the bone-implant contact area of the ZI is also important, as only a sufficient bone-implant contact area can achieve good initial stability for immediate restorations. Various classifications of ZIs exist. Aparicio et al. proposed an anatomically oriented approach to ZIs, dividing the surgical approach into the following five categories based on implant location: (i) Class 0, intrasinus approach;
Fig. 4. The coronal, apical, depth, and angular deviation of three types of zygomatic implants. *significant difference between groups  $(p < 0.05)$ .

(ii) Class I, mixed intrasinus-extrasinus approach; (iii) Class II, mixed extrasinus-extrasinus approach; (iv) Class III, extrasinus approach; and (v) Class IV, maxillary extrasinus approach [33]. Stella et al. proposed the maxillary sinus slot technique [34], and Aparicio C et al. improved the extrasinus technique [35]. Three models were selected for this study: the intrasinus, extrasinus, and sinus slot approaches. The intrasinus approach group was superior to the other two groups in terms of less apical deviation. This could be because, when the long zygomatic drill passes through the maxillary sinus area before drilling in the zygomatic region, the angle of the internal zygomatic slope in the maxillary sinus is flatter than the external slope of the maxillary sinus in the other two groups, allowing less drill slippage and less apical deviation. The angular deviation of the sinus slot group was worse than that of the other two groups because the drill of the sinus slot group was always subjected to the lateral force of the bone during drilling, resulting in the accumulation of deviations.

In this study, 26 ZIs were inserted into 10 resin models by the semiautonomous robot, including 13 each in the one- and two-stage technique groups. Accuracy was greater with the two-stage than with the conventional one-stage technique. In the two-stage technique group, because the first stage (alveolar ridge section) had already been prepared, the drill was not subjected to the lateral force of the implant socket in the alveolar ridge section when drilling the zygomatic part, and thus deviations occurring in the alveolar ridge section did not accumulate in the zygomatic section. Furthermore, large mouth-opening can easily lead to stress concentration in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and prolonged mouth-opening may lead to TMJ disorders [36]. Limiting the degree of mouth-opening is a major challenge in ZI placement with robots. In the two-stage zygomatic technique proposed in this study, the long zygomatic drill was manually partially inserted into the prepared implant socket before the drill was installed on the implant handpiece intraorally, avoiding entry of the robotic arm holding the implant handpiece with the long drill into the mouth, making robot placement of ZIs possible without the restrictions associated with mouth-opening.


In this study, a novel semi-autonomous two-stage dental robotic technique for ZI placement was proposed, and its feasibility and accuracy were demonstrated. The limitations of this study are that only resin models were used, which are homogeneous, harder than bone, and lack the anisotropy of bone. The model experiments do not fully simulate the clinical situation and are unable to overcome all limitations of mouth-opening. We plan to apply this technique to cadaver studies and clinical cases in future.

# 5. Conclusions

In this study, we proposed a semi-autonomous two-stage dental robotic technique for ZI placement and demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of this approach using resin models. The results demonstrated that the coronal, apical, depth, and angle deviations of the two-stage technique were better than those of the conventionally used one-stage technique. This study provides a basis for further investigation of ZI placement by semi-autonomous robots in cadaveric and clinical studies.
