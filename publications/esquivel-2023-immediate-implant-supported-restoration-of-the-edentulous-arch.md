A method of transitioning a patient with complete edentulism or a nonrestorable dentition to an implant-supported fixed restoration.

# Indications

1. Adequate bone volume for the placement of dental implants
2. Adequate inter-arch (interocclusal) distance for a fixed prosthesis
3. Properly motivated patient to maintain a fixed prosthesis

# Contraindications

1. Uncontrolled systemic disease
2. Retrognathic jaw relationship

# Treatment Planning Considerations

Treating an edentulous patient or a patient with a failing dentition is a complex restorative challenge. A series of prosthodontic steps must be followed to ensure a proper outcome. A thorough esthetic and functional evaluation of the patient must be performed to determine the case's prosthetic design and surgical approach. Critical determinants for proper planning and execution of these complex cases include:

Incisal edge position: This is an essential consideration as all the teeth in the mouth will be set based on this reference point and it will help determine the restorative space for the final prosthesis.
Vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO): A facial and intraoral analysis must be performed to ensure proper VDO of the interim restorations as a duplicate of these often will be used as surgical guides used for bone reduction.
Lip support: If the patient has deficient lip support, the final prosthesis will need to have a flange and be removable. The patient can have a flange-less transitional implant-supported prosthesis, but the facial esthetics will be affected. If inadequate lip support is present, the interim prosthesis should be transitioned to a locator supported removable overdenture restoration. If the patient has adequate lip support, a fixed implant-supported restoration without a flange, also known as a hybrid prosthesis, can be designed.


Lip travel: Lip travel is one of the most important considerations to prevent esthetic complications, such as a visible prosthetic transition line (see Figure 11.34). A thorough analysis of the patient's smile and lip dynamics must be done to minimize aesthetic issues.

- Restorative space: Full arch implant-supported restorations which will replace both teeth and soft tissues require a large amount of restorative space. If this is not analyzed correctly, breakage of restorations (see Figure 11.33) and other complications may occur.

Transitioning a patient with complete edentulism or a terminal dentition to an implant-supported fixed restoration without using an interim removable prosthesis is a good treatment option to maintain functionality and esthetics after the teeth have been extracted and implants are in the osseointegration period.

# Part I - Implant Placement

# Technique (Surgical)

1. The procedure may be undertaken using local, intravenous, or general anesthesia.
2. Extraction of the remaining dentition is carefully completed, making sure to preserve alveolar bone.
3. The alveolar bone is curetted to debride granulation tissue, periapical pathology, and fistulous tracts.
4. The residual edentulous maxillary arch is leveled and reduced to ensure the interface between the abutment and the final restoration is superior to the lip line during animation (see Figure 11.2 in Case Report 11.1).

5. The residual edentulous mandibular arch is leveled to achieve a uniform flat surface topography to provide the proper width for the placement of dental implants and sufficient vertical space to allow for restorative materials (see Figure 11.5 in Case Report 11.1 and Figure 11.23 in Case Report 11.2).
6. Posterior implants are placed to ensure proper distal angulation to avoid violating vital structures (mental nerve and maxillary sinuses) (see Figures 11.3 and 11.5 in Case Report 11.1). Anterior implants are placed along the long axis of the anterior alveolus (see Figure 11.6 in Case Report 11.1).
7. Alveolar bone interfering with the seating of the abutments is removed (see Figures 11.26 and 11.27 in Case Report 11.2).

# Case Reports

Case Report 11.1. Extractions with immediate maxillary and mandibular fixed hybrid prosthesis placement. Part I-Surgery. A 59-year-old male presents with painful and failing dentition. The patient desired fixed maxillary and mandibular prostheses. The two maxillary implants were stable. Remaining maxillary and mandibular teeth were extracted, immediate implants were placed and

Figure 11.3. The sinus is located. The drill demonstrates the proposed angle of the distal implant to engage the medial sinus wall. Angling the posterior implants will allow for a great A-P spread of the implants and the potential for greater distal prosthesis extension. Fifteen- and thirty-degree angled abutments are available to correct standard implant angulations.

8. Abutments are seated and torqued to the manufacturer recommendations.
9. Healing caps are placed on the abutments and the incisions are closed in a tension-free manner with resorbable sutures (see Figures 11.4 and 11.7 in Case Report 11.1).
10. Postsurgical films are taken to ensure appropriate implant position and complete seating of abutments (see Figure 11.28 in Case Report 11.1).

Note: These procedures are typically performed in conjunction with the restoring prosthodontist, and the interim prosthesis is placed and adjusted immediately after implant placement.

the patient was temporized with an interim hybrid prosthesis. After 4 months of implant osseointegration, final fixed hybrid prosthesis will be placed (see Figure 11.1 through 11.19).

The patients smile line should be thoroughly evaluated prior to surgery to ensure adequate vertical bone reduction to minimize a visible prosthetic transition line between the hybrid prosthesis and the gingiva.

The mental nerve is identified, and the posterior implants are angled distally to avoid contact with the mental nerve and to maximize the anterior-posterior (A-P) spread of implants.

# Part II - Conversion

# Technique (Restorative)

1. If intravenous or general anesthesia is utilized, the patient is allowed to recover before the restorative phase of the procedure.
2. The restorative phase is initiated with removing the healing caps and the placement of the impression copings (see Figure 11.8 in Case Report 11.1).
3. Floss is threaded around the impression copings to provide a scaffold for the impression.
4. A low-flow bis-acryl is used to connect the impression copings.
5. A medium-viscosity impression material is flowed under the bis-acryl registration material and onto the tissue (see Figure 11.9 in Case Report 11.1).

6. A rigid-bite registration material is placed over the bis-acryl and medium-viscosity impression material to complete the impression (see Figure 11.10 in Case Report 11.1). Care is made to avoid covering the screws with impression material.
7. The impression is removed and poured.
8. The impression is completed for the opposing arch and poured.
9. The interim dentures are relieved to allow complete, passive seating over the abutments.
10. Impression material is placed on the intaglio surface of the denture, and the denture is placed in the mouth to identify the exact location of the abutments (see Figure 11.11 in Case Report 11.1).
11. Access holes are placed at two locations within each denture, allowing the full seating of the denture. Temporary cylinders and copings are placed on two of the abutments (see Figure 11.12 in Case Report 11.1).
12. A rubber dam is placed over the sutures and extraction sites to prevent the extravagation of the impression material into the surrounding tissues or extraction sites (see Figure 11.12 in Case Report 11.1).

13. Self-cure acrylic resin is used to connect the temporary cylinders to the denture (see Figure 11.13 in Case Report 11.1).
14. The process is repeated for the opposing arch, if applicable.
15. The remaining temporary cylinders are connected to the implants, and then connected to the denture with self-curing acrylic, which creates a fixed restoration.
16. The dentures are placed (see Figures 11.15 and 11.16 in Case Report 11.1), and retaining screws are torqued to  $15\mathrm{Ncm}$
17. The access holes are filled with a silicone material.
18. Final occlusal adjustments are made with the dentures seated.
19. A final film is obtained (see Figure 11.19 in Case Report).

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics and antibiotics are prescribed based on the invasiveness of the procedure.
2. Continued follow-up with both the surgeon and the restoring prosthodontist is key to patient comfort and prosthesis success.

# Complications

1. Lack of primary stability of the implants: Care is taken in the site preparation to prepare the site according to the bone density. Softer bone requires minimal site preparation and/or the use of dental implants with a more aggressive thread pitch.
2. Inability to fully seat the abutment: The use of a bone mill or bone profile is required to ensure the bone does not interfere with seating the abutment. Full seating must be visually confirmed during surgery. Care is taken when removing excess bone with handpiece to prevent damage to implant platform (see Figures 11.27 and 11.28 in Case Report 11.2).
3. Sinus location prevents adequate anterior-posterior spread of implants: Preoperative evaluation is critical in case selection. Angled traditional implants, pterygoid implants, or zygomatic implants can be used to extend the anterior-posterior spread of the maxilla coupled with angled abutments.
4. Inadequate inter-arch distance to properly fabricate restorations: Adequate bone removal may be necessary before implant placement to ensure the appropriate amount of inter-arch distance. A minimum of  $15\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical restorative height is necessary for a hybrid prosthesis.
5. Prosthetic transition line is evident during animation: Evaluation of the smile line is a key component in the preoperative evaluation. The bone level must be superior to the smile line for a maxillary fixed hybrid restoration and inferior to the smile for

a mandibular fixed restoration. If this is not possible, alternative restorations should be considered (see Figure 11.34).

6. Fracture of the provisional prosthesis: Excessive cantilever length without a proper substructure is a common cause of interim prosthesis fracture (see Figure 11.33). Provisional prosthesis fracture may be minimized by preventing excessive cantilever forces, maintaining sufficient thickness of the provisional restoration and, if necessary, providing additional support in the form of metal mesh substructures (see Figure 11.19).

# Key Points

1. The smile line must be evaluated and bone level determined before surgery.
2. The lip support the patient will require must be considered to determine if a fixed appliance is appropriate.
3. The required inter-arch distance and amount of bone reduction required must be determined before surgery.
4. An adequate anterior-posterior spread is required to minimize excessive distal cantilever forces on the prosthesis.
5. As immediate implants are often placed into extraction sites, appropriate implant angulation and insertional torque values are necessary to minimize implant failure. Implant insertion torque values of  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  or greater are desired.
6. If at the time of immediate implant placement, if the bone density is poor, or if implants will be placed with suboptimal angulation, depth, or parallelism, grafting should be performed and implant placement should be delayed to allow for ideal implant placement to ensure acceptable prosthesis strength and stability for enhanced longevity.
7. The authors prefer the placement of at least five implants for a fixed hybrid prosthesis so that if an implant fails to osseointegrate, the patient will still have a stable final prosthesis (see Figure 11.32).
8. Verification that the abutments are fully seated must be visually and radiographically confirmed before beginning the restorative phase.
9. The restoration must be cleansable to minimize plaque accumulation and gingival irritation.
10. A substructure support may be necessary if a large span is present.
11. A sufficient number of implants should be placed to avoid a pontic span greater than  $15\mathrm{mm}$ .
12. The use of a CR splint is recommended to protect the dental implant-supported prosthesis, especially when the implant-supported prosthesis opposes natural dentition (see Figure 11.20).
Figure 11.20. A CR splint is fabricated to protect the prosthesis in the patients mouth when opposing a dental implant-supported prosthesis or natural dentition.

Case Report 11.2. Extractions with immediate mandibular fixed hybrid prosthesis placement. A 62-year-old female patient presents with a well-fitting maxillary removable prosthesis and failing mandibular dentition. Remaining mandibular teeth were extracted, immediate implants were placed, and the patient was temporized with an interim mandibular hybrid prosthesis. After 4 months of implant osseointegration, a final fixed mandibular hybrid prosthesis was placed (see Figures 11.21 through 11.31).

Case Report 11.3. Complication - Failed implant. A 56-year-old male presents for the removal of his interim prosthesis and the placement of his final prosthesis. During interim prosthesis removal, one of the five implants failed to osseointegrate. The fixed hybrid prosthesis was salvageable as four implants were available for restoration.

Case Report 11.5. Complication - Unaesthetic transition line during animation. A 52-year-old male presents with a chief complaint that when he smiles, he notices a gap beneath his left mandibular prosthesis.

The transition line of the lower prosthesis is visible on animation due to poor initial evaluation and inadequate bone reduction at the time of surgery.
