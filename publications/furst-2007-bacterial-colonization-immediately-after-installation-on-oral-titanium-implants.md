# Abstract

Background: Information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited.

Aims: (1) To assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites.

Material and methods: Subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery.

Results: Comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of Veillonella parvula  $(P < 0.05)$  differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. Week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery  $(P$ -values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). Between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. Included among these bacteria at implant sites were Porphyromonas gingivalis  $(P < 0.05)$ , Tannerella forsythia,  $(P < 0.01)$ , and Treponema denticola  $(P < 0.001)$ . Immediately post-surgery  $5.9\%$  of implants, and  $26.2\%$  of teeth, and at week 12,  $15\%$  of implants, and  $39.1\%$  of teeth harbored Staphylococcus aureus. Comparing tooth and implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. This difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically.

Conclusions: Bacterial colonization occurred within  $30\mathrm{min}$  after implant placement. Early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.

Dental plaque is a complex biofilm accumulating on teeth and oral tissues. Although it comprises a large variety of bacterial species, the colonization follows a regimented pattern with the adhesion of initial colonizers to the acquired pellicle followed by secondary colonization through inter-bacterial adhesion (Rosan & Lamont 2000). For example, there appears to be a specific pattern regarding how Porphyromonas gingivalis co-adheres with Streptococcus gordonii (Park et al. 2005).


Knowledge about bacterial colonization on tooth surfaces and bacterial interactions has increased significantly with the understanding of the development of the dental biofilm (Xie et al. 2000). The colonization pattern and bacterial presence around teeth appear to depend on many microorganisms previously not considered in studies (Aas et al. 2005).

Using cultural techniques, studies have also characterized early colonization around implants in partially edentulous subjects by pathogens that are otherwise associated with periodontitis (i.e., Nakou et al. 1987; Mombelli et al. 1988; van Winkelhoff et al. 2000). Recent data suggest that their colonization on submucosal implant surfaces and the presence in sulcus fluids may occur within 10-14 days after implant installation (De Boever & De Boever 2006; Quirynen et al. 2006). Despite the development of a biofilm capable of triggering clinical inflammation, no development of peri-implant mucositis appeared to occur within the first 6 months (De Boever & De Boever 2006). This is consistent with the fact that clinical studies have shown that osseo-integrated titanium implants may be successfully used as abutments for reconstruction, and that peri-implant tissues can be kept in a healthy clinical state for prolonged periods of time (Sbordone et al. 1995; Ellegaard et al. 1997).

Biological complications, however, do occur (Brägger et al. 2005). Thus, the early colonization pattern may contribute and be explanatory to the development of peri-implant lesions (Leonhardt et al. 1999). In fact, differences may exist on how microorganisms colonize a tooth surface from that of how they colonize around titanium implants. Thus, Staphylococcus aureus, a pathogen commonly not considered in periodontal microbiological research (Kronström et al. 2001), is known to have the ability to attach to almost any type of titanium surfaces (Harris & Richards 2004). It is well known that a significant proportion of medical implants became the focus of a device-related infection. Such infections are difficult to treat because bacteria causing these infections live in well-developed biofilms, and hence are protected against the effect of antimicrobial agents. S. aureus autolysin may be an important factor in the early colonization of such implant devices including dental titanium implants (Costerton et al. 2005).

The titanium surface characteristics may further modulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by macrophages in a time-dependent manner (Refai et al. 2004). Thus, the clinically observed inflammatory responses in peri

implant mucositis and peri-implantitis may be dependent on specific pathogens with affinity to titanium and to host-linked interactions. This may explain the specific inflammatory responses in periimplant lesions (Zitzmann et al. 2001).

In vitro studies have also shown that specific bacterial strains attach to titanium surfaces by their outer membrane proteins. Thus, unlike Fusobacterium nucleatum strains that appear to have poor affinity to titanium, P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia cells have a much higher level of affinity to titanium. If some anaerobes can attach directly to an inert titanium surface, this may have consequences leading to infection of the peri-implant tissues (Kuula et al. 2004).


There is paucity of data on early bacterial colonization and on biofilm formation on titanium dental implants, and no information on the impact of the bacteria present at adjacent tooth sites. The purposes of this study were to assess (1) the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement through the first 3 months post-surgically and (2) to compare the developing microbiota at inter-proximal sub-gingival implant and adjacent tooth sites.

# Materials and methods

This study was performed in compliance with the institutional review board (Ethical Committee of the Canton of Berne, Switzerland) (KEK). Subjects treatment planned for single tooth replacement and with at least one adjacent natural tooth were included following periodontal treatment. Oral hygiene standards were clinically satisfactory with a full-mouth plaque score of  $< 25\%$ . Assessments of full-mouth (six surfaces per tooth) probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding scores, and radiographic evaluation of bone levels, confirmed that study subjects did not have periodontitis. Patients were on a regular schedule for supportive periodontal therapy (SPT). Periodontal examination, treatment planning, and implant surgeries were performed consistent with routine clinical practice at the Department of Periodontology and Fixed Prosthodontics, School of Dental Medicine at the University of Berne, Switzerland. All procedures were performed by an experienced clinician and specialist in periodontology (GES). Immediately before the implant placement, the subjects rinsed their mouth with a  $0.1\%$  chlorhexidine solution. During the first 2 weeks after surgery, subjects also rinsed once daily with a  $0.1\%$  chlorhexidine solution. All implants placed were standard Straumann  $4.1\mathrm{mm}$  diameter regular neck implants allowing trans-mucosal healing.

Post-surgical oral hygiene instructions were given on an individual basis. At 1 week after surgery, the sutures were removed. The participants of this study were then followed during the first 12 post-surgical weeks.

Before the beginning of implant installation and after the gentle removal of supragingival plaque at adjacent tooth surfaces, sub-gingival plaque samples were collected. Additional sub-gingival plaque samples were taken immediately after suturing and completion of the surgical procedures. Such samples were taken both at the adjacent tooth sites, as before surgery, and at the mesial and distal aspects of the freshly installed implants. Likewise, subgingival plaque samples were taken at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implant placement. The sub-gingival plaque samples were collected with paper filter strips (Periopaper, Proflow Inc., Amityville, NY,

USA) inserted into peri-implant and periodontal sulci for 30 s.

# Microbiological processing

The samples were individually placed in Eppendorf tubes containing  $0.15\mathrm{ml}$  TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6).

Within 30 min after sampling, o.1 ml  $5\mathrm{M}$  NaOH was added to each tube. The samples were all stored for the same period of time (3 months) before processing to avoid loss of microbiological information. The samples were analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method.

A total of 40 bacterial strains were included in the analysis (Table 1). Details of the method have been previously described (Katsoulis et al. 2005; Gerber et al. 2006; Persson et al. 2006). To receive a fully detailed account of the identified bacteria, the digitized information was analyzed by a software program (ImageQuant, Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) allowing comparison of signals against standard lanes of known bacterial amounts  $(\mathrm{IO}^{5}$  or  $\mathrm{IO}^{6}$  cells). Signals were converted to absolute counts by comparison with these standards and studied as the proportion of sites defined as having  $\geq \mathrm{I} \times \mathrm{IO}^{5}$  bacterial cells. The total sum of the 40 species present was computed as the total bacterial load.

# Data analysis

Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were employed. Differences in microbial colonization over time for the individual sites were tested with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Differences between implant and tooth sites were tested with the Mann-Whitney  $U$ -test. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify differences in bacterial loads between the implant and tooth surfaces. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical software for PC (version 13.0, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).

# Results

A total of 14 subjects were included in the study. Tooth decay was identified as the cause of tooth loss in  $55.3\%$  of cases, periodontitis in  $40\%$  and a combination of both for the remaining  $6.7\%$  cases. A total of 17 titanium implants and their adjacent tooth sites were studied. The mean PPD of adjacent (mesial and distal) tooth surfaces was  $3.1 \mathrm{~mm}$  ( $\mathrm{SD} \pm 0.6$ , median 3, range: 3-5) and the mean bleeding on probing (BOP) was  $8.9\%$  ( $\mathrm{SD} \pm 4.4$ , 8.4, range: 0-15%). At baseline (pre-surgery), no differences were found for clinical parameters (PPD, BOP) between the adjacent mesial and distal tooth sites opposing the implant placement site. In addition, no differences in microbial presentation patterns (quantities and proportions) were found between the tested proximal tooth

Development of a sub-mucosal microbiota at tooth sites following a surgical procedure

The colonization pattern for selected bacteria at tooth sites and based on mean values are illustrated in Fig. 1. At the different time points, no differences in bacterial-presence patterns at teeth were found between the mesial and distal sites to implant-adjacent tooth surfaces. Thus the placement of an implant between the teeth made no difference in the presence or development of a characteristic. The proportions of tooth sites presenting with bacterial levels  $\geq \mathrm{I} \times \mathrm{IO}^5$  organisms before surgery, at  $30\mathrm{min}$  after the completion of the surgical implant installation and at 1, 4, 8, and at 12 weeks post-surgically are presented in Table 1. Statistical analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) failed to demonstrate any differences in the presence of any of 40 species when sample data from before surgery and  $30\mathrm{min}$  after surgery were compared. This was also the case for the proportional distribution of species.


In comparison with pre-surgical levels at sampled teeth, samples obtained 4 weeks post-surgically demonstrated significantly higher levels of S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces naeslundi type 1 and 2 combined  $(P < 0.05)$ . At week 8, additional bacteria demonstrated higher bacterial loads than at baseline. Thus an increase of Eikenella corrodens  $(P < 0.05)$ , Fusobacterium nucl. polymorphum  $(P < 0.05)$ , Pep tostreptococcus micros  $(P <   0.05)$  ,and  $P$  gingivalis  $(P <   0.01)$  was found. On the other hand,  $15 / 40$  species  $(P <$  values varying between o.o5 and o.o1) presented with a higher bacterial load at 12 weeks postsurgically as compared with the pre-surgical levels.


Development of a sub-gingival microbiota at implant sites

The colonization pattern for selected bacteria at implant sites based on mean values is illustrated in Fig. 2. At the different time points, no differences in bacterial presence patterns were found between the mesial and distal aspects of implants. The proportions of implant sites with bacterial levels  $1 \times 10^{5}$  organisms  $30\mathrm{min}$  after the completion of the surgical implant installation, at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-surgically are presented in Table 2. Comparing bacterial data between  $30\mathrm{min}$  after placement with those after 1 week post-surgically showed that only the levels of Veillonella parvula  $(P < 0.05)$  differed with higher loads at week 1. Week 8 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for  $32/40$  species, and at week 12, a total of  $29/40$  species differed with higher loads. Included among these bacteria were  $P.$  gingivalis  $(P < 0.05)$ , Tannerella forsythia,  $(P < 0.01)$ , and Treponema denticola  $(P < 0.001)$ . However, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype Y4  $(P < 0.61)$ , or for S. aureus  $(P < 0.50)$ , were not included. The dominating bacteria included Capnocytophaga and Fusobacterium species. S. aureus was more commonly found than P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b  $(Y4)$ , T. forsythia, and T. denticola.

Microbiological comparisons between tooth and implant sites during the first 12 weeks after implant placement

At  $30\mathrm{min}$  after implant placement significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for  $27 / 40$  species than at implant sites. This difference increased to  $35 / 40$  species at week 12. ROC curves identified specific bacteria that differed in their colonization patterns between implants and tooth surfaces. This is illustrated for the first post-surgical sampling at  $30\mathrm{min}$  (Fig. 3 and Table 3) and at week 12 (Fig. 4 and Table 4). The area under the ROC curve represents the difference between the presence or the absence of a select

# Discussion

This study has demonstrated that the submucosal dental implant microbiota is already established at the completion of the surgical procedure. The studies by De Boever & De Boever (2006) employed the same implant system as the one installed in this study, whereas the study by Quirynen et al. (2006) used a different implant system. This may partly explain the differences in the detection prevalence and development of a microbiota over time. On the other hand, the above-cited studies also used similar bacterial sampling methods as

in our study assessing the presence of microorganisms in sulcus fluids from implant sites. In principle, this study confirmed that early colonization occurs (Callan et al. 2005; De Boever & De Boever 2006; Quirynen et al. 2006). Thus the data in this study also represent the presence of the bacteria in the gingival fluid and not in the biofilm possibly attached to either tooth or implant surfaces.

The consequences of bacterial colonization at the implant surface and the bacteria present in sulcus fluid are not known. The study by De Boever & De Boever (2006) suggested that, at least for the first 6 months after the installation, there might be no consequences. Notwithstanding, however, the presence of pathogens during the immediate healing phase may have future consequences. Thus, Leonhardt et al. (2003) demonstrated that in several cases of peri-implantitis with culture identified species that not only included pathogens such as  $P$  gingivalis,  $P$  intermedius, and  $A$  actinomycetemcomitans but also encompassed Escherichia coli and S. aureus as identified by culturing techniques. Although a large number of studies exist, a significant proportion of the resident human microbiota remains poorly characterized (Kroes et al. 1999). Studies are necessary to expand on the microbial colonization pattern at sites with clinical health (Aas et al. 2005).


The presence of early colonizing bacteria including Actinomyces species and  $V.$  parvula in gingival fluid samples from both teeth and implants as demonstrated in this study is not surprising (Nakazato et al. 1989; Rasperini et al. 1998). The rather high prevalence of Streptococci species at tooth sites is consistent with other studies of early plaque formation (Egland et al. 2004). Specifically the presence of S. gordonii is of concern, as this microorganism co-adheres with P. gingivalis (Park et al. 2005). The link between a P. gingivalis infection and periodontitis is well established. The presence of S. aureus at implants is consistent with in vitro observations on the affinity of S. aureus to titanium (Harris & Richards 2004). This is, however, of concern, as Sauer's has been linked to early oral titanium implant failures (Kronström et al. 2000, 2001). S. aureus is of significant concern in infections encountered in conjunction with medical titanium implants (i.e. Costerton et al. 2005; Stoodley et al. 2005).

It appears from other studies that at least the transmission of  $P_{\cdot}$  gingivalis and  $P_{\cdot}$  intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region is possible (Sumida et al. 2002). This may explain why the implants in this study were immediately colonized with some pathogens associated with periodontitis. It should, however, be pointed out that the subjects in this study did not have periodontal treatment needs that had not previously been taken care of. In addition, adjacent tooth sites did not include periodontal pockets of clinical concern. Other reports have shown that, even with the supragingival environment as the single source for colonizing bacteria, a complex sub-mucosal microbiota develop within 1 week (Quirynen et al. 2005). Furthermore, it is possible that bacteria such as  $P$  gingivalis disseminate from cell to cell without passing through the extra-cellular space (Yilmaz et al. 2006). This mechanism of spreading may allow  $P$  gingivalis to colonize oral tissues without exposure to the humoral immune response or recommended oral hygiene measures.


The levels of several of the bacterial species assayed in this study yielded much higher prevalence levels of bacteria at week 12 than that identified in another study using the same sampling and microbial analytical methods for implants in function more than 12 months (Gerber et al. 2006). It may be speculated that the wound-healing process provides an environment favorable for microbial colonization and growth.

It is of interest that the microbiota at implant sites in this study demonstrated similarities with our previous analysis of the microbiota from implant sulcus fluid at implants in function for more than one year (Gerber et al. 2006). Although a large number of studies exist, a significant proportion of the resident human microbiota remains poorly characterized (Kroes et al. 1999). In vitro studies have shown that chlorhexidine in a suspension form is more effective in inhibiting  $P_{\cdot}$  gingivalis than the use of antibiotics (Noiri et al. 2003). This study demonstrated that the short-term effects of chlorhexidine rinses as shown by a reduction on the prevalence of some bacteria did not last beyond the first week. This may be due to the fact that a chlorhexidine rinse may be insufficiently efficient against an established oral biofilm (Vitkov et al. 2005) as this was the case at both tooth and implant sites.

Studies have demonstrated that chlorhexidine rinses over a shorter time may effectively reduce the levels of anaerobic bacteria in the saliva and on tongue surfaces (Sreenivasan & Gittins 2004). Our study demonstrated that in spite of the fact that the study subjects routinely rinsed with chlorhexidine before surgery as well as during the first weeks after surgery, this antibacterial regimen was insufficient in preventing the establishment of a potentially pathogenic microbiota in the surrounding fluids to both implants and teeth.
Fig. 4. Receiver operating characteristic curves at 12 weeks identifying bacteria with different colonization patterns between the tooth and implant sites immediately after surgery (see Table 4 for specific details).


The establishment of the microbiota was faster at the tooth sites. This study, however, also demonstrated characteristic differences in the colonization patterns developing at the tooth vs. implant sites. This is an important observation suggesting that an immediate transmission of pathogens is not immediately established. Further studies are needed to search the source of bacteria that colonize implant surfaces. Whether the early colonization pattern of bacteria around implants is explanatory to future infectious events leading to implant mucositis must also be studied.


In conclusion, the colonization of bacteria occurred within 30 min after the completion of trans-mucosal implant installation surgery. There is also an early re-colonization at surrounding teeth. The colonization pattern is distinctively different for approximately  $50\%$  of the species studied. Notably, a different colonization pattern was found for bacteria such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and several Streptococci species.
