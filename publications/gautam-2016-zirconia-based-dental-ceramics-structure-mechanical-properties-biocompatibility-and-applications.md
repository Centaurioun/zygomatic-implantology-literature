# Zirconia based dental ceramics: structure, mechanical properties, biocompatibility and applications

Chandkiram Gautam,\*a,b Jarin Joyner,a Amarendra Gautam, b Jitendra Raoc and Robert Vajtai

Zirconia  $(\mathrm{ZrO}_2)$  based dental ceramics have been considered to be advantageous materials with adequate mechanical properties for the manufacturing of medical devices. Due to its very high compression strength of  $2000\mathrm{MPa}$ ,  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  can resist differing mechanical environments. During the crack propagation on the application of stress on the surface of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$ , a crystalline modification diminishes the propagation of cracks. In addition, zirconia's biocompatibility has been studied in vivo, leading to the observation of no adverse response upon the insertion of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  samples into the bone or muscle. In vitro experimentation has exhibited the absence of mutations and good viability of cells cultured on this material leading to the use of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  in the manufacturing of hip head prostheses. The mechanical properties of zirconia fixed partial dentures (FPDs) have proven to be superior to other ceramic/composite restorations and hence leading to their significant applications in implant supported rehabilitations. Recent developments were focused on the synthesis of zirconia based dental materials. More recently, zirconia has been introduced in prosthetic dentistry for the fabrication of crowns and fixed partial dentures in combination with computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques. This systematic review covers the results of past as well as recent scientific studies on the properties of zirconia based ceramics such as their specific compositions, microstructures, mechanical strength, biocompatibility and other applications in dentistry.

# 1. Introduction

The etymology of the word 'ceramic' derives from the Greek word keramos, which means pottery or burnt article. Today, the word 'ceramic' has a more expansive meaning and includes materials such as glass, advanced ceramics and cement systems as well. Ceramics are generally inorganic, nonmetallic solids synthesized by proper heat treatment and subsequent cooling. They are related to a combination of covalent, ionic, and seldom metallic bonding. Ceramic materials may be crystalline, partly crystalline or non-crystalline. $^{1}$  Crystalline ceramics are composed of either pure or glass ceramics.  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  based ceramics have been considered to be very important materials for medical device applications. $^{2-6}$

$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  is a bioceramic that was first investigated by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789. The first research paper on the use of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  as a biomaterial was published by Helmer and Driskel in 1969. In the last ten years, the use of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based ceramics as a biomaterial for implants and dental crowns in dentistry has risen significantly, due to the superior mechanical properties of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ , such as its high mechanical strength, biocompatibility, as well as its very high wear resistance and friction. In the research field of dentistry, the use of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  in dental restoration applications has been a practice since 1998 due to its very high strength for load bearing as dental crowns, fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and dental implants. Therefore,  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  takes a remarkable place amongst the various oxide ceramics due to its excellent mechanical as well as biocompatible properties. It is well known that the different stages of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  polymorphs are temperature dependent; at ambient pressure, zirconia can assume three crystallographic forms. Pure zirconia is monoclinic (m), under ambient conditions. With increasing temperature, the material transforms to a tetragonal crystal structure (t) at  $\sim 1170^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and then to a cubic crystal structure (c), followed by a fluorite structure at  $\sim 2370^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  with melting at  $2716^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .
Fig. 1 Crystallographic phase change with the variation of temperature of the three  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  phases. $^{17,18}$

The  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  ceramic shows a hysteretic, martensitic  $\mathrm{t} \rightarrow \mathrm{m}$  transformation during the heating and cooling processes, while its reversible transformation occurs at  $\sim 950^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  upon cooling. Pure zirconia along with various stabilizing oxides such as CaO, MgO,  $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  or  $\mathrm{CeO_2}$  allows the retention of the tetragonal structure at room temperature. Therefore, it controls stress-induced transformations. It is reported that  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  has a high temperature stability and melting point (2680 °C), high hardness (1200-1350 HVN), a high thermal expansion coefficient ( $>10 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ ), low thermal conductivity ( $<1 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ ) and a high thermo-shock resistance ( $\Delta T = 400 - 500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ).<sup>10</sup> All possible crystallographic phase changes with temperature are shown in Fig. 1.<sup>17,18</sup>

# 2. Stabilizing high temperature phases of zirconia

The doping of various oxides that are dissolvable in zirconia  $\mathrm{(CaO, MgO, Y_2O_3)}$  lowers the crystal structure from tetragonal to monoclinic (t-m) and cubic to tetragonal (c-t) phase transformation temperatures. This doping is therefore said to be stabilizing the high temperature phases. The amount of alloying oxide required to produce this respective stabilization is determined from the relevant phase diagram, which can be seen in Fig. 2 for the zirconia-yttria system.[19] In principle, any composition which is sintered in the cubic phase and retains a wholly cubic crystal structure on cooling is considered to be fully stabilized. The continued possession of the tetragonal phase at room temperature will also be feasible, provided that the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation is inhibited. This can be achieved by a combination of fine powders, matrix constraints and stabilizing additions of dopants.


In the recent years, the use of bioceramic restorations has increased due to their superior aesthetic appearance, biocompatibility, machinability and the absence of any metal content as compared to other materials.[20] Zirconia based bioceramic materials, especially yttria-tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZPs), have recently been included for prosthetic rehabilitations as a core material for single crowns, and conventional as

Y-TZP exhibits unusual physical and mechanical properties, such as high flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness, corrosion resistance, wear and tear under both acidic as well as basic ambient conditions, translucency, color stability, greater effectiveness of diagnostic radiographs and high biocompatibility.[23-25] To enhance the bonding between zirconia frameworks and veneering porcelain, surface roughness is increased with variable grained alumina based abrasives and the use of interlayers is also in current practice. Furthermore, in spite of the use of CAD/CAM, the final steps involving strong mechanical action on zirconia components must continue to be performed by dental technicians.[26,27] One of the first researchers who used CAD/CAM techniques for the fabrication of tooth restoration devices was Duret in the 1970s.[28] Fig. 3 shows a tooth crown fabricated from a pre-sintered zirconia core, which was milled using CAD/CAM (Cercon, Dentply).[29] Different important mechanical, thermal and electrical parameters of zirconia are listed in Table 1.

# 3. Advantages of zirconia and zirconia based ceramics

Zirconia is considered to be a suitable ceramic material for dental and other biomedical applications due to its high resistance to corrosion and light weight. In addition, zirconia based ceramics have superior properties such as high biocompatibility compared to other ceramics.[30,31] However, the properties

Robert received his M.S. degree in physics and his Ph.D. degree in solid-state physics from the University of Szeged, Hungary, in 1986 and 1997, respectively. He received the Bolyai Fellowship of the Hungarian Scientific Academy from 1999 to 2000. He also spent his sabbatical time as a Fellow of the Swedish Institute in The Ångström Laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden, from 1998 to 1999; as an Eötvös Fellow at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, from 1995 to 1996, and he also visited the Max Planck Institute in Göttingen, Germany in 1993 via the Max Planck Fellowship.

of zirconia based ceramics may be compromised when exposed to considerable heat and moisture. $^{32,33}$  In the late 1960s, zirconia was studied as a potential biomaterial known as tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZPs). It was found that its properties were ideal for the construction of hip prostheses as well as for dental restorations. In 1975, British physicist Ron Garvie found that the tetragonal structure of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  could be stabilized by doping of  $\sim 5.5\%$  yttrium oxide, resulting in an extremely hard and tough ceramic material. This process improved its mechanical properties and enhanced its high biological stability. Furthermore, zirconium's sheer strength prompted its nickname, 'ceramic steel', and over the past two decades it has debuted in the field of dentistry first for the fabrication of strong crowns, and more recently as a strong, tooth-colored and metal-free dental implant material. Zirconia has mechanical properties very similar to that of stainless steel. Its resistance to traction lies in the range of  $900 - 1200\mathrm{MPa}$  and its effective compression resistance is  $\sim 2000\mathrm{MPa}$ . $^{34}$  Decades of research have shown that a zirconia bridge can retain its strength even after a time period of 50 years. In addition, studies have also reported that zirconium is extremely biocompatible, and does not cause allergic symptoms to human beings during implantation processes. $^{35}$

Other significant advantages of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  over other ceramics include: (i) natural: zirconium implants are extremely advantageous over titanium or any other metal implants for the jaw in order to create fixed teeth replacements. Therefore,  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implants are a holistic, natural choice for dental implants. (ii) Hygienic: zirconium dental implants are shown to retain less plaque than their titanium counterparts, which will promote healthier gums around the implant. (iii) Aesthetics:

zirconium has the advantage of its bright and white tooth like color, which as a base for a tooth replacement, appears even more natural than crowns with metal implants underneath. The white color of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  implants also eliminates the possibility of a darkened gum line that sometimes occurs due to metal implants. (iv) Strength: zirconium is the second strongest material found in nature (next to diamond), and the strength of zirconium implants is equal to that of titanium implants. (v) Biocompatible: zirconium is inert in nature and therefore it does not cause any allergic reactions. Moreover, it shows extraordinary toughness and resistance against wear and tear. The comparative characteristics of some ceramics for biomedical applications have been listed in Table 2. $^{36,37}$

# 4. Types of zirconia used in dentistry

In spite of the fact that there are so many different types of zirconia, only three types of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  are used to date in dentistry.[38,39] The first of these types are zirconia ceramics with at least two  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  tetragonal phases as a minor phase dispersed and precipitated, respectively. The origin and details of the stabilization of the tetragonal phase differ among these three toughened microstructures. These have evolved as researchers and manufacturers have sought to exploit the different properties of the various phases of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  that form at different temperatures (as discussed in section 1). These phases are stable at high temperatures and need to be frozen in such a manner that they can be used at room temperature, while others exploit toughening mechanisms that are only found in these and a few other materials. The three materials share the requirement of stabilizing the tetragonal phase whereas toughening involves the martensitic transformation. The raw materials of zirconia are the minerals zircon  $(\mathrm{ZrSiO_4})$  and baddeleyite  $(\beta -\mathrm{ZrO_2})$ .

# 4.1 Magnesium partially stabilized zirconia (Mg-PSZ)

Mg-PSZ is reportedly an unsuitable composite for use in dentistry because of its high porosity and large grain size, which may lead to surface wear and large crack propagation. The sintering temperature of this type of zirconia is also much higher

(1680-1800 °C) than other composites. Furthermore, Mg-PSZ has poor stability, which may slightly lower the energy for tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. The microstructure of Mg-PSZ consists of an array of cubic zirconia partially stabilized by 8 to 10 percent (by mol) of magnesium oxide. Due to the difficulty in obtaining free silica, Mg-PSZ precursors  $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_2\right)$ , magnesium silicates can form a low content of magnesia, favoring the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation and resulting in lower mechanical properties and stability of the synthesized material. Fully sintered blocks have been manufactured with this material and require rigid and strong machining systems. A dental ceramic system called Denzir-M (Dentronic AB, Skellefteå, Sweden) is an example of a fully sintered Mg-PSZ ceramic for dental crown and bridgework.[40] Fig. 4 shows the microstructural features of the major categories of transformation of toughened zirconia with

The composition ranges studied successfully, along with the aging temperatures used are shown in Fig. 5. $^{45}$  It was soon realized that the aging kinetics of sintering and appropriately cooled Mg-PSZ materials above the eutectoid temperature was too rapid to control the tetragonal precipitate crystal growth and therefore enabled the production of material properties suitable for a variety of industrial applications.


# 4.2 Zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA)

It is reported that the nanocomposites of  $\mathrm{Al_2O_3 - ZrO_2}$  have a high resistance with respect to crack propagation, which can improve the lifetime and reliability of ceramic joint prostheses.[46,47] At room temperature, the stability of the tetragonal phase did not initially involve the use of doping, but instead is controlled by the grain size, morphology and particle size (intra- or inter-granular). The possibility to synthesize  $\mathrm{Al_2O_3 - ZrO_2}$  nanocomposites has been evidenced by refining powder processing using a new colloidal synthetic route.[48,49] These new composites can exhibit not only greater toughness but more importantly, a greater threshold for the stress intensity factor, under which crack propagation does not take place. Although there is a relatively low concentration of zirconia, i.e. 10 percent in volume, in these composites, they show a similar hardness value in comparison with other materials such as  $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  and are not susceptible to the hydrothermal instability observed in some cases of stabilized zirconia bioceramics. In  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  toughened alumina, for example, particles above a critical size will transform to the monoclinic symmetry upon cooling to room temperature.[50] Since, this tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation is known to be martensitic, thus, a useful way to describe particle size effects is to examine their influence on the martensitic start

(Ms) temperature; essentially all tetragonal phase stabilization can be viewed as decreasing the value of Ms to below room temperature. Such investigations have suggested that the particle size effect is likely due to difficulties in nucleating the phase transformation. However, consideration has also been given to the possible effects of surface and strain energy and chemical free energy driving forces. In contrast to the other two classes, the stability of the tetragonal* (*indicating metastability*) phase at room temperature does not primarily involve the use of dopants, but rather is controlled instead by the particle size, particle morphology and location (intra- or inter-granular; Fig. 4a).

# 4.3 Yttria full stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP)

The addition of approximately 2 to 3 percent of yttria,  $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  by mol as a stabilizing agent in  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  allows the sintering of fully tetragonal fine-grained zirconia ceramic materials made of 100 percent small metastable tetragonal grains, known as Y-TZP.[51] The TZP stabilized with 3 mol percent of 3Y-TZP zirconia has been utilized for different dental applications since the mechanical properties are similar to that of metals, whereas the color approximates that of natural teeth. To date, studies on the potential of 3Y-TZP zirconia bioceramics in dental applications continue to increase. Therefore, more information and further detailed studies are needed to identify the capabilities of these materials as bio-compatible. 3Y-TZP has superior mechanical properties than those of other  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based materials. Like poly-crystalline materials, 3Y-TZP shows low porosity and very high density.[52] The grain size significantly influences the mechanical properties of zirconia 3Y-TZP, whereas high temperature and longer sintering periods produce larger grain sizes and will subsequently diminish the mechanical properties due to large pore sizes.[53] Therefore, higher sintering temperatures lead to larger grain sizes. Consequently, the sintering process becomes the determining factor and thus the process control needs to be emphasized.

The 3Y-TZP bioceramic consists of an array of partially stabilized zirconia with  $2\mathrm{mol}$  percent of  $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ . The  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  fine grains (usually  $<0.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) with small concentrations of  $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  stabilizers can contain up to 98 percent of the metastable tetragonal phase after sintering. The main feature of this microstructure is to be formed by tetragonal grains of uniform diameter in the order of nanometers, sometimes combined with a small fraction of the cubic phase. As explained above, the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is suitable for optical and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications due to its high refractive index and electrical conductivity, low absorption coefficient and high opacity in the visible and infrared spectra. The critical grain size for this material is in the order of  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$ , i.e. if the size exceeds  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$ , then 3Y-TZP becomes prone to phase transformation toughening because of the its lower stability. Meanwhile, if the grain size is smaller than  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$ , this phenomenon does not occur. In addition, zirconia having a grain size below  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}$  does not undergo this phase transformation toughening and thus its fracture toughness decreases.[54] 3Y-TZP was first applied in the medical field of orthopedics, with significant success due to its good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Prosthetic restorations with 3Y-TZP are obtained by milling pre-sintered blocks, followed by either another subsequent sintering performed at a high temperature, or by machining sintered blocks completely. Fig. 6(a and b) display the scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of different zirconia 3Y-TZP bioceramic blocks.[55] The blocks are machined with the help of CAD/CAM systems and in the case of pre-sintered blocks, prosthetic restorations are pre-shaped into a size 25 to 30 percent higher than desired (depending on the batch compositions) to compensate for the sintering, or shrinkage in the final product. The final sintering temperature is between 1350 and  $1550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .[56] This processing reduces the level of tension present and prevents the transformation from the tetragonal to monoclinic phase, which leads to a final surface virtually free of the monoclinic phase.

# 5. Biocompatibility of zirconia and zirconia composite ceramics

The allergic reaction produced by some metal alloys is a disadvantage of metal ceramic restorations which in turn has led to the increase in the demand of more biocompatible ceramic implants for restorations. However, the degree of cytotoxicity of the metal alloys largely depends on the type of dental alloy used in the fabrication of metal ceramic restorations.[57] Generally, zirconia based ceramics are chemically inert materials, which have no adverse effect or general tissue reactions. As the ceramic prostheses are made with highly polished surfaces, they can contact the gum tissue and assist in the maintenance of the gingival architecture. Depending on the smoothness, the ceramics prevent the build-up of plaque, creating a favorable surface for gingival tissues. Zirconia based materials, allowing good cell adhesion and no adverse systemic reactions have been associated with it. However, particles from the degradation of zirconia at low temperatures or from the manufacturing processes can be released, promoting an immune localized inflammatory reaction.


The biocompatibility of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  has been extensively evaluated and both in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the high biocompatibility of Y-TZP with the use of very pure zirconia powders that have been purged of their radioactive content.[58-65] No local or systemic adverse reactions were reported to this material.[66,67] Recent studies have demonstrated that fewer bacteria accumulate around the Y-TZP material than titanium, which can be potentially explained by different protein adsorption properties.[68-71] Additionally, the release of metal ions may cause gingiva discoloration, which would further decrease the visual aesthetics.[72] Besides promoting high cosmetic requirements, other advantageous properties of ceramic materials are the biocompatibility and chemical stability. The strongest dental ceramic commercially available is 3 mol percent of yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (3Y-TZPs), shortened as zirconia. This material has become the most popular choice for the dental core and multiple units' framework.[73] The biocompatibility of the  $(\mathrm{Y,Nb})\text{-}\mathrm{ZrO}_2 / \mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  composite was evaluated by means of an in vitro cytotoxicity test and an in vivo subcutaneous implant test.[74,75] Recently, Joon Kim et al. reported the biocompatibility of the  $(\mathrm{Y,Nb})\text{-}\mathrm{TZP} / \mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  composite abutments for dental implants. This biocomposite material was prepared by using 20 mol percent of  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  as a dopant and exhibited a highest strength of the order of  $700\mathrm{MPa}$ , toughness of  $8.1\mathrm{MPa}\mathrm{m}^{1/2}$  and showed no hydrothermal degradation while aging in an autoclave. The biocompatibility of the composite ceramic exhibited no cytotoxicity and no significant adverse soft tissue response for up to a 3 month implant period in guinea pigs. The cell growth and survival test micrographs are shown in Fig. 7(a and b) and exhibit a favorable response of L929 fibroblast cells on  $(\mathrm{Y,Nb})\text{-}\mathrm{TZP} / \mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  specimens, such as an increased cell number according to the culture time and maintenance of a normal cell morphology.[76]  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  bio-composite ceramic was successfully processed via spark plasma sintering (SPS) at  $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $5\mathrm{min}$ . They reported that the strong adherence and the absence of cracking at the interfaces indicated the matching of fracture toughness gradation, providing a cushioning between composite layers of functionally graded materials (FGM). However, a desired variation in porosity could not be achieved. Successive cell culture experiments using L929 fibroblast and Saos-2 osteoblast like cells provided clear evidence of cell adhesion and cell proliferation on the surface of FGM, indicating good cyto-compatibility as shown in Fig. 7(c-f). In vitro and in vivo studies have also confirmed a high biocompatibility of zirconia and composite dental ceramics based on it, especially when it is completely purified of its radioactive contents. The biocompatibility of alumina-zirconia composites was investigated by Konduk et al. Tissue reactions of test materials were performed using rats for a two month duration. As the amount of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  is increased, mullite formation became visible on the particle boundaries. Animal studies have revealed that these ceramic composites do not have any adverse effects on the tissue investigated histologically. Zeng et al. developed a new type of gradient ceramic biomaterial.  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  was selected as the substrate and the  $\mathrm{Na_2O - SiO_2 - B_2O_3 - CaO}$  glass system was chosen as a medium

After a 3 month implantation period in the leg bone of a canine, the gradient bioactive implant bonded with the bone and the bonding strength between the gradient bioactive material implant and bone was much higher than that between a pulse titanium implant and bone. In vivo studies of carbon-carbon composites showed the accumulation of platelets on the exposed surface material with any surface morphology, whereas platelet concentration in the blood remained constant.[82]

# 5.1 Biocompatibility in soft tissues

Several studies on various animals like rabbits, rats, mice, dogs and monkeys have reported on the behavior of zirconia based ceramics implanted into soft tissues. These in vivo tests performed with different physical pins, bars, wear particles and structural forms (TZP, PSZ, or coatings) of zirconia in different sites of implantation led to the analysis of systemic toxicity and adverse reactions in the implanted soft tissues. Only a few studies have dealt with PSZ in rodent muscles compared with alumina. When implanted in the para-spinal muscles of rats for up to 12 weeks, zirconia polycrystals (Y-PSZ) tended to become encapsulated with fibrous tissue as observed for alumina control samples. Similarly, Y-PSZ ceramic elicited the same response to alumina controls when implanted subcutaneously into rats for a period of up to 12 months. Both materials became encapsulated by a thin layer of fibrous tissue, which was independent of the implantation time. In all cases,  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  did not bring out any form of adverse tissue reaction, suggesting that zirconia is a biocompatible ceramic material. In conclusion, zirconia (despite the physical form tested) does not succeed in causing cytotoxicity in soft tissues even if fibers were found in lymph nodes after intraperitoneal injection.[83-85] Degidi et al. compared soft tissue reactions to  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and titanium; they reported that inflammatory infiltrate, micro-vessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor expressions appeared higher throughout the titanium implant than around those of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . Moreover, cellular proliferation on  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  surfaces is higher than that on titanium ones.[86]


In vitro biocompatibility is also evaluated using cell cultures which interact with the biomaterial; zirconia is currently used as the femoral ball head in total hip replacements (THR) and thus will make contact with soft tissues and blood cells in vivo.[87] Zirconia powders were tested with different cell lines (Table 3) and some authors observed that  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  has no cytotoxic effects when fibroblasts were co-cultured with it or with extracts using different methods (viability of cells and MTT assay).[88,89] Scanning electron microscopy studies also reported the adhesion and spreading of 3T3 fibroblasts.[90] On the other hand, a higher inhibition of cellular growth using zirconia and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) powders rather than alumina or hydroxyapatite was observed in direct contact with cell viability and MTT assays. These observations were confirmed successively[91] when the cytotoxicity of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2 - Y_2O_3}$  on human lymphocyte mitogens was compared with the one observed in cultures of alumina and titania powders. All the materials tested (grain size  $\leq 44~\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) showed a dose dependent lymphocyte mitogen inhibition. Alumina and zirconia cytotoxicities were similar and both were lower than that of  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  rutile. Specially, the cytotoxicity of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  powders (ceramic precursors) was higher than the cytotoxicity of powders obtained by the crushing and milling of sintered  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  ceramics. Ion release was tested in a saline solution at a temperature of  $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (to  $0.12~\mu \mathrm{g~cm}^{-2}$ ) from plates of high density sintered materials (HIP,  $160\mathrm{MPa}$ ,  $1225^{\circ}\mathrm{C}, 2\mathrm{h}$ ). In an acid solution, (lactic acid  $0.02\mathrm{M}$  at  $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) yttrium and zirconium ions increased (to  $3\mu \mathrm{g~cm}^{2}$ ), leading to the conclusion that  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  ceramics cannot be used in an acidic environment i.e. the oral cavity.


# 5.2 Biocompatibility in hard tissues

The first comparative results with  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and other implanted materials like  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  have previously been reported by Wagner and Christel, who used pins of zirconia (Y-TZP) or alumina inserted into the femurs of rabbits and did not observe any difference in the bone reaction to implants.[92,93] Bar and cylinder forms of the implants were also implanted in the bones of rats, rabbits, and mice without inducing or causing any local or systemic toxic effects after the insertion of yttria-stabilized zirconia. Finally, it appeared that the various forms of zirconia tested in hard tissues do not induce any adverse reaction or global toxic effects. Moreover, in light of these biocompatibility tests, it became evident that zirconia, no matter the physical, or structural form tested, is a biocompatible material.

# 6. Dental applications of zirconia based composite ceramic materials

# 6.1 Zirconia based implants

The reported studies demonstrate a bone implant contact for zirconia dental implants, very similar to those of titanium implants, and these findings suggest that  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  dental implants can reach firm stability in bones. More recently, the osseo-integration of zirconia dental implants was histologically demonstrated in one human patient.[94] In this study, a two-piece zirconia implant was placed in the maxilla of a healthy woman and 6 months after surgery, the retrieval of the dental implant was performed. The surrounding soft and hard tissues were gathered and processed for histological evaluation and the processed sample of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  dental implants provided the histological evidence of osseo-integration. Moreover, the SEM analyses exhibited very good maintenance of the crestal bone level; in fact, it was possible to evaluate the observations that the first bone-to-implant contact was occlusal to the implant abutment junction. This finding can be related to the excellent characteristics of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  dental implants which present high biocompatibility and low plaque adhesion.[95] Another retrospective study suggests that  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  endosseous implants can achieve a survival rate similar to that of titanium implants with healthy and stable soft and hard tissues. In the work by Brull et al.,[96] 121 zirconia implants (66 two-piece implants and 55 one-piece implants) were inserted in 74 patients. After a mean observation period of 18 months, the cumulative implant survival rate was  $96.5\%$ . The clinical examination revealed that the probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were significantly lower around implants than around the teeth (mean PPD of  $1.8 \pm 0.4$  mm; mean BOP scores of  $4.1\% \pm 4.2\%$ ), whereas the radiographic evaluation demonstrated that peri-implant marginal bone levels were stable (mean bone loss of  $0.1 \pm 0.6$  mm) after the three-year follow-up.

Kohl et al. reported an all ceramic custom made  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implant crown system for the replacement of a single tooth.[97] The experimental study which was carried out on the mean bone implant surface of rabbits was reported to be  $\sim 68.4\%$ . Sennerby compared the osseo-integration and removal torque of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implants, titanium oxide implants, and zirconia with a modified surface when these were inserted in the tibia and femur of rabbits. He concluded that although osseo-integration appeared similar between the different samples, the removal torque of the pure zirconia implant was lower than those of the other two implants, suggesting that surface modification can improve  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implant stability.[98] Titanium implants with a coronal base in  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  are also available, the aim of which is to combine the safety of titanium with the aesthetic features of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ .[99] Moreover, an in vitro experimental study pointed out that  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implants are able to sustain chewing stresses nicely. The cyclical mechanical resistance of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implants with ceramic restorations in comparison with that of traditional implant prosthodontic restorations was reported. The mean fracture load after cyclical stress in titanium-porcelain fused to metal restorations amounted to  $668.6\mathrm{~N}$ , whereas for zirconia implants with all ceramic restorations fracture occurred at a mean load of  $555.5\mathrm{~N}$ . It was concluded that  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  implants are able to bear fatigue and stresses sufficiently well for anterior teeth implant replacements. Suarez studied the outcome 3 years after the placement of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  ceramic restorations on 18 teeth. Only one tooth failed after the experimental period because of radicular fracture. According to this study, it is possible to consider  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  restorations as reliable and durable for clinical applications.[100] In terms of periodontal health, none of the studies reported any difference or noted any changes in the biological characteristics of the soft and hard tissues around the zirconia-based restorations. Although some data quantified and explored distinction in the biocompatibility of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$ , no instances of gingival inflammation or periodontitis could be shown.[101] These findings have led to the suggestion that  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  may be a suitable material for manufacturing implant abutments with a low bacterial colonization potential. Recently, Zafiropoulos et al. reported in their clinical study over a period of 3 years of study that none of the patients reported any unusual pain or discomfort, nor the presence of abscesses, swelling, or allergic reactions during the course of treatment. In addition, no implants or natural teeth were lost during the observation period. Furthermore, no fractures and failures were observed in the  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  abutments, the superstructures, or the ceramic veneers as shown in Fig. 8.[102]


In further studies, a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing zirconia and titanium abutments supported by 40 single implants was published. $^{103}$  After being in function for three years, 18 zirconia and 10 titanium abutments were followed up in a study. Both abutment materials exhibited survival rates of  $100\%$  as well as similar biological and esthetic outcomes. In an adult pig animal study, it was shown that the collagen fiber orientation was similar around  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and titanium implant necks. For both ceramic as well as metallic materials, the fibers run parallel-oblique and parallel to the implant surface. $^{104}$  More recently, in a clinical study, a similar degree of plaque accumulation was found at  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and titanium abutments for the period of three years. In the same study, when  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  abutments were used as a restoration support, there was no significant difference in bone levels between  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and titanium abutments after a 3-year follow-up. $^{105}$

# 6.2 Zirconia based esthetic orthodontic brackets

Orthodontic brackets are passive components of fixed orthodontic appliance bonded to the enamel which provide the means to transfer the force applied by the activated arch-wire to the tooth. Besides the dental applications that were mentioned previously,  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  has also been applied for the fabrication of esthetic orthodontic brackets.[106] The recent introduction of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based ceramics as a restorative dental material has generated considerable interest in the dental community. According to Koutayas et al.,[107]  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based orthodontic brackets can be technologically feasible with the development of
Fig. 8 Three-year clinical view. (a) Zirconia copings. (b) Zirconia implant abutment. $^{102}$

CAD/CAM systems. High-strength  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  frameworks can be viable for the fabrication of full and partial coverage crowns, fixed partial dentures, veneers, posts and cores, primary double crowns, implant abutments, and implants. Heravi states that in the future, the reduction in the curing time and change in the light direction may increase the bond strength and reduce enamel fracture during debonding processes.[108]

Polycrystalline  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  brackets, which reportedly have the greatest toughness amongst all ceramic materials, have been offered as an alternative to  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ceramic brackets.[109] They are cheaper than crystalline  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ceramic brackets but are very opaque and can exhibit intrinsic colors making them less aesthetically favorable. Favorable sliding properties have been reported with both stainless steel and nickel-titanium archwires along with reduced plaque adhesion and clinically acceptable bond strengths and bond failure loci at the bracket/ adhesive interface.[110] Therefore, Y-TZP orthodontic brackets provide enhanced strength, superior resistance to deformation and wear, reduced plaque adhesion and improved aesthetics.[111]

# 6.3 Zirconia-based crowns and bridges

Dental crowns are the caps that mimic the teeth by capping and encircling the teeth, reconstructing their shape, size and durability. The crowns are bonded to the tooth using dental cement (resin or acid-base cements, the powder is a metal oxide or silicate and the liquid is acidic), hiding the visible part of the tooth below and above the gum line.[112] Advanced zirconium based crowns are taking the place of ordinary metal and porcelain crowns. The advantage of this combination is the natural translucency of the crown, which makes it possible to successfully mimic a natural tooth.  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  is often used for anterior teeth due to the metal base not being able to be seen in a ray of light.  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  based restoration has superior mechanical properties (fracture toughness, strength and hardness) comparable to that of the metal based materials $^{113,114}$  which is why it is feasible to prepare all ceramic crowns, bridges and implants, $^{115}$  making it a hot issue in stomatology. $^{116-120}$  The  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  crown for dental applications is shown in Fig. 9. $^{121}$  Tsalouchou carried out a study of  $50~\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  crowns, comparing fracture resistance of two types of veneer ceramic: injected ceramic and stratified ceramic over  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  cores. The mean resistance for the groups was ZirCAD + ZirPress  $(2135.6 \pm 330.1\mathrm{N})$  and ZirCAD + IPS e.max Ceram  $(2189.9 \pm 317.6\mathrm{N})$ , without a statistically significant difference. $^{122}$  Another important argument is the durability of a crown compared to all ceramic crowns, which are also aesthetically favorable, but are totally unacceptable for the posterior teeth. Clinical studies have revealed a high rate of fracture for porcelain veneered  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based restorations that varies between 6 and  $15\%$  over a 3-5 year-period. $^{123}$  These are high values compared to the  $4\%$  fracture rate shown by conventional metal ceramic restorations over 10 years, as shown in Fig. 10a. $^{124}$  The cause of these fractures is still a mystery, but might be associated with bond failure between the veneered porcelain and the  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  structure. The  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  porcelain interface may be involved in crazing and

Stresses could be related to surface properties, as bulk thermal expansion or contraction mismatches do not appear to be the cause. $^{125}$  According to Heintze and Rousson, $^{126}$  the chipping of veneered porcelain can be classified by severity and the treatment required for repair as follows:
Fig. 10 Different grades of the crowns: (a) chipping of the ceramic veneer on ceramo-metallic restoration, (b) grade 1 chipping of a zirconia full-coverage crown (tooth 41) and (c) grade 2 of a zirconia full-coverage crown (tooth 44).<sup>123</sup>


Grade 1: small surface chipping. Treatment: polishing the restoration surface (Fig. 10b). Grade 2: moderate surface chipping. Treatment: use of a resin composite repair system (Fig. 10c). Grade 3: severe veneer ceramic chipping with exposure to the  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  core. Treatment: replacement of the damaged prosthesis. Literature reviews show that the most frequent types of  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  based fixed dental prosthesis chipping are grades 1 and 2, which do not show restoration failure.[127]

After these observations regarding  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based crowns and bridges we shift the focus to the behavior of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  as an abutment material. The clinical applications of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  for abutment can be divided into two main areas: first are the pre and custom fabricated  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  posts for endodontic treated roots. Although, this procedure has been advocated by few dental clinicians, the use of single visit fiber posts has proven to be the method of choice when an endodontic treated tooth needs to receive an endodontic post and build up a  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  abutment for oral implant reconstructions. Zirconia as an implant abutment material as shown in Fig. 11, was first introduced in 1996.[128] Based on its mechanical properties with the high fracture toughness compared to all other ceramics,[129] zirconia seems not to be prone to fractures in clinical practice. In fact, until today there has been no report on fractures of zirconia implant abutments in any clinical study.[130] However, long term clinical trials on zirconia abutments are scarce and based on observation periods of three to six years.[131,132] Furthermore, most of the studies on  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  abutments are case reports. For example, only four patients with six implants were treated in one of the aforementioned studies with the longest follow up time of six years.[133] Sailer et al. investigated 58 zirconia bridges fabricated by the direct ceramic machining system clinically. $^{133}$  Their results exhibited a survival rate of 84 percent in a period of 3.5 years. Minor porcelain chipping was reported in 11 percent of the bridges. Tinschert et al. fabricated 65 zirconia bridges with the DCS President® system and observed the zirconia bridges for a mean period of three years and reported a small chipping of the veneering material in 6 percent of the bridges, which showed a cumulative survival rate of 86 percent. $^{134}$  More recently, Rismanchian et al. reported that both Biodenta  $(\mathrm{ZrO}_2,$ $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ ,  $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3)$  and Cercon  $(\mathrm{ZrO}_2,\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3,\mathrm{HfO}_2,\mathrm{SiO}_2,\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3)$  systems can withstand biting force (even para functions) in posterior implant supported  $\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  based bridges and no significant differences were observed between the two systems. $^{135}$

6.3.1 Thermal induced residual stress effect in zirconia veneer crowns. Residual stresses within the veneer are linked to the high prevalence of veneer chipping observed in clinical trials of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  prostheses.[136] Belli et al. hypothesized that the thermal mismatch between the  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  infrastructure and the veneer porcelain, as well as the rate used for cooling zirconia veneer crowns, would be directly proportional to the magnitude of residual stresses built within the veneer layers. Two porcelains with different coefficients of thermal expansion were used to veneer  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  copings in order to create high or low thermal mismatches.[137]

Lohbauer et al. [137] reported the results on the fracture of a veneered  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  dental prosthesis from an inner thermal crack fractographic analysis and showed that the fracture of dental prostheses may initiate from internal thermal flaws, and not exclusively from contact cracks, radial cracks or marginal defects. The fracture origin in the presented research work was a thermal flaw that resulted from the layering technique. Fracture was induced by sliding contact loading and expedited by an internal flaw embedded in the veneering material under considerable thermal residual stresses. Other manufacturing techniques that avoid incremental sintering of the veneer might come as a more reliable option. [138] Overall, the resultant residual stresses in bilayer prostheses are a superimposition of stresses generated during cooling and stresses due to the mismatch  $(\Delta \alpha)$  in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between the core and the veneer. The low thermal diffusivity of the framework in zirconia veneer bilayer systems results in higher temperatures at the interface during cooling in comparison with other infrastructure materials. [139] Thermal gradients within the veneer are aggravated for faster cooling rates due to the less relaxed state of the veneer as the temperature falls through the glass transition temperature,  $T_{\mathrm{g}}$  range. [140] These conditions place  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  based prostheses under a high risk of veneer fracture and the high incidence of chipping reported in clinical trials seems to support the mathematical predictions only. [141,142] However, available data on the magnitude and spatial distributions of residual stresses in zirconia veneer bilayers are usually analytical or experimentally measured using simple geometries. [143-145]

Later on a third variable was introduced in the form of surface treatment, where copings were sandblasted or left sintered prior to veneering. Through differences in core exposure experiences after failure, the effect of sandblasting on the bonding between the core and veneer can be qualitatively evaluated afterwards. A conventional static load to failure test and a more clinically relevant chewing simulation cyclic fatigue test were used and compared. A four to five-fold stress increase was observed for the high CTE mismatch in comparison with the low mismatch combination. The higher cooling rate had a small influence on the stress increase, especially for the low mismatch combination. The mechanical data evaluation showed that while the compression test could not show clear differences between variables, the fatigue test showed a higher sensitivity to detect reliability variations regarding states of thermal stress within the veneers. Differences in the magnitude and distribution of cooling and thermal mismatch induced stresses within the veneer layer of bilayer systems affect crack behavior and theoretically print their effects on the fracture surfaces.[146] However, this effect can be seen using indentation tests on tempered or slowly cooled porcelain discs, which result in differences in crack lengths for surfaces under compressive or tensile residual stresses.[147-149] Under the same applied load, residual tensile stresses result in longer cracks, while compressive stresses tend to shorten them. A significant increase in the characteristic cycles to failure was observed for crowns that were built using a veneer with a coefficient of thermal expansion close to that of the zirconia core, indicating that the lifetime of zirconia based prostheses could benefit from low thermal mismatch combinations. That was the case, however, only for the condition of a fast cooling rate, so that slow cooling protocols may be employed to minimize stresses arising from large thermal mismatches. Before stronger evidence could be supplied, some authors have suggested that sandblasting the  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  surface prior to veneering could improve the interfacial quality by increasing its roughness.[150] In vitro studies on dental ceramics have used fractography, so as to locate crack initiation sites and calculate fracture toughness and stress at failure from crack size measurements.[151-155] Eventually, the results on the fracture of a veneered  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  dental prosthesis from an inner thermal crack fractographic analysis showed that fractures of dental prostheses may initiate from internal thermal flaws, and not exclusively from contact cracks, radial cracks or marginal defects. The fracture origin was a thermal flaw that resulted from the layering technique. Fracture was induced by sliding contact loading and expedited by an internal flaw embedded in a veneering material under considerable thermal residual stresses. Other manufacturing techniques that avoid incremental sintering of the veneer might come as a more reliable option.


6.3.2 Surface treatments of zirconia. In spite of the high mechanical strength, zirconia based ceramics have poor bond strength after conventional bond cementation procedures, requiring different surface treatment methods.[156] The clinical success of ceramic restorations depends on the cementation process.[157] Adhesive cementation to  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  ceramics is desirable[158] since it improves retention,[159,160] marginal adaptation, and fracture resistance,[161] reduces the possibility of recurrent decay,[162,163] and enables more conservative cavity preparations. Different methods to promote adequate adhesion between the resin cement and  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  have been proposed. These methods include the use of a phosphate modified monomer (MDP) in the resin cement, $^{164-168}$  laboratory or chair side airabrasion with 110 and  $30~\mu \mathrm{m}$  Si-coated aluminum particles, $^{169-171}$  the use of zirconate coupler primers, $^{172}$  tetraethoxysilane flame treat device usage, $^{173}$  the use of organo functional silanes, $^{174,175}$  laser irradiation, $^{176}$  the Si vapor phase deposition method, $^{177}$  and the selective infiltration etching procedure. $^{178-180}$


The most common surface treatment method (STM) for adhesive cementation to ceramic restorations is based either on micromechanical bonds that is bonds obtained with hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching and particle sandblasting or on chemical bonds, which is obtained by the application of a silane coupling agent. HF removes the glassy matrix of glass ceramics creating a high surface energy substrate with microporosities for the penetration and polymerization of resin composites, which is enabling a micromechanical interlocking. However, HF etching does not produce any change in the arithmetic roughness of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . The negligible effect of the HF on the  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  surface occurs due to the absence of the glassy matrix, resulting in low bond strength values. The surface treatment with primers containing functional monomers such as MDP (Alloy Primer and Clearfil Ceramic Primer, Kuraray Medical Inc., Japan) or other phosphoric acid acrylate monomers (Metal/Zirconia Primer, Ivoclar Vivadent) is often recommended to improve the bonding strength of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . Since results are not always significant, the combination of primers and air abrasion methods tends to produce a better bond strength, especially in the long term. The use of new zirconia primers (a mixture of organophosphate and carboxylic acid monomers) or a phosphonic acid monomer (6-MHPA) has been tested showing good immediate results. Different types of silanes have been studied, but none of them was able to show high effectiveness in surfaces with an absent or reduced Si content as the surface of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . In addition, siloxane bonds may be sensitive to hydrolytic degradation, affecting the stability of the adhesive interface. Organosilanes were also tested (3-methacryloyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, 3-acyloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, or 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane) with better results for the two first ones. The silane organo-functional groups are generally a methacrylate molecule, but acrylate groups are known to be more reactive than methacrylates. The 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane is a rare silane, which has not been reported to be used as an adhesion promoter in dental materials research. Si deposition by air abrasion might produce a more silane reactive surface, but it also tends to produce a surface with lower roughness and consequently a lower possibility of mechanical interlocking with resin cement. Some authors do not show lower roughness, but considering this might be a true observation, the enabled chemical interaction to resin cement or coupling agents would justify its use. Recent studies have shown promising results on the bond strengths of Y-TZP/resin cement after the glazed ceramic surface is subjected to air particle abrasion with  $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  and silanization or etching with HF acid, $^{200}$  but a stable bond promoted by these methods is questionable and needs more studies.


Kosmac et al.201,202 have reported the effects of dental grinding and sandblasting on the ageing and fatigue behavior of pressureless sintered biomedical grade Y-TZP ceramics. It was found that upon dental grinding and sandblasting, the surface of the material was heavily damaged and partially plastically deformed, but the amount of transformed monoclinic  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  was low. The partitioned tetragonal zirconia grains and pre-existing  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  zirconia in the ground and sandblasted surfaces hindered the propagation of the diffusion controlled transformation during subsequent ageing. Dental grinding at a high rotation speed lowered the mean strength under static loading and the survival rate under cyclic loading. Scherrer et al.203 showed that sandblasting yttria stabilized zirconia with  $30~\mu \mathrm{m}$  silica coated  $\mathrm{AlO}_3$  particles at 2.5 bar also improved the fatigue limits and survival probabilities of the Y-TZP materials tested. It can therefore be recommended as a last clinical step before cementation.

# 6.4 Zirconia based dental posts

For more than 250 years, dental clinicians have written about the placement of posts in the roots of teeth to retain restorations.[204] As early as 1728, Pierre Fauchard described the use of tenons, which were metal posts screwed into the roots of teeth to retain bridges. In the mid-1800s, wood replaced metal as the post material, and the pivot crown, a wooden post fitted to an artificial crown and to the canal of the root, was popular among dentists.[205] Often, these wooden posts would absorb fluids and expand, frequently causing root fractures. In the late 19th century, the Richmond crown, a single piece post retained crown with a porcelain facing, was engineered to function as a bridge retainer. During the 1930s, the custom cast post and core was developed to replace the one piece post crowns. This procedure required casting a post and core as a separate component from the crown. This 2-step technique improved marginal adaptation and allowed for a variation in the path of insertion of the crowns. The nonmetallic prefabricated posts have been developed as alternatives, including ceramic (white  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ ) and fiber reinforced resin posts.  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  posts have a high flexural strength, are biocompatible, and are highly corrosion resistant. However, this material is difficult to cut intra-orally with a diamond cutter, and to remove from the canal for retreatment.[206] The inherent high flexural strength of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  makes it useful not only for crowns, fixed partial dentures and implant abutments, but also for posts. In dental applications,  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  is used mostly in tetragonal crystalline phases that are partially stabilized with  $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ , providing flexural strength greater than  $1000\mathrm{MPa}$ . This makes  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  suitable also as a post material. Zirconia posts are available today in cylindrically, as well as conically, shaped designs. In terms of the surface quality, zirconia posts with slightly roughened finishes are preferred for good micromechanical retention to adhesive cements. While zirconia posts provide excellent radiographic opacity, the reported strength becomes a significant disadvantage if the post later needs to be retrieved. The likelihood of endodontic re-intervention therefore, needs to be considered. Clinical long term success, however, appears to be excellent for adhesively cemented zirconia posts with direct composite buildups.[207] The Metoxit AG company has been reported to produce root posts made of zirconia, which were produced starting in 1991. The key to their success was the hardening and tempering of the material by the HIP process. The advantage of the 'Metoxit process' is that root posts can be manufactured with very small diameters (as low as  $1.4\mathrm{mm}$ ), very narrow tolerances and high resistance to fracture. To date, this quality has not been matched either by injection moulding methods or by extrusion (Fig. 12a-c).[207]

Fig. 12 (a) Example of a product: root post made of zirconia ceramic, (b) root posts made of zirconia ceramic in the root canals for the build-ups and (c) the root posts can be fitted with ceramic build-ups by using the press technique.[207]

Recently, Abu Kasim et al.208 patented three types of multilayered composite materials that were produced using powders of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ , HAp, and Ti to develop newly designed functionally graded dental posts. Likewise, Abu Kasim et al.209 also investigated the stress distribution of a newly designed functionally graded dental post which consisted of a multilayer design of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ -Ti-HAp and was compared to posts fabricated from a homogeneous material such as titanium and zirconia. They reported that this new dental post exhibited several advantages in terms of stress distribution compared to posts fabricated from a homogeneous material. The stress and strain distribution at the post dentine interface of FGDP was better than that of homogeneous posts.

# 6.5 Zirconia in removable prosthodontics

The use of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  for the fabrication of a zirconia bar on implants and of a corresponding zirconia complete denture has also been reported. The technique utilizes a copy milling unit, that is a manually operated machine for the manufacture not only of frameworks but also of completely removable dentures.[210,211] Removable partial dentures are for patients who are missing some of their teeth on a particular arch. Fixed partial dentures, also known as a crown and bridge, are made from crowns that are fitted on the remaining teeth to act as abutments and prosthodontics made from materials to resemble the missing teeth. Fixed bridges are more expensive than removable appliances but are more stable. Removable prosthodontics are used when fixed prosthodontics are not possible.

# 7. CAD/CAM and zirconia restoration

# 7.1 Applications of dental CAD/CAM systems

Currently, a stone model of crowns and FPDs is being produced, as was done with conventional methods, and this serves as the starting point for the CAD/CAM process to ensure digitizing accuracy.[212] After the stone model is digitized, restorations can be designed on the monitor and fabricated by various processing machines. Dental laboratory technicians can use this system as a laboratory tool. This flow is most commonly followed by the current commercial dental CAD/CAM systems available for crown and FPD restorations. There are also systems that complete the wax up, as in the conventional method, and then digitize the wax patterns followed by automatic processing. Recently, networked CAD/CAM systems that were originally based on the Procera® system have garnered attention, especially for the fabrication of high strength ceramic frameworks. The roles of digitizing a stone model and that of CAD/CAM processing are separated in this system. Frameworks fabricated at the center are then delivered to the satellite office to complete the restorations by layering porcelains. This is an important application of the CAD/CAM technology in a specialized field within a total process. This application holds promise for the fabrication of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  frameworks. Later, networked CAD/CAM systems were available, and all ceramic frameworks using industrial dense sintered polycrystalline  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  were available in the clinic. Since these high strength industrial ceramics were not available in the conventional dental laboratory, the application of networked CAD/CAM, located in a processing center, was a tremendous innovation in the history of dental technology. Such networked production systems are currently being introduced by a number of companies worldwide. Currently, the production of zirconia frameworks is the most popular use of this approach in the world market (Table 4). Furthermore, the veneering part of zirconia all ceramic FPDs was also fabricated by a CAD/CAM process from a block of glassy materials and thus a new fabrication system for digital veneering was introduced.[213]


# 7.2 Availability of zirconia based materials for CAD/CAM

CAD/CAM has become somewhat synonymous with zirconia, but systems are available that can machine any type of ceramic materials i.e. glass ceramics, interpenetrating (infiltration ceramics) materials and solid-sintered monophase ceramics like zirconia. The material used depends on the functional and aesthetic demands and on whether a chair side or laboratory CAD/CAM restoration is fabricated. For chair side CAD/CAM restorations, an aesthetic, strong material requiring minimal post milling aesthetic adjustment to minimize the chair side time is needed. Currently, most of the commercially available CAD/CAM systems in the world use zirconia based materials (Y-TZP) to fabricate the frameworks of FPDs $^{214-221}$  and are shown in Table 4. There are two types of zirconia blocks currently available for distinct CAD/CAM applications. The first application is the use of fully sintered dense blocks for direct machining using a dental CAD/CAM system with a grinding machine with higher stiffness. The second application is the use of partially sintered blocks for CAD/CAM fabrication followed by post sintering to obtain a final product with sufficient strength. The former has the advantage of a superior fit because no shrinkage is involved in the process, but has the disadvantage of inferior machinability associated with the wear of the tool. In addition, micro-crack formation on the material during the milling procedure might deteriorate mechanical durability. $^{222}$

# 7.3 CAD/CAM used in zirconia supraconstruction

CAD/CAM is also an important technique to produce supraconstruction for teeth restoration. Recently, Zafiropoulos et al. have reported the results using CAD/CAM to fabricate zirconia supraconstruction.[102] The CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia supraconstruction processes are shown in Fig. 13. The zirconia framework (ZENO Discs, Wieland Dental) was then milled using a CAD/CAM system (M4820, I-MES, Eiterfeld, Germany) and sintered in an electrical furnace (ZENO Fire, Wieland Dental) for 14 hours at  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Fig. 13a). To veneer the implant retained supraconstruction, a high fusing microceramic (Vintage ZR, Shofu Dental, Ratingen, Germany) was used. To veneer the natural tooth retained supraconstruction, a lightly cured indirect ceramic polymer (Ceramage, Shofu Dental) and a bonding system (Bond I and II, Shofu Dental) were used (Fig. 13b-e). The zirconia superstructure possessed

# 8. Future prospect of zirconia restorations

In dental healthcare, the use of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  implants as a treatment option is a new topic compared to the other dental applications described. Titanium has been the material of choice for the fabrication of oral implants, and many investigations have shown its long term effects. However, more recently, tooth colored ceramic materials have been gaining popularity with dentists as well as with patients. The possible side effects of metallic materials and the trend away from the use of metals in the human body have promoted the search for more biocompatible materials. Zirconia has been used as an orthopedic implant material for many years and lately has been emerging in dentistry in the form of orthodontic brackets, post and core systems, all ceramic prosthetic restorations, implant abutments and more recently as a material for oral implants. Because of the rapid development of both materials and processing technologies, the application of zirconia based FPDs seems promising. However, dentists and dental technicians must collaborate and perform the proper clinical procedures even if the CAD/CAM system can neglect some parts of the conventional manual work. It is a challenge to comment on 'aging free' zirconia since the transformation occurring upon aging consists of a 'natural' return to the monoclinic equilibrium state. However, it is still not clear whether the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transition phenomenon com promises the final dental restoration. The addition of alumina to zirconia, creating zirconia/alumina composites has been advocated to reduce the aging kinetics maintaining good mechanical properties and is being explored as one of the possible options. In order to improve the lifetime and the reliability of the prostheses, carbon nanotubes (CNT) are also added. Zirconia-MWCNT nanocomposites were also proposed for biomedical applications.[223] Nanocrystalline materials are expected to show improved mechanical properties and the nanometric features on the surface of the prostheses seem to reduce the risk of rejection and enhance the proliferation of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells).[224] Due to metastability, zirconia is prone to ageing in the presence of water. For the development of new ageing system, ceramics (absence of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ ) are the key for gaining confidence in mechanical property degradation known as ageing which is due to the progressive spontaneous transformation of the metastable tetragonal phase into the monoclinic phase. As reported in the present article, zirconia is being widely applied in dentistry starting from oral implant fabrication to the manufacturing of dental crown and bridgework. Zirconia and zirconia supported ceramics are worthy of being further evaluated particularly with improved production methods. More long term clinical evaluation must be performed to understand the behavior and reliability of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  compared with porcelain fused to metal restorations that are currently the most reliable system for FPD restorations.


# 9. Summary

In this article, past, current and future perspectives of zirconia and zirconia based ceramic materials have been reviewed. These materials have potential applications in dental restorations, dental CAD/CAM and some specific and special implants. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed their high fracture resistance and use in stress bearing areas. Due to the excellent physical properties of zirconia, its white color and superior biocompatibility, it is being evaluated as an alternative framework for the full coverage of all ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures. The properties of  $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  surfaces, such as the low plaque adhesion on zirconia dental implants, and the absence of micro-gaps between fixtures and abutment restorations, which are a promising prosthodontic alternative to metal based restorations and the biological, mechanical and clinical studies published to date seem to indicate that zirconia restorations are both well tolerated and sufficiently resistant. Ceramic bonding, luting procedures, ageing and wear of zirconia restorations need to be further evaluated in order to guide the adequate use of this material. The biocompatibility of zirconia has been well documented and in vitro and in vivo tests on Y-TZP have revealed good biocompatibility with no adverse reactions with cells or tissues. Existing clinical studies demonstrated a promising survival potential regarding tooth-supported restorations but also revealed significant complications such as the high incidence of early fractures of either the veneering or the core materials.

Longitudinal studies will help to determine the degree of clinical benefits or severity of complications. The fracture origin in the presented research work was a thermal flaw that resulted from the layering technique. Fracture was prompted by sliding contact loading and expedited by an internal flaw embedded in the veneering material under considerable thermal residual stresses. Other manufacturing techniques that avoid incremental sintering of the veneer might come as a more reliable option. New aesthetic, restorative materials demand adhesion and recreating the dentin-enamel junction; their success is a function of addressing the needs of the individual substrates involved (enamel, dentin, and indirect materials such as zirconia). The use of adhesives on the tooth substrate and the use of primers on the indirect substrate in conjunction with quality resin-based cements are crucial in optimizing clinical outcomes of these new restorative materials.

Zirconia applications seem to consolidate a well-established position in clinical dentistry, due to the improvements in CAD/ CAM technology and due to the materials' exceptional physical properties. There is no doubt that the application of the CAD/ CAM technology in dentistry provides innovative results, and contributes to the health and QOL of people in aging societies. CAD-CAM methods of production produce consistent quality, a superior marginal fit and can also satisfy critical aesthetic needs of the patients. The application of dental CAD/CAM systems is promising, not only in the field of crowns and FPDs, but also in other fields of dentistry, even if its contribution is limited at present. Basic research should be conducted in the fields of aging, veneering, framework design, bonding, surface modification and esthetic performance to further understand the observed complications and provide solutions that will accelerate expected clinical outcomes. As many new trends and applications for zirconia are being discovered, the future of this biomaterial appears to be very promising. Lastly, we are confident that by using zirconia ceramics in dental restorative and prosthetic devices, we have helped patients to recover and maintain their oral function and health.
