# Abstract

Background: Zygomatic implant surgery is considered as a safe and successful alternative to the conventional implant surgery with bone grafts for patients with severe atrophic maxilla.

Purpose: The aim of this retrospective clinical case series was to report clinical outcome of zygomatic implants with a follow-up between 6 months and 7 years.

Materials and methods: A total of 110 patients with 302 zygomatic implants were included in this study. The intra and postoperative complications and survival rate of zygomatic implants were evaluated.

Results: The study included 110 consecutively treated patients with an age range of 21 to 76 years (mean 57.35 years, SD 10.42). The overall zygomatic implant survival rate was  $98.34\%$ . There were five implant failures in four patients. One intraoperative and 17 postoperative complications developed in 18 patients. There were no dropouts and the median follow-up of the patients was 41.75 months (with a range of 6-89 months).

Conclusions: According to the results, in cases of severely atrophic posterior maxilla, zygomatic implant surgery can be considered as an effective and safe alternative to conventional implants and bone grafting procedures.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Zygomatic implant (ZI) surgery was reported by Brænemark, in the 1990s, as an alternative to conventional methods for patients with a severely resorbed maxilla. Since its introduction, this method has been shown to be a promising alternative with high success rates and reduced healing time. $^{1,2}$  ZI is considered as an attractive option since it offers advantages such as reduced costs and low morbidity when compared to conventional bone augmentation procedures. $^{3-5}$

ZIs can be inserted as bilateral two implants (quad), bilateral one implant per maxillary process, or unilateral 1 or 2 implants. They can also be utilized in combination with conventional implants. Initially, the success of ZI surgery with high primary stability was considered as a consequence of engagement of the fixations through four cortices: the cortical floor of the maxillary sinus, the palatal cortex of the maxillary alveolar bone at the crest and two zygomatic bone cortices at the apex of the Zls. $^{6}$  Even in cases with an absence of cortical bone to engage the implant at the crestal level, it was reported that Zls can be successful with good primary implant stability by engaging zygomatic bone cortices. $^{7}$  However, alveolar bone support is considered beneficial by some authors, Freedman et al in  $2015^{8}$  in a finite element analyses study reported that alveolar bone support for Zls placed in an extra-sinus position can reduce the internal stresses generated by occlusal and lateral forces when compared to implants not supported by alveolar bone. $^{8}$


The insertion of ZIs is a major and difficult surgery associated with some risks due to proximity of the critical anatomical structures such as the infraorbital nerve, orbit, and the infratemporal fossa. $^{6}$  In addition to the complex surgery, the region represents reduced visibility and instrument control during site preparation and the placement of relatively long (30-52.5 mm) implants. $^{3}$  Traditionally, the ZI surgery is performed under general anesthetic or intravenous sedation. $^{3}$


The postoperative complications are infrequent<sup>3</sup> and the success rates of the ZI are high.<sup>9-12</sup> However, even rare, ZI surgery can be associated with serious intra/postoperative complications and it is advisable that this kind of surgery should be performed by a highly experienced surgeon. Intraoperative complications of the technique include fracture of the zygomatic bone and perforation of the orbital cavity. Postoperative complications include sinusitis, mucositis, temporary or permanent neurosensory deficits, peri-orbital abscesses, peri-implantitis, oroantral communications and failure of the implant.

The aim of this single center retrospective consecutive case series study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of 302 ZIs in 110 patients with a follow-up between 6 months and 7 years.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present article was written following the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines (http://www.strobe -statement.org).

This retrospective study was performed at the Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Milan, (section of Galeazzi Hospital, Italy) between September 2012 and February 2020. This study protocol was approved by institutional scientific review board of Galeazzi Hospital (Milan, Italy; authorization no. 2552377-L2058. ("Implant rehabilitation of the partially or totally edentulous patient: evaluation of techniques and materials to improve predictibility and maintenance"). All the patients signed an informed consent agreement form and the study protocol was in compliance with the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki on medical protocol. The study population composed of 110 patients with 302 ZIs who had at least one ZI placed between September 2012 and August 2019. The patients were identified from the medical records as having consented to total edentulous maxillary rehabilitation with the use of implants inserted into the zygomatic bone.

Inclusion criterion was set as patients with severely atrophic edentulous maxilla with extreme horizontal and vertical bone loss and pneumatization of the maxillary sinuses $^{13}$  (Class IV-V Cawood and Howell), who were in need of oral rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria were patients with active infection in oral maxillofacial region, emotionally instable patients, and patients with active radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The patients were rehabilitated either by only ZIs or by using ZIs in conjunction with conventional dental implants. The presurgical and surgical approach, the prosthetic procedure and the follow-up protocol were described in detail in a previous article by the same team. $^{14}$  The representative preoperative and postoperative orthopantomographic images of one of the patients can be seen in Figures 1 and 2.

FIGURE 2 The representative postoperative panoramic radiographic image of the patient showing quad zygomatic implants inserted

# 2.1 | Presurgical protocol

Preoperative clinical examinations of the patients included preoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and orthopantomographs for the form and dimensions of the maxillary and zygomatic bone and for the maxillary sinus pathologies. General health status of the patients was evaluated by a blood test, electrocardiography, and chest radiography.

A week before surgery, a professional oral hygiene session was given to each patient and oral rinses with chlorhexidine digluconate  $0.2\%$  mouthwash. The patients were prescribed with pre- and postoperative antibiotics: Augmentin (amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium) at a dosage of 1-g tablet every 8 hours for a total of 6 days, starting from the evening before the surgery. In cases, when an allergy to penicillin was declared, Azithromycin  $500\mathrm{mg}$  for 3 days was prescribed as an alternative.

# 2.2 Surgical protocol

All surgeries were carried out by the same surgeon (Fr.G.) under local anesthesia (4% articaine with 1:100000 adrenaline) and general anesthetic or under sedation with blood pressure, pulse, and oximetric monitored by the anesthetist. All the ZIs were inserted with "extrasinus technique." The ZIs used in this study were either partially threaded (unthreaded crestal long body with  $12.5\mathrm{mm}$  apical threaded part) (Noris Medical Ltd., Israel) or totally threaded (ICX Zygoma implants, Medentis medical GmbH, Ahrweiler, Germany).


In brief; the operation started with a palatal incision in the maxillary crest with vertical posterior releasing incisions and the muco-periosteal flap reflections. After flap reflection, all the bone surgeries and the implant site preparations were performed using drills and burs according to the instructions from the manufacture firms. Finally, the ZIs were carefully inserted at a low speed (20-40 rpm), with a torque of 40 to 80 Ncm, and the final stabilization was performed manually with an extraoral screwdriver, or with the standard protocol of screwing that are used with conventional implants. The anterior implants that emerged from canine region, were always inserted before the posterior ones. The surgical sites were covered with resorbable equine collagen membrane (15 sites) (Condress, Smith&Nephew, Agrate Brianza, Italy) or with Bichat fat pad (45 sites) in cases of vestibular maxillary concavity. The wounds were repositioned and sutured using continuous resorbable sutures (Vicryl, Ethicon FS-2, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, New Jersey). The representative intraoperative and intraoral view of a patient with quad partially threaded ZIs inserted can be seen in Figure 3.

# 2.3 Prosthetic procedure and follow-up protocol

All the implants typically emerged the canine or the first molar region on the residual crest of the ridge and primary stability was achieved in all implants with minimum insertion torque of 40 Ncm. Ninety-one of the patients received immediate loading of the prothesis while 19 of the prothesis were done in a delayed approach. The decision for loading protocol based on the request of the each patient mostly due to economic reasons, independent of the primary stability of the ZI. The type of the prosthesis to be delivered was determined according to the anatomic and financial conditions of each patient, taking antagonist dentition in consideration as well. A total of 89 Toronto implant bridges in acrylic resin, one Toronto implant bridge in ceramic, three acrylic resin bridges, 10 ceramic bridges, five total fixed resin prosthesis, and two removable prosthesis with bar were delivered.
FIGURE 3 The representative intraoperative and intraoral view of the patient with partially threaded quad zygomatic implants inserted

The patients were recalled for clinical follow-up after 10 days, 1 month, and every 3 months for the first year, and then twice a year. The occlusion was examined carefully at the delivery of the final prostheses and at each follow-up. In the first year following ZI insertions, follow up criteria for the patients with Toronto prosthesis included additional interventions. Every 6 months, Toronto prosthesis were unscrewed to check the status of the surrounding tissues.

# 2.4 ZI outcome evaluation

Implant survival rates were evaluated based on the clinical and radiologic criteria as a primary outcome. Complications were evaluated as additional criteria.

Implant survival rates were evaluated based on the clinical criteria described by Albrektsson and his colleagues $^{15}$  as listed below:

absence of clinically detectable implant mobility;
- no evidence of peri-implant radiolucency;
- no spontaneous ZI failure;
- radiographic vertical bone loss less than  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  per annum;
absence of pain and infections.

# 2.5 Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, California). Descriptive statistics of the data was done using mean values and standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables normally distributed. Normality of distributions was evaluated through the d'Agostino and Pearson omnibus test. The effect of each variables (gender, age, smoking habits, reason for ZI, type of antagonist dentition, number of ZIs per prosthesis, loading modality, ZI location, prosthesis type, implant design) on complications was evaluated by using the Fisher's exact test, given the low incidence of complications in each subgroup. When there were more than two categories for a given variable, the generalized Fisher exact test was used. Since the latter was not provided by GraphPad Prism 5.03, the test was performed using the online free package SISA (Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis, http://wwwquantitativeskills.com/sisa/). The patient was considered as the unit of analysis.  $P = .05$  was considered as the significance threshold.

# 3 | RESULTS

The study group of the present study included 110 consecutively treated patients (60 women and 50 men), with a total of 302 ZIs. The study population composed of patients aged from 21 to 76 (mean 57.35 years, SD 10.42) who had at least one ZI placed between September 2012 and February 2020. Final or provisional prosthesis were delivered on the same day of surgery. The median follow-up of the patients was 41.75 months (with a range of 6-89 months).

Thirty-two patients presented some systemic conditions which can be listed as follows: two gastritis, four depression, one sjogren syndrome, one pulmonary embolism, one osteoporosis, three rheumatoid arthritis, four hypothyroid, three hypertension, four hepatitis C virus (HCV), one hepatitis B virus (HBV), one cardiac stent, one

There were 10 patients presenting more than one condition. There were no oncologic conditions in any of the patients. The systemic conditions of all patients were under control, so they were not accepted as major obstacles to perform surgical operations. As recorded from the history of the patients, two ex-periodontitis patient and three ex-smokers were present in the population. Nine patients were active smokers (one heavy smoker), and two patients declared allergy to penicillin. There were two bruxist patients and one of these patients lost an implant due to this condition.


In this present study, there were no drop outs and the implant survival rate was  $98.34\%$ . Five implants were lost in four patients (two in the first week, one in 3 months, and the other two after 1 year due to heavy bruxism and occlusal overload.

According to the results, the implant survival was not influenced by gender, smoking, ZI location, and ZI design. No specific loading protocol, either immediate or delayed was beneficial in terms of implant survival.

There was no significant effect of using bilateral ZI insertion (2ZI or 4ZI) vs unilateral ZIs (3ZI and 1ZI) on implant survival (Table 4).

Patients with previous failure of conventional implants had greater probability of ZI failure respect to patients with atrophic maxilla receiving implant treatment for the first time, though it was not statistically significant. Age over 60 was found to be favorable in terms of implant survival.

In some of the groups, statistical calculations were not applicable (NA), due to great difference among sample size and number of events with no events in some cases (Table 4).

The details for timing and treatment modality for complications seen in 18 patients including 4 patients with 5 implant failures are listed in Table 5.

# 4 DISCUSSION

In cases of extremely atrophic maxillary bone, zygomatic surgery approach is considered by several authors as less invasive and more predictable than conventional implant surgery with grafting procedures. Various studies have reported that the use of ZIs decreases the number of surgical steps, the length of treatment, and the costs, mainly due to the fact that, the insertion of ZIs does not require additional grafting.

The ZIs may be inserted in the zygomatic bone, alone or in combination with conventional implants. $^{1,16,21}$  Indications, comparison of surgical protocols, prosthetic rehabilitation protocols, complications and survival rates for ZIs were evaluated in many clinical and review articles. $^{3-5,7,10,11,22-24}$  According to the literature, the major complications associated with ZIs were reported as loss of integration, oral-antral communication, sinusitis, paresthesia, mucositis, periimplantitis, penetration of the orbital cavity during the drilling protocol, cutaneous fistula and failure of the implants. $^{10,22}$

According to a review by Candel-Marti 2012, maxillary sinusitis is the most frequent complication in ZI surgery.[21] However, according to a retrospective cohort study by D'Agostino et al,[25] placement of ZIs is not associated with severe rhinosinusitis complications. Additionally, various authors have reported that extra-maxillary/extra-sinus approach in ZI insertion does not cause significant sinusitis, since most part of the implant is placed outside the maxillary sinus.[2,11,26,27] In the present study, extra-maxillary approach was utilized without any sinusitis cases and this result is in accordance with the statement above.

The biological and prosthetic complications associated with ZIs include, infection following fistula, sinusitis, fracture of the abutment screw and fracture of the prosthesis.[10,28] According to various reports, biological complications are rare and usually resolve in time. In the present study, one of the patients had inflammation of the soft tissues with a cutaneous fistula, the problem was resolved without major problems. The cutaneous fistula was treated by two stage surgical approach. Fistulactomy and simultaneous lipofilling were performed at the first stage. After 6 months, the patient was recalled and due to some aesthetic concerns an additional lipofilling was performed with success.

Nobre et al. evaluated clinical soft tissue parameters for extramaxillary ZIs and the results failed to identify compelling evidence to conclude that any particular implant or feature affects the outcome of the treatment of patients with fully edentulous maxilla.[29] In this study, three periimplant mucositis and two periimplantitis were seen in five patients. The three cases of peri-implant mucositis were diagnosed after 2 to 3 months and treatment modality included Diode laser applications (Doctor Smile Dental laser, Lambda S.p.A., Brendola, Italy). All of the mucositis conditions were resolved without any further complications. In two periimplantitis cases, two implants were removed by the surgeon, at the follow up visit due to mobility and their prosthesis was adjusted with replanning. The three cases of periimplant mucositis were seen in totally threaded design, however when survival rates of the two designs were compared, there was no statistically significant difference between them for periimplantitis or mucositis.

The success of prostheses and bone-implant stress distribution can be influenced by implant length, number, position, inclination, and prosthetic protocol which includes; material properties, loading modality, prosthesis splinting protocols, and cantilever forces.[30] ZI are similar to angled implant applications in which, implant length, cortical anchorage and implant distribution within the arch are important factors on failures and success.[30] The ZI has an increased tendency to bend under horizontal loads,[31] since ZIs are longer in length than conventional dental implants and there is limited bone support in the maxillary alveolar crest. Due to these reasons, additional attention should be given to the balanced load distribution by the prosthetic over-structure throughout the maxillary arch. Specially, in cases of heavy bruxism patients, the situation can be quite challenging. Several authors observed higher stress values in the molar region compared to more anterior regions and the increase in stress in implants is proportional to the increase in cantilever lengths.[32,33] In the present

study, five implants were lost due to occlusal overload either because of heavy bruxism or occlusal overload by inappropriate unbalanced prosthetic over structure. Furthermore, when conducting the analysis using the patient as unit (Table 4), insertion of unilateral ZIs (3ZI and 1ZI) showed a slightly higher incidence of failure (2 patients with failure out of 14 patients,  $14.3\%$  as compared to bilateral ZI insertion (2 patients with failure out of 96 patients,  $2.1\%$ ). This might suggest that the latter solution could be beneficial, though the results did not achieve statistical significance  $(P = .07)$ . It could be hypothesized that an even number of implants would mean a better load distribution

Hence, an uneven number could place the patient in greater biomechanical risk. A larger sample size is required to explore this hypothesis.


The Immediate loading modality of ZIs is reported as a predictable treatment option for the atrophic maxilla.[24] In this study, all the failures were observed in immediate loaded ZIs. However, there was no statistically difference among immediate or delayed loading protocols.

ZIs placed with a combination of 2 to 4 conventional implants inserted in premaxilla are accepted to be the most preferred protocol to reduce the load and create an even stress distribution around the implants by splinting.[34] The emergence of the ZIs are often 10 to  $15\mathrm{mm}$  medial to the ridge, the prosthetic over structure should be designed to enable proper oral hygiene in the area. The head of the implant with adequate abutment type in length and angulation is also a crucial factor for positioning the screw emergence on the occlusal surfaces and for determining the final thickness of the prosthesis.[31] In the present study, there was no statistically significant difference for ZI failures among groups concerning ZI location, ZI design, and loading protocol. However, the authors of this present work highly recommend giving special importance to the prosthetic phase, in order to prevent failures.

According to a clinical report by Pu et al,[35] the age-related linear and angular changes in the ZI insertion areas are factors that should be considered with regard to the safety of the four-implant protocol.[35] In this study, population group consisted of 110 patients aged from 21 to 76 (media 57.19–SD 10.63). Five implants were lost in four patients, which were under 60 years old. According to the results of this study, older age was found to be particularly favorable in terms of implant survival, according to the opinion of the authors, this result might be due to the fact that patients over 60 paid more attention to oral hygiene procedures.

Additionally, there were 11 smokers in the group with one ZI failure and one oroantral communication as complication. According to various authors relative contraindications include smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day.[25,36] In this study, smoking did not have any significant effect on the failures and complications, however smoking should always be considered as a critical risk factor.

Since its first introduction by Brænemark for the oral rehabilitation of patients with serious and extended defects of the jaws caused by postoncological resections, trauma or congenital malformations, ZI have presented high success rates and are considered as a safe approach.[7,9,11,12,22,37] The result of this study is in accordance with this statement showing high implant survival rate (98.38%) and low incidence of complications. However, ZI insertion is a major difficult surgery and is not risk-free due to reduced visibility and instrument control. Additionally, there are critical surrounding anatomical structures such as the infraorbital nerve, orbit, and the infratemporal fossa. Several complications related to ZIs were described in literature such as fracture of the zygomatic bone, paresthesia of the infraorbital or zygomatic and facial nerves, formation of oroantral fistula, and implant failures.[10-12,22,25] The surgeon performing the surgery should be able the deal with the possible complications. In the present study, in one of the patients, zygomatic bone was accidentally fractured during surgery. The surgery continued with the repositioning of the zygomatic bone with fixation plate and insertion of the quad ZIs. Another patient represented a zygomatic bone periostitis at the apex of ZI in first molar region, due to apical over-instrumentation of the implant site. In this case, an additional surgery was performed for cutting off the apex of the ZI was under general anesthesia. Oroantral sinus communications and paresthesia were seen in a total of six patients, as postoperative major complications. Patients with oroantral sinus communications were treated with additional surgical operations by laterally positioned flaps. In cases of temporary paresthesia, complete recovery was seen approximately after 6 months of ZI surgery. All the complications explained above were resolved without any major problems.


The limitations of the present study include a single center research with retrospective consequent case series. In cases when the patients failed to comply with the control appointments, each patient was contacted and the information about implant survival and complications were retrieved directly. However, the follow-up period and follow-up status for the estimation of ZI survival remained unchanged.

# 5 CONCLUSION

The data from this previous study indicates that the oral rehabilitation of the severely atrophic maxilla utilizing one to four ZIs placed with an extramaxillary surgical protocol can be considered as an alternative to bone grafting, and sinus elevation procedures. In accordance with data in the literature, the results of this study show that placement of ZIs is a safe procedure with high survival rate and does not seem to be associated with severe complications. However, it should be considered that ZI insertion is a challenging procedure and prior specific training is recommended. Future studies should focus on the 10-year or more outcome of ZI implants with larger groups with different treatment protocols.
