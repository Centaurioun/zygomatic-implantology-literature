Terheyden: Lateral augmentation of the sinus floor followed by regular implants versus short implants in the vertically deficient posterior maxilla: a systematic review and timewise meta-analysis of randomized studies.

Abstract. The aim of this study was to perform a timewise meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of short implants  $(\leq 6\mathrm{mm})$  versus lateral sinus floor augmentation followed by regular implants  $(\geq 10\mathrm{mm})$  in the deficient posterior maxilla. Eleven RCTs with 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up were reported in 21 articles. There was no significant difference in the implant loss rate at the patient level after 1 and 3 years between the two groups (risk ratio  $0.50$ ,  $P = 0.17$ ; risk ratio  $1.71$ ,  $P = 0.51$ ). After 5 years, the risk ratio was in favour of regular implants with augmentation and approached significance  $(3.28, P = 0.06)$ . Excluding the results of two studies on ultrashort implants, the risk ratio for complications was in favour of short implants, but without significance  $(0.33, P = 0.08)$ . Mean marginal bone loss was significantly lower at 1, 3, and 5 years for the short implants when compared to regular implants with augmentation. The residual osseointegration length of implants was between  $3.4\mathrm{mm}$  and  $5.9\mathrm{mm}$  in the short implants group and between  $10.1\mathrm{mm}$  and  $12.5\mathrm{mm}$  in the regular implants group after 5 years. In conclusion, short implants in the atrophic posterior maxilla demonstrate comparable outcomes to regular implants within the first 5 years. Patients who are fit for surgery should be informed about the risks and benefits of both options.

Bone grafting of the maxillary sinus floor is a predictable method for augmentation in the posterior atrophic maxilla. In sinus floor augmentation procedures, a graft material, which can be autologous, of allogeneic or xenogeneic origin, alloplastic, or mixed, is placed into the subantral space after careful elevation of the Schneiderian membrane. Dental implants of regular length  $(\geq 8\mathrm{mm})$  can be placed immediately at the time of bone grafting or in a staged approach. Short implants have become increasingly popular in patients with a reduced ridge height, but it remains uncertain whether these implants also perform well in the posterior maxilla with a reduced height  $(< 7\mathrm{mm})$ , where bone quality is lower and is often type IV according to the Lekholm and Zarb classification.


Various techniques that aim to avoid the additional surgery of sinus floor augmentation in patients with a reduced ridge height have been discussed, including trans-sinus tilted implants, pterygoid implants, zygoma implants, and sub-periosteal implants. Short  $(< 8\mathrm{mm})$  and ultrashort  $(< 5\mathrm{mm})$  implants aim to use residual bone of  $\leq 5\mathrm{mm}$  often in a bicortical fixation mode in the oral and subantral cortex. However, there are concerns about the longevity of short implants, because they have less osseointegrated length, especially if marginal bone resorption occurs.

A recent meta-analysis on short implants versus augmented bone and regular implants in the posterior mandible by Terheyden et al. demonstrated a continuous worsening of the implant survival rate in the short implants group over time from 1 to 3, 5, and 8 years. This trend was clearly visible due to increasing implant losses in the short implants group, but significance was not reached in that study. This prompted the question of whether a timewise analysis would also uncover such a trend in the posterior maxilla. A number of recent systematic reviews have addressed the question of short dental implants versus sinus floor augmentation and longer implants in the vertically deficient posterior maxilla, but none of these has used a timewise analysis and all results have been pooled without considering the time of observation. The systematic reviews by

Cruz et al.,<sup>2</sup> Lozano-Carrascal et al.,<sup>3</sup> Chaware et al.,<sup>4</sup> and also Al-Moraissi et al.<sup>5</sup> did not differentiate the different observation times. Yan et al.<sup>6</sup> only had an observation period of 1-3 years. Nielsen et al.<sup>7</sup> compared short  $(\leq 8\mathrm{mm})$  and long implants  $(>8\mathrm{mm})$  with the same question; however, only three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, with an observation period of 3 years. The meta-analysis study by Ravida et al.<sup>8</sup> on short  $(\leq 6\mathrm{mm})$  and long  $(\geq 10\mathrm{mm})$  dental implants for prosthetic rehabilitation of the posterior atrophic maxilla includes results for the survival rate, complications, and bone loss at 1 and 3 years, but newer studies and results are missing, as well as results after 5 years of observation. Badaró et al.<sup>9</sup> published a meta-analysis focusing on complications and survival rates of single short implants  $\leq 6\mathrm{mm}$ , while regular implants were not included in the study.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature comparing the treatment outcomes of short implants  $(\leq 6\mathrm{mm})$  versus lateral sinus floor augmentation followed by regular implants  $(\geq 10\mathrm{mm})$  at different time intervals of follow-up, after 1, 3, and 5 years.

# Materials and methods

The PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews of the literature was used in this study. For the meta-analysis, the methodology of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 6.3 (www.training.cochrane.org) was applied. This study has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO (file number CRD42020204888).

The PICO question was constructed as follows: For patients in need of dental implants with a partially edentulous or edentulous maxilla with vertical bone atrophy (P, population), does treatment with short implants  $\leq 6\mathrm{mm}$  and no vertical bone augmentation (I, intervention), compared with sinus floor augmentation from a lateral approach followed by placement of dental implants with a regular length  $(\geq 10\mathrm{mm})$  (C, comparative intervention), result in differences in implant survival, rate of perioperative complications, peri-implant bone resorption, or residual osseointegrated length of the dental implant (O, outcomes)?


# Literature search and study inclusion criteria

A systematic search of the literature was performed in the PubMed database using the search phrase "(sinus lift) OR (sinus graft*) OR (subantral) OR (posterior maxilla graft*) AND Short AND implant*", and additionally with restriction to RCTs (date of last search November 13, 2021). There was no language restriction. Only RCTs that compared short implants with regular implants in vertically augmented bone in the posterior maxilla were eligible for inclusion. The residual preoperative bone of the sinus floor had to be  $\leq 8\mathrm{mm}$ . Only RCTs that used the lateral approach for sinus augmentation were included; osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE) was an exclusion criterion. In the analyses, short implants were defined as dental implants with a length of  $\leq 6\mathrm{mm}$  (ultrashort implants as those with a length  $\leq 4\mathrm{mm}$ ) and regular implants as those with a length of  $\geq 10\mathrm{mm}$ . The minimum follow-up time had to be 1 year. Additionally, a search under the name Esposito-M was performed, because this author's group has published numerous articles on the topic. A hand-search was performed in the European Journal of Oral Implantology (the name changed to International Journal of Oral Implantology after January 2019). Systematic reviews addressing a similar topic were cross-checked for additional candidate studies and completeness of the search results.

# Data items and collection

The data for the agreed outcomes were extracted from the studies and entered into an Excel spreadsheet. These outcomes were (1) implant survival (implant present in the oral cavity), based on inserted implants at baseline, with follow-up intervals started after prosthetic loading; (2) number of patients with perioperative complications (biological complications including bleeding on probing, peri-implantitis, and infection but excluding mechanical implant complications and swelling); (3) peri-implant marginal bone resorption (MBR; the change in marginal bone level in millimetres) from the loading time point as baseline, measured radiographically on standardized peri-apical radiographs and in certain cases on panoramic radiographs; (4) residual osseointegrated implant length, calculated by subtracting the mean radiographic bone level measured from the implant collar (in millimetres) from the reported technical implant length.


# Risk of bias assessment

The risk of bias assessment was done using the tool in RevMan 5.4.1 software (Cochrane Community). Seven subcategories were assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. Each category can be rated as 'low risk', 'high risk', or 'unclear risk'. This assessment was performed independently by the two review authors. Differences in opinion were resolved by discussion.

# Data synthesis

The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 software (Cochrane Community). The statistical unit was the patient. Data from split-mouth studies were combined with data from parallel group trials. The risk ratio (RR) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes, while the mean difference (MD) was calculated for continuous data. The random-effects model was applied for the meta-analyses. This was done for the 1-, 3- and 5-year follow-up times. Subgroup analyses were performed for short  $(\leq 6\mathrm{mm})$  versus ultrashort  $(\leq 4\mathrm{mm})$  implants after 1 year of follow-up.

The studies by Rossi et al.,[11] Pistilli et al.,[12] Gulje et al.,[13] Felice et al.,[14] Schincaglia et al.,[15] and Nielsen et al.,[16] were zero-event studies after the first year of observation, because no implant losses occurred. Zero events also occurred after 3 years of observation (Pohl et al.,[17] Gastaldi et al.,[18] Hadzik et al.[19]). These studies were excluded from the meta-analyses of the survival rate for mathematical reasons (division through zero). In the analysis of perioperative complications, Gulje et al.,[13] Felice et al.,[14] and Nielsen et al.[16] also had zero events and were excluded from the calculation.

# Heterogeneity

The presence of heterogeneity was assessed using the  $I^2$  statistic. A rough guide for interpretation in the context of meta-analyses of randomized trials, according to the Cochrane manual,[10] is as follow:  $0 - 40\%$ , may not be important;  $30 - 60\%$ , may represent moderate heterogeneity;  $50 - 90\%$ , may represent significant heterogeneity;  $75 - 100\%$ , may represent substantial heterogeneity.

# Results

# Included studies

In total, 11 RCTs were identified through the literature search (Fig. 1). These were published in 21 original articles, reporting results at different times of follow-up (Supplementary Material Table S1).[11-31] These clinical studies and their patient populations, although published in numerous articles, could be identified by the brands of implant system used. This way, double inclusion of certain patients in the meta-analysis could be avoided.

Four of the included RCTs were published by the group of Esposito et al. at different time points (1, 3, and/ or 5 years). The first of these RCTs was a split-mouth comparison of implants placed in the posterior jaws, in which MegaGen EZ Plus implants (MegaGen, Daegu, South Korea) were used.[20,24,29] Initially, 34 short and 38 regular implants were examined in this group. The second was a parallel group RCT of implants placed in atrophic jaws including 40 maxillary sites, in which MegaGen ExFeel implants with a calcium incorporated surface were used,[21,26,27] starting with 36 short and 37 regular implants. The third RCT used Southern Implants (Southern Implants, Irene, South Africa) in atrophic mandibles and maxillae and followed a split-mouth design.[12,25,28] This study started with 39 short and 44 regular implants. The fourth RCT was a parallel-arm study using Zimmer Biomet implants (XFOS5/6xx, NXFOS5/6xx; Zimmer Biomet, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA), beginning with 16 short and 18 regular implants.[14,18]

Two RCTs used Astra Tech implants (Dentsply Sirona, Bensheim, Germany) in a parallel-arm study design and reported results for the different time points: one was performed by a group in Zürich, Switzerland[15,17,31] (starting with 67 short and 70 regular implants) and the other by a group in Groningen, the Netherlands[13,30] (starting with 21 short and 19 regular implants).


The other RCTs included a parallel group RCT published by Bolle et al.22 investigating implants in the posterior jaw, which used twinKon  $4.0\mathrm{-mm}$  implants (Global D, Brignais, France), starting with 37 short and 41 regular implants. Also included were RCTs by Rossi et al.11 (using 16 short and 14 regular Straumann implants; Straumann, Freiburg, Germany), Nielsen et al.16 (using 24 short and 21 regular Astra Tech implants; Dentsply Sirona), Bechara et al.23 (using 45 short and 45 regular MegaGen AnyRidge implants; this study collected data at 1 and 3 years), and Hadzik et al.19 (using 25 short and 25 regular OsseoSpeed implants; Dentsply Sirona). In all studies, one to several implants were placed per patient.

# Excluded studies

Thirteen studies were excluded (Supplementary Material Table S2).32-44 The studies by Cannizaro et al. (2009 and 2013)32,33 were not included because they used the crestal sinus lift technique in an atrophic sinus floor. Other studies were excluded because they had a short observation period of between 4 and 5 months: Felice et al. (2009),34 Felice et al. (2011),35 Felice et al. (2012),36 Esposito et al. (2012),37 and Esposito et al. (2016).38 Nedir et al. (2013 and 2016)39,40 used the OSFE technique. In the study by Taschieri et al.,41 the short implants were too long  $(6.5 - 8.5\mathrm{mm})$  The studies by Gonshor et al.,42 Hsu et al.,43 and Grandi et al.44 were excluded because the content was not relevant to this study.

# Methodological aspects of the studies

The initial situation was a partially edentulous maxilla, except in the study by Rossi et al.11 in which an edentulous maxilla was investigated. Augmentation and implant placement were performed in one stage in all studies except for those by Esposito et al.20 and Rossi et al.,11 in which a two-stage procedure was performed. Some heterogeneity was presented by the different xenogeneic augmentation materials applied. In all studies, implants were restored with fixed prostheses. It was not possible to obtain separate data for splinted and non-splinted crowns. Rossi et al.11 restored the implants with a full arch bridge.

Comparability of the intervention and control groups was given by clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, clear randomization, and the same implant system and geometry used in the control and intervention groups in all studies.

# Risk of bias

The risk of bias, in general, was considered to be low (Fig. 2). Blinding of the participants was impossible. Incomplete reporting of the outcome was noted in the studies by Pohl et al.17 and Hadzik et al.19

# Meta-analysis-implant survival rate

The meta-analysis showed that the patient-related implant loss rate did not differ significantly between the short implants and the regular implants with augmentation after 1 and 3 years (1 year: RR 0.50,  $P = 0.17$ ; 3 years: RR 1.71,  $P = 0.51$ ). After 5 years, the risk ratio was in favour of regular implants with augmentation, with a result that approached significance (RR 3.28,  $P = 0.06$ ) (Fig. 3). No significant advantage could be seen for either the short or ultrashort implants after 1 year when these were compared separately to regular implants with augmentation (Fig. 4).


Heterogeneity for the meta-analysis of the survival rate of implants was as follows: for the survival rate at 1 year:  $I^2 = 0\%$ ,  $P = 0.50$ ; at 3 years:  $I^2 = 25\%$ ,  $P = 0.26$ ; at 5 years:  $I^2 = 0\%$ ,  $P = 1.00$ . In the subgroup analyses for short and ultrashort implants separately, heterogeneity was  $I^2 = 7\%$ ,  $P = 0.34$  for short implants and 'not applicable' for ultrashort implants.

# Meta-analysis-rate of perioperative complications

The data on perioperative complications were extracted from the 1-year follow-up reports of 10 studies[11-16,20-23] for meta-analysis: eight were assigned to the short implants subgroup and two were assigned to the ultrashort implants subgroup  $(\leq 4\mathrm{mm})$  (Fig. 5). The study by Hadzik et al.[19] did not report data for complications and was not included in this analysis. The complications included biological complications and not mechanical implant complications. The risk ratio for the short implants subgroup approached significance  $(P = 0.08)$ ; there were three-times fewer complications in the short implants subgroup than in the regular implant with augmentation group (RR 0.33). In the other subgroup analysis, there was no advantage for the ultrashort implants when compared to regular implants with augmentation (RR 0.76,  $P = 0.78$ ).


Heterogeneity for the complication rate meta-analysis was  $I^2 = 42\%$ ,  $P = 0.14$  for the short implants subgroup comparison and  $I^2 = 71\%$ ,  $P = 0.07$  for the ultrashort implants subgroup comparison.

# Meta-analysis—marginal bone resorption (MBR), change in marginal bone loss

The meta-analysis of MBR in each trial showed a significantly lower bone loss for short implants after 5 years when compared to regular implants with augmentation  $(P = 0.02)$  (Fig. 6). The timewise analysis showed that the difference in MBR between the groups increased consistently over the years. The mean difference in MBR was  $0.11\mathrm{mm}$  after 1 year  $(P = 0.0007)$ ,  $0.15\mathrm{mm}$  after 3 years  $(P = 0.02)$ , and  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  after 5 years  $(P = 0.02)$ . Fig. 7 shows the analysis for MBR in the short and ultrashort implant subgroups after 1 year. There was a significant difference in MBR at 1 year, in favour of short implants when compared to regular implants with augmentation (MD 0.11,  $P = 0.002$ ); however, no significance was observed for the ultrashort implants  $(P = 0.19)$ .

Heterogeneity for the meta-analysis of peri-implant bone loss was as follows: MBR at 1 year:  $I^2 = 84\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$ ; at 3 years:  $I^2 = 65\%$ ,  $P = 0.009$ ; at 5 years:  $I^2 = 41\%$ ,  $P = 0.15$ . In the subgroup analysis for short and ultrashort implants separately, heterogeneity was  $I^2 = 87\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$  for short implants and  $I^2 = 19\%$ ,  $P = 0.27$  for ultrashort implants.

# Meta-analysis—residual osseointegrated implant length

The residual osseointegrated implant length is responsible for anchorage of the dental implant in the bone. The study by Bolle et al.,[22] which used 4-mm short implants, reported the lowest residual osseointegration at 1 year of all included studies  $(3.37\mathrm{mm})$ . The residual osseointegration ranged from  $3.37\mathrm{mm}$  to  $5.98\mathrm{mm}$  for the short implants, and from  $9.49\mathrm{mm}$  to  $12.84\mathrm{mm}$  for the regular implants, after 1 year. After 5 years, the residual osseointegration length ranged from  $3.35\mathrm{mm}$  to  $5.88\mathrm{mm}$  in the short implants group, and from  $10.1\mathrm{mm}$  to  $12.54\mathrm{mm}$  in the regular dental implants group (Fig. 8). At 1 year, regular implants had  $6.14\mathrm{mm}$  more osseointegrated length than short implants; after 5 years they had  $6.53\mathrm{mm}$  more osseointegrated length. Fig. 9 shows the analysis of residual osseointegration in the short and ultrashort implant subgroups after 1 year. After 1 year, the residual osseointegration length ranged from  $3.84\mathrm{mm}$  to  $5.98\mathrm{mm}$  in the short implants group, and from  $3.37\mathrm{mm}$  to  $3.96\mathrm{mm}$  in the ultrashort implants group.
Fig. 2. Risk of bias summary.


Heterogeneity for the meta-analysis of residual osseointegrated implant length was as follows: at 1 year:  $I^2 = 100\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$ ; at 3 years:  $I^2 = 98\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$ ; at 5 years:  $I^2 = 97\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$ . In the subgroup analysis for short and ultrashort implants separately, heterogeneity was  $I^2 = 100\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$  for short implants and  $I^2 = 98\%$ ,  $P < 0.00001$  for ultrashort implants.

# Discussion

A major finding of this meta-analysis is that there was no significant difference in the implant loss at the patient level after 1 and 3 years. After 5 years, there was more implant loss in the short implants group compared to the regular implants with sinus floor augmentation group, which approached significance  $(P = 0.06)$ .

Regarding implant loss, this review found that after 1 and 3 years there was no difference between short implants and regular implants with augmentation (1 year: RR 0.50,  $P = 0.17$ ; 3 years: RR 1.71,  $P = 0.51$ ). Other meta-analyses by Chaware et al., Lozano-Carrascal et al. (both including 1-5 years), and Cruz et al. (up to 1-3 years) also found no differences between the different implant lengths studied and survival rates. However, it must also be considered that there was no chronological separation of the results by time period in these previous studies. The advantage of the present study is the temporal grouping. It was noted that after 5 years, the risk ratio was in favour of regular implants with augmentation, with a result approaching significance (RR 3.28,  $P = 0.06$ ). Reports of these RCT study populations with longer observation periods of 8 and 10 years are needed in the future, which may show a consolidation of the trend of more sustainable results in the bone augmentation group. A similar observation was made, and similar conclusion drawn, in the analysis of the mandible by Terheyden et al.
Fig. 3. Meta-analysis of the implant survival rate—forest plot. After 1 year the results were in favour of the short implants, but a constant shift in favour of augmentation and regular implants was observed after 3 and 5 years, although with no statistical significance (5 years,  $P = 0.06$ ). Pistilli et al. published two studies in 2013, which can be differentiated by the dental implant system applied.



Two RCTs were included in this study that examined 4-mm ultrashort implants[11,22]; both the ultrashort implants and short implants in the  $5 - 6\mathrm{mm}$  range showed no difference in survival rate when compared to the regular implants with augmentation. For both studies on ultrashort implants, by Rossi et al.[11] and Bolle et al.,[22] only 1-year of follow-up is available for comparison at this time.

Concerning perioperative complications, there were three times fewer complications in the short implants group (excluding the two studies with ultrashort implants) when compared to the regular implants with augmentation group, although the  $P$ -value did not show significance  $(P = 0.08)$ . This effect size approaches significance, yet it must also be noted that these are biological, perioperative complications and not permanent damage.


With regard to MBR, the short implants consistently showed a smaller change in marginal bone level than the regular implants. The biological reason for this phenomenon - why short implants, independent of site and study, show lower resorption rates than regular implants - is still unclear. The comparison of marginal bone loss over time showed a consistent advantage for short implants beginning at 1 year, with a constant increase in the difference over time, up to  $0.25\mathrm{mm}$  between short and regular implants at 5 years  $(P = 0.02)$ . Although the bone loss after 5 years is clinically low, studies with a longer observation period would be interesting. If both trends (survival rate and MBR) are extrapolated over time, regular implants with bone augmentation are the more sustainable concept than short implants, because they can resist marginal bone loss for longer.
Fig. 4. Subgroup analysis of the implant survival rate after 1 year for short  $(\leq 6\mathrm{mm})$  versus ultrashort implants  $(\leq 4\mathrm{mm})$ . No significant advantage could be seen for either of these two groups when compared to augmentation and regular implants: short implants  $P = 0.68$ ; ultrashort implants,  $P = 0.17$ .

The implants in these RCTs were regularly monitored under study conditions. While inflammation was detected and treated immediately in these studies, under real life conditions, inflammation could cause more severe bone loss. Longer implants have a longer osseointegration length, so even a minor loss of bone would not immediately result in implant loosening. In this study, the residual osseointegration length ranged between  $3.35\mathrm{mm}$ and  $5.88\mathrm{mm}$  in the short implants group, and between  $10.1\mathrm{mm}$  and  $12.54\mathrm{mm}$  in the regular dental implants group after 5 years (Fig. 8). Hence, in situations of inflammation, there is the chance to treat regular length implants, while short implants may already have been lost even after slight inflammatory bone loss.


In a meta-analysis by Roccuzzo et al.,45 peri-implantitis could be treated well, with an implant survival rate of  $81.7 - 100\%$  after 3 years,  $76 - 100\%$  after 5 years, and  $69.6 - 98.7\%$  after 7 years. Furthermore, the aim should be to achieve long-term implant survival. Even if a new implant can be placed after an implant has been lost, the survival rate of the second, third, and fourth implants is reduced: first reimplantation  $77.4\%$ , second re-implantation  $72.7\%$ , third re-implantation  $50\%$  survival rate.[46] One reason for this is that the biological potential of the surrounding area is reduced.47 The data presented here suggest that bone augmentation and regular implants could probably avoid such repeated surgery at one site. This is an argument for placing longer implants, even with the additional price of bone augmentation. From the standpoint of the patient, short implants are less expensive, require less surgery, and generally take less treatment time.

Fig. 7. Subgroup analysis of marginal bone loss after 1 year for short versus ultrashort implants. While the bone loss was in favour of the short implants  $(P = 0.002)$ , no significant result was found for the ultrashort implants  $(P = 0.19)$  when compared to augmentation and regular implants.



Fig. 8. Meta-analysis of residual osseointegrated implant length—forest plot. At 1 year, regular implants had  $6.14\mathrm{mm}$  more osseointegrated length than short implants; after 5 years they had  $6.53\mathrm{mm}$  more osseointegrated length.
Fig. 9. Subgroup analysis of residual osseointegration after 1 year for short versus ultrashort implants. After 1 year, the residual osseointegration length ranged from  $3.84\mathrm{mm}$  to  $5.98\mathrm{mm}$  in the short implants group and from  $3.37\mathrm{mm}$  to  $3.96\mathrm{mm}$  in the ultrashort implants group.


Consequently, patients who are fit for surgery should be informed about the risks and benefits of bone augmentation. This could also involve the referral of a patient to a specialist for bone augmentation in particular cases. In this study, the surgical interventions of implantation resulted in perioperative biological complications (excluding mechanical implant complications and swelling), but there was no significant difference in complication rate between the short implants group (excluding ultrashort implants) and regular implants with augmentation group  $(P = 0.08)$ ; the use of ultrashort implants also showed no difference  $(P = 0.78)$ . The argument that augmentation is associated with a higher risk of complications cannot be substantiated by the results of this study.




The conclusions of this study must be interpreted with caution. A criticism may be that the biomaterials used for augmentation were heterogeneous, because different materials were used for the augmentation (Supplementary Material Table S1). In addition, patients included in an RCT usually enjoy a strict supportive periodontal care programme. Under real-life conditions without this care, short implants may suffer more from inflammatory bone resorption.

In conclusion, in the vertically deficient posterior maxilla, short implants versus lateral sinus floor augmentation combined with regular implants demonstrated comparable outcomes within the first 5 years. Patients who are fit for surgery should be informed about the risks and benefits of both options.
