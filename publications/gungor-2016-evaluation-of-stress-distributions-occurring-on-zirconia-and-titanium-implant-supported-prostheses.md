Titanium implants are defined as the gold standard and have been widely used in implant dentistry. Their high success rates have been proven in long-term clinical studies. The main disadvantage of titanium is its dark color, which can shine through the thin soft tissues or may be visible because of gingival recession. However, galvanic side effects and allergic reactions have also been demonstrated for titanium implants. In patients who value esthetics, rehabilitation of the loss of anterior teeth with titanium implants may present a clinical challenge and providing satisfactory esthetic results in the anterior region is often difficult to achieve.6


Zirconia implants may be an alternative to titanium implants.7 Zirconia implants have excellent mechanical properties, and their biocompatibility and osseointegration capacity have been demonstrated in several studies.7-15 Furthermore, zirconia has the ability to withstand long-term loading, although grinding can decrease the fracture strength of zirconia implants.16 Successful applications of zirconia implants have also

# ABSTRACT

Statement of problem. Titanium implants have been successfully used to support fixed dental prostheses. Zirconia implants have been suggested as support for crowns, but information on their use to support partial fixed dental prostheses is limited.

Purpose. The purpose of this finite element study was to evaluate the maximum principle, minimum principle, and von Mises stresses and their distributions on zirconia and titanium implant-supported, partial fixed dental prostheses located in the anterior maxillary region.

Material and methods. Zirconia and titanium implants (4 mm in diameter and 11.5 mm in length) and prostheses made from 2 different materials (lithium disilicate and zirconia) were simulated, and 4 models were generated: Titan-IPS, Titan-Lava, Zircon-IPS, and Zircon-Lava. The maxillary bone was modeled as type 3 bone. The load was applied obliquely (534 N) and horizontally (76.5 N), and the stress values and distributions were examined.

Results. Under horizontal loading, stresses generated on the cortical bone in the Zircon models were lower than those in the Titan models. Under oblique loading, stress values were similar in the same implant material and stress type. For all types of stress among the models, the stress values that occurred on the trabecular bone were found to be similar under both horizontal and oblique loading. The maximum stress values on the bones, implants, cores, and veneers did not exceed the strength of the structures.

Conclusions. Different stress values resulted from the different implant types. The prosthetic materials did not change the stress distributions in bone.

FEA generally focuses on the rehabilitation of single tooth loss with zirconia implants; however, using zirconia implants as an abutment for partial fixed dental prostheses is not well documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stress distributions that occur on the cortical bone, trabecular bone, implants and abutments, cores, and veneers under horizontal and oblique loading of a zirconia and titanium implant-supported partial fixed dental prosthesis using 3D FEA.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

A maxillary model was created by compiling 1-mm sections using computed tomography. The model was transferred to a computer (OptiPlex 755; Dell). To generate and organize the network structure, a computer program (Patran 2008; MSC Software Corp) was used. The product simulation program (Abaqus FEA v6.8.1; Dassault Systems Simulia Corp) was used for the solution of the model and results. In the maxillary anterior and premolar regions, a thin cortical bone layer composed of type 3 bone exists around the dense trabecular bone. Therefore, the bone quality classification of the maxillary bone was modeled according to homogeneous type 3 bone characteristics. The thickness of the cortical bone was determined as  $0.75\mathrm{mm}$ .[39,53]

Two-piece zirconia implants (Zit-vario; Ziterion) and titanium implants (Zit-vario; Ziterion) (4 mm in diameter and 11.5 mm in length) and straight (not-angled) zirconia abutments (Ziterion) were modeled. The design of the titanium and zirconia implants, abutment height, and width of the margins were the same. The implant-abutment connection was generated platform switching. Two implants were located parallel to each other and

A minimum of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of bone tissue was left around the implants.


Partial fixed dental prostheses were formed from 2 different prosthetic materials, lithium disilicate (IPS e.max Press; Ivoclar Vivadent AG) and zirconia (Lava; 3M ESPE), for both implants. For both core materials,  $1.5\mathrm{-mm}$  core thickness was determined. The stated minimum connector thickness for lithium disilicate ceramics is 4 to  $5\mathrm{mm}$  occlusogingivally, 3 to  $4\mathrm{mm}$  buccolingually, and  $9\mathrm{mm}^2$  for Lava zirconia cores.[54] A  $12\mathrm{mm}^2$ $(3\times 4\mathrm{mm}$ ; buccolingualxocclusogingival) connector thickness was used and was determined to be the same in all models. Zirconia and lithium disilicate core materials are generally covered with their appropriate veneers.[55-57] IPS e.max Ceram (veneer) for IPS e.max prostheses and Lava Ceram (veneer) for Lava prostheses were modeled as veneer porcelain. To design the outer forms of the partial fixed dental prostheses, anatomic crown parts of the maxillary model were used. In all designs, tetrahedral (triangular pyramid) linear elements were used.

Two different implants (titanium and zirconia implants) were used to support a 3-unit partial fixed dental prosthesis. With these combinations, 2 different prosthetic materials (IPS and Lava) were used. Cement thicknesses were ignored. A total of 4 different models were generated using the following combinations (Fig. 1): model Titan-IPS: titanium implant and zirconia abutment, IPS e.max core and veneer; model Titan-Lava: titanium implant and zirconia abutment, Lava core and veneer; model Zircon-IPS: zirconia implant and abutment, IPS e.max core and veneer; model Zircon-Lava: zirconia implant and abutment, Lava core and veneer.

Poisson ratios and the elastic moduli of the structures are listed in Table 1. The nodes and element numbers of the models are listed in Table 2. The characteristics of the structures were assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic, and linear elastic. The bone-implant interface was assumed to be perfect, simulating complete osseointegration (100% bone-implant contact). The models were fixed on 2 different planes: a horizontal plane located in the upper border of the maxillary bone and a frontal plane located in the maxillary first molar region.

Two different occlusal forces were applied: a horizontal occlusal force at a 90-degree angle to the long axis of the implant  $(\mathrm{F_h})$  and an oblique occlusal force at a 30-degree angle to the long axis of the implant  $(\mathrm{F_o})$ . The oblique load was  $178\mathrm{N}$  (534 N in total), and the horizontal load was  $25.5\mathrm{N}$  (76.5 N in total), applied on each tooth by dividing 7 different nodes. The ratio between the magnitudes of the occlusal forces was  $1:7(\mathrm{F_h:F_o})$ .<sup>58</sup> Loads were applied to the palatal surface of the complete prosthesis (central incisor, lateral incisor, and canine; Fig. 2). These magnitudes of forces have been used in similar studies.<sup>37,39,40</sup> The maximum principle,

minimum principle, and the von Mises stresses and their distributions were evaluated under horizontal and oblique loading. A value scale was determined to compare the stress patterns in the models.

# RESULTS

The maximum principle, minimum principle, and the von Mises stresses transmitted under horizontal and oblique loading to the cortical bone, trabecular bone, implants and abutments, cores, and veneers are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.
Figure 4. Maximum principle, minimum principle, and von Mises stress values in models under oblique loading.


Under horizontal loading, the minimum principle stresses occurring in the cortical bone were concentrated in the buccal region of the bone, whereas the highest von Mises and maximum principle stress concentrations were observed in the mesiopalatal region of the bone. The maximum principle stresses were similar in the Titan and Zircon models. Minimum principle stresses were similar in the Titan and Zircon models. The von Mises stresses were similar in the Titan and Zircon models. The maximum principle, minimum principle, and von Mises stress values in the cortical bone were slightly lower in the Zircon models. Under oblique loading, the highest maximum principle stress concentrations were observed in the mesiopalatal region of the bone where the implant was inserted into the central tooth area, and in the distal region of the bone where the implant was inserted into the canine tooth area (Fig. 5). Under horizontal loading, higher maximum principle stress concentrations were observed in the palatal region of the implant sockets and at the apexes of the cortical bone. Under oblique loading, the stress distributions were similar in the same stress type and higher stress concentrations were observed at the implant apexes in all the models.


In all stress types, the highest stress concentrations were observed in the implant and abutment connection part. Under horizontal loading, stress values were similar in the same implant material in the same stress type. Under oblique loading, the maximum principle stresses that occurred in the implants and abutments were concentrated in the palatal region of the implants inserted into the canine area. The minimum principle stresses and the von Mises stresses occurring on the implants and abutments were concentrated in the buccal region of the implants (Fig. 6).

Under horizontal loading, higher maximum principle, minimum principle, and von Mises stresses were observed on the cores in Lava models than on IPS models for both zirconia and titanium implants. Under oblique loading, higher maximum principle stress concentrations were observed on the buccal connector areas, especially in the Lava models. Higher minimum principle stress concentrations were observed on the palatal connector areas, especially in Lava models (Fig. 7). Under horizontal loading, higher maximum principle stresses were concentrated on the connector areas of the veneers at the buccal region, higher minimum principle stresses were concentrated on the palatal surface of the prosthesis and palatal connector areas, and higher von Mises stresses were concentrated on the buccal connector areas. Under oblique loading, higher maximum principle stress concentrations were observed on the buccal connector areas, especially in IPS models. Higher minimum principle stress concentrations were observed on the palatal connector areas, and especially on the load application areas. Von Mises stresses were concentrated on both the buccal and palatal connector areas, and especially on the load application areas (Fig. 8).

# DISCUSSION

The response of bone to biomechanical factors demonstrates osseointegration and remodeling capacity after implantation. Biomechanical analyses are complex because of the complexity of biomaterials, dental anatomy, and microstructural details.[34] For this reason, FEA is a numeric technique that has been widely used in dental implant analysis to standardize the factors.[26,34] In FEA, some simplifications and assumptions are made to provide acceptable approximations, (depending on geometry, material, boundary, and loading conditions).[34,43,44] In the present study, the materials have been assumed to be homogeneous and isotopic, which means that the material properties are identical in all directions, and only 2 independent variables (elasticity modulus and Poisson ratio) were defined. FEA with ideal modeling of implants and surrounding tissues produces more successful results.[26,39] For ideal modeling, the size of elements must be 150 to  $300~\mu \mathrm{m}$ . It has been reported that if the element size is larger than  $300~\mu \mathrm{m}$ , misleading results[39,59,60] may be obtained. However, decreasing the element size below  $150~\mu \mathrm{m}$  is not beneficial and extends the analysis time.[39,59,60] The average element size used in the study was  $250~\mu \mathrm{m}$ .


Occlusal loads distributed on osseointegrated implants are important for the long-term success of implant-supported prostheses.[27,37] The forces are usually concentrated on the crestal part of the cortical bone thus bone loss started from the crestal part of the bone.[35,39,45] The ultimate tensile and compressive strength values for the cortical bone are 121 to 135 MPa and 167 to  $205\mathrm{MPa}$ .[46,50,61] In the present study, in the cortical bone, under oblique loading, the highest maximum principle stress value was observed in the Zircon-Lava model (27.09 MPa) and the highest minimum principle stress value was observed in the Titan-IPS model (-73.20 MPa) under oblique loading.
Figure 6. Maximum principle, minimum principle, and von Mises stress occurring on implants and abutments under oblique loading.

The maximum principle stresses were concentrated on cortical bone at the distal side of the canine implant region and the minimum principle stresses were concentrated on the buccal crestal region of the implants. The observed values were below the ultimate tensile and compressive strength of the cortical bone. The ultimate strength values of the trabecular bone varies between 1 and  $20\mathrm{MPa}$ .46,61 Under oblique loading in the Zircon-IPS model, the stresses were concentrated on the implant apexes of the trabecular bone and the maximum stress value was the von Mises stress  $(7.25\mathrm{MPa})$ . It was concluded that the trabecular bone could successfully resist these stress values.

The highest stress value was the von Mises stress value (209.36 MPa), which was observed on the implants in the Zircon-Lava model under oblique loading. Zirconia exhibits a very high flexural strength (900 to 1200

MPa); therefore, within the loading conditions of this study, biomechanical failure was not expected in the observed stress values. The highest von Mises stress was 135.88 MPa in the Titan-Lava model under oblique loading. This value did not exceed the endurance limit of titanium (259.9 MPa).[38,47] The stresses were concentrated on the implant abutment connection area, which may have been a result of the platform switching design.

Different prosthetic materials are suggested for implant-supported prostheses.[28,30,41] The choice of the prosthetic material is a controversial topic, and there is a consensus that implant survival is not affected by the prosthetic material.[29,30] Zheng et al[49] stated that the interfacial stresses between the core and the veneer of zirconia-based partial fixed dental prostheses was greater than that of a gold alloy and lithium disilicate reinforced glass ceramic core and the veneer-core interface stress value decreased with increasing occlusal veneer thickness. In the present study, the IPS and Lava models were observed to have similar stress values and concentrations in bones under the same stress type when the same implant material was used. The difference in the stress values and concentrations observed in the bones was the result of the implant material type (titanium or zirconia). However, when the stresses generated on the core layers of the prostheses were evaluated, higher stress levels were observed in the Lava models. Möllers et al[48] stated that the stresses on the core materials increased with the decreasing elasticity modulus of the veneering material. Greater differences between the elasticity modulus of the core and veneer transmitted greater stress concentrations to the cores. The results showed that the Lava models exhibited higher stress values on the core materials than in the IPS models. In the present study, maximum principle and minimum principle stresses were concentrated on the connectors of the cores on the buccal region and palatal region. The highest stress value was the von Mises stress  $(93.6\mathrm{MPa})$  in the Titan-Lava model under oblique loading. Higher stress concentrations were observed in the Lava models than in the IPS models. The highest stress value in the IPS models was the von Mises stress  $(76.3\mathrm{MPa})$ .
Figure 7. Maximum principle, minimum principle, and von Mises stress occurring on cores under oblique loading.


Lithium disilicate ceramics exhibited flexural strength between 300 and  $400\mathrm{MPa}$ . For both core materials, failure was not expected according to results of this study.

# CONCLUSIONS

Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Under horizontal loading, stresses generated on the cortical bone in the Zircon models were lower than those in the Titan models.
2. Under oblique loading, stress values were similar in models with the same implant material and stress type.
3. Under both horizontal and oblique loading, the stresses that occurred on the trabecular bone were of similar stress type among all 4 models.
4. The maximum values that occurred on the bones, implants, cores, and veneers did not exceed the strength of the structures.

The difference in stress values was the result of the different implant type. Prosthetic materials do not change the stress distributions on bones. From a biomechanical point of view, zirconia implants can be used to support partial fixed dental prostheses.
