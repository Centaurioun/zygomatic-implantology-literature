Special thanks to Michael S. Block, DMD and Shady Hassan, BDS for their continued support, mentoring and for constantly advancing my implant surgery skills.

The placement of dental implants with the use of custom guides generated from specific computed tomography (CT) scanning protocols and software.

# Indications

1. Placement of dental implants where bone height, width, or shape is limited
2. Placement of dental implants near anatomical structures (inferior alveolar nerve, mental foramen, etc.)
3. Flapless implant surgery
4. Placement of dental implants in areas of bone atrophy resistant to grafting
5. Placement of multiple dental implants
6. Placement of dental implants in areas of significant adjacent root dilacerations
7. When ideal prosthetics are required for the aesthetic zone

# Contraindications

1. Insufficient bone height, width, or shape for the placement of dental implants
2. Poor bone quality
3. Systemic issues (previous radiation therapy, intravenous bisphosphonates, and chronic immunosuppression)
4. Bone pathology, infection, and gross periodontal disease
5. Skeletal immaturity
6. Psychological disorders

# Anatomy and Guided Surgery Planning Parameters

1. Implants should maintain a minimum of  $1.0 - 1.5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone circumferentially around the implant surface. This may be particularly difficult within the anterior maxilla due to the slope of the anterior maxillary alveolar process. In instances where facial plate thickness is minimal, consider the use of tapered implants

(see Figure 9.1) and the augmentation of the buccal plate of bone prior to or simultaneously with implant placement. Violation of appropriate bone thickness can lead to implant failure, infection, fistula formation, exposed implant threads, future bone and tissue loss, and decreased implant aesthetics and longevity.

2. Implants should maintain  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone between the implant body and the adjacent teeth roots. Violation of these parameters may lead to implant failure, interproximal bone necrosis/loss, blunting or absent papilla architecture, and infection/loss of the adjacent tooth.
3. Anterior implants within the aesthetic zone should be placed  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the adjacent teeth's cementoenamel junction (CEJ) in order to allow for ideal gingival contours and tissue architecture. In cases with thin overlying tissue support or high levels of crestal bone, the bone and tissue contours can be modified and the implant countersunk at the time of implant placement (see Figures 9.2 through 9.6) or custom healing abutments may be utilized to allow for ideal tissue and prosthesis aesthetics.
4. The implant shoulder (most crestal portion of the implant) should be a minimum of  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the adjacent natural tooth height of contour and at least  $3.0\mathrm{mm}$  from an adjacent implant if adjacent implants are being placed (see Figures 9.7 through 9.10). Violation of these parameters may make final restoration of the implant(s) impossible or suboptimal by creating excessive cantilever forces, necessitating implant splinting (in case of adjacent implants) and may mandate a cement- versus screw-retained final prosthesis.
5. An appropriate vertical restorative height must be either maintained or created. The minimum vertical restoration height for a cement-retained prosthesis (crown or bridge) is  $7\mathrm{mm}$  and the minimum restorative
Figure 9.1. The use of a tapered implant within the anterior maxilla allows for maintenance of  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  of bone thickness at the apex of the dental implant. If soft tissue height is inadequate, implants may be countersunk to increase the vertical restorative height and to aid in the development of ideal soft tissue contours.
Figure 9.2. Thin biotype, poor soft tissue architecture and only  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  of soft tissue height at site #8. The placement of an implant at the current bone and soft tissue height will lead to a high gingival margin, the appearance of a short clinical crown and suboptimal soft tissue architecture.
Figure 9.3. At the time of implant placement,  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical bone was reduced circumferentially around the implant osteotomy to allow for the implant shoulder to be placed  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the adjacent teeth's CEJ.

height for a screw-retained prosthesis is  $4\mathrm{mm}$ . Violation of these parameters will lead to unrestorable implants, the need for opposing occlusal reduction, or mandating a screw-retained prosthesis. When appropriate vertical restorative height is not possible, the implant must be intentionally countersunk to increase the vertical restorative space and/or the opposing dentition modified. Depending on the degree of apical implant placement, osteotomy site profiling or vertical alveoloplasty may be necessary.
Figure 9.7. Virtual surgical planning (VSP) for absent teeth #19, #20, #21, and #30. Virtual implants have been placed within implant-specific software to ensure implants are spaced ideally, parallel, and in ideal occlusion with the opposing dentition.
Figure 9.8. Implants are planned at least  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the implant shoulder to the adjacent natural tooth's height of contour and with at least  $3.0\mathrm{mm}$  of space between adjacent implants.
Figure 9.9. Reformatted orthopantomogram showing parallel implants spaced ideally for definitive fixed restorations.


6. In cases where a fixed bridge will be fabricated, implants should be placed as parallel as possible in order to maintain a similar path of insertion and axial loading of the fixed prosthesis. Implants must emerge through the clinical crowns of the final fixed restoration and not through the embrasure spaces.

7. Anterior implants should be planned to emerge through the cingulums of the planned prosthesis. Violation will lead to unattractive access through the facial surface or incisal edge of the final prosthesis. Posterior implants should emerge through the central groove of the implant crown in order to allow for axial loading and support of the functional cusp.
8. Although not as critical as when restoring natural teeth, the implant to final prosthesis (crown to root) ratio is important to follow. Placing a short or narrow diameter implant in a site with a significant vertical restorative height may lead to premature implant failure.
9. Safe distances of implant apices from key vital structures must be maintained. Recommendations include  $2.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the mandibular canal and mental nerve,  $1.0\mathrm{mm}$  from the overlying maxillary sinus and nasal floor,  $1.0\mathrm{mm}$  from the incisive canal (nasopalatine foramen),  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the mandibular lingual bone undercut, and  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  from adjacent teeth roots. Alternatively, the maxillary sinus may be intentionally penetrated if a direct or indirect sinus augmentation is planned. The incisive canal may be violated if intentional obliteration and grafting is planned at the time of implant placement.

# Technique

1. Patients are consulted regarding implant and grafting materials, potential complications, the implant to crown timeline, the workup and surgical procedure, the healing period, the specific roles of the surgeon and of the restoring dentist, and realistic final results.
2. A cone beam CT (CBCT) scan, dental models, and a bite registration are taken. Any intraoral scanner that exports stereolithography (STL) files can be used. Additionally, scans of stone models can be utilized if intraoral scanners are not available.
3. The CBCT and STL files are merged using surface-mapping technology (see Figures 9.17 through 9.23 in Case Report 9.1). The patient's bony anatomy, soft tissue anatomy, and teeth are evaluated in a layered 3D environment. Anatomical structures are highlighted (mandibular canal, mental foramen, and sinuses).
4. Implant treatment planning is performed virtually using restoration-guided implant planning (a crowndown approach). Most software programs contain the majority of commercial-grade implants preloaded within their software package. The implant (or implants) is selected and placed within the edentulous region. Manipulation of the implant position is performed with the aid of axial, sagittal, and coronal views; serial slices; and custom cross-sections. The

must be cognizant of the location of vital structures, the opposing dentition, and the anticipated shape and location of the final crown. The decision is made as to whether the crown would be best restored with a screw-retained or cement-retained prosthesis. For a screw-retained prosthesis, implants are planned palatal so that the screw can be positioned along the cingulum of the crown. For a cement-retained prosthesis, implants are centered parallel to the long axis of the crown. If multiple implants are to be placed, the implants should be placed as parallel as possible and spacing should be optimized. Most programs have paralleling tools for this type of application.

5. The final 3D treatment plan is approved, and a surgical guide is fabricated. The guide is placed prior to the administration of local anesthesia to ensure a proper fit. The guide should interdigitate with the occlusal third of the clinical crowns, should be rigid, and should not rock or bend. Any potential for movement of the surgical guide will be translated into drilling errors and unplanned implant placement.
6. Local anesthesia is administered in the form of infiltration only. Sedations and nerve blocks are typically not utilized for mandibular implant surgery as the vibration of the drill as it nears the inferior alveolar nerves adds an additional layer of safety during mandibular osteotomy preparation. Depending on the clinical situation and the operator's experience, the decision is made for creating a mucoperiosteal tissue flap or performing flapless surgery.
7. In flapless surgery, the guide is placed, and the appropriate drill sleeve is placed for the pilot drill. The pilot drill is taken to the predetermined depth using drill stops and/or external measurements. The osteotomy is enlarged to the preplanned size using sequential drill sleeves and drills with copious irrigation.
8. Once the preplanned implant osteotomy depth and diameter are reached, a bone probe is placed into the osteotomy site in order to confirm  $360^{\circ}$  of bone contact around the circumference of the osteotomy site.
9. Based on the surgeon's preference and the guide design, the implant may be placed through the surgical guide for complete control of implant angulation and depth or the guide may be removed and the implant placed freehand. Implants are typically placed freehand if the osteotomy site requires additional modification in the form of bone profiling, hard or soft tissue augmentation or if an implant is placed that is larger than the  $5.0\mathrm{mm}$  diameter of the drill sleeve.

10. Based on the bone quality, a cover screw, a healing abutment, or a provisional prosthesis is placed. For anterior cases, immediate or early loading with prefabricated temporary crowns is recommended to shape tissue architecture.

# Postoperative Management

1. Patients are prescribed analgesics based on the invasiveness of the procedure. With the flapless approach, patient pain is minimal.
2. Patients are instructed to begin twice-daily saltwater rinses beginning the day after surgery. Healing abutments and provisional restorations are brushed daily with a soft toothbrush.
3. Depending on PA (periapical) films and torque test values, implants are ready for final prosthesis placement after 6-8 weeks of osseointegration.

# Complications

Complications are associated with non-ideal implant placement and poor surgical technique and include infection, failure of implant osseointegration, and damage to adjacent structures.

# Key Points

1. Digital treatment (virtual surgical) planning allows for a direct line of communication between the surgeon and the patient, the referring dentist, and the laboratory regarding implant options, possibilities, and limitations.
2. Digital work-ups allow the surgeon an in-depth understanding of the surgical site to include bone volume and density (measured in Hounsfield units), proximity to vital structures, and implant position and angulation.
3. Guided surgery allows for decreased surgery time, decreased implant angulation, and placement errors and when using the crown-down technique, allows the planning of implant placement based on the virtual wax-up of the final prosthesis position.
4. Guided surgery is precise and accurate with errors typically less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . Most deviations are at the apex of the implants and not at the shoulder (crestal aspect of the implant).
5. Parallel versus tapered wall dental implants. Guided parallel wall implant placement is more accurate as the implant osteotomy is uniform in wall thickness throughout the depth of the osteotomy. Tapered implants aid in achieving primary stability in softer maxillary bone (decreased Hounsfield units), especially if the osteotomy site is under-prepared (under-drilled) and can help maintain appropriate

thickness of the facial plate with anterior maxillary implants (see Figure 9.1).

6. Specific care must be taken when placing implants within the aesthetic zone of the anterior maxilla, especially in patients with a high smile line. Error on the side of placing anterior implants deep and palatal, as implants placed too facial and supracrestal are difficult to restore cosmetically, even with custom or angled abutments.

7. The majority of anterior maxillary implants can benefit from a subepithelial connective tissue graft, especially in cases with a thin biotype.

8. Custom temporaries and anatomical and custom healing abutments greatly enhance the gingival contours of the implant site. Poor oral hygiene around temporaries and abutments will lead to tissue inflammation, edema, papilla loss, or blunting. Patients are typically scheduled 3-4 weeks after the placement of anatomical or custom temporaries to assess cleanliness and to make oral hygiene recommendations if necessary.

9. Most implants are placed in a flapless fashion in order to decrease scar formation, to decrease surgeon operating time, to minimize patient discomfort, edema and recovery, and to allow for rapid and ideal soft tissue healing. Exceptions are made if bone reintour- ing or hard or soft tissue grafting is required.

10. Complications do occur with the placement of guided dental implants. Errors can occur in the planning stage; these include errors in the dental or digital impression, scanning and software errors, and planning errors. Errors may occur during guide fabrication that result in poor fitting guides with non-optimal accuracy. Errors during implant surgery include insufficient irrigation due to the thickness of the guide, implants placed too superficially, implants placed without complete bone coverage, and implants that violate adjacent anatomical structures.

11. A surgical guide that is not rigid and/or does not fit ideally will cause inaccuracies with implant placement during guided surgery. Guides are intentionally designed to cross the midline in order to allow for cross-arch stabilization and increased guide stability.
12. For tooth-supported cases where the edentulous span is greater than four continuous teeth, skeletal fixation pins are recommended to increase guide stability and overall implant placement accuracy (see Figure 9.58 in Case Report 9.2).
13. The patient's maximum vertical opening (MVO) will determine if the placement of posterior implants is possible using a guide. In patients with a limited MVO, it is difficult to place the surgical guide, drill sleeves, and hand piece and orient them appropriately.
14. Scan body impressions (see Figure 9.10) may be taken after implant osseointegration and exported to the referring dentist for CERAC crown fabrication (see Figure 9.11), to the referring dentist's lab for crown fabrication directly from the STL file (see Figure 9.12), or a custom model (see Figures 9.13 and 9.14) can be fabricated with an implant analog in place.
15. The number one cause of peri-implantitis is cement extrusion into the gingival sulcus. Whenever possible, implants should be placed for a screw-retained prosthesis. Screw-retained prosthesis also have the advantages of retrievability and the use of numerous angled stock abutments.
16. Ideal implant placement is paramount for the longevity of dental implants. Implants should be centered within the restorative space, axially loaded with the final prosthesis, and should have dense bone circumferentially around the implant.

# Case Reports

Case Report 9.1. Integration of DICOM and STL files in a 3D layered environment. Congenitally missing teeth #7 and #10 with limited space. A 19-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of congenitally missing teeth #7 and #10. The patient has been in orthodontics for the past 5 years. On review of the initial CBCT scan, there was insufficient spacing for dental implant placement. The patient was referred back to the orthodontist to create at least  $6.0\mathrm{mm}$  of horizontal spacing between the adjacent teeth roots and the heights of contour of the teeth adjacent to the edentulous sites. After obtaining  $6\mathrm{mm}$  of space between adjacent teeth, a digital impression and an open bite CBCT scan were obtained. The data was exported in the form of DICOM (CBCT scan) and STL (digital impression) files to implant specific planning software to evaluate the case in a 3D layered environment. The maxilla was isolated within the software package and the two files were merged using occlusal points of reference. A virtual wax-up was performed and crowns were placed into edentulous sites #7 and #10. Implants were positioned in the software after the virtual crowns were designed (crown-down technique) to ensure ideal emergence and position of the implants based on the future restorative prostheses design. Implants were designed to have sufficient bone support, to be placed  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the CEJ of the adjacent teeth, and to have safe margins from adjacent vital structures. A custom guide was virtually created to fit over the pre-existing orthodontic brackets and then 3 D printed into a physical form. Implants were placed in a guided and flapless fashion. After 6 weeks of healing, PA films and torque testing were performed to ensure implant osteointegration. Scan body impressions were taken and an STL file was exported for the creation of a custom model. The final implant crowns were designed on the articulated custom STL generated model (see Figure 9.15 through 9.43).

Case Report 9.2. Implants in the aesthetic zone with multiple prosthetic options. 28-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of failing anterior maxillary dentition. After the extraction of the terminal anterior teeth, teeth #5-#10 will be absent. Tooth #11 has drifted into an unideal position and there is a horizontal (width) bone defect at site #10. Prior to extraction and grafting, a digital work-up (wax-up) was performed by exporting the CBCT scan (DICOM files) and TRIOS digital impression (STL files) into implant-specific software. The DICOM and STL files were merged in a 3D environment and a prosthetic work-up was performed. Several weeks prior to surgery, the patient was presented with two prosthetic options. After the patient and dentist agreed upon the prosthetic an essix retainer was made to mimic the virtual wax-up. The terminal teeth were extracted and the alveolar ridge was reconstructed with a combination of socket and onlay grafting. The essix retainer was placed as a temporary prosthesis. After 3 months of graft consolidation, an open bite CBCT scan and a TRIOS digital impression were obtained and an implant treatment plan was created based on the virtual prosthetic wax-up. A custom guide was fabricated and the implants were placed in a flapless fashion and allowed to integrate for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, scan body impressions were obtained and the STL files were delivered to the dentists preferred lab. The final prosthesis was fabricated based on the exported STL file from the scan body impressions (see Figure 9.44 through 9.67).

Case Report 9.4. Adolescent orthodontic therapy, immediate implants, and custom healing abutment placement. An 18-year-old male presents congenitally missing teeth #6, #7, #11, and #13. The patient initiated orthodontic therapy at 13 years of age in mixed dentition. The patient initially presented to the orthodontist with a  $90\%$  deep anterior overbite, excess maxillary spacing, a peg lateral incisor at site #10, and missing 12 permanent teeth (#1, #6, #7, #11, #13, #16, #17, #18, #20, #29, #31, and #32). Deciduous teeth letters A, C, H, and J were remained within the maxillary arch with only letter A having a permanent successor. Deciduous teeth letters c, h, and j served as space maintainers until the patient reached skeletal maturity. Full orthodontic treatment was completed at 17 years of age with improved occlusion, normal overbite, and ideal spacing and root management for future dental implants. A lingual fixed retainer between the maxillary central incisors was placed to maintain diastema space closure and central incisor position until definitive restorative treatment with dental implants and permanent crowns could be achieved at skeletal maturity. At age 18, the patient was treatment planned for the removal of teeth letters c, h, and j, immediate implant placement at sites #6, #7, #11, and #13 and custom screw-retained healing abutments. Site #13 required a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  indirect sinus lift to accommodate a  $4.8\times 8\mathrm{mm}$  implant. Site #13 did not receive a custom healing abutment as it is not within the anterior aesthetic zone (see Figures 9.82 through 9.101).

Case Report 9.5. Implant in the aesthetic zone with immediate prosthesis placement. A 37-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of missing tooth #9. The patient is unhappy with the aesthetics of his removable prosthesis (flipper) and desires a fixed solution. Site #9 with sufficient bone volume and density for the placement of a dental implant with simultaneous temporary crown placement (see Figures 9.102 through 9.130).

Case Report 9.6. Implants in the aesthetic zone with temporary prosthesis placement. A 45-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of a failing maxillary 6-unit fixed bridge. Tooth #6 with a large apical abscess and tooth #11 with recurrent decay under its margin. The edentulous ridge at sites #7-#10 with significant horizontal bone loss from disuse atrophy. The decision was made to place implants at sites #7-#10 as natural teeth abutments #6 and #11 were not strong enough to support another fixed prosthesis. Teeth #6 and #11 were treated with definitive single-unit crowns and tooth #6 received endodontic therapy. Particulate onlay grafting was performed to the buccal plate defect. A custom virtual work-up was created. During the digital work-up, it was noted that the patient had a Class III malocclusion that was camouflaged by his six-unit fixed bridge. A try in removable prosthesis (Essix retainer) was fabricated for patient approval prior to confirming the overall treatment plan. Immediately after implant placement, scan bodies were placed and a digital impression was obtained. A custom fixed prothesis was designed and inserted 1 week after implant placement. The interim fixed prosthesis was fabricated to be slightly out of occlusion and to be in an end-to-end occlusion to compensate (camouflage) the Class III malocclusion. The patient wore his temporary removable prosthesis used to assess his overall aesthetics and lip projection while the custom temporary was being fabricated. The custom fixed interim prosthesis was placed after 1 week of implant healing and the final digital impression was obtained 6 weeks after implant placement (see Figures 9.131 through 9.156).
