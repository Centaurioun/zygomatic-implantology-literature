# Procedure: Onlay Bone Grafting

A method of augmenting the hard tissue of the mandible and/or maxilla to facilitate the placement of endosseous implants.

# Indications

1. Inadequate available bone width and/or height for the placement of dental implants in an ideal restorative position
2. Adequate space in relation to vital structures allowing for the placement of fixation screws

# Contraindications

1. Inadequate restorative space for the fabrication of the final prosthesis
2. Intravenous bisphosphonate therapy
3. Immunosuppressed patients
4. Previous radiation therapy to the site of grafting and implant placement
5. Relative contraindications include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, smoking/vaping, alcoholism, active periodontal disease, and chronic corticosteroid therapy

# Intraoral Alveolar Ridge Augmentation Technique

1. Preoperative models, optical intraoral scans, 3D radiographs (CBCT scans) and dental implant specific planning software may be used to estimate the amount of bone augmentation required.
2. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure and the type of graft material utilized are discussed with the patient. The graft material (autogenous or allogenous) is selected based on defect size, defect location, patient desires, and the surgeon's preference.
3. The procedure may be performed under local anesthesia, intravenous sedation, or general endotracheal sedation depending on the amount of bone augmentation required, the donor site, the patient's anxiety level, and the patient's medical history.

4. Antibiotic prophylaxis is administered 30 minutes preoperatively. The oral cavity is prepped with chlorhexidine and/or betadine solution.
5. Local anesthesia is administered within the augmentation site, utilizing nerve blocks for the mandible and local infiltration for the maxilla. Local anesthesia is also injected within the attached and unattached tissue of the recipient site to aid in hemostasis and to hydrodissect the periosteum from the underlying bone.
6. A #15 blade is utilized to bisect the keratinized tissue overlying the atrophic alveolar ridge. Vertical releasing incisions are frequently necessary to obtain adequate exposure of the surgical site and to allow for a tension-free closure over the augmented area.
7. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is elevated to expose the atrophic alveolar site (see Figure 5.2 in Case Report 5.1, Figure 5.9 in Case Report 5.2, and Figure 5.23 in Case Report 5.3) and the osseus defect is measured. The defect size determines the amount of allograft required or the amount of autogenous bone to be extracted from the harvest site.
8. For block grafting, the recipient site is contoured (see Figure 5.3 in Case Report 5.1) with a round bur to allow for passive and even contact of the graft to the underlying alveolus.
9. A 701 bur may be utilized to create perforations within the buccal cortex to stimulate blood flow to the area. The periosteum is released with a #15 blade in order to allow for added mobility of the mucoperiosteal flap and a tension-free closure.
10. The graft (block or particulate) is placed within the recipient site. For block grafts, the graft should be flush with the underlying bone, should have a passive fit, should completely fill the area to be grafted, and should have no sharp protruding edges or corners. Block grafts are fixated to the recipient site with a minimum of two positional screws (see Figure 5.5 in Case Report 5.1). Particulate grafting may be utilized to fill any residual defects between the graft and the recipient bed.
11. The full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is advanced over the graft and checked for passivity. Membranes are placed (see Figure 5.12 in Case Report 5.2 and

Figure 5.26 in Case Report 5.3) based on the surgeon's preference, the ability to achieve a tension-free primary closure of the augmented surgical site, and the presence of tears within the overlying mucoperiosteal flap.

12. The surgical site is closed in a tension-free manner (see Figure 5.13 in Case Report 5.2 and Figure 5.27 in Case Report 5.3) with 3-0 or 4-0 sutures.

# Subperiosteal Mandibular Tunnel Grafting Technique

1. Steps 1-5 of Intraoral Alveolar Ridge Augmentation Technique are utilized.
2. A 1.5-cm vertical or 45-degree-angled incision is created at the anterior aspect of the defect site (see Figure 5.35 in Case Report 5.4) that will allow for a tension-free closure once augmentation is completed. Care is taken to avoid placing the incision in close proximity to the mental nerve and foramen.
3. A subperiosteal tunnel is created using a periosteal or freer elevator to elevate the periosteal in the area of the proposed graft. Care is taken to create a subperiosteal pocket to hold the graft material with a solid inferior periosteum stop and to not tear the overlying tissues. The dissection should not enter the retromolar pad, cross over to the lingual aspect of the alveolus or violate muscular attachments.
4. Particulate graft material is placed within a  $1.0\mathrm{-mL}$  Tb syringe to facilitate graft placement. The syringe is placed through the vertical incision and injected in a retrograde fashion within the subperiosteal tunnel (see Figure 5.37 in Case Report 5.4).
5. The anterior incision is closed in a tension-free manner with resorbable sutures (see Figure 5.38 in Case Report 5.4)
Figure 5.1. Common sources of autogenous bone.

# Symphysis (Chin) Graft Technique

1. Preoperative CBCT or medical grade scans are utilized to identify key structures within the anterior mandible (apices of the anterior teeth roots, mental foramen, and mandibular canal).
2. Steps 1-5 of Intraoral Alveolar Ridge Augmentation Technique are utilized.
3. The mandibular symphysis region may be approached via either a sulcular (see Figure 5.42 in Case Report 5.5) or a vestibular approach. Advantages of the sulcular approach include greater access, better visibility, increased hemostasis, and decreased postoperative paresthesia. Disadvantages include increased risk of gingiva recession. The sulcular approach originates along the buccal sulcus of the anterior teeth and extends to the second molar region where bilateral releasing incisions are created, extending from the distobuccal line angles into the vestibule. The vertical releasing incisions are posterior to the mental foramen. The vestibular incision provides direct access to the symphysis region; however, it is associated with increased neurosensory disturbances. The vestibular incision originates  $1\mathrm{cm}$  inferior to the mucogingival junction from first premolar to first premolar and transverses the mentalis muscle.
4. Once the symphysis is accessed, the mentalis is reflected, the bilateral mental foramen and nerves are visualized and protected, and the inferior border of the anterior mandible is identified.
5. The harvest zone is identified  $5\mathrm{mm}$  lateral to the mental foramen bilaterally,  $5\mathrm{mm}$  superior to the inferior border of the anterior mandible, and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the anterior teeth roots (see Figure 5.43 in Case Report 5.5).
6. Osteotomies are initiated with any combination of fissured or round burs, saws, chisels, or piezoelectric devices. The graft is harvested atraumatically with the aid of dental elevators or chisels with preservation of the lingual plate of bone. Graft shape may include one large corticocancellous graft or two bilateral grafts (see Figure 5.44 in Case Report 5.5) without violating the mandibular midline.
7. The site is irrigated and the mentalis muscle is resuspended with 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The sulcular or vestibular incisions are closed with resorbable sutures (see Figure 5.45 in Case Report 5.5).

# Lateral Ramus Graft Technique

1. Preoperative CBCT or medical grade scans are utilized to identify key structures within the posterior mandible (apices of the posterior teeth roots, mental foramen, and mandibular canal).
2. Steps 1-5 of Intraoral Alveolar Ridge Augmentation Technique are utilized.

3. A sulcular incision is created along the neck of the posterior molars and is continued posteriorly and laterally along the external oblique ridge. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal tissue flap is elevated to expose the lateral ramus from the first molar to the ascending ramus (see Figure 5.47 in Case Report 5.6). If the coronoid process is to harvest as well, the incision is carried to the sigmoid notch and the temporalis muscle is stripped from the coronoid process.
4. The outline of the graft is marked based on the preoperative CBCT scan to ensure a safe distance from the mandibular canal. Osteotomies are created using burs, saws, chisels, or piezoelectric devices. The anterior vertical osteotomy is initiated just anterior to the thickest prominence of the buccal plate of bone. The crestal osteotomy is initiated medial to the external oblique ridge with care to maintain a safe distance of at least  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of bone lateral to the molar teeth. The inferior osteotomy is placed  $4\mathrm{mm}$  above the mandibular canal. The posterior vertical osteotomy is based on the amount of bone harvest necessary for the graft site. The posterior osteotomy may extend as far posteriorly as the sigmoid notch if the coronoid process will be harvested. All osteotomies extend into the marrow space, unless the posterior osteotomy extends so far posterior that a marrow space cannot be identified.
5. Once all osteotomies are completed (see Figure 5.48 in Case Report 5.6), the lateral ramus graft is out fractured with dental elevators, periosteal elevators, or chisels. The use of dental elevators allows increased tactile sensation and the ability to detect and correct the propagation of aberrant fractures before completing the out-fracture.
6. Once the lateral ramus graft is harvested, the harvest site is inspected (see Figure 5.49 in Case Report 5.6). Accidental unroofing of the mandibular canal is treated by inspecting the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). Damage to the epineurium is managed by placing the IAN passively within the mandibular canal. Transection of the IAN is managed via direct repair with 8-0 nylon sutures. The donor site is copiously irrigated and closed with resorbable sutures.

# Postoperative Management

1. Analgesics and antibiotics are prescribed.
2. A liquid diet is recommended for the first 48 hours. The diet is then advanced to a soft mechanical diet for the first week. Patients are to avoid masticating at the site of the graft.
3. Oral hygiene is maintained with gentle brushing of any teeth adjacent to the surgical site and the utilization of saltwater rinses three times daily until all intraoral incision sites are healed.

4. Patients are to avoid the wearing of any prosthesis that will place pressure on the graft site or graft harvest site for a minimum of 14 days. Preexisting or temporary dentures may be refined to alleviate pressure on the augmented ridges.
5. Patients are to avoid strenuous activity until evaluated at 7 days postoperatively.

# Complications

1. Wound dehiscence: Incision line dehiscences result from failure to obtain a tension-free closure, failure to remove sharp edges from block grafts, and placing too much grafting material within the recipient site. Dehiscences result in contamination of the graft, delayed healing, and partial or complete loss of the graft. Dehiscences are treated with meticulous oral hygiene, chlorohexidine rinses, and the addition of systemic antibiotics as indicated. Exposed, loose particulate grafting material should be removed with a curette, and areas of exposed block grafts should be removed with a handpiece with copious irrigation. The above techniques may allow for the partial retention of the underlying, unexposed graft.
2. Infection: Infections typically occur from intraoperative wound contamination and/or postoperative wound dehiscence. Infections are treated with prompt incision and drainage, removal of the source of the infection (infected hardware and mobile graft), chlorohexidine rinses, and systemic antibiotics.
3. Loss of graft: Partial or complete loss of bone graft may occur secondary to infection or wound dehiscence. Significant graft loss may require additional augmentation.
4. Nerve damage: The IAN may be damaged during the harvest of lateral ramus grafts, during the exposure of the parasymphysis region of the mandible, and during the placement of position screws to secure block grafts. Nerve damage can be minimized with a thorough evaluation of preoperative radiographs and attention to detail. Close monitoring, testing, and documentation are performed until resolution of symptoms. Patients who fail to improve should be referred for evaluation from a microvascular nerve specialist.
5. Graft mobilization: Graft mobilization may occur secondary to fixation failure or localized infection. Failure to achieve adequate fixation may lead to partial or total graft loss, infection, or fibrous union.

# Key Points

1. A thorough evaluation and calibration of preoperative radiographs will aid the surgeon in determining the amount of bone augmentation required, the type of

graft needed, and will minimize the potential for nerve injury.

2. Ridge morphology dictates the type of onlay graft utilized. Three-wall and four-wall bony defects, saddle depressions, and areas of deficient buccal bone with an inferior stop are typically amendable to onlay particulate grafting. Two-wall bony defects respond best to block onlay grafting.
3. Particulate graft sources include any combination of autogenous, alloplastic, xenoplastic, and synthetic bone or may be prepackaged within a bone putty (Regenaform; Exatech, Gainesville, FL, USA), mixed with a tissue adhesive to provide additional form and support (Tisseel; Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA), combined with protein-based regenerative gels (Emdogain; Straumann, Andover, MA, IUSA), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), or combined with osteoconductive materials (rhBMP-2 Infuse; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
4. Block grafts require contouring prior to placement to maximize bone contact, to allow an even and passive fit, and to remove all sharp edges and corners.
5. Immobility of the graft is key to successful incorporation. Two-point fixation is necessary with block grafting to minimize rotation and movement during the healing process. Positional screws are preferred to lag screws in order to minimize iatrogenic fracture of the block graft.
6. The mandibular symphysis can generate a corticocancellous block graft of approximately  $20\mathrm{mm}$  (length)  $\times 10\mathrm{mm}$  (height)  $\times 7\mathrm{mm}$  (depth) with uninterrupted bilateral harvest. Smaller grafts are available if a midline bony strut is preserved (see Figure 5.44 in Case Report 5.5) within the midline to maintain the bony architecture of the chin. Decreased bone volume is available in atrophic mandibles and prolonged edentulous regions.
7. The lateral ramus can generate a strictly cortical block graft with a variable cortical thickness. Standard lateral ramus grafts can generate a  $13\mathrm{mm}$  (vertical)  $\times 30\mathrm{mm}$  (horizontal) cortical block harvest (see Figure 5.50 in Case Report 5.6). When larger bone quantities are desired, the lateral ramus graft may be extended posteriorly to include the coronoid process of bone (see Figure 5.51 in Case Report 5.6).
8. Particulate bone from the maxillary tuberosity may be harvested during third molar surgery. Bone may safely be harvested from the distal of the second molar to the hamular notch. Care should be taken to avoid entering the overlying maxillary sinus. The bone harvested from the maxillary tuberosity is typically of poor quality and is most commonly mixed with allograft to add osteoprogenitor cells.

# Case Reports

Case Report 5.3. Mandibular particulate onlay grafting. A 68-year-old male presents with a failed three-unit bridge to the right posterior mandible. After the bridge was removed and a new crown was placed on tooth #29, site #30 was noted to have significant bone atrophy, especially in the horizontal dimension. The decision was made to extract root tips #31 with socket preservation grafting and to perform onlay grafting at atrophic site #30. Tooth #31 was extracted atraumatically and an onlay graft consisting of particulate bovine bone, Tisseel fibrin sealant, and Emdogain was placed. After 3 months of healing, two tissue level implants were placed and restored (see Figures 5.20 through 5.31) to allow increased function of the right posterior mandible.
