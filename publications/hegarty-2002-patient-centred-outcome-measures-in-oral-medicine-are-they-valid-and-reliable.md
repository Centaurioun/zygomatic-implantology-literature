Abstract. The present study evaluates the performance of patient-centred outcome measures in the oral medicine setting in patients with oral lichen planus. The study included 48 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of oral lichen planus who completed a questionnaire incorporating two patient-centred outcome measures: the 16-item UK Oral Health Related Quality Of Life Measure (OHQOL-UK) and 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). They subsequently underwent an oral examination and rated the pain they experienced on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The impact of oral health on their life quality was considerable with physical, social and psychological consequences. Both OHQOL-UK  $(P < 0.01)$  and OHIP-14 scores  $(P < 0.01)$  were associated with clinical findings; demonstrating criterion validity. Patient rating of pain experienced (on a VAS) correlated with OHQOL-UK  $(P < 0.01)$  and OHIP-14  $(P < 0.01)$ ; demonstrating construct validity. The mean inter-item correlation for OHQOL-UK was 0.93 and was 0.90 for OHIP-14; demonstrating high internal consistency reliability. Our results suggest both OHQOL-UK and OHIP-14, patient-centred outcome measures perform well in patients with oral lichen planus, demonstrating validity and reliability. This implies patient-centred outcome measures may be utilized in both oral medicine and oral and maxillofacial surgery to assess patient needs and opinions.

# Introduction

Patient perceptions are important in the assessment of treatment need, planning of appropriate therapy and clinical outcome. Whilst the majority of oral diseases are not fatal, they give rise to significant morbidity, resulting in physical, social and psychological consequences which affect patients' 'quality of life'.

Over the past decade the measurement of how patients perceive their oral health status as affecting their life quality has emerged as an important method of assessing outcome. A variety of patient-centred outcome measures termed 'oral health related quality of life measures' have been developed[13]. Two measures that have received particular attention are the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and the UK Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHQOL-UK)[6] questionnaires[9,14], of which there are available UK national norms data[10,11]. These measures have been employed principally in the assessment of restorative oral health care. There is no data on the impact of quality of life of patients with disorders relevant to oral medicine $^{12}$ .



There is a need to establish the effect of oral mucosal disease upon quality of life—particularly as these are often chronic and/or recurrent painful disorders, which occasionally predispose to or may develop into life-threatening conditions.

In view of the paucity of data regarding the assessment of quality of life in patients with oral mucosal disease the aim of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of two patient centred outcome measures: OHIP-14 and OHQOL-UK among patients with oral lichen planus.


The following hypotheses were tested:

i. Construct validity: significant differences in scores derived from the questionnaires exist among patients with symptomatic and nonsymptomatic lesions, ii. Criterion validity: scores derived from the questionnaire are moderately/ strongly correlated with patients' rating of their pain experience on a visual analogue scale (VAS), iii. Internal reliability: there is strong inter-item correlation between the items of each individual measure.

# Methods

The study group comprised 48 English-speaking patients (38 female, group median age 53 years, range 26 to 86 years) with clinical and histological features of erosive or ulcerative oral lichen planus attending the Oral Medicine unit of the Eastman Dental Institute for Oral Health Care Sciences, University College London, UK. Local ethical approval was obtained and written consent was obtained from all patients.

# Data collection

The data collection consisted of a self-completed structured questionnaire and an oral examination. The self-completed questionnaire incorporated the two patient-centred outcome measures; the 14-item oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) and the 16-item UK oral health related quality of life measure (OHQOL-UK)9,14. These measures are based on two conceptually distinct models of oral health, the former based on the World Health Organization (WHO) model of 'disease-impairment-disability-handicap' and the latter on an updated WHO model of 'structure-functionability-participation' which incorporates both negative and positive influences of health6,15. Patients also rated the pain they were currently experiencing from their lesions on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0-100, zero representing 'no pain' and 100 'the worse pain imaginable'. Oral examination was undertaken after completion of the questionnaire. The clinician was blind to the questionnaire responses.

# Data analysis

Scores were derived from both questionnaires by summating the responses to each of the individual questions within the measures. For OHIP-14, each item was scored: 'never'—score 0, 'hardly ever'—score 1, 'occasionally'—score 2, 'fairly often'—score 3, 'very often'—score 4. Possible OHIP-14 scores range from 0 to 56. For the OHQOL-UK the response categories were 'very bad effect'—score 1, 'bad effect'—score 2, 'no effect'—score 3, 'good effect'—score 4, 'very good effect'—score 5. Possible OHQOL-UK scores range from 16 to 80.


Frequency tables were produced to identify aspects of life quality affected by oral health status. Variations between OHIP-14 scores, OHQOL-UK<sup>®</sup> scores and clinician's diagnosis of the lesions were examined utilizing t-test statistics. Spearman's correlation coefficients were examined to determine the correlations between OHIP-14 scores, OHQOL-UK<sup>®</sup> scores and patients' VAS ratings of their pain. Inter-item correlation between the individual items of both measures were examined using Cronbach alpha's statistics.

# Results

All patients participated in the study and only on three occasions were the questionnaires incomplete because respondents failed to rate all of the OHIP-14 or OHQOL-UK questions. One individual failed to rate one question of the OHIP-14 and one of the OHQOL-UK items, and in another case a patient failed to complete two items of the OHQOL-UK measure.

A quarter of the patients were diagnosed as having ulcers (12) and the others  $(75\%, 36)$  as having erosions (Table 1). On a VAS pain scale from 0-100, the mean VAS value was 37 and median value 27. The mean OHQOL-UK was 43 as was their median value. The mean OHIP score was 17 with a median value of 16 (Table 1).

Table 2 illustrates the responses to the OHIP-14 and OHQOL-UK items. In particular many experienced physical pain, having had a painful aching in their mouth (91%, 39) or finding it uncomfortable to eat (97%, 45). Many too were handicapped, feeling life was less satisfying because of problems they had with their oral health problem (54%, 26) and in some case were totally unable to function because of their oral health problem (23%, 11). The responses to the OHQOL-UK items also demonstrated that many felt that their oral health distracted from their life quality because

of symptoms like pain  $(85\%, 41)$  but also due to social consequences: their oral health distracted from their social life  $(27\%, 13)$  and romance  $(30\%, 14)$ . Many reported it distracted from their life quality psychologically, their carefree manner  $(48\%, 23)$  and that it had a negative effect on their mood  $(46\%, 22)$ .

Variations in OHQOL-UK  $(P < 0.01)$  and OHIP-14  $(P < 0.01)$  scores were apparent in relation to clinician's diagnosis of the lesions (Table 3). Patients with ulceration had higher OHIP-14 score and lower OHQOL-UK  $^{\text{©}}$  scores compared to those with erosions. Patients' current pain rating on the VAS was moderately and significantly associated with both their OHQOL-UK  $(P < 0.01)$  and OHIP-14 scores  $(P < 0.01)$  (Table 3).

The inter-item correlation coefficient scores of the 16 items of OHQOL-UK ranged from 0.16 to 0.81 and for the OHIP-14 measure ranged from 0.13 to 0.67. The corrected item-total correlation (the correlation between each individual item and the adjusted total score without the item) ranged from 0.32 to 0.83 for OHQOL-UK and from 0.42 to 0.82 for OHIP-14. The mean correlation between items, Cronbach alpha values were 0.93 for OHQOL-UK and 0.90 for OHIP-14 (Table 4).

In collecting the data the study relied on patients self-completing the oral health related quality of life questionnaires (OHQOL-UK and OHIP). The patients had little difficulty in completing the questionnaires (very few items being incomplete for both measures, for which mean values were used) supporting the face validity of both instruments, the


phrasing of the questions and their scoring systems. It also highlights the feasibility of employing them in the oral medicine clinical setting.

The impact of oral lichen planus upon the life quality of the patients was considerable with many suffering from physical, social and psychological consequences. The responses to both OHQOL-UK and OHIP compared to national norms for the UK adult popu

lation suggest that patients with oral lichen planus have many oral health problems that place a large burden upon their life and that few enjoy the positive oral health influences on life quality10,11

Marked differences in both OHQOLUK and OHIP-14 were apparent between patients with ulcers and erosions. Patients with symptomatic lesions had greater OHIP-14 scores suggesting that oral health had an increased burden on their life quality compared to those with non-symptomatic lesions. In addition, patients with ulcers had lower OHQOLUK scores suggesting they had fewer positive oral health influences on life quality compared to those with erosions. This is an indication of the criterion validity of these measures. The construct validity is supported by observations that both measures were significantly and moderately correlated with patients' pain rating by the VAS.

In terms of reliability, none of the inter-item correlations were negative,

thus indicating homogeneity of the items and no correlations were high enough for any item to be redundant. This is to be expected given that the items seek to measure aspects of the same concept ('quality of life'). The corrected item-total correlation was well above the minimum recommended level of 0.20 for including items in a scale. The mean correlation between items was very high (above 0.90). Different minimum acceptable levels have been proposed ranging from 0.50 to  $0.70^{3,5}$

In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that two patient-centred outcome measures performed well in the relevant assessment of patients with oral lichen planus, exhibiting validity and internal reliability. The results support the use of oral health related quality of life measures in oral medicine. As pain is the principal symptom of erosive and ulcerative oral lichen planus these measures are likely to be clinically relevant in other painful orofacial conditions presenting to oral and maxillofacial surgeons. In particular, their use in the assessment of atypical facial pain, temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome, radiotherapy and chemotherapy induced mucositis and longstanding postoperative pain requires evaluation. It is presently unknown if these two quality of life measures are sensitive to the effects of treatment of mucosal disease, hence future studies will explore this clinically relevant area.
