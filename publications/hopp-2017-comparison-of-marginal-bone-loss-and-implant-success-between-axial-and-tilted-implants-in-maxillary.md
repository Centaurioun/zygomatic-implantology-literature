# Abstract

Background: There is need for more scientific and clinical information on longer-term outcomes of tilted implants compared to implants inserted in an axial position.

Purpose: Comparison of marginal bone loss and implant success after a 5-year follow-up between axial and tilted implants inserted for full-arch maxillary rehabilitation.

Material and Methods: The retrospective clinical study included 891 patients with 3564 maxillary implants rehabilitated according to the All-on-4 treatment concept. The follow-up time was 5 years. Linear mixed-effect models were performed to analyze the influence of implant orientation (axial/tilted) on marginal bone loss and binary logistic regression to assess the effect of patient characteristics on occurrence of marginal bone loss  $>2.8 \, \text{mm}$ . Only those patients with measurements of at least one axial and one tilted implant available were analyzed. This resulted in a data set of 2379 implants (1201 axial, 1178 tilted) in 626 patients (=reduced data set).

Results: Axial and tilted implants showed comparable mean marginal bone losses of  $1.14 \pm 0.71$  and  $1.19 \pm 0.82 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively. Mixed model analysis indicated that marginal bone loss levels at 5 years follow up was not significantly affected by the orientation (axial/tilted) of the implants in the maxillary bone. Smoking and female gender were associated with marginal bone loss  $>2.8 \mathrm{~mm}$  in a logistic regression analysis. Five-year implant success rates were  $96\%$ . The occurrence of implant failure showed to be statistically independent from orientation.

Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study and considering a follow-up time of 5 years, it can be concluded that tilted implants behave similarly with regards to marginal bone loss and implant success in comparison to axial implants in full-arch rehabilitation of the maxilla. Longer-term outcomes (10 years +) are needed to verify this result.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Immediate function implant-supported rehabilitations have proven to be safe and reliable in the short and midterm outcomes, $^{1-10}$  while providing the patients with the psychological advantage of immediate fixed restorations. $^{11-14}$  The All-on-4 treatment concept is one of these immediate-function protocols, allowing the rehabilitation of an edentulous jaw in one operation without nerve transposition and/or bone grafting. This is achieved by strategic positioning of four implants and maximization of the existing bone volume. $^{6,15-18}$


The All-on-4 treatment concept provides that two implants are placed anteriorly and two posteriorly. The anterior implants are placed axial, whereas the posterior implants are tilted between  $30^{\circ}$  and  $45^{\circ}$ . The use of tilted implants posteriorly allows for use of longer implants.

This in turn enhances primary stability, enables cantilever reduction with optimized prosthetic support as well as reduces the need for bone augmentation by optimized use of available bone.[6,15-19] Although providing these benefits, the tilting of posterior implants may—from a biomechanical point of view—have the disadvantage of promoting marginal bone loss due to increased stress to surrounding bone.[20-22]

However, abundantly available clinical data did not support this hypothetical concern. Previous systematic reviews $^{23}$  and meta-analyses $^{24,25}$  did not reveal differences in marginal bone loss and implant failure rates between axial and tilted implants in short and medium term outcomes. The few available longer-term outcomes support these results for the mandible $^{26,27}$  and the maxilla $^{28,29}$  showing no significant differences in marginal bone level change and implant survival rates between axial and tilted implants over 5 years of follow-up assuming no additional risk of implant failure by using tilted implants posteriorly. However, due to the limited data available for the maxilla, additional scientific, and clinical information on longer-term outcomes of axial and tilted implant is needed. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the effect of implant orientation (axial, tilted) on marginal bone loss 5 years after insertion for full-arch maxillary rehabilitations using the All-on-4 treatment concept and to examine possible risk indicators for advanced marginal bone loss ( $>2.8$  mm). The cutoff value of  $2.8$  mm at 5 years was chosen based on universally accepted initial bone remodeling of up to  $2.0$  mm in the first year when considering immediate function, together with a marginal bone loss  $\leq 0.2$  mm annually thereafter. $^{30}$  The null hypothesis was that marginal bone loss levels are not significantly influenced by implant orientation (axial, tilted).

# 2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

This retrospective study was performed in a private clinic, Maló Clinic, Lisbon, Portugal. Patients were treated between November 2002 and June 2010. Patients were included provided the need for fixed prosthetic full-arch maxillary rehabilitations supported by immediate function implants due to edentulism or the presence of teeth in very poor periodontal conditions. The same team performed surgery and prosthetic restoration. Exclusion criteria were active chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and patients who were not further followed at the private practice. An Ethical Committee approved the study (Ethics Committee for Health, Lisbon, Portugal; authorization no. 001/2016).

# 2.1 | Surgical protocol

The medical history of each patient was reviewed, and each patient received a clinical examination complemented with radiographic examinations (an orthopantomography to assess bone height and computerized tomography scan to assess bone volume and anatomical structures). The surgical procedures were performed under local anesthesia with mepivacaine chlorhydrate with epinephrine 1:100 000 (Scandinibsa  $2\%$ , Inibsa Laboratory, Barcelona, Spain). All patients were sedated with diazepam (Valium  $10\mathrm{mg}$ , Roche, Amadora, Portugal) prior to surgery. Antibiotics (amoxicillin  $875\mathrm{mg} +$  clavulanic acid  $125\mathrm{mg}$ , Labesfal, Campo de Besteiros, Portugal) were given 1 hour prior to surgery and daily for 6 days thereafter. Cortisone medication (prednisone [Metricen Schering-Plough Farma Lda, Agualva-Cacém, Portugal], 5 mg) was given daily in a regression mode (15-5 mg) from the day of surgery until 4 days postoperatively. Anti-inflammatory medication (ibuprofen, 600 mg, Ratiopharm Lda, Carnaxide, Portugal) was administered for 4 days postoperatively starting on day 4. Analgesics (clonixine [Clonix, Janssen-Cilag Farmaceutica Lda, Barcarena, Portugal], 300 mg) were given on the day of surgery and postoperatively for the first 3 days if needed. Antacid medication (Omeprazole, 20 mg, Lisbon, Portugal) was given on the day of surgery and daily for 6 days postoperatively.


A mucoperiosteal flap was raised along the top of the ridge with relieving incisions on the buccal aspect in the molar area. The insertion of the implants followed standard procedures, except that we performed under-preparation to achieve an insertion torque between 30 and 50 Ncm before final seating of the implants. The implant platform was positioned  $0.8\mathrm{mm}$  above the crest (corresponding to the lower corner of the implant neck for Brænemark system Mk III or Mk IV implants) or flush with the bone level (NobelSpeedy implants). In the case of tilted implants, we sometimes performed leveling of the bone crest to ensure that the implant platform was situated at the level of the bone crest, and to create space for the angulated abutment. Bicortical anchorage was established whenever needed. A surgical guide (Allon-4 Guide, Nobel Biocare AB) was used for implant placement assistance to facilitate the insertion of the tilted implants and the precise positioning of the implants in relation to the opposing jaw. The implants were inserted between the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus with an angulation between  $30^{\circ}$  and  $45^{\circ}$  relative to the occlusal plane. The posterior implants were tilted distally along the anterior sinus wall, emerging typically at the second premolar position. The two anterior implants were positioned axially; however, in cases with severe bone resorption and/or buccal concavities, vestibular tilting was employed. Multiunit abutments (Nobel Biocare) were connected to the implants, with tilted implants provided with angulated Multiunit abutments  $(30^{\circ})$  and anterior axial implants provided with straight  $(0^{\circ})$  or angulated Multiunit abutments  $(17^{\circ})$ . After closing and suturing the flap with 3–0 nonresorbable sutures (B Braun Silkam, Aesculap Inc., Center Valley, PA), the abutments were accessed by means of a punch.

# 2.2 | Prosthetic protocol

High-density acrylic resin (PalaXpress Ultra, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) and acrylic resin crowns (Premium teeth, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH) provisional prostheses with Temporary Coping Multi-Unit Titanium (Nobel Biocare AB) were delivered on the day of surgery. Considering the patients' preference, definitive acrylic-resin prostheses of the same type, metal-ceramic prostheses with a titanium framework (Procera, Nobel Biocare AB) and all-ceramic Alumina crowns (Procera crowns; NobelRondo Ceramics, Nobel Biocare AB) or metal-acrylic prostheses with a titanium framework (Procera) high-density acrylic resin (PalaXpress Ultra,) and acrylic resin crowns (Premium teeth), were delivered, at the earliest, 6 months' postsurgery.

# 2.3 | Follow up visits and maintenance protocol

The authors instructed the patients to follow a strict protocol for postoperative maintenance of the oral hygiene. Follow up visits were performed at 10 days, 2, 4, and 6 months, 1 year and every 6 months thereafter. The routine checkups consisted in the assessment of clinical parameters, followed by prophylaxis and dental hygiene instructions.

# 2.4 | Clinical endpoints

Primary clinical endpoint was marginal bone loss at 5 years of follow-up. Marginal bone levels were assessed through periapical radiographs taken at baseline (day of surgery) and 5 years of function. Periapical radiographs were made using the parallel technique with a film holder (Super-bite, Hawe-Neos), and its position was adjusted manually for an estimated orthogonal film position. A reader blinded to the patient information examined all radiographs of the implants for marginal bone level. Each periapical radiograph was scanned at 300 dpi with a scanner (HP Scanjet 4890, HP Portugal, Paço de Arcos, Portugal), and the marginal bone level was assessed with image analysis software (Image J version 1.40g for Windows, National Institutes of Health). The reference point for the reading was the implant platform (the horizontal interface between the implant and the abutment), and marginal bone level was measured up to the first contact between implant and bone. The radiographs were calibrated digitally using the distance between implant threads as reference. The measurements were performed on the mesial and distal sites, and average values were calculated. The radiographs were accepted (74%) or rejected (26%) for evaluation based on the clarity of the implant threads; a clear thread guarantees both sharpness and an orthogonal direction of the radiographic beam

Secondary clinical endpoints included prosthetic survival (on patient level) and implant success as well as incidence of biological complications (at implant level) at 5 years of function. Biological complications encompassed infection (in the first 12 months postsurgery), fistula, abscess, mucositis (mucosal inflammation with or without probing pocket depths  $>4$  mm and absence of marginal bone loss), or periimplant pathology (probing pocket depths  $>4$  mm with marginal bone loss with or without suppuration) measured using a plastic periodontal probe calibrated to 0.25 N (Hawe Click Probe, Hawe Neos, Bioggio, Switzerland). Prosthetic survival was based on function, with prosthesis removal classified as failure. Implant success was based on the Malo Clinic success criteria $^{31}$ : (1) implant fulfilled its intended function as support for reconstruction (the potential existence of a sleeping implant was considered a failure); (2) implant was stable when individually and manually tested (the prosthesis was removed at each follow-up appointment); (3) no signs of persistent infection; (4) no radiolucent areas around the implants; (5) good aesthetic outcome in the rehabilitation (classified as the absence of aesthetic complaints from the patient or prosthodontist); and (6) construction of an implant-supported fixed prosthesis that provided patient comfort and good hygienic

FIGURE 5 Periapical radiograph of the axial implants in the anterior second sextant at 5-year follow-up maintenance (classified as the absence of comfort and hygiene complaints from the patient). Implants not complying with the criteria as well as implant removal were considered failures.


In addition to the clinical endpoints, patient and implant related data were compiled to be used as explanatory fixed and random factors for bone loss in a generalized linear mixed model and potential risk predictors for marginal bone loss  $>2.8 \mathrm{~mm}$  in a logistic regression model. The factors are given consideration in Tables 1-3 and were chosen based on assumed relevance as explanatory variable and risk predictor for bone loss as well as their data availability.

# 2.5 Data sets for analyses

A total of 891 patients with 3564 maxillary implants were initially included in this study for the analysis of implant success and prosthesis survival as well as biological complications (=complete data set). The final data set for marginal bone loss analysis was lower because: (1) 91 implants failed before 5 years follow up; (2) the treatment of 29 implants was modified within the 5 years period under consideration limiting the validity of the All-on-4 treatment concept and (3)  $26\%$  of the periapical radiographs were not readable. The remaining data set of 2539 implants in 715 patients was then used to evaluate the effect of patient characteristics on marginal bone loss  $>2.8 \, \text{mm}$  using a binary logistic regression model. To avoid bias due to unbalanced data, the data set was further adapted for statistics (descriptive statistics and GLMM analysis) of marginal bone loss levels focusing on comparisons between axial and tilted implants: Only those patients with measurements of at least one axial and one tilted implant available were analyzed. This resulted in a data set of 2379 implants (1201 axial, 1178 tilted) in 626 patients (=reduced data set). Different data sets were used and not consistently lowered to the reduced data set, in order to retain the most comprehensive data set possible for each analysis.

# 2.6 | Statistics

Descriptive statistics were calculated for implant success, incidence of biological complications (complete data set) as well as marginal bone loss (reduced data set). In addition, mean marginal bone loss was calculated for 20 randomly composed subsets (100 implants each) of the data set, to assess the impact of the data set size on calculated mean values. Subsamples of 100 implants were chosen, since this is the scale of implants analyzed in one of the few available and comparable longer-term studies.[6]

Implant success was analyzed using life table analysis. McNemar tests were performed to assess differences in marginal bone loss  $>2.8 \, \text{mm}$ , biological complications and implant failure between axial and tilted implants. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were adopted to analyze the influence of implant orientation (axial/tilted) on marginal bone loss at 5 years of follow-up. Implant length and orientation (axial/tilted), gender (m/f), smoking (y/n), cardiovascular condition (CVD; y/n) as well as opposing dentition (4 categories with increasing strength of resistance) were evaluated as fixed effects, and age and patient as random factors. Interaction terms between CVD and age, CVD and smoker and CVD, age and smoker were checked for improvement of the model. A GLMM without consideration of implant orientation was compared with the respective model including implant orientation using a likelihood ratio test. The GLMMs were computed in R v3.3.2 using the glmer function from the lme4 package. A binary logistic regression model was performed to ascertain the effect of patient characteristics on the likelihood of patients have peri-implant bone loss  $>2.8$  mm on at least one implant. Odds ratios and corresponding  $95\%$  confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the explanatory variables. The regression model was performed on patient level. Univariate analyses were used to identify covariates associated with marginal bone loss  $>2.8$  mm. Covariates with  $P < .20$  in univariate analyses were included in the regression model. The level of significance was  $5\%$ , statistical power was  $\geq 80\%$ . All data, except for the GLMM, was analyzed using the software SPSS version 20 (IBM SPSS, NY).

# 3.1 | Patient and implant characteristics

A total of 891 patients with 3564 maxillary implants supporting 891 prostheses were included in this study. Three-hundred-sixty-four were males, 527 were females. The average age was 56 years (range 20-83). About 287 patients  $(32.2\%)$  presented systemic comorbidities, namely: a cardiovascular  $(n = 189)$ , a thyroid  $(n = 24)$ , a rheumatologic  $(n = 37)$ , an oncological disease  $(n = 17)$ , diabetes  $(n = 36)$ , hepatitis  $(n = 16)$ , a hemorrhagic  $(n = 1)$ , a neurological  $(n = 7)$ , a kidney  $(n = 2)$ , or an autoimmune disease  $(n = 3)$ , HIV positive  $(n = 3)$  or a syndrome (von Willebrand disease,  $n = 1$ ). Forty-nine patients presented more than one systemic condition. Two-hundred-eleven of the included patients  $(23.7\%)$  were smokers. Implant diameter differed between 3.3 and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  and implant length differed between 7 and  $18\mathrm{mm}$ . The opposing mandibular occlusal surfaces consisted of removable prostheses  $(3.1\%$  of patients), natural teeth  $(16.9\%$  of patients), implant-supported fixed

# 3.2 | Marginal bone loss after 5 years and risk factors

Regarding marginal bone loss axial and tilted implants showed an identical median value of  $1.05\mathrm{mm}$  and mean values of  $1.14 \pm 0.71\mathrm{mm}$  (range  $0 - 6.9\mathrm{mm}$ ) and  $1.19 \pm 0.82\mathrm{mm}$  (range  $0 - 8.4\mathrm{mm}$ ), respectively, at 5 years of follow-up (Figure 7). Calculated marginal bone loss from randomly composed subsets (100 implants) of the present data set resulted in mean values between 0.97 and  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$ . Generalized linear mixed models were computed with and without implant orientation as fixed factor (Table 4). Inclusion of implant orientation (axial/tilted) as fixed factor did not result in a significantly improved model ( $P = .503$ ), which indicates that the marginal bone loss at 5 years follow up was not significantly affected by the implant orientation (axial/tilted) in the maxillary bone. Seventy-one implants [2.9% of all implants; 36 axial (3% of axial implants), 35 tilted (3% of tilted implants)] revealed marginal bone loss  $< 0.2\mathrm{mm}$ . Two-hundred-eighty-seven implants (12%;

130 axial  $[10.8\%]$  and 157 tilted  $[13.3\%]$  ) lost more than  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of periimplant bone. Advanced bone loss  $(>2.8~\mathrm{mm})$  occurred with 97 implants  $[4.0\% ;39$  axial  $(3.9\%)$  and 58 tilted  $(4.9\%)$ ]. Seventy-nine of the 97 implants had either biological complications (infection, fistula, or peri-implant pathology;  $n = 28$ ) previously and/or were connected in a prosthesis that presented mechanical complications  $(n = 68)$ . The difference of the proportion of advanced marginal bone loss  $(>2.8~\mathrm{mm})$  at axial and tilted implants on patient level was statistically significant (McNemar,  $X2 = 8.82$ ,  $P = .003$ ;  $n = 626$  patients). A binary logistic regression model performed to ascertain the effects of patient characteristics on the likelihood of patients have marginal bone loss  $>2.8~\mathrm{mm}$  was statistically significant  $(X2 = 28.174$ ,  $P < .001$ ; Table 5). Of the five predictor variables, only three were statistically significant: smoking, gender, and cardiovascular condition. Smokers had 2.032 times higher odds, female gender 1.925 times higher odds and patients without cardiovascular condition 2.42 times higher odds to exhibit advanced marginal bone loss  $(>2.8~\mathrm{mm})$  than nonsmoker, males and patients with cardiovascular disease, respectively (Table 5).

# 3.3 | Implant success and biological complications

After 5 years 91 implants failed, giving a 5-years success rate of  $96\%$  at implant level. Failure of tilted implants (69 implants failed;  $96.1\%$  success rate) was numerically nearly equal to failure of axial implants (76 implants lost;  $95.7\%$  success rate). The occurrence of implant failure on patient level showed to be statistically independent from implant orientation (McNemar, X2  $(1, n = 891$  patients)  $= .65$ ,  $P = .42$ ). Life table analysis revealed implant failure occurring predominantly within the first 2 years of follow-up for both axial and tilted implants (Table 6). Prosthesis survival was  $99.8\%$  (889/891). Three-hundred-thirteen implants  $(8.8\%)$  in 209 patients  $(23.5\%)$  showed biological complications, namely infection  $(n = 24)$ , fistula  $(n = 4)$ , mucositis  $(n = 189)$  peri-implant pathology  $(n = 95)$ , or abscess  $(n = 1)$ . Biological complications were observed with 131 axial and 182 tilted implants. The difference of the proportion of biological complications at axial and tilted implants on patient level was statistically significant (McNemar, X2  $(1, n = 891$  patients)  $= 14.82$ ,  $P < .01$ ). The biological complications were resolved (absence of inflammation and probing pocket depths  $< / = 4$  mm without reoccurrence during the study follow-up) for 242 implants through nonsurgical intervention by scaling with an ultrasonic device and application of  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine gel and for 10 implants through administration of systemic antibiotics and open flap

# 4 | DISCUSSION

Implant tilting in immediate function implant-supported rehabilitations has provided the possibility of rehabilitating patients with anatomic limitations that preclude the insertion of implants in an axial position. However, it is still under debate if tilted implants bear a higher risk of implant failure compared to axial implants by peri-implant bone loss or pathology over time.[32] Long-term data are scarce. In this retrospective cohort study, the authors investigated the 5-year follow-up results of marginal bone loss and success rates of axial and tilted maxillary implants placed using the All-on-4 treatment concept. Linear mixed model analysis showed that implant orientation (axial/tilted) does not significantly contribute to the explanation of the peri-implant bone loss pattern after 5 years' follow-up. Hence, the null hypothesis of nonexistence of a significant influence of implant orientation on marginal bone loss after 5 years could not be rejected. This result is congruent with findings based on reviews and meta-analysis of short-term outcomes.[25,33,34] Chrcanovic and colleagues performed a meta-analysis focusing on the difference in implant failure rate, marginal bone loss, and postoperative infections for patients being rehabilitated by tilted or by axially placed implants.[25] The authors included data from 44 publications in their analysis, resulting in a total of 5029 tilted and 5732 axial implants. No significant effects of tilted implants on the occurrence of marginal bone loss and implant failure rates was observed using a random-effects and a fixed-effects model, respectively. Furthermore, another meta-analysis from Ata-Ali and colleagues investigated

the outcome of oral rehabilitations with tilted dental implants. $^{35}$  The authors included 13 publications (seven retrospective studies and six prospective studies) and performed three meta-analysis resulting in: One-hundred-sixty-six tilted and 241 axial implants for the meta-analysis evaluating the success rates in the retrospective studies; 379 tilted and 425 axial implants for the meta-analysis evaluating the success rates in the prospective studies; and 230 tilted and 270 axial implants for the meta-analysis evaluating the marginal bone loss in the prospective studies. No evidence of differences in success rate were found in prospective or retrospective studies, nor differences in marginal bone loss was registered between tilted and axial implants. However, in contrast to the present study, limitations, such as variability in the techniques used, lack of analysis of confounding factors, no differentiation between mandibular and maxillary implants and assessment of primarily short-term data hamper definitive conclusions on long-term effects.

In this study, the mean marginal bone loss observed with axial and tilted implants was  $1.14 \pm 0.71$  and  $1.19 \pm 0.82 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively, retrieved from the reduced data set with 2379 implants (1201 axial, 1178 tilted) in 626 patients. These values compare favorably with other longer-term outcomes (5 and 7 years) for maxillary implants placed using the All-on-4 treatment concept or similar immediate loading protocols.[6,36,37] Niedermaier and colleagues measured mean marginal bone losses of  $1.30 \pm 0.35 \mathrm{~mm}$  for axial and  $1.30 \pm 0.42 \mathrm{~mm}$  for tilted implants 5 years after treatment of severely atrophied and edentulous jaws by means of implant-supported immediately loaded fixed full-arch dentures using four to six implants per jaw.[36] Results might not be comparable directly, because the authors did not differentiate between treatment protocols and mandibular and maxillary implants. Vervaekte and colleagues for instance, found jaw of treatment to be a predictor of periimplant bone loss with more marginal bone loss observed in the maxilla;[38] however, other studies did not find differences.[23,34] Nevertheless, in accordance with our findings and the literature, Niedermaier and colleagues did not observe significant differences in bone loss between tilted and axial implants during a follow-up of 5 years.[36] Maló and colleagues reported a 3 and 5 years mean marginal bone loss of  $1.52 \pm 0.3 \mathrm{~mm}$  and  $1.95 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively, after rehabilitation of completely edentulous maxillae using the All-on-4 treatment concept.[6] Readable radiographs were available for 621 implants (196 patients) at 3 years and 106 implants (33 patients) at 5 years of follow-up. Treatment as well as patient and implant characteristics were very similar to the present study. Since mean values of small data sets are in general more prone to outliers the authors assume that the lower marginal bone loss values obtained in our study may be due to the larger data set analyzed. Calculated marginal bone loss from randomly composed subsets (100 implants) of the present data set resulted in mean values of 0.97 to up to  $1.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ . The lower mean marginal bone loss for axial and tilted implants obtained in this study and the larger data set confirm that the proportion of implants with low marginal bone loss after 5 years is high. This is further supported by even lower median values for axial and tilted implants of  $1.05 \mathrm{~mm}$ . Even if this study was not designed to examine to which extent marginal bone loss of the differently angled implants increases over time, comparing our marginal bone loss measurements from rehabilitation of completely edentulous maxillae with short-term and long-term results available in the literature it can be concluded that (1) our results do not indicate that tilted implants placed using the All-on-4 treatment concept promote marginal bone loss to a higher extent than axial implants over time and that (2) mean bone loss over time might be generally lower than expected based on short-term data obtained from small data sets.


Advanced marginal bone loss  $(>2.8\mathrm{mm})$  occurred with about  $4\%$  of the implants (39 axial, 58 tilted). Comparing the occurrence of marginal bone loss  $>2.8\mathrm{mm}$  with biological and mechanical complication observed at these implants assume that advanced marginal bone loss might at least partly be interpreted as being secondary to biological or mechanical complications. Seventy-nine of the 97 implants had previous infection, fistula, or peri-implant pathology and/or were connected in a prosthesis that presented mechanical complications. The proportion of tilted implants with advanced marginal bone loss  $(>2.8\mathrm{mm})$  was significantly higher than of axial implants; however, the overall number of affected implants is low and in many cases (59% of patients,  $n = 53$  implants) only a single implant per patient showed marginal bone loss of this severity. This suggests a low potential impact on prosthesis survival and thus very low clinical relevance of this statistical finding. Thus, the authors do not rate this statistical result to be contradictory to the GLMM analysis of the whole bone loss data set resulting in no relevant influence of implant orientation on marginal bone loss after 5 years of function.

Logistic regression analysis revealed smoking and female gender to be associated with, and thus potential risk indicators for, marginal bone loss  $>2.8$  mm at 5 years when controlled for other variables of interest. Smokers exhibited a more than 2-fold risk than nonsmokers. The impact of smoking on implant success is still controversially debated.[34] Some studies observed a negative impact of smoking on implant failure or marginal bone loss,[38,39] others did not.[27,36,38] Since smoking habit is rarely precisely defined and the impact assessment varies greatly between descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analysis it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Our study support assumptions of higher risk of bone loss in smokers as suggested by various meta-analysis and reviews.[38-41] Female gender showed a 2-fold risk than males for advanced marginal bone loss. Higher marginal bone loss was previously reported in female patients in long-term follow-up studies.[42-47] The higher risk of patients without CVD compared to patients with CVD is counterintuitive and the statistical outcome might be influenced by the fact that the patients with CVD-group was much smaller than the patients without CVD-group and the patients without CVD-group consisted of healthy as well as patients with other comorbidities, such as diabetes. Hence, further research is needed focusing on the impact of patient and implant characteristics on the long-term marginal bone loss outcome in immediate function full-arch rehabilitations when adjusted for other relevant risk predictors.

Survival rates of  $97.5\%$  and  $93.8\%$  were obtained after 5 years at implant and patient level, respectively. Survival rates were similar for axial and tilted implants. These findings are consistent with results of previous short-term and long-term studies using similar treatment protocols. These studies report survivals of axial and tilted implants in the range of  $95\% -100\%$ .[6,34,36,48] Life table analysis revealed implant failure occurring predominantly within the first 2 years of follow-up for both axial and tilted implants. About  $71\%$  of the failed implants in our study were lost in the first year, which is in line with previous research on immediate function implant supported restorations.[6,14,48] A very low number of implant failures occurred in the subsequent years and no significant association between implant orientation (axial/tilted) and implant failure was found. Thus, the authors assume that marginal bone loss over time does not markedly provoke failure of either axial or tilted implants, at least up to 5 years of follow-up.

Consideration of biological complications after implant placement is important for assessing the long-term success of immediate function full-arch rehabilitations, since more severe biological complication, such as peri-implant pathology may indicate an increased risk for failure over time. However, if properly recognized and treated, a biological complication might be saved. The biological complications observed in the present study were infection, mucositis and peri-implant pathology as well as a few events of fistulae or abscesses. The study shows a slight but statistically significant higher proportion of biological complications occurring at tilted compared to axial implants on patient level. Low levels of oral hygiene, history of periodontitis and mechanical complications were frequently suggested to be potential risk factors for biological complications;[42,43] however, the authors are not aware of any other study examining the association of biological complications with implant orientation. Due to several reasons it is assumed that the statistical finding in the present study is of low clinical relevance: (1) The overall rate of biological complications after 5 years follow-up was low (8.8% of implants); (2) the majority of biological complications observed were well amenable for periodontal treatment; (3) in many affected patients (65%) only single implants exhibited biological complication, which is considered to bear a low risk of prosthesis failure in full-arch implant-supported rehabilitations irrespective of the location of the biological complication. Nevertheless, an effective recall program is crucial to individuate complications in the beginning avoiding the evolution of these in major complication that may lead to implant failure.

This study exhibits certain limitations, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. The single center retrospective design used has drawbacks, such as lack of external validation and data collection not adjusted to the focus of this study. A further limitation is the loss of data due to the  $26\%$  of nonreadable radiographs, thereby providing a potential bias by unbalancing the data set and underestimating the marginal bone loss evaluation. To accommodate for these limitations, the data set used for marginal bone loss comparisons was adjusted as described in Material and Methods, for example, by ensuring that data for at least one axial and one tilted implant was available per patient. The large sample size, consideration of various factors using regression and mixed model analysis and the less than  $20\%$  rate of patients lost to follow-up represent study strengths.


# 5 | CONCLUSION

Within the limitations of this study and considering a follow-up time of 5 years, it can be concluded that tilted implants do not promote marginal bone loss and implant failure in comparison to axial implants in full-arch rehabilitation of the maxilla. Future research on the impact of implant orientation on implant survival or success should focus on the long-term follow-up of these rehabilitations (10 years +) and should consider implant success as well as marginal bone loss and soft tissue outcomes.
