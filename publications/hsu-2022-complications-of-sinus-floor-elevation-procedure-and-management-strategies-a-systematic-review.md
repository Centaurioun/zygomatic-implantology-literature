# Abstract

Aim: This systematic review aimed to investigates the types and incidences of complications following sinus floor elevations (SFE) along with their prevention and management strategies.

Materials and methods: Electronic database and hand search were conducted to screen the literature published from January 1960 to June 2021. The selected studies had to report well-described SFE techniques, complications during, and post-SFE. Data extraction included types of SFE techniques, complications, and their treatment strategies.

Results: A total of 74 studies with 4411 SFE procedures met the inclusion criteria. Different SFE techniques demonstrated varying patterns for both complications and complication rates. Postoperative pain, swelling, and edema were widely reported. The most common complications that required intervention following Lateral SFE (LSFE) were sinus membrane perforation (SMP), wound dehiscence, graft exposure and failure, and sinusitis. LSFE had more SMPs and sinusitis cases compared with a transcrestal SFE (TSFE). The presence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo following TSFE was significant in certain selected studies.

Conclusion: Given the inherent limitations, this systematic review showed distinct features of complications in SFE using varying techniques. Treatment planning for these procedures should incorporate strategies to avoid complication occurrence.

# What is known

Sinus floor elevations (SFE) carry with them potential complications both during and after their performance that may cause either temporary or permanent problems. Previous literature has mainly focused on sinus membrane perforation without addressing other complications and possible strategies to manage them.

# What this study adds

The first systematic review for overall complications occurring during and immediately after SFE.

- Distinct features and rates of complications in SFE using different techniques.
- An overview of prevention and management strategies for common SFE complications.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Sinus pneumatization and alveolar ridge resorption are the natural phenomena seen after tooth loss. Consequently insufficient ridge height becomes a significant challenge in the maxillary posterior for placing dental implants to assist in any reconstruction. Therefore, procedures to elevate the maxillary sinus floor had been introduced to increase the bone volume for placing dental implants. To achieve success, it is imperative for the clinician to understand sinus anatomy and both carefully plan and execute treatment.

Depending on the location and residual crest height, sinus floor elevation (SFE) is usually performed by means of either a lateral window (LSFE) or a transcrestal approach (TSFE). Several techniques have been introduced to decrease SFE complications, chair time, and patient morbidity. Commonly used instruments for LSFE include rotary bur, $^{1}$  piezoelectric surgical tools, $^{2}$  sonic instruments, $^{3}$  and scrapers. $^{4}$  With regard to TSFE, the use of osteotomes $^{5}$  has been the conventional approach. The use of alternative sinus membrane elevation techniques includes but has not been limited to hydraulic force, $^{6}$  specially designed reamers, $^{7}$  or densification burs $^{8}$  might help to avoid some of the complications reported with osteotomes.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that SFE is reliable and predictable. $^{9-11}$  Nevertheless, these SFE procedures carry with their potential complications both during and after their performance that may cause either temporary or permanent problems. $^{12-14}$  For example, sinus membrane perforations (SMPs) which have been associated with SFE may also be involved with wound infection, postoperative sinusitis, and even graft failure. $^{15,16}$  Previous reviews have mainly focused on the specific complication of SMPs and have failed to address the entire scope of both LSFE and TSFE complications and their management. $^{17-19}$  This information has been limited due to the relatively lower incidence rates of other SFE complications. For this reason, this systematic review was undertaken to elucidate all the SFE-related complications in both their type and their incidence. With the summarized complication management from this review, a management strategy is also proposed for SFE-related complications.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This systematic review was performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines.[20,21] This systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42021232820).

# 2.1 Search strategy

# 2.1.1 | Focused questions

Based on the PICOS principle,

1. Population: patients in need of SFE for dental implant placement;

2. Intervention (or exposure): any type of LSFE or TSFE technique;
3. Control (or comparator): any possible comparisons between different SFE techniques;
4. Outcomes of interest and the study design: incidence of any complications during or following SFE in prospective or retrospective clinical studies.

# 2.1.2 Study selection criteria

1. Studies had to have patients receiving SFE for implant placement. Surgical techniques used to perform SFE had to be clearly described and these techniques were able to be categorized into either LSFE or TSFE.
2. Studies could have more than one group of subjects receiving different SFE procedures. Each group however, had to have at least 10 subjects.
3. Studies had to report the total number of SFE procedures performed in all subjects and the short-term complications which occurred during or immediately following SFE. These complications included SMP during the SFE procedure, postoperative sinusitis, postoperative edema, and so forth. If there were no complications reported after SFE, the study had to include a clear statement.
4. Studies excluded the cases immediately after the occurrences of complications (since the complication history is incompletely reported).
5. For those series of studies investigating the same cohort in different follow-up periods, only the most recently published one that reported complications was selected.
6. In vitro studies, animal studies, narrative reviews, unpublished data, communications, or expert opinions were excluded from this review.

The primary outcome of this systematic review is the event of short-term complications occurred during or immediately following SFE. Complication management strategies were also recorded as the secondary outcomes.

# 2.1.3 | Search strategy

A search was conducted for studies published from January 1960 to June 2021 in several electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov., using specific key terms (Appendix A. Search Strategy). Moreover, the additional search was performed in the following journals: Journal of Periodontology, Journal of Clinical Periodontology, Journal of Periodontal Research, Journal of Dental Research, Clinical Oral Implants Research, Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research, and The International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants. Finally, the reference lists of identified articles were screened to find additional articles that might fit the selection criteria.

# 2.2 Data extraction and data synthesis

The titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles were independently screened by two authors (Yung-Ting Hsu and Karishma Choksi). The full texts of potentially qualifying articles were reviewed. Any disagreement between the two authors was resolved by discussion. If the identified studies had multiple groups of subjects, only those groups fitting the selection criteria described above were included. Data were independently extracted by the two authors (Yung-Ting Hsu and Karishma Choksi) with a specially designed form and the accuracy was confirmed by a third reviewer (Chun-Teh Lee). The authors of potentially qualifying articles were contacted if there was unclear information that needed clarification. Heterogeneity of both the design and data of the studies precluded a meta-analysis from being performed.

# 2.3 Quality assessment

The Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials  $(\text{RoB2})^{22}$  and risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions  $(\text{ROBINS-II})^{23}$  tools were used to assess quality of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and nonRCTs (NRCT) respectively. The quality assessment was conducted by two authors (Yung-Ting Hsu and Karishma Choksi) independently and the agreement between the two authors was evaluated using the kappa statistic.

# 2.4 Grading the body of evidence

Quality-of-evidence (risk of bias in reported outcomes, inconsistency of outcomes among studies, indirect reporting of outcomes, lack of precision with reported outcomes, and potential publication bias) assessment was based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.[24,25] The GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence in four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low. The quality of evidence is rated based on five elements, including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Studies were independently evaluated by two authors (Yung-Ting Hsu and Karishma Choksi) and agreement was reached by discussion, as needed (GRADE system assessment).

# 3 | RESULTS

One hundred and sixty-seven articles were selected for full-text review after screening 380 abstracts and tiles (Figure 1). Ninety-three studies were excluded. The excluded articles and the reason(s) for their exclusion can be found in Table B1. Eighteen studies were excluded because the researchers only reported the SMP without the overall outcomes of complications. A total of 74 studies with 4411 SFE procedures in 3419 patients were included in this systematic review. The selected studies included 25 RCT, 3 controlled clinical trial (CCT), 2 prospective cohort studies, 24 retrospective studies, and

20 case series. In these 74 studies, 4411 SFE procedures were performed including 3436 LSFE and 975 TSFE (Table 1, Table C1).

# 3.1 | Quality assessment and heterogeneity evaluation, quality of evidence

The kappa coefficients for the agreement in these two risks of bias assessments between the two authors (K.C and Y.H) were 1.00 and 1.00, respectively. Among 25 RCT, 19 articles demonstrated low- overall risk of bias. Among 49 NRCTs, The overall "serious" risk of bias was determined in 11 selected NRCTs, and other 9 studies had only moderate risk of bias. The table of quality assessment can be found in Table D1. Based on GRADE guidelines, the risk of overall SFE complications using TSFE is lower than using the LSFE had "low" evidence quality.

# 3.2 Types and incidence of complications during and following SFE

The presence of the SFE complications (Table 2) included SMP, sinusitis, bleeding from injured vessels, wound infection, graft loss either partial or complete, and dehiscences of soft tissue and/or hard tissue. Headache, temporary swelling/edema, discomfort, and hematoma were also frequently reported from patients following either TSFE or LSFE.

Generally, postoperative pain, swelling, hematoma, and bleeding were widely noted. These complications may have occurred after any type of SFE, affecting patient morbidity and satisfactory outcomes. These four complications were specified in 27 out of 74 included studies. Since pain and swelling commonly occur in patients having SFE, these studies did not report them unless symptoms were severe enough or if the patient complained about them. Using a 100-mm visual analogue scale, a TSFE study demonstrated limited postoperative pain ( $\text{VAS}_{\text{pain}}$  ranged 0–18) and discomfort ( $\text{VAS}_{\text{discomfort}}$  ranged 0–31). The pain decreased to zero at 7 days after TSFE and patients only took 0.5–1.5 Nimesulide 100 mg tablets during the first weeks following TSFE.[26] Another study used a six-point verbal rating scale for pain and inflammation following TSFE. The mean VAS score for inflammation and pain were  $0.97 \pm 0.85$  and  $0.87 \pm 1.19$  respectively.[27] A study comparing the LSFE using conventional flap and minimally invasive flap reflection also reported pain and discomfort outcomes. Using a 0–10 scale, the patients rated that the pain and discomfort ranged from 0.7 to 5.6, in favor of the minimally invasive flap approach. With conventional flap reflection, the patients still required analgesic medications after 7 days following LSFE. In addition, the facial swelling/ facial soft tissue volume change was three times greater than minimally invasive flap and remained significant 1 week after surgery.[28] It corresponded to another LSFE study reporting  $73.7\%$  with swelling,  $31.6\%$  with hematoma,  $26.3\%$  with bleeding,  $5.6\%$  with nausea, and  $26.3\%$  with halitosis at 1 week after LSFE.[29] Even though meta-analysis was not feasible due to limited
FIGURE 1 Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow chart data and heterogeneity of the rating scales and types of analgesic, the pain and swelling outcomes appeared to be more significant and prolonged after LSFES, especially with conventional flap reflection, compared to TSFE.


The major complication documented during LSFES was SMP. Out of 2500 LSFES procedures using rotary bur, the reported complications included SMP (525 procedures,  $21\%$ ), postoperative sinusitis (58 procedures  $2.32\%$ ), partial or total graft failure (50 procedures,  $2\%$ ), wound infection (44 procedures  $1.76\%$ ), and wound dehiscence (19 procedures,  $0.76\%$ ). Eighty-five procedures with SMP ( $10.73\%$ ) were reported during 792 piezoelectric LSFES. This ranged from 0– $30\%$  of the procedures. The use of a piezoelectric device to help create the window reduced the incidence of sinusitis remarkably with only 2 instances ( $0.68\%$ ) being reported. Using autografts harvested from iliac crest, Felice and colleagues experienced two graft failures and two cases with buccal dehiscence from the same patient due to infection following LSFES performed by the piezoelectric device.[30] There was limited data for using instruments other than rotary burs and piezoelectric devices to perform LSFES. It is noteworthy that Geminiiani and coworkers communicated 10 flap dehiscences, 2 sinus infections out of 79 procedures when using sonic instruments for LSFES.[3] The incidence rate could not be confirmed by other studies.

Fewer complications have been reported following TSFE. Among 975 TSFE procedures, these complications included SMPs (50 procedures,  $5.12\%$ ), vertigo and dizziness (49 procedures,  $5.02\%$ ), and edema (16 procedures  $1.64\%$ ). Only two studies communicated a total of three cases with the complication of sinusitis.[27,31] Of the 440 mallet-mediated TSFE cases in the selected studies, 49 procedures in 2 studies suffered from vertigo.[32,33] Al-Almaie and coworkers reported that all patients in their study complained of vertigo and dizziness accompanied with nausea following osteotome TSFE.[32,33] However, this study demonstrated the highest incidence of vertigo, which is not confirmed by other studies. Two cases were reported to have temporary paresthesia in the suborbital area at 1 week after TSFE.[26,34] For those TSFE procedures using hydraulic or reamer-mediated instruments, complications were rarely documented. Only 12 SMP were communicated from a total of 535 cases using these techniques.

# 3.3 Potential contributing factors of complications during and following SFE

The association between complications and smoking versus nonsmoking or pre-operative sinus pathosis was only addressed in two

studies. $^{34,35}$  In comparison with nonsmokers, Stacchi and coworkers reported four SMPs, which all occurred with smokers. $^{35}$  In contrast, the SMP rates in nonsmokers and smokers were  $8\%$  (2/25) and  $4\%$  (1/20) respectively which was not statistically significant $^{34}$  but may be clinically meaningful.

Sinus pathoses discussed in selected articles included sinusitis, pseudocyst, chronic hyperplastic sinusitis, mucocele, ostium obstruction, and mucosal thickening (defined as average thickness of sinus membrane  $>2\mathrm{mm}$ ).<sup>36</sup> Only three studies reported outcomes for patients with preoperative sinus pathoses.<sup>31,36,37</sup> In the cohorts study, 32 SFE were performed in 29 patients (18 LSFE and 14 TSFE) with the presence of an antral pseudocyst. No membrane was torn during SFE but the antral pseudocyst caused bone and membrane perforation in one patient. The SMP was later repaired after cyst aspiration. The authors also reported a small superficial abscess was formed following a small orifice leakage. Three other patients developed acute sinusitis and were successfully managed with antibiotics and nasal decongestants.<sup>31</sup> Falco and colleagues enrolled 38 cases with otolaryngological diseases prior to SFE, including chronic hyperplastic sinusitis, mucocele, ostium obstruction, anatomical alterations of the nasal septum. An otolaryngologist, in coordination with the treating dental surgeon, performed functional endoscopic sinus surgery with LSFE in a single session. Only one SMP was reported and  $8.7\%$  patients experienced immediate swelling at grafted sites. The sinus disease however was completely resolved, and no implant failed with up to 1 year of follow-up.<sup>37</sup> However, a recent retrospective study suggested a positive association between SMP and the presence of membrane thickening in the sinus augmented sites with pathology. The average membrane thickness was greater in the sites with SMP (membrane thickness in average was  $6.1\mathrm{mm}$ ) compared with those without SMP (membrane thickness in average was  $2.35\mathrm{mm}$ ). Sinus pathoses before SFE were found in  $66\%$  of the sites with SMP and  $41\%$  of the sites without SMP. The authors did not specify if the patients were sent for consultation with an otolaryngologist.<sup>36</sup> Taken all together, these studies would suggest that the presence of sinus pathology may not be a contraindication for SFE with the therapeutic intervention of an otolaryngologist either before or during surgery.

The information about the presence of anatomic factors, such as the presence of septa and membrane thickness, was not included in the majority of the studies. Moreover, most of the studies included prophylactic antibiotics before SFE in the surgical protocol. Therefore, the impact of smoking, anatomic factors and premedication usage on the incidence of SFE complications could not be evaluated via meta-analysis.

# 3.4 Treatment strategies of SFE complications

Among the 74 included studies, 66 articles provided their strategies in the management of SMP and 50 articles included the treatment on complications other than SMPs. The majority sites with SMPs were treated with the placement of a resorbable collagen membrane (for LSFE) or collagen surgical dressing (for TSFE) (31 articles). Some researchers suggested the placement of platelet-rich fibrin clot. $^{38,39}$  Extending membrane reflection for spontaneous closure via membrane folding was suggested by two research groups in five articles using LSFE. $^{3,40-43}$  Membrane suturing is also suggested in two articles for sites with large membrane perforation ( $>5\mathrm{mm}$ ). $^{31,44}$  Procedures may be aborted for these sites as well. It should be kept in mind that the efficacy of these strategies remains unclear and required further validation.


Other complications following SFE required intervention included sinusitis, wound dehiscence, and infection. Sinusitis was suggested to be managed with antibiotics and nasal decongestants (eight articles). Moreno Vazquez and coworkers specified their regimens, including an antibiotic cycle of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, fluticasone (nasal anti-inflammatory medication), and aerosol therapy consisting of gentamicin, mesna, fluocinolone, and budesonide  $0.25\mathrm{mg / ml}$ , with sessions every  $12\mathrm{h}$  for 1 week, followed by another week with daily sessions.[15] Another antibiotic regimen for acute sinusitis following SFE is the combination of clindamycin  $300\mathrm{mg}$  and levofloxacin  $500\mathrm{mg}$  every  $12\mathrm{h}$  for 7 days.[27]

The application of systemic antibiotics and chlorhexidine irrigation was used to treat wound dehiscence and wound infection. Sinus membrane and graft removal may be required if infection persists. Most of the bleeding was treated by pressure or bone wax application. Pieri and colleagues reported treating the bleeding site successfully with the use of diode laser.[45] Most of the other complications following SFE required no specific intervention, such as postoperative swelling, minor bleeding, edema, or temporary paresthesia in the suborbital area.[34]

# 4 DISCUSSION

SFE is both feasible and safe to perform to increase the subantral bone available in the posterior maxilla for implant placements. Nevertheless, these procedures still carry some risk of complications. The current results suggested that TSFE and LSFE have distinct features to their complications. Transient SFE complications are widely reported, such as postoperative swelling, edema, hematoma, and pain all of which can occur with dental implant or traditional periodontal surgeries. Of the SFE complications, SMP is probably addressed the most in the literature and requires immediate intervention.

The findings from the current systematic review demonstrate that TSFE and LSFE vary in both the types and incidence of complications reported. The sinuses treated via LSFE had higher incidence of SMPs and postoperative sinusitis than those using TSFE. The limited number of studies and the significant amount of heterogeneity in experimental designs prevented the current systematic review from reaching any conclusions about the association between SMPs and other complications. A previous study reported a significant association between postoperative sinusitis and SMP (OR of 10.5).<sup>46</sup> One should also be bear in mind that the diagnosis/recognition of postoperative sinusitis and many other complications relied heavily on patients self-reporting of symptoms. Some rare complications, like post-operative orantral

Note: The symbol * indicates pain, swelling, and edema are common reactions of wound healing. Some studies might not report these as complications unless symptoms are severe. Also, their incidence heavily replies on patients' self-reports. Therefore, incidence of these should be interpreted with caution.

[Correction added on 26 November 2022, after first online publication: Data in the bottom portion of Table 2 has been shifted up two lines.] communications $^{47}$  followed by poorly-healed SMP, were not reported in the selected articles. The incidence of these complications may be underestimated without standardized and appropriate records.


Most SFE complications are temporary and managed within the week following the procedure using supportive postoperative care which includes analgesics and systemic antibiotics. SMP should be immediately addressed given the potentially significant adverse effects, which could have on the outcome of the attendant bone grafting procedure. Focusing on the prevention and management of SFE complications, Table 3 summarized management and prevention strategies. In the treatment of SMP, clinicians should consider the following strategies based on the size of perforations: (1) releasing the membrane to reduce tension on it if the diameter of the SMP is less than  $2\mathrm{mm}$ ,[41] (2) repairing medium-size SMP (around  $2 - 5\mathrm{mm}$ ) using collagen membranes,[13,48-53] surgical dressing,[16,26,32,34,54] or by other biologics, such as platelet-derived plasma or platelet-derived fibrin. $^{38,39}$  (3) Consideration to aborting the procedure if the size of SMP greater than 5 mm. For a large SMP, Pikos suggested a technique of membrane repair requiring multiple membrane placement and fixation. $^{55,56}$  Suturing or sealing with fibrin glue has also been proposed. $^{44,57}$


Cone beam computed tomography scan prior to treatment is the most effective way to avoid complications with bleeding by identifying blood vessels contained in the lateral wall, septa, along with the presence of underlying pathology. When in doubt, one should consider seeking the consultation of a board certified otolaryngologist to rule out any possible undetected pathology before performing SFE.

Other widely reported LSFES complications are post-operative sinusitis and graft failure. The present findings showed that LSFES had a greater chance of postoperative sinusitis (60 out of 3436 cases) compared with TSFES (3 out of 975 cases). The incidence of acute sinusitis suggested in the early literature published before 1997 was up to  $20\%$ .[58] Recent literature suggests that the incidence of post-SFE sinusitis has been lower,[59-61] and the incidence among all cases included in this presented review is approximately  $1.7\%$  which may be due to the improvement of techniques and instruments. Better case selection and complication management also appear to help reduce the incidence of postoperative sinusitis. The current evidence suggested post-operative SFE sinusitis may be associated with the incidences of SMPs, ostium obstruction, and blockage of air flow.[58,60,62] However, the causality needs more investigation.

Sinus infection is another concern with SFE procedures. Recruiting 359 SFE procedures with 150 SMPs, Nolan and coworkers suggested  $85\%$  of sinus infection was related to the presence of SMP. $^{16}$  Patients with predisposition to sinusitis or sinus pathology were prone to have post-SFE sinusitis, however, a small SMP on a healthy sinus membrane did not appear to be related to the presence of post-SFE sinusitis. $^{58-60}$  Acute maxillary sinusitis may also happen after TSFE even though the incidence is low $^{63}$  (In the present review, there are only three cases reported out of the 975 TSFE). Interestingly, wound infection may increase the chance of graft loss but it is not necessary the cause of total graft failure. Kahnberg and colleagues reported that eight infections developed at more than 2 weeks after 47 SFE procedures but only four sites ended up with partial graft loss. $^{64}$  Sinus infections can be managed at the early postoperative timeframe with antibiotics to prevent escalating bacterial contamination to the entire sinus antrum. Prior studies have suggested a regimen of chlorhexidine irrigation for the sites with wound infection or graft exposure. $^{44,50}$  Membrane or graft removal as well as otolaryngological referral should be considered if antibiotics or the application of antibacterial agent could not control the infection. $^{59,65}$  To prevent sinus infections, prophylactic antibiotics have been widely given in the selected articles (51 studies). Most of them prescribed 2 g Amoxicillin 1 h before surgery. Clinicians should also prescribe antibiotics following SFE and instruct the patient avoiding pressure for sinus during healing. The combination of antibiotics and decongestants have been widely recommended. $^{15,31,66}$  In addition, Choukroun et al. demonstrated that when they incorporated metronidazole solution into the graft material in half of their patients undergoing LSFE, they were able

to significantly reduce the rate of infection.[67] They postulated that the effectiveness of this preventive approach is related to the anaerobic and fusospirochete bacterial population associated with infected grafted sites.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), including vertigo and dizziness accompanied with nausea, was first reported in a case report where osteotome malleting was used for ridge expansion.[114] A study suggested the incidence of BPPV is around  $2.7\%$  following osteotome SFE.[115] As a popular theory, it is believed that osteotome-associated BPPV develops as a result of canalolithiasis. The tapping of the osteotome approaches on TSFE may trigger the dislodgement of otoliths, leading to BPPV. Researchers have furtherly demonstrated the relationship between the presence of BPPV and the use of osteotome technique in case reports.[116,117] This adverse outcome has been one of the contributions to alternative approaches being sought for TSFE. In this current review, BPPV was noted in only two articles[32,33] with 49 cases out of the overall 440 cases using osteotome reported from the selected studies. Fortunately, all reported BPPV or tinnitus required no interventions as they resolved by one month following the procedure. In the latest clinical practice guideline of BPPV published by American Academy of Otolaryngology, referral should be made if the patient has vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus (jumping of the eyes) provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver; or if the patient reports a history of symptoms similar to those seen with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus.[118]

Insufficient gain of vertical ridge height could also be challenging for future implant placement. Uchida and coworkers suggested that approximate volumes of bone materials requested for a 15-mm and 20-mm SFE were 5.46 and  $7.96\mathrm{cm}^3$ , respectively.[68] Dimensional changes of various graft materials were reported with a range of 0.3-0.5 cm³ within the 6 months of experimental period.[69] As the result of a combination of insufficient graft consolidation and postoperative sinus pneumatization, significant alterations in sinus volume were noticed in previous studies up to 6 years of follow-up periods.[70]

A secondary SFE surgery is required if insufficient vertical height is present.

Limitations encountered when performing the current systematic review included great heterogeneity with the study designs and patient populations, in terms of smoking status and the presence of sinus anatomy (such as the presence of septa and lateral wall thickness) or pathology. Patient outcomes and complications in the selected articles were also assessed with very different approaches. For example, the pain level was assessed in visual analog scale (VAS) in different increments so it was difficult to directly compare these studies. While studies have strict criteria for recruitment to avoid potential complications, ascertaining their occurrence relies heavily on patient reporting. For example, post-operative pain, edema, and early swelling are usually only realized by a patient report any of these and this can also be quite subjective. Unfortunately, there were a limited number of studies that prospectively set out to ascertain quantified patient-outcome assessments, such as VAS for pain, consumptions level of analgesics for pain relief,[26] and volumetric changes in facial soft tissue signifying swelling.[28] Therefore, the severity and true incidence of these complications throughout the entire body of literature is left to some conjecture. The incidence of SFE complications, especially temporary and mild ones, may be underestimated. Future investigations should include in their design the assessment for patient perception about the procedure and complication reporting.

# 5 CONCLUSION

Within the limitations of this systematic review, the results suggest that LSFE and TSFE have distinct features of complications with varying incidences. Due to the nature of the techniques, LSFE shows higher incidence of SMP, wound dehiscences, and graft exposure/ failure; whereas vertigo and tinnitus are only found in TSFE even though their incidences reported from literature are inconsistent. Most of the SFE complications were transient and the most common complication requiring intervention was SMP. BPPV may be associated with mallet-mediated TSFE but the incidence was rare. Treatment planning for these procedures should incorporate strategies to avoid complication occurrence. More studies are needed to evaluate the association between SFE complications and regenerative outcomes.
