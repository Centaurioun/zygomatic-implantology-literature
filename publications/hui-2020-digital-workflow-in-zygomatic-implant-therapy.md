# Digital Workflow in Zygomatic Implant Therapy

# Zygomatic Implant

Dentistry has changed tremendously in the past decades. Discovery of osseointegration and its application have revolutionized dentistry like never before. A fixed dental prosthesis for rehabilitation of the edentulous jaw is no longer an impossible dream. Instead, it is now an expected and common outcome. This opens new challenges in both surgical and prosthetic disciplines. Today, there are more innovations surrounding implant dentistry including soft and hard tissue reconstruction, prosthodontics, and aesthetic considerations, as well as new methods of diagnosis and treatment planning and application of digital technology.

Zygomatic implant opens new challenges to implant surgeons and offers new prosthetic outcomes. Although zygomatic implant-based therapy is not an easy therapy to master, with the advent of digital technology, we hope it becomes more widely applicable and more patients benefited by it.

The zygomatic implant was first introduced by PI Branemark [1]. The invention is an example of 'thinking outside the box': lack of bone at dentoalveolar level for conventional implants is overcome by utilizing bone higher up, beyond the bone that normally houses teeth. The beauty of the zygomatic implant is multi-fold: it allows for reconstruction of severely atrophic maxillae [2, 3]; it has a higher implant survival rate than implants placed with conventional bone augmentation methods; and a prosthesis may be immediately placed and immediately loaded [4, 5].

The success rate of zygomatic implants is not affected by immediate loading. Immediate loading is a major factor in decision-making for a patient to opt for zygomatic implant placement in lieu of bone augmentation. It not only allows early restoration of function and aesthetics, but also significantly reduces postoperative pain and discomfort. Without a removable temporary denture pressing and rubbing over the mucoperiosteal flaps which are not yet reattached to the underlying bone, pain and discomfort after surgery become acceptable. For many patients, this benefit is even more important than early function. For dentists, making a comfortable removable denture that is retentive enough over an atrophic maxilla for proper function is often unfeasible.

Zygomatic implant therapy remains a relatively under-utilized treatment option, and as mentioned before, it is not an easy technique to undertake and master. Other than technical difficulties, which will be addressed later, there are some shortcomings:

The implant head, which means where the abutment is to be located and where the prosthetic screw access emerges, is often located more palatally than desired. How far palatally is dictated by the morphology of residual alveolar bone, the maxillary sinus wall and the zygomatic bone. Palatally placed implant heads lead to a bulky prosthesis that infringes on tongue space, causing inconvenience, discomfort, and possibly affecting speech. As a result, different authors have attempted to classify the different pertinent clinical presentation and derived treatment outcome and modify treatment plans accordingly:

Aparicio et al. [3] classified five skeletal forms of the zygomatic buttress-alveolar crest complex, identified as zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) classification 0, I, II, III or IV:

- Type 0: The implant body reaches the zygoma bone following an intra-sinusal path.  
- Type I: Slightly concave maxillary wall, implant osteotomy to perforate the maxillary wall and most of the implant body remains inside maxillary boundaries.  
- Type II: More concave maxillary wall, and ideal placement of implant head forces most of the implant body to be placed extra-sinusally. No space is left between the implant surface and the anterior maxillary bone.  
- Type III: Very concave maxilla, middle part of the implant does not touch the bone.  
Type IV: Extra-maxillary path.

The authors report that zygomatic implants have an increased tendency to bend under horizontal loads and this is related to two factors: Greatly increased length of the implants and limited or no bone support at the maxillary alveolar crest.

Malo et al. advocated extra-maxillary placement of zygomatic implants [6]. Implants are positioned outside the maxillary sinus, to preserve integrity of the maxillary membrane, provide more bone-to-implant contact, to place the implant head on or close to the maxillary crest, and to allow direct visualization of the drill during surgical preparation of the zygomatic bone. New implant designs with  $5\mathrm{mm}$  diameter are used to increase surface area of contact between bone and implant and to reduce flexibility of the implant.

With regard to technical difficulties, many may be overcome through digital technology. Zygomatic implant surgery involves placing a long and tilted implant into the zygoma bone, which is itself high up beyond the teeth-bearing area, and, therefore, outside the comfort zone of most dentists. Steps are described here with special emphasis on the pitfalls:

A mucoperiosteal flap needs to be raised to the zygomatic bone and beyond the point, the zygomatic implant exits the bone surface in order to make use of the full thickness of available bone. Surgical access can be difficult, as it is relatively distant from the mouth. Patients with bulky cheeks and limited mouth opening present greater difficulty still. Compromised visibility could lead to imprecise drilling and, consequently, inaccurate placement of the implant.

The lateral maxillary sinus wall is opened and an extended sinus lift is performed to preserve the lining as much as possible with the goal of keeping the fixture path outside the sinus lining. Extra-sinus placement of zygomatic implants may still be within bony sinus wall. This modification is made to reduce the risk of developing sinusitis later [7, 8]. Chronic sinusitis is one major complication of zygomatic implant treatment.

There are two entry points on installation of a zygomatic fixture: one at the alveolar bone and the other at the zygomatic bone. To simplify, we call the former (at the alveolar bone) the 'entry point' and the latter, the 'exit point'. Since a zygomatic fixture is a straight implant, and while two points define a straight line, it is the determination of these two points, and the ability to involve these two points accurately during surgery, that matters greatly.

The entry point to alveolar crest is determined from prosthetic plan, the so-called prosthetically driven treatment planning. The goal is to position the prosthetic screw access hole so that they emerge as close to the occlusal surface of the artificial teeth as possible. Although very deep screw access hole that may make for difficult handling of prosthetic screws, it is still desirable to keep the implant heads as buccal as possible to minimize bulk on palatal side of the prosthesis.

Placing the apical portion of the zygomatic implant into zygomatic bone at the exact position planned is the most difficult part of the procedure. The challenge is with the sequential drilling. Osteotomy preparation with long drills is difficult because of limited mouth opening. The difficulty increases the more the posterior implant placement is needed. Nevertheless, in order to minimize free-end distal cantilever extension of the prosthesis, it is desirable to place the zygomatic implant head as far posterior as possible.

Other than limitation of mouth opening, presence of opposing dentition also increases difficulty of the procedure and either or both of these factors could lead to an entry point that is too anterior and has too much backward tilt to the drilling direction. Traditionally, entry points were at the premolar region which has probably taken these factors into account. At present, we try to place the entry point at the first molar position. However, clinical assessment of mouth opening is very important to ensure that the execution of the planned surgery is possible. The high tendency to backward tilt the drilling direction may place the implant tip into the infra-temporal fossa, an undesirable position for osseointegration.

Some surgeons like to plan for the shortest implant possible since with shorter implants the above factors are less limiting. When planning to use a shorter implant, the path chosen is along the lower border of the zygoma bone. This path has additional advantages of providing a safer distance from the orbit and requiring less extensive flap raising. Furthermore, shorter implants are less flexible and bend less upon loading. Even with no alveolar crest support (extra-sinusal placement), there is less springboard effect. However, some studies demonstrate that the zygoma bone has better bone volume at higher position [9]. Because individual anatomy varies, the surgical plan should be customized accordingly.

There is no reliable anatomical reference for the exit point seen during operation. Its determination is dependent upon experience. The zygoma bone is quite thin in cross-section and it is easy to go too medially towards the infra-temporal fossa, especially when angulation of the drill is tilted backwards.

In view of the complex and highly varied morphology of zygomatic-maxillary skeleton, 3D imaging is mandatory in planning zygomatic implants. With the aid of digital technologies, such as software planning and 3D modelling, many of the related problems and difficulties can be overcome.

# Digital Dentistry

Digital technology is changing our lives in many aspects and it is transforming dentistry as well.

The learning curve associated with incorporating digital technology is steep, as the knowledge involved is not necessarily within the boundaries of conventional dentistry. Therefore, we have to develop new ways of thinking to acquire the skills. Working with software is often a tedious exercise and hours of desktop time are spent facing computer screens, especially during the initial learning phase. Most dental product companies are also at an early phase in developing their software and they often want to keep them as closed systems which then limits their usage to the company's own dental products. In addition, sometimes, the software may not be as 'intelligent' and/or user-friendly as needed.

The sophisticated software that is needed for high-precision digitization can only be supported by most up-to-date computer hardware; therefore, the cost of incorporating digital dentistry is high. The speed of development in digital technology is extremely fast, rendering the lifespan of both software and hardware relatively short which is an additional issue as dental practices try to control overhead expenses.

Digital technology is supposed to improve efficiency and accuracy, shorten production time, and make surgery less traumatic and impression less uncomfortable. However, at the moment not all parts share equal level of advantage over conventional analogue techniques. This is another principal reason for the hesitation of clinicians to use digital technology.

Major developments in dental CAD/CAM systems occurred in the 1980s; CAD/CAM is the abbreviation of 'Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing'. Digital systems have three functional components [10]:

1. Digitization tool/scanner that transforms geometry into digital data for computer processing.  
2. CAD: Software to design the prosthesis, locate implant position and to perform according to conventional dental requirements.  
3. CAM: A production technology that transforms data sets into the desired products.

In implant dentistry, the first geometric digitization is done by cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) to produce digital data renderings of anatomy relevant to dental treatment, such as implant surgery. In the images, different tissues show up as different shades of grey. Isolation of relevant anatomy by the process called 'segmentation' is performed by selection of the grey value range of the region of interest. Bone stands out quite well from soft tissue and, therefore, segmentation of bone structure is more straightforward than segmentation of soft tissue structures or organs. This is an advantage in dentistry since teeth and bone, being hard tissues, are usually the main items of interest.

CBCT is the basis of all digital planning, without which digital surgical planning is impossible, be it implant surgery, orthognathic surgery, or other jaw reconstructive surgeries. It provides three-dimensional imaging of our jaw structures, so that we can visualize the relevant anatomy and pathology, facilitating diagnosis and treatment planning.

Various CAD programs can be used to plan implant surgery and design surgical guides which are appliances used to transfer digital surgical planning to actual surgery. Guided surgery is generally divided into static and dynamic techniques, that means, by fabricated surgical guides [11] or by real-time navigation systems [12, 13]. We will come back to the topic of guided surgery later.

Digital impressions are also becoming more popular. Conventional impression making is never a comfortable procedure and may be is especially difficult for patients with a prominent gag reflex and those with mobile teeth due to periodontal disease. Since data from digital impressions do not occupy physical space, if a dental model is needed, the data can be utilized whenever needed to print out a model.

3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is nowadays very useful in making dental models [14] and surgical guides. Conventional digital manufacturing processes are based on the subtractive technique of cutting or milling products from base materials. This process is very popular in making final dental products, such as crowns, fixed partial dentures/bridges and other types of prosthetic framework. In contrast, 3D printing builds a prosthesis through layer-by-layer addition of material.

3D printing first appeared in 1984 invented as 'stereolithography' by Charles Hull. Stereolithography creates 3D objects by successively printing thin layers of an object using a medium curable by ultraviolet light, starting from the bottom layer to the top layer. Hull and his co-workers launched the first commercial 3D printer in 1988 and created the STL file format for 3D printing. STL (STereoLithography or 'Standard Triangle Language' and 'Standard Tessellation Language') is a file format native to stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems, the world's first 3D printing company that was founded by Hull and others. Standard Tessellation Language and Standard Triangle Language are actually after-the-fact backronyms. At about the same time, Scott Crump invented a material extrusion process called fusion deposition modelling (FDM).

Since the late 1980s, 3D printing has evolved rapidly, and additional methods have been invented, developed and refined, resulting in various ways of 3D printing available today. The most popular processes used by dental industry include Stereolithography (also categorized as vat photo-polymerization), Fused Deposition Manufacturing (material extrusion), PolyJet and PolyJet Matrix Technology (material jetting) and 3D Printing (binder jetting).

Current usages of 3D printing in dentistry are not for final prosthetic parts, but rather 3D printing is mainly used for making anatomical models and surgical guides. Anatomical models are made from data obtained by medical imaging of specific patients. They allow true size visualization to facilitate surgical planning, simulation and rehearsal of surgical procedures, and fabrication of customized surgical guides and templates. In maxillofacial surgery, the models are also used for prebending of metal reconstruction plates and designing of distraction devices. Additional uses are limited only by our imagination.

# Digital Planning in Zygoma Implant

The use of a surgical guide to facilitate zygoma implant placement is not a new idea. In the past, acrylic plates were fabricated on dental stone models, metal beads of known dimension attached to the acrylic plates, an orthopantomogram (OPG) taken with patients wearing the plates, and from the OPG, a safe length of implants is determined. The idea of prosthetic-driven treatment planning is also nothing revolutionary. In the old days, a prosthetic mock-up was completed on stone models, transparent acrylic was used to transform the mock arrangement into a surgical guide, and then pilot holes were prepared to identify exact positions where implants were to be positioned. Similar principles are still being used for making radiographic guides in this digital era, as it acts as an exact replica of the desired prosthetic end result, supported with radiopaque markers.

Introduction of CBCT imaging and other digital tools has significantly improved the accuracy of guided surgery and prosthetically driven treatment planning. CBCT provides three-dimensional information of the relevant anatomy. The information of hard tissues is much more accurate than that of soft tissue, even though both have limitations. Bone information is of central importance to dental implant therapy planning and because of its high general accuracy, CBCT is to present a crucial diagnostic tool for complicated cases such as those involving zygoma implants.

When we plan implant position on CBCT images, we have to bear in mind that the images offer limited information with regard to 'softer' tissues. Density measurement is also inaccurate for bone and the softer the bone, the more it resembles soft tissue on these images. Therefore, there is the possible pitfall of planning implants to be placed in bone that is too soft to establish good primary stability. Another possible pitfall occurs in mandibles with low bone density where the inferior dental/alveolar canal may not be visible because of the absence of a cortical boundary around the canal.

Knowing and accepting these limitations, CBCT information is critical for success in guided surgery, as it is the basis of all subsequent steps.

The goal of dental implant placement is to provide excellent support for an aesthetically-pleasing, functional and cleansable prosthesis. The importance of prosthetically driven treatment planning cannot be overemphasized. A radiographic guide is made as an exact replica of the planned prosthesis. Double scan technique is for production of an artefact-free, high-resolution digitization of a guide. A first scan is taken with the patient wearing the radiographic guide and the second scan is a scan of the radiographic guide only. The two scans are superimposed according to the radiopaque markers, resulting in a 3D bone model of the patient together with a 3D model of the radiographic guide.

The image data obtained from CBCT are imported into design software for digital planning. The positions and angulations of implants are planned in the software by the clinicians making use of various reconstruction views. The surgical guide is also planned with the CAD system. It is made of acrylic resin that is manufactured by a process called stereolithography. Stereolithography is a form of widely used 3D printing technology by production of parts layer by layer with photopolymerization.

Metal sleeves are important components of surgical guide. The metal sleeve guides the osteotomy drills. The sleeves guide the position, direction and depth of osteotomy preparation. The guide can be supported by teeth, bone, or soft tissue. For full edentulous cases, temporary fixation pins are also important components to be incorporated into the guide.

The accuracy of surgical guide is affected by many factors:

# 1. CT threshold value

A CBCT image is the foundation of the entire digital planning process. Therefore, its quality will affect all facets of the design and production processes. CBCT image quality is affected by image acquisition and processing. Grey value thresholds can influence 3D reconstruction and will affect final fit and thickness of the appliance. Figure 1 shows the dimensional changes in the radiographic template under different CT threshold values. The template becomes thicker and the fitting surface is also changed when the threshold is adjusted from  $-537$  to  $-907$ . To date, there is no standardized threshold for radiographic templates and the values vary amongst different planning software.

# 2. Types of tissue support

There are three types of tissue support for surgical guides:

(a) Tooth-supported guide  
(b) Mucosa-supported guide  
(c) Bone-supported guide

Tooth-supported guides and mucosa-supported guides offer better accuracy than bone-supported guides. The reason for bone-supported guides to be the least accurate among the three is that dimensions of 3D CT reconstructed bone models vary at different CT thresholds/iso-values, and, hence, in turn affect the dimensions of surgical guide fabricated from the inaccurate models [15]. This dimensional inaccuracy will affect the fitting of the guide and implant position.

3. Use of temporary fixation screws can also induce errors in accuracy. This is related to elasticity of the polymer guide plate. The sequence of drilling and pin

placement can deform the guide unintentionally, as well as leading to settling of the guide in an even manner.

4. Fully guided protocols offer higher accuracy than partially guided protocols. There are different types of protocols. Some only allow for the pilot osteotomy and the guide is removed after the initial osteotomy pilot drilling and the rest of the process is done free hand. Some protocols allow for the entire drilling process to be completed before implant placement. Fully guided protocols allow for the entire drilling process and implant placement to be guide-dependent. Depth control systems that stop the drill at the sleeve insertion level offer more accurate vertical drilling, depth implant placement and, therefore, a higher safety level to underlying structures, most importantly, the inferior dental/alveolar nerve.

Planning guided surgery for zygomatic implant placement has unique challenges. The first challenge is that there is no existing computer design software system specific for zygoma implants. Therefore, special modifications to third-party software are required to design the guide.

Another difficulty is controlling the path of the long zygoma implant. Zygoma implant passes through two bone structures along its path: the residual maxillary ridge through a point we call the 'entry' point, and the zygoma bone through the 'exit' point. The entry point is identified in a similar way as for conventional implants; specifically, it is prosthetically driven. The drilling is controlled by the metal sleeves within the resin template, in the same fashion as for conventional implants.

The ultra-long zygoma implants give rise to several problems. First, the errors of conventional guided surgery will be magnified. Among the coronal, apical and angular deviation, angular deviation is most significantly affected by implant length. With a long implant, a small degree of angular deviation will lead to substantial positional error at the apex. This is called sine error that describes the magnification of angular error over distance.

Further errors can be induced by flexibility of the long twist drills used during zygoma implant osteotomy and by flexibility of the resin guide template. These factors are more obvious when the mouth opening of a patient is restricted. In addition, there are more sideways and bending actions during the drilling sequences to align the long drill through the guide sleeves.

The curved or irregular bony surface at the base of the zygoma bone around the exit area may induce another source of error. When drilling into an inclined surface, the entrance hole is oval instead of round in shape and the drill has a natural tendency to lean in a direction to become perpendicular to bone surface. The inconsistency of bone density of the cancellous space would also deviate the drill to a direction with less physical resistance. No matter, the resultant direction change means the drill will tilt when drilling through a surface that is not perpendicular to it.

A guided drill can minimize such deviation. However, during zygoma implant osteotomy preparation, the exit point is far away from the metal guide sleeve at the entry point, so the ultra-long flexible drill is not guided into the exit point; hence, the tendency for angular deviation is magnified.

A zygomatic drill guide was developed by Chow [16]. The design has double metal sleeves guiding both entry and exit point drilling. It consists of two heads in co-axial alignment connected by a sliding arm like a telescope, resulting in a more well-controlled long straight line drilling. It is a novel design and further studies are necessary to assess its effectiveness.

# Protocols for Guided Implant Surgery

There are two distinct protocols that could be utilized in guided implant surgery planning:

# 1. Optical Scan Protocol

This protocol is usually used in single tooth replacement and short partial edentulous cases. Sufficient number of natural teeth with at least four to six teeth per arch is necessary and these teeth should have no or minimal metal elements such as crowns and bridges. The purpose of having sufficient number of teeth is to allow accurate superimposition of the 3D CT-reconstructed bone model with the optical scanned dental arch (Figs. 2, 3 and 4). The reason to avoid metal elements (crows and bridges) is that they could lead to severe scatters in the cone beam CT images, and it will make the matching more difficult and inaccurate. The

# 2. Dual CT Scan Protocol

In contrast to optical scan protocol, this is used mainly for patients with insufficient teeth or total edentulous (Fig. 6) or cases with a lot of metal restorations. This is because in edentulous cases, there are no teeth available for CT/Model superimposition, while in those dentate patients who have a lot of metal crowns and bridges, their CT images inevitably present with severe scatters (Fig. 7)

# Digital Planning Protocols for Zygomatic Implant Cases

There are basically three types of scenarios the digital planning could be applied.

1. Total edentulous patients who allow implant placement directly with no bone reduction required.

2. Edentulous patients who required modification of the alveolar ridge, followed by implant placement.

3. Partial edentulous patients where teeth have to be extracted and immediate placement of implants.

1. Total edentulous patients who allow implant placement directly without modification of the alveolar bone.

In total edentulous patients, there are no teeth, and hence no reference, helping the registration of DICOM images to the optical STL models and thus, dual CT scan protocol is utilized for digital planning. A radiographic template could be made or copied from patient's existing denture (Fig. 9a, b); however, if patient does not have any denture, a diagnostic prosthetic tooth set-up is required to determine the best implant position in relation to the future prosthesis.

The dual CT scan protocol, as the name implies, requires two CBCT scans: the first scan is the patient wearing the radiographic template and the second scan is the radiographic template alone. After the two CBCT scans have been acquired, both DICOM data sets are imported and merged together in the implant planning software. Once the radiographic template has merged with the 3D bone model, implant is planned based on the CBCT while the surgical guide is designed and generated based on the radiographic template (Figs. 10, 11, 12 and 13). The surgical template in this case scenario is mucosa-supported guide.

2. Edentulous patient who required modification of the alveolar ridge before implant placement.

Bone reduction is necessary when the coronal part of the edentulous ridge is too thin for implant placement and implants have to be placed in a more apical position (Fig. 14). Same as for the first case scenario, a diagnostic wax up is made to determine implant position in relation to the future prosthesis (prosthetically driven); the mock-up is then converted into a radiographic template (Fig. 15). Again, the dual CT scan protocol is used in these cases for planning implant position (Figs. 16 and 17). As the coronal portion of the alveolar ridge is so thin, horizontal reduction of bone is performed to make sure that the implants are placed in a flat bony platform. In order to accurately reduce the desired amount of bone, a bone reduction guide is designed using the planning


software (Fig. 18). The implant surgical guide is then generated on the virtual model of the reduced maxilla (Fig. 19). The two guides are exported as stereolithographic files (STL/Standard Triangle Language) and may be printed using any 3D printers (Fig. 20).

To facilitate bone reduction, a large mucoperiosteal flap should be raised. Once the anterior maxilla is reduced, the bone reduction guide is replaced by the implant surgical guide to allow fully guided placement of the two anterior regular implants and guided drilling of entry point of the zygomatic implants. The surgical guides in this case are bone-supported (Figs. 21, 22 and 23).

3. Partially edentulous patients in whom all teeth are to be extracted followed by immediate placement of implants for full arch rehabilitation.

In partially edentulous patients who present with limited number of teeth (Fig. 24), a dual CT scan protocol is indicated. Traditionally, a partial

We have modified the partial radiographic template to become a full coverage design; the teeth area is now fully covered by the template (Fig. 27) and hence, there will be no missing areas in the surgical guide.

Tooth-supported guides are preferred, as they offer better accuracy for implant positioning [15]. Therefore, in partially edentulous cases, instead of full clearance of the dentition and using either mucosa- or bone-supported guide for implant placement, we try to keep the remaining teeth to support the surgical guide (a tooth-supported guide) and place some of the implants, followed by dental clearance and placement of the remaining implants using a second surgical guide. The second guide is a mucosa-supported guide that it is also supported by the implants placed using the first guide. We call this a 'staged guides' approach, which provides better accuracy because the surgical guides are supported by rigid structures throughout the surgery.

In the previous section, we noted that dimensions of a radiographic template and a 3D reconstructed bone model may be affected by the CT threshold value. In other words, there could be inherited errors in the dual CT scan protocol, which, in turn, are transferred to the surgical guide. To prevent such error transfer and improve the accuracy of the guide, we believe that an optical scan protocol is always preferable because the optical scanned STL model is more dimensionally stable than the CT radiographic template [17]. Therefore, we modified the dual CT scan protocol to create a 'triple scan' protocol. Here, 'triple scan' means that we superimpose three scans together: (1) CT scan of patient's jaw, (2) CT scan of radiographic template and (3) optical scan of the dental arch (Fig. 28). However, in the triple scan protocol, the radiographic stent is placed on dental cast when obtaining CT images so that the dental cast can be visualized in the CT image (Fig. 29). This CT radiographic template/dental cast image provides a reference for matching the optical scanned model to the dual CT scan (Fig. 30). Hence, the dual CT scan protocol is 'converted' to an optical scan protocol and the resultant surgical guide is now generated based on the STL model instead of the radiographic template (Fig. 31).

In this upper partial edentulous case, the treatment plan is for edentulation followed by placement of four regular dental implants in the anterior maxilla and one zygomatic implant on each side in the posterior maxilla (Fig. 32).

According to Raico and colleagues [15], tooth-supported and mucosa-supported guides provide better accuracy when compared to bone-supported guides. Therefore, a 'staged' approach is used in this case where a tooth-supported guide is used first

# Discussion

It is apparent that dental profession moves eagerly in the direction of digital technology for a variety of reasons:

We are nervous about our performance; even though we trust our skills, we all understand the factor of human error. Human error occurs in sports, driving, singing, musical instrument playing, calligraphy and, certainly, surgery. Among all these activities, surgery is the lease tolerable one. Errors are not tolerated by our patients, our colleagues, and ourselves. Looking for methods to minimize, if not to eliminate, human error is an ongoing challenge.

Digital technology helps at many points along the workflow continuum. CBCT is a significant step forward, especially when looking back to the days when treatment planning relied on intraoral dental radiographs and making a diagnosis was merely educated guessing. Availability of an OPG was a big step forward; however, cross-sectional information was lacking regarding the dimension of jaw bone, path of inferior dental/alveolar nerve where it makes a turn to exit through the mental foramen, the size of nasopalatine canal and its proximity to the position of the planned implant position for the upper central incisor, size and shape of the maxillary sinus and lateral maxillary wall, and certainly, the thickness and morphology of the zygoma bone. In fact, because the zygoma bone is at different focal trough on an OPG compared to the alveolar crest, an OPG is of limited use when planning zygoma implant therapy.

Surgical guides and navigation systems are developed to improve the accuracy and safety of surgery by minimizing the effect of human error in surgical skills. However, guided surgery requires another set of skills. Attention to detail is essential when placing the guide and when calibrating a navigation device. The fact that fully guided protocols exhibit higher level of accuracy than partially guided protocols is proof that surgical guides improve implant placement accuracy.

In addition, guided surgery facilities use of flapless surgeries. With a more thorough knowledge of underlying anatomy and fabrication of accurate guides for precise placement of implants, theoretically, widely raised flaps for surgical access are needed less frequently. However, the need for reliable bone support to achieve precise and stable fit of the guide is at odds with flapless surgery.

To solve this problem, there are two main factors to consider which are currently not overcome:

# Accuracy of Fitting the Surgical Guide or Template over Soft Tissue

Soft tissue has highly variable elasticity and viscoelasticity and is not a reliable structure for guide positioning and fixation. A little tilting during the fixation process on compressible soft tissue can lead to serious error in implant angulation and lead to malposition of the implant apex. The longer the implant, the bigger the displacement of implant apex due to sine error. Therefore, with zygoma implants, a flap needs to be raised to anchor the guide on bone, to reposition the sinus lining so as to keep the implant extra-sinusally, and to place the device with second metal sleeve at the exit point to allow for control of implant trajectory.

With better imaging quality, segmentation accuracy, 3D printing possibilities of products with high precision with multiple materials, a customized guide that uses bone for support through the soft tissue without the need to erase a flap should not be an impossible task in the future.

# Drilling Through Soft Tissue and Inclined Bone Surface

Drilling through soft tissue is a messy procedure. Passing rotary cutting instruments through soft tissue traumatizes tissue. The tissue tends to attach to the drill surface and spin around with it and the centrifugal force of the spinning soft tissue is not very gentle to surrounding tissues. The softer the tissue, the more traumatic the process. Drilling through attached gingiva is more forgiving than drilling through loose connective tissue.

Trapping soft tissue along the drill may have a detrimental effect on the goal of achieving osseointegration even in the absence of infection. The thicker the soft tissue to pass through, the greater the need to raise a flap. Therefore, the more extrasinusal the path planed for a zygoma implant, the more necessary it is to raise a flap.

Digital impression making remains a relatively clumsy procedure compared with conventional impression taking. The time used is often longer than impression taking with elastomeric material and scanning devices are still bulky. Undoubtedly, advances will be made quickly based on the speed of digital technology development. Advantages of digital impressions are multi-fold: easier for patients with prominent gag reflex; less risky to lose teeth; data storage that is not space-occupying; 3D models may be printed as many times as needed; permanent record of colour and morphology, and so on. Therefore, despite the shortcomings, it is time for practitioners to start making digital impressions.

3D printing is another area that is expected to bloom in near future. With current limitations, we are employing 3D printing to create anatomical models, surgical guides and templates. We anticipate that the next phase of development will be manufacturing of dental prostheses that are currently mainly made by subtractive technique. When biocompatible implantable materials can be 3D printed, even the implants will be customized, designed and produced according to the individual's clinical presentation.

3D printing can also develop new materials. New materials that are lighter, stronger, recyclable and adaptive can be produced [18]. A nanomaterial such as graphene is approximately 200 times stronger than steel, a million times thinner than a human hair, and is an efficient conductor of heat and electricity. With the possibility of new materials being invented, there is the exciting possibility of creating de novo materials with physical, chemical and biological properties that are closer to the ideal for use in dentistry.

Bio-printing is a process combining genetic engineering to 3D printing. Today, cells, tissues and even organs can be printed. Bone, cartilage, skin, blood vessels, heart and liver cells have been successfully 'manufactured'. It is foreseeable that bone defects, as well as soft tissue defects, can be reconstructed using corresponding tissues that are printed in the correct form and shape for complete anatomical reconstruction. Teeth are more complex structures and if they can be manufactured together with the periodontium and alveolar bone with easy to anastomose vascular structures, the end of osseointegration implantology will be near.

Digital Technology is transforming our world and our lives. Its integration with biology and material science will surely change health sciences and clinical practice radically. The change is already beyond the beginning stage and education in medicine and dentistry will not be the same. However, fundamental biological principles should always be respected and cannot be replaced by technology. In our dental and surgical practice, the focus of attention is our patients, their physical and mental conditions, not their digital data.
