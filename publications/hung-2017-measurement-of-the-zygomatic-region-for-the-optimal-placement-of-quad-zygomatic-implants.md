# Abstract

Background: The zygomatic implant is suggested to be placed in zygomatic areas with the largest thickness, but regions to obtain the largest bone-to-implant contact (BIC) were unknown.

Purpose: To identify the zygomatic regions for placing quad zygomatic implants that obtain the largest BIC.

Materials and Methods: The zygomatic thicknesses of 300 zygomata were measured at total 12 points on the superior, middle, and inferior areas on the 3-dimensional reconstruction images. In 50 edentulous maxillae, the zygomatic BICs of virtually placed implants were measured and the incidence of the intrusion into the infratemporal fossa calculated at each point.

Results: The largest thickness in the superior, middle, and inferior regions were at Point  $A_1$  (8.01 ± 2.10 mm), Point  $B_1$  (7.02 ± 1.73 mm), and Point  $C_0$  (6.65 ± 1.66 mm), respectively. The virtually placed implants at Point  $A_3$  (16.70 ± 4.18 mm) and Point  $B_1$  (12.07 ± 3.84 mm) had the highest BICs while retaining the minimum incidence of the intrusion complications.

Conclusion: To obtain the largest BICs and avoid the intrusion complications, results suggested that the postero-superior region (Point  $A_{3}$ ) and the center of zygoma (Point  $B_{1}$ ) were the optimal places for the placement of quad zygomatic implants.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Zygoma can provide large area and adequate bone volume for the placement of zygomatic implants for the aim of oral rehabilitation, and the placement of zygomatic implant is a favorable approach for patients with atrophic maxillae $^{1-3}$  with a long-term survival rate of from  $94.2\%$  to  $100\%$ . $^{4-7}$  In the maxillary edentulous patients with severely atrophic maxillae, more than 1 zygomatic implant are required

*Dr. Kuofeng Hung is the first author of the manuscript.

to place in each zygoma to support the prosthesis, and currently the placement of quad zygomatic implants is suggested. The placement of quad zygomatic implants requires accurate evaluation on the characteristics of zygoma so that 2 zygomatic implants can be placed in the proper regions of the same zygoma. These regions should not only provide the largest bone-implant contacts (BICs) for the stability concern, but also keep away from the adjacent critical structures such as infratemporal fossa (ITF) to avoid the intrusion complications.

Previous 2 studies measured the thickness of zygoma. $^{8,9}$  One of them $^{9}$  measuring on Asian suggested that the region near the infero-anterior position to the jugale, which have the largest thickness, could be the optimal choice to place the apex of a zygomatic implant. However, these studies may cause the less precision of linear measurement because the thickness were obtained by measuring on cadavers. Furthermore, none of these studies assessed whether these regions with the largest thickness could provide the largest zygomatic BIC for the placement of zygomatic implants. In addition, no studies have evaluated whether all regions of zygoma are applicable to place the zygomatic implants while avoiding the intrusion of the ITF.


Therefore, this study obtained all data by measuring on the 3-dimension reconstruction computed tomography (3DCT) rather than on cadavers, and aimed to identify 2 regions on zygoma with the largest BICs while avoiding the intrusion complications for the placement of quad zygomatic implants. This study first evaluated the thickness in different regions of zygoma, and the potential relationships between the thickness and gender and age. This study mainly assessed the BICs of the apexes of zygomatic implants, which were virtually placed in different regions on computer using planning software, and assessed the incidence of intrusion into the ITF of the virtually placed zygomatic implants in different regions on zygoma.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

# 2.1 | Patients

This was a prospective study and the study protocol was scrutinized and approved by Ethical Committee of the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine. All patients had to sign a written consent form.

The Chinese maxillary dentate or edentulous patients who needed to undergo the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examinations before surgery in the Department of Oral Implantology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine from January 2016 to February 2017 were recruited. The exclusion criteria were (1) patients had anatomic abnormalities in zygoma or maxilla; or (2) patients had any facial asymmetry. There were additional exclusion criteria for maxillary dentate and edentulous patients, respectively. For dentate patients, the additional exclusion criterion was (1) patients lost 1 or more maxillary premolars or molars on both sides. For edentulous patients, the additional exclusion criteria were (1) patient's maxillary residual bone volume could not meet the standard of classes V or VI of the Cawood Howell classification<sup>10</sup>; or (2) The anterior maxilla had sufficient bone volume to place regular implants without additional bone grafting even with titled approach.<sup>11</sup>

# 2.2 | CBCT standardization

A CBCT scanner with a flat panel detector was used in all cases (i-Cat; Imaging Sciences International, LLC, Hatfield, Pennsylvania). The voxel size was  $0.2 \mathrm{~mm} \times 0.2 \mathrm{~mm} \times 0.2 \mathrm{~mm}$ . The exposure volume was set at  $0.4 \mathrm{~mm}$ . Manufacturer recommended settings of  $80 \mathrm{kV}$  and  $5 \mathrm{~mA}$  were employed. The Frankfort plane was used rather than the occlusal plane. Scan range from the supraorbital edge to mandible. DICOM files of images were imported and analyzed using the planning software NobelClinician (Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden).


# 2.3 | Imaging analysis

# 2.3.1 | Landmarks designation

An investigator performed the measurements under the supervision of 2 experts in oral and maxillofacial surgery and radiology.

# Landmarks in all patients

From the frontal view, a line passed through the bilateral lowermost points on the infraorbital margin was designated as line IM (Figure 1A). A line passed through the most lateral point on the orbital margin parallel to the middle line plane was designated as line LM (Figure 1A). The intersection point of line IM and line LM was designated as Point C (Figure 1A). The intersection point of angular bisector of line IM and line LM and orbital margin was designated as Point O (Figure 1A).

Line 1  $(\mathsf{L}_1)$  connected Point C with Point O (Figure 1B). Line 0  $(\mathsf{L}_0)$  was parallel to  $L_{1}$  anteriorly at the distance of  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , and Line 2  $(\mathsf{L}_2)$  and Line 3  $(\mathsf{L}_3)$  were orderly parallel to  $L_{1}$  posteriorly at the distance of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  (Figure 1C). The  $L_{0}$  to  $L_{3}$  were confined from the orbital margin to the inferior border of the zygoma, and the region from  $L_{0}$  to  $L_{3}$  was the apex of the zygomatic implants may be presented. The  $L_{0}$  and  $L_{3}$  were quartered with 6 points namely  $A_0$ ,  $B_0$ ,  $C_0$ ,  $A_3$ ,  $B_3$ , and  $C_3$  from the tops to the bottoms (Figure 1C).

The Line A (L_A), Line B (L_B), and Line C (L_C) passed through points A, points B, and points C, respectively (Figure 1C). The L_A, L_B, and L_C intersected with L_1 and L_2 with 6 points namely A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, and C_2, respectively (Figure 1C). Zygoma was divided into the superior, middle, and inferior parts by L_A, L_B, and L_C and regions passed through by L_A, L_B, and L_C were represented as the superior, middle, and inferior regions of the zygoma (Figure 2).

# Additional landmarks for edentulous patients

Two points namely  $E_1$  and  $E_2$  were additionally designated. Point  $E_1$  was the lowermost point of the alveolar crest, drawing a line from the lateral margin of the nasal incisure shifted 5 mm to the palatal side, corresponding to the coronal point for the anterior zygomatic implant in the quad approach $^{12}$  (Figure 1D). Point  $E_2$  was the lowermost point of the alveolar crest, drawing a line at a tangent to the lateral margin of the infraorbital foramen shifted 5 mm to the palatal side, corresponding to the coronal point for the posterior zygomatic implant $^{13}$  (Figure 1D).

# 2.3.2 | Measurements

The zygomatic thicknesses at total 12 points in the superior, middle, and inferior regions and the zygomatic length at  $L_0 - L_3$  were, respectively, measured in all cases (Figure 3). Zygomatic BICs were measured in maxillary edentulous patients. The virtual zygomatic implants were placed in the planning software. The placement of zygomatic implants was performed on the basis of the coronal and apical points. The coronal points of the mesial implant and distal implant were at Point  $E_1$  and  $E_2$ , respectively. The apical points of the mesial implant were orderly located on Point  $A_0 - A_3$  and that of the distal implant were orderly located on Point  $B_0 - B_3$  and Point  $C_0 - C_3$ . The zygomatic BIC was the

The length of the virtually placed implant and the depth of implant intruded into ITF were measured at each point (Figure 5). The percentage of the implant into the zygoma and implant

FIGURE 2 Zygoma was divided into the superior, middle, and inferior parts by LA, LB, and LC and regions passed through by LA, LB, and LC were represented as the superior (red), middle (blue), and inferior (green) regions of the zygoma intruded into ITF were calculated at each point. All the measurements were performed on bilateral zygomata.


# 2.4 | Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed with SPSS (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Differences of the zygomatic thickness and length between groups were compared using independent student  $t$ -test (between 2 groups) or ANOVA test (among 3 or above groups). The zygomatic thickness and length were correlated with age using the Pearson correlation analysis and the Pearson correlation coefficient  $(R)$  were calculated. Differences of the penetration incidence of the placed implants at zygomatic points were compared using chi-square test. A  $P$  value of  $< .05$  was considered to be statistically different.

# 3.1 | Patients demographics

This study recruited 150 elegibly consecutive patients (male = 81, female = 69; mean age = 49.8 years; age range: 20-78 years), of 100 were maxillary dentate patients, and 50 were maxillary edentulous patients.
FIGURE 3 Longitudinal tomography showed the measurements of the zygomatic thickness (blue line) and length (red line)

# 3.2 | The zygomatic thicknesses at points and zygomatic lengths at lines

The zygomatic thicknesses and lengths were measured on total 300 zygomata. The zygomatic thickness at each point and the length of each line are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The differences of the thicknesses at points on superior, middle, and inferior areas were significantly different (Table 1). The differences of the lengths at lines were significantly different (Table 2). The largest thickness on the superior, middle, and inferior areas were at Point A<sub>1</sub>, Point B<sub>1</sub>, and Point C<sub>0</sub>, with a mean value of  $8.01 \pm 2.10 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $7.02 \pm 1.73 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $6.65 \pm 1.66 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively. On the superior area, the thickness gradually decrease from Point A<sub>1</sub> to the anterior point of Point A<sub>0</sub> and the posterior point of Point A<sub>3</sub>; on the middle area, the thickness gradually decrease from Point B<sub>1</sub> to the anterior point of Point B<sub>0</sub> and the posterior point of Point B<sub>3</sub>; on the inferior area, the thickness decrease from Point C<sub>0</sub> to the posterior point of Point C<sub>3</sub> (Table 1 and refer to Figure 2).

# 3.3 | Correlation of the zygomatic thickness and length with the dentate and edentulous patients, gender and age

The zygomatic thickness at each point and length at each line were compared between the dentate patients and edentulous patients, and results showed the differences were not significant (Table 3). Results showed that comparing with zygomatic thickness in male, all points except Point  $A_0$ , Point  $A_1$ , and Point  $C_0$ , were significantly larger than those in female (Table 4). All zygomatic lines were significantly longer in male than in female (Table 4). The zygomatic thickness at each point did not have correlation with age (R from 0.023 to 0.170).

# 3.4 | The zygomatic BICs of the virtual implants at points

The zygomatic BICs were obtained by measuring on the virtually placed implants on 100 zygomata of the edentulous patients. The

FIGURE 5 The depth of implant intruded into infratemporal fossa (red line) lengths of the placed implants on corresponding apical points are shown in Table 5. The zygomatic BICs of different apical points and the percentage of the implant into the zygoma are shown in Table 6. On the superior area, Point  $A_{3}$  provided the largest zygomatic BIC, and the zygomatic BICs gradually decreased from at Point  $A_{3}$  to  $A_{0}$ ; on the middle area, Point  $B_{2}$  provided the largest zygomatic BIC, and the zygomatic BICs decreased from at Point  $B_{2}$  to the posterior point of Point  $B_{3}$  and the anterior point of Point  $B_{0}$ , respectively; on the inferior area, Point  $C_{1}$  provided the largest BIC, and the zygomatic BICs decreased from at Point  $C_{1}$  to the posterior point of Point  $C_{3}$  and the anterior point of Point  $C_{0}$ , respectively (Table 6 and refer to Figure 2).


# 3.5 | Intrusion into ITF of placing zygomatic implants at different areas

On the superior area, the placement of zygomatic implants at 4 points did not occur the intrusion into ITF. On the middle area, the placement of zygomatic implants at Point  $\mathsf{B}_3$  had the highest incidence of intrusion into the ITF (99%), followed by at Point  $\mathsf{B}_2$  (17.0%) with an intrusive depth of  $2.86 \pm 1.21 \mathrm{~mm}$  and  $1.59 \pm 0.45 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively, but no intrusion complications occurred at Point  $\mathsf{B}_1$  and Points  $\mathsf{B}_0$ .

# 4 | DISCUSSION

# 4.1 | Anatomic characteristics of zygoma

Zygoma is known as an irregular bone with a various thickness on regions, and the zygomatic characteristics could be diverse between ethnicities $^{14,15}$  and gender. $^{9,16}$  Results in this study showed that the thicknesses of zygoma were from 4.51 to 8.01 mm, and the lengths were from 25.67 to 32.54 mm. Furthermore, compared to the previous reports on the Brazilian $^{8}$  and Belgian $^{17}$  zygomatic measurement, the thicknesses and lengths of zygoma were larger. In keep with previous studies, $^{9,16}$  this study also showed that the length and thickness of the zygoma in female are smaller than that in male. Because of the disuse osteoporosis, $^{18,19}$  it was initially supposed that the zygomatic thicknesses in the edentulous patients were smaller than that in the dentate patients. On the contrary, this study found the zygomatic thickness and length on designated points and lines were similar between the dentate and edentulous patients. Furthermore, these characteristics of zygoma did not correlate with age.

# 4.2 | The promising regions for the placement of quad zygomatic implants

Similar to the results of a clinical study reported by Balshi et al.,[20] and an anatomic-based study reported by Corvello et al.,[21] our study showed that the largest BIC obtained on the superior, middle, and inferior areas of zygoma were  $16.70 \pm 4.18$  mm,  $13.88 \pm 3.50$  mm, and  $13.44 \pm 3.40$  mm, and the percentages of the implant into the zygoma were  $30.2\%$ ,  $29.9\%$ , and  $31.6\%$ , respectively. Some studies selected the regions with the largest thickness on zygoma as the optimal place for placing the apex of a zygomatic implant.[8,9] However, this study found that the points with the largest thickness were Point A<sub>1</sub>, Point B<sub>1</sub>, and Point C<sub>0</sub>, which failed to provide the largest BICs for the placement of zygomatic implants. Interestingly, on the superior, middle, and inferior areas, these points obtained the largest BICs located at posterior to those points with the largest thickness. Some other studies proposed that the bone thickness for placing the apex of the zygomatic implant was to be at least  $5.75 \mathrm{~mm}$ [22,23] but this study found that Point

The difference of BICs in each 2 groups was significant except that in  $C_0$  and  $C_3$ .

$\mathrm{A}_{3}$ , which provided the largest BICs with no intrusion complication, had a thickness of  $< 5.75 \mathrm{~mm}$ .

The approach of the quad zygomatic implants needs 2 regions on a zygoma for placing zygomatic implants, and the apex of the mesial implant should be placed above that of the distal implant. Therefore, the superior area was designed to place the mesial implant, and the middle or inferior areas was designed to place the distal implant. On the superior area, Point  $A_{3}$  provided the largest BIC, and on the middle or inferior areas, Point  $B_{1}$ , Point  $B_{2}$ , and Point  $C_{1}$  were potential points that provide high BICs for the placement of zygomatic implant. However, the placement of the second zygomatic implant on inappropriate region increases at risk of implant intrusion into the ITF,[24] and our results showed that the apex of the distal implant placed at Point  $B_{2}$ , Point  $B_{3}$ , Point  $C_{1}$ , Point  $C_{2}$ , and Point  $C_{3}$  occurred implant intrusion into the ITF. Therefore, to obtain the largest BICs while retaining the minimum incidence of intrusion into the ITF, Point  $A_{3}$  and Point  $B_{1}$  were the most promising points for the placement of quad zygomatic implants. This indicates that the postero-superior region and the center of zygoma were the optimal places for the apex of the mesial implant and the apex of the distal implant, respectively.

It is worthy to note that when the apex of the anterior implant was placed at Point  $A_3$ , the average lengths of the implant were  $55.68 \pm 3.41$  mm, which were beyond the lengths of the commercial zygomatic implants. Therefore, to obtain the largest BICs, it is suggested to produce longer zygomatic implants.

This study had advantages. This study recruited large sample size and measured the thicknesses and lengths of 300 zygomata on 150 patients. Compared to measuring on cadavers, linear measurements based on CBCT images is accurate, reliable $^{25-29}$  and repeatable without deforming or destroying the subjects. However, one of the main limitations was that the bone density of zygoma was not taken into account in this study. Moreover, the BICs were obtained by the virtually placed zygomatic implants on the computer using the planning software rather than by clinical practice.

# 5 | CONCLUSION

To obtain the largest BICs while avoiding the intrusion complications, results suggested that the postero-superior region (Point  $A_{3}$ ) and the center of zygoma (Point  $B_{1}$ ) were the optimal places for the placement of quad zygomatic implants.
