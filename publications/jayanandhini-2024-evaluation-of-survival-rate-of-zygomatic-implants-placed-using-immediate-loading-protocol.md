# Abstract

Background Zygoma implants are evidence-based surgical and prosthetic solutions for the rehabilitation of atrophic posterior maxilla with both classical two-stage and immediate loading protocols. Zygoma implants avoid grafting and sinus lift procedures and therefore contribute to a shorter and more comfortable treatment. The zygomatic bone is superior to that of the posterior maxilla in providing anchorage and the success of the zygomatic implant is due to Quad cortical stabilization. Immediate loading decreases the time of treatment and increases the acceptance of the treatment by the patient.

Aims and Objectives The purpose of the study is to evaluate the survival rate of immediately loaded zygomatic implants in severely atrophic maxilla based on clinical criteria.

Materials and Methods Five patients with completely edentulous atrophic posterior maxilla were included in the study. Nobel Biocare zygomatic implants were placed in the posterior region of completely edentulous atrophic maxilla and anterior conventional implants in selected subjects. The patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively and followed up for 12 months to assess clinical parameters like implant stability quotient, Lund-Mackay rhinosinusitis analysis, Ainamo and Bay gingival bleeding index, and evaluation of the position of the apical third of zygomatic implant.


Results The zygomatic implants and the anterior conventional implants were immediately loaded, and a survival rate of  $100\%$  was obtained in the current study. The mean ISQ achieved intraoperatively on the right and left side was  $68.80 \pm 4.14 \mathrm{~Hz}$  and  $65.6 \mathrm{~Hz}$ , respectively, which suggested good primary stability. Postoperatively after one-year follow-up, the mean ISQ on the right and left side was  $71.4 \pm 3.6 \mathrm{~Hz}$  and  $71.0 \pm 3.80 \mathrm{~Hz}$ , respectively, and this indicated good secondary stability.

Conclusion Completely edentulous atrophic maxilla rehabilitated with immediate loaded zygomatic implants in combination with anterior conventional implants revealed a survival rate of  $100\%$  in a one-year follow-up in the current study. There were no potential complications encountered during the follow-up period.

# Introduction

An atrophic edentulous maxilla is unique in its anatomical considerations, owing to the presence of the maxillary sinus. Since this limits the volume of the bone available for implant placement [1], severely atrophied maxilla presents a major challenge in rehabilitation, due to the complexity in terms of lack of height and width of the alveolar ridge secondary to extractions, trauma, infection, or maxillary sinus pneumatization [2].

The placement of the implant-supported prosthesis in cases with atrophic posterior maxilla with insufficient bone height is always a challenging task for surgeons. Hence, a multitude of surgical procedures was advocated to increase the bone height, which includes augmentation procedures such as crestal on-lay, inlay grafting to the maxillary antrum and nasal floor, and Lefort I osteotomy with interpositional grafting and sinus lift technique [3].


However, the above-mentioned techniques have their drawbacks such as donor site morbidity, invasive treatment, and prolonged duration [3]. Per Ingvar Branemark introduced zygomatic implants in 1998 as a "rescue implant concept" [1], which was a breakthrough in the field of implantology.

"Zygomatic fixtures" are different from commercial dental implants wherein they anchor into the zygomatic bone, rather than the "osseointegration" concept of conventional implants. It is used when maxillary bone quality and quantity are inadequate for the placement of conventional implants. Zygomatic implants were originally designed to treat the victims of trauma, tumor resection, and congenital defects [2]. Later the technique was refined, for its application in severely resorbed ridges, to restore proper function and esthetics [2]. Branemark studies have proved that the quality of zygomatic bone is similar to that of the anterior mandible, which is widely known to have a high success rate in terms of survival rate. The success of the zygomatic implant is attributed to "Quad-cortical" stabilization, wherein the implant body engages the four cortical bones, namely the maxillary palatal plate, maxillary sinus floor, maxillary sinus roof, and lateral cortex of the body of the zygomatic bone.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the survival rate of immediately loaded zygomatic implants, in prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with atrophic posterior maxilla.

# Materials and Methods

This prospective clinical case series included 5 patients with completely edentulous atrophic maxilla, within the age group of 40-60 years. Patients with acute sinusitis, heavy smokers, systemic diseases, or radiation therapy for head and neck region 12 months before the proposed study were excluded. The mean follow-up period was one year.


A complete systemic preoperative evaluation was done. Frontal, profile view (Fig. 1), and intraoral (Fig. 2) photographs were taken. Preoperative orthopantomograph (Fig. 3) were taken to evaluate the available bone in zones I, II, and III based on the "Bedrossian concept." A computed tomogram of  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  slice thickness was taken (Fig. 4). Digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) data was used to determine the implant dimensions of both zygomatic and conventional implants. Noble biocare™ Zygomatic implants were used. STL (Standard Triangulation Language) format was used to fabricate the skeletal model via

3D printing (Fig. 5). A "bone-supported surgical template" was used for visual control of the drilling protocol. Virtual planning for "angulations" of implants, its "apical exit" in the zygomatic bone, and its "palatal emergence" were precisely performed (Fig. 6).

Postoperatively, the position of the apical third of the zygomatic implant was assessed using the orthopantomograph, and rhinosinusitis was assessed using a computed tomogram of paranasal sinuses and ostiomeatal complex based on Lund-Mackay scoring (radiological staging). Implant stability quotient (ISQ) was determined using resonance frequency analysis (RFA), and bleeding on probing was evaluated based on Ainamo and Bay's "Gingival bleeding index."

# Surgical Protocol

The surgical management was under general anesthesia. A midcrestal incision was placed from tuberosity to tuberosity along with a vertical releasing incision at the posterior maxilla. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised, and subperiosteal dissection was carried out to expose the entire maxillary alveolar process, palatal bone, and anterior and lateral antral wall. Infraorbital nerve was identified and preserved. After ensuring the complete exposure and visualization of the infra-zygomatic crest, the base of the zygomatic bone, osteotomy sites were planned. The 3D-printed surgical template was secured to the exposed alveolar bone (Fig. 7). A 20:1 surgical handpiece with a maximum of 20,000 RPM was used for osteotomy. Sequential osteotomy was initiated with a  $2.9\mathrm{mm}$  twist drill, followed by a  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  pilot drill and a  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  twist drill. As in the classical extra sinus technique, drilling was made toward the zygomatic buttress along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, and the final twist drill was ensured to penetrate both the cortices of the zygomatic bone till its desired length. The osteotomy depth was measured using a depth gauge to determine the appropriate length of the implant (Fig. 8). A 45-degree angulated implant (Fig. 9) of appropriate length was placed using an implant carrier, and final tightening was done with a hand wrench. A screwdriver was used to check the orientation of the occlusal head of the implant. The same sequential osteotomy effected on the other side (Fig. 10).

Conventional implants were placed in the anterior maxilla after sequential osteotomy with  $2.4\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $3.1\mathrm{mm}$ , and  $3.5\mathrm{mm}$  drills. Immediately after implant placement implant stability [ISQ] was evaluated using an OSTELL Resonance frequency analyzer (Fig. 11). Since significant primary stability was achieved intraoperatively, an immediate loading protocol was

# Results

Five patients with the chief complaint of completely edentulous maxilla referred to the Department of Oral and

Maxillofacial Surgery were included in the study. Out of five cases, 4 patients were male, and 1 patient was female with a mean age of  $55.8 \pm 2.8$  years. Four patients had a completely edentulous maxilla and mandible, and one patient had a completely edentulous maxilla and partially edentulous mandible (Table 1). The mean follow-up period was 1 year.

The mean height of bone observed in zone I, zone II, and zone III was  $16.3 \pm 2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $6.56 \pm 0.94 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $3.08 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively. The mean width of bone observed in zone I, zone II, and zone III was  $5.42 \pm 0.8 \mathrm{~mm}$ ,  $4.22 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{~mm}$ , and  $2.60 \pm 0.3 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively (Tables 2, 3, Figs. 15 and 16). The qualitative one-way ANOVA test performed showed that the height and width of bone are different for each zone. (Height and width vary significantly between premaxilla, premolar, and molar regions.)

Bleeding on probing based on Ainamo and Bay index (1975) on the six surfaces around the zygomatic implants namely mesiobuccal, mid-buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, mid-lingual, and distolingual were compared at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. There was a considerable reduction of bleeding on probing after 12 months postoperatively (Tables 4, 5).

There was moderate pain in 4 cases during the first postoperative week. Postoperative edema was noted in 3 cases.

Nasal obstruction was evident in one case during the first postoperative week, gradually resolved within 6 months follow-up. There was no evidence of nasal bleeding or periorbital edema in any of the patients. In the current study, there was no sinusitis complication throughout the follow-up period, evaluated based on Lund-Mackay radiological scoring (Table 6). In one case, there was partial opacification of the right and left maxillary sinuses in the initial follow-up (LMS-2) gradually resolved after six months. The ISQ results obtained perceived mean intraoperative stability on the right-side zygomatic implant of about  $68 \pm 4.14\mathrm{~HZ}$  and for the left-side zygomatic implant about  $66.6 \pm 5.17\mathrm{~HZ}$  (Tables 7, 8, Fig. 17). After a follow-up period of 12 months, the mean zygomatic implant stability on the right side was  $71.4 \pm 3.6\mathrm{~HZ}$ , and on the left side, the zygomatic implant was  $71.0 \pm 3.8\mathrm{~HZ}$ .


# Discussion

Rehabilitation of the edentulous atrophic maxilla has evolved over the years. An atrophic edentulous maxilla is unique in its anatomic considerations, owing to the presence of maxillary sinus which consecutively limits the volume of available bone for implant placement [1].

The history of zygomatic implants dates back to 1998 when Per Ingvar Branemark introduced zygomatic implants for rehabilitation of severely atrophied maxilla. He was acknowledged as the "Father of dental implantology" [5]. The concept of a zygomatic fixture according to Branemark was "Quad-cortical [6] stabilization."

Bedrossian et al. recommended the treatment option based on the presence of bone in different zones of the maxilla: zone I—premaxilla, zone II—premolar, zone III—molar area [7]. Zygomatic implants are recommended when there is a bone in zone I only. In case of insufficient bone in all the zones, Quad-zygomatic implants would be desirable.

In the current study, the mean bone height in zone II and zone III was  $6.56 \pm 0.94 \mathrm{~mm}$  and  $3.08 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ , respectively. It was  $16.3 \pm 2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$  in zone I, and henceforth,

Uchida et al.'s [8] study on the measurement of maxilla and zygoma for facilitation of zygoma implant installation concluded that if the apical diameter of the implant is  $3.75\mathrm{mm}$ , then the thickness of the zygoma must be  $5.75\mathrm{mm}$  or more. In the current study, the mean zygomatic bone thickness at the exit was  $6.44 \pm 0.31\mathrm{mm}$  which was ideal for the success of zygomatic implants.

Nkenke et al. [9] utilized CT and histomorphometry to examine 30 human zygoma and reported that the zygomatic bone consists of trabecular bone, which was unfavorable for implant placement. However, the success rate of zygomatic implants was achieved by implant engaging the four cortical bones.

The original surgical technique developed by Branemark consists of Lefort I incision [10] and insertion of a 35-55-mm-long implant following an intrasinusal trajectory. Stella and Warner [11] presented the "Sinus slot technique," which improved the original technique in terms of implant orientation, elimination of sinus window, and thus the reduction of postoperative symptoms.

Aparicio et al. [12] proposed an extra sinus technique for patients with pronounced buccal concavities. The merit of the extra sinus or extra maxillary technique is that it avoids excessive palatal emergence of the implant head and precludes the incidence of sinusitis. Carlos Aparicio [13] proposed a classification system comprising five basic anatomic groups from ZAGA 0 to 4 [zygomatic anatomy-guided approach]. This classification helps the surgeons to refine the original technique by understanding the possibility of finding out inter-individual and intra-individual anatomical differences.

Edward B Sevetz [14] described the drilling orientation. If drilling is too far anterior, not much of the zygomatic bone will be available for osseointegration; on the other hand, if it is too posterior, infratemporal fossa containing important anatomical structures such as temporalis muscle, maxillary artery, and its branches and pterygoids plexuses may be encountered leading to complications.

Bedrossian et al. describe the proper "path of the axis" of implant placement, which is the one that extends from the premolar region through the maxillary sinus to the midpoint of the zygomatic body pointing toward "INCISURA" and achieving implant emergence  $1\mathrm{mm}$  at the zygomatic body.

A 45-degree angulated Ti-unite Noble Biocare implant was used with either zero degrees or 17-degree angulated multiunit abutment based on the emergence of the implant head. Immediately after the implant placement, the primary stability was evaluated using a "Resonance frequency analyzer," OSTELL. The mean intraoperative primary stability in our study was  $68.8 \pm 4.14\mathrm{Hz}$  and  $66.6 \pm 5.17\mathrm{Hz}$  for right- and left-sided implants, respectively, which indicated good primary stability and immediately loading protocol was followed, an interim prosthesis loaded within  $48\mathrm{h}$ .

Postoperatively, a paranasal sinus view and an orthopantograph were done to evaluate the zygomatic implant position and its apical emergence (Fig. 12). Later definite metal bar-reinforced prosthesis was replaced (Figs. 13, 14).

According to the literature review, the incidence of sinusitis after zygomatic implant placement was  $0 - 26.6\%$  [15, 16]. Aparicio et al. [17] reported sinusitis in  $9.09\%$  and  $45.4\%$  with signs of sinus opacification with intrasinus technique. He advocated the ZAGA method to maximize peri-implant mucosal seal and Schneiderian membrane preservation to lower the incidence of postoperative rhino sinusitis.

Antonio D Agostino et al. [15] reported that 52 maxillary sinuses had an LMS [Lund-Mackay] score of 0 and 23 patients have a score of 1 and 7 cases had a score of 2, a

In the current study, there were no sinusitis complications throughout the follow-up period, evaluated based on Lund-Mackay scoring. In one patient, there were partial opacification (LMS -2) and nasal obstruction clinically that subsequently resolved after six months.

Bedrossian et al. [18] reported a survival rate of  $100\%$  in 28 zygomatic and 65 regular implants in 14 patients, a one-year follow-up period. Penarrocha et al. [19] concluded a success rate of  $100\%$  in 121 patients where 40 zygomatic implants were placed and followed up for 29 months. Pi urgell [20] proclaimed a survival rate of  $96.04\%$  where 4 implants failed. Miglioranca et al. [21] and Davo et al. [22] summarized a survival rate of  $98\%$  after 12 months and 5 years of follow-up, respectively.

The usage of a fixed prosthesis to connect all the implants with adequate anteroposterior spread provided cross-arch stabilization and allows masticatory forces to get transmitted to the zygomatic bone. In our study, the mean secondary stability was  $71.4 \pm 3.6\mathrm{HZ}$  and  $71.0 \pm 3.80\mathrm{HZ}$  on the right and left sides, respectively, after 12 months.

Throughout our follow-up period, there were no anticipated complications. Virtual planning of the surgical procedure and determination of implant dimensions and angulations and use of 3D printing STL models of individual patients enhanced the surgical outcome precisely, being more accurate, less time-consuming, and high success rate.

# Conclusion

The zygomatic implants have enormously revolutionized the rehabilitation of completely edentulous atrophic posterior maxilla. Zygomatic implants are "graftless" solutions eliminating the need for bone grafting techniques and its associated donor site morbidity. The success of zygomatic implants is due to the primary stability achieved from the compact zygoma. Recent advances in virtual planning and 3D-printed STL models help with the precise placement of zygoma implants. Immediate loading protocol vastly improved the oral health quality of life index (OHQOL), by eliminating the "psychological trauma period" of edentulism as well as decreasing the treatment period. Completely edentulous atrophic maxilla rehabilitated with immediate loaded zygomatic implants in combination with anterior conventional implants showed a survival rate of  $100\%$  in a one-year follow-up in our current study. There were no major complications encountered during the follow-up period. To conclude our study, zygomatic implants are a viable rehabilitative option for the edentulous atrophic maxilla. However, large randomized clinical trials with a larger sample size are needed to assess the long-term clinical success of the zygomatic implants.
