# Learning Aims

1. The surgeon should be aware of the site classification of the osseous defect to be treated. Is the defect mild, moderate, or severe? Is the defect vertical, horizontal, and/or both?
2. The surgeon should be aware of the amount of augmentation required to satisfy prosthetic support, which has in recent years lessened with the success of shorter implants such as the 7- or 8-mm implant.
3. Guided bone regeneration remains the mainstay of treatment and can be done in conjunction with addition of small block grafts or biomimetics. GBR may be limited, however, for use in vertical height management.
4. The use of titanium mesh, alveolar osteotomies for interpositional bone grafting, iliac block grafting, or, rarely, alveolar distraction osteogenesis must be considered for treatment of extensive alveolar bone absence not amenable to GBR.

Edentulous or partially edentulous reconstruction of the mandible must be based on the dental restorative need [1]. If more teeth and more alveolar bone are missing, then the range of treatment options is more extensive. In general, specific sites require significant treatment variation, which can be categorized as follows:

Single missing teeth—incisors, cuspid-bicuspid, molar
Multiple missing teeth—two to six contiguous missing teeth, free end saddles, anterior saddle
Edentulous—immediate extraction and implant placement, modest resorption, marked resorption, extreme resorption

For each restorative location, there is a specific hard tissue finding, often not ideal, that must be addressed. But the desired implant treatment plan must first be decided on before hard tissue modification for functional osseointegration is deemed necessary [2]. The following treatment schemes are based on common treatment planning with an underlying philosophy efficient for the number of implants placed relative to the desired dental restoration and are based on the idea that the surgeon cannot solve all bone-deficient problems using only one method such as GBR. However, the desire for a minimally invasive procedure and the familiarity the surgeon has to a prescribed method impact the choice of treatment the surgeon might employ.

# 12.1 Single Missing Teeth

In the mandible, there are three basic single-tooth sites that entail completely different approaches to implant placement. The clinician should consider the use of min imal flaps, minimal bone grafting, and, sometimes, connective tissue grafting as indicated. The anterior incisor site, the cuspid-bicuspid site, and the molar site present with completely different problems related to implant fixation and bone augmentation requirements, particularly if attempted at the time of dental extraction.


# 12.1.1 Mandibular Incisor Sites

There is controversy in how to treat a single missing anterior incisor in the mandible [3]. Usually, there is minimal space for implant placement as well as reduced bone mass. If the surgeon accepts the dictum that at least  $1\mathrm{mm}$  of bone needs to be present circumferentially around the implant, a site must be  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter to house a  $3.0\mathrm{-mm}$  implant and  $5.5\mathrm{mm}$  for the most commonly used  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter implant [4]. The use of the  $2.0 - 2.5\mathrm{-mm}$  one-piece implants is also a consideration but has not been fully vetted in the literature [5]. In situations of oligodontia, the lower anterior incisors may not be present, and in this setting, the caudal alveolar process never fully forms [6]. This requires guided bone regeneration often requiring both lingual and facial mucoperiosteal flaps (  $\mathbb{O}$  Fig. 12.1).

Figure 12.2 demonstrates a missing lower central incisor tooth treated with a single implant, which encroaches upon the periodontal ligament space. When bone and space for implants is minimal, consideration should be given to conventional dentistry or a more aggressive approach of removal of adjacent incisors to make room for implants. Two missing teeth have also been treated with a single implant. Treatment plans that sometimes make more sense are three to four tooth bridges, often best accomplished at the time of dental extraction using guided bone regeneration (GBR) principles in a submerged treatment scheme. On occasion, a perfectly healthy adjacent tooth may be sacrificed in order for a sustainable restoration to become feasible using dental implants. The use of immediate loading in these settings should be cautioned against because early osseointegration may fail with minimal loading in such compromised sites. When one-piece implants are employed, care should be taken that deflective occlusal contacts are not present in anterior protrusive jaw movement.

A missing lower central incisor tooth entails placement of a single implant without encroaching on adjacent periodontal ligament space, which can put teeth at risk as well as decrease the chance for osseointegration of the implant [7]. For this reason, some practitioners have suggested the use of mini (2-2.5-mm-diameter) implants [5].

In general, the best time to place implants in the anterior incisor region is at the time of extraction, which is often a setting of full facial dehiscence best treated with
Fig. 12.1 a, b Anterior mandibular alveolar atrophy can present as a very thin alveolus, too deficient for implant treatment without bone grafting. c This area can sometimes be treated with narrow-diameter implant placement and guided bone regeneration (GBR) if

GBR and a staged technique. Connective tissue grafts can be placed as needed as part of the final implant restoration [8].

# 12.1.2 Canine-Bicuspid

The canine-bicuspid zone can often be treated with immediate implant placement at the time of dental extraction. When the socket defect is large, greater than  $3\mathrm{mm}$ , intrasocket grafting is advisable, though not entirely necessary for osseointegration. Intrasocket the implant can fixate into basal bone. d This can require bone grafting both lingual and facial with barrier membrane coverage. e Final implant healing follows usually with the requirement of a splinted restoration grafting will help maintain alveolar width, which otherwise will resorb centripetally, sometimes affecting osseous coverage on the facial surface of the implant [9]. This is especially true in the bicuspid zone, which can often be horizontally deficient.



For healed extraction sites, GBR can be used when there is a small dehiscence present at the time of implant placement. When the alveolus is narrow, alveolar split grafting can be done before or sometimes at the time of implant placement. Though split grafting is usually done with an open flap approach, the use of osteoperiosteal flaps such as the book flap (Fig. 12.3) provides another
Fig. 12.2 a One of the dilemmas for implant therapy is what to do with a single missing lower incisor. These sites often have minimal facial bone, mucogingival deficiency, and adjacent root proximity. b Atraumatic extraction with intrasocket grafting, keeping the implant away from the facial plate, is advisable. c Despite near-ideal placement, this 3-mm one-piece implant encroaches upon the periodontal ligament space
Fig. 12.3 a The canine-bicuspid zone in the mandible is often moderately horizontally deficient especially in healed sites. b Alveolar split grafting with immediate implant placement using a bone flap can establish  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of facial bone in front of a newly placed implant option for alveolar widening when there is sufficient width to do a split, usually  $4\mathrm{mm}$  minimum, such that  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of facial plate results from the splitting process [10]. When the alveolus is slanted, pyramidal in shape, it can be split using an open flap technique, left to heal for 4 weeks, and then split again using a closed wound osteoperiosteal flap approach with simultaneous implant insertion [11]. This technique, however, is usually reserved for segmental deficiencies and is not always possible or advisable in single-tooth sites (  $\square$  Fig. 12.4) [11].


# 12.1.3 Single-Molar Sites

The molar site in the mandible is generally not a good site for immediate placement of implants after tooth extraction unless large-diameter implants are placed (Fig. 12.5). Great care must be taken in avoiding the inferior alveolar nerve. A good rule of thumb is to stay 2, or even 3, mm superior to the nerve [12]. This then becomes the foundation point for implant placement and all associated grafting schemes in the posterior mandible.


One of the key issues of molar extraction sites is the presence of the buccal plate. When there is a substantial buccal plate of bone, the large-diameter implant can be placed, which should not remove or disturb the buccal plate as it is placed. This applies to the lingual plate as well. Large-diameter implants can then be placed with little or no bone grafting using relatively short lengths such as  $7.5 - 9.0\mathrm{mm}$  [13]. Care should be taken to over-torque the crestal bone when using large-diameter devices as late-term resorption may result. Large-diameter implants can often be immediately loaded. Alternatively, when  $4 - 6\mathrm{-mm}$  diameter implants are used in molar extraction sites, bone grafting and resorbable membranes are recommended in a staged protocol [14].

In healed molar sites for single teeth, often lateral or vertical osseous deficiency is present. Because most horizontal deficiency still allows plenty of osseous volume for placement of an implant, usually on the lingual side of the alveolar crest, GBR can be used to improve
Fig. 12.4 a When all of the anterior mandible incisors are missing, a common finding is a moderately narrow alveolus not amenable to implants without augmentation grafting. b If the site is  $4\mathrm{mm}$  in width, it can easily be split using an osteoperiosteal flap approach. c Long implants are placed simultaneously if they are able to engage fixation deep to the split site, which usually out-fractures at about a  $10\mathrm{-mm}$  depth. d One and one half years later, a two-tooth restoration on two implants appears well integrated with good vertical maintenance of alveolar bone the osseous contour as needed to develop alveolar form and is not necessarily needed to gain osseointegration.


Block describes a subperiosteal tunneling method using an anterior vertical incision for access to place (inject) particulate xenograft posteriorly to widen the alveolus laterally. This semi-closed-wound approach, once healed after 4 months, allows for transgingival placement of a molar implant centrally in the edentulous space, both surgeries being relatively minimally invasive.

When the alveolus is extremely thin or vertically deficient and more than  $4 - 5\mathrm{mm}$  deficient, vertical augmentation is recommended using block graft-added particulate GBR, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) titanium mesh grafting, or perhaps a small sandwich osteotomy interpositional graft (Fig. 12.6) can be done. Of these approaches, the sandwich graft is the simplest, easily gaining  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of vertical height with little morbidity but may be a technical challenge for such a small segment [15].

# 12.2 Segmental Mandibular Defects

In general, mandibular defects in partially edentulous patients present as either anterior or posterior saddle defects. In partially edentulous states, the anterior teeth may be lost, often due to trauma, or conversely, the posterior segment may be edentulous from periodontal loss with retained anterior dentition. As contiguous teeth are lost, segmental resorption commonly develops, leading to combined vertical and horizontal deficiency. Bone augmentation solutions then take on certain patterns of treatment based on the extent of bone loss.


# 12.2.1 Anterior Segmental

The extent of bone deficiency can be categorized as mild, in which GBR procedures are suggested; moderate, treated by block grafting, interpositional techniques, or titanium mesh procedures; or severe lesions, treated by iliac corticocancellous block grafts or larger titanium mesh procedures often using morphogens (Fig. 12.7). Distraction osteogenesis is especially helpful in vertical defects of the anterior mandible. In complete loss, continuity defect treatment may proceed with reanastomosis of free fibula grafts, iliac bone source grafting, or BMP-2 mesh procedures depending on the length of the discontinuity.

The most common anterior mandibular lesions, however, are the moderate to severe lesions due to trauma or periodontal loss. Once the vertical loss reaches  $5\mathrm{mm}$ , one method to easily treat this lesion, even up to  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of deficiency, is the sandwich osteotomy bone graft. This procedure will take care of the vast majority of vertical osseous deficiency states not amenable to simple GBR.  $\square$  Figure 12.8 shows a surgical series demonstrating interpositional grafting with an "alveolar lift" of  $4\mathrm{mm}$  with a segmental internal alveolar split to widen a narrow alveolus.

Fig. 12.6 a The posterior mandible that is both vertically and horizontally deficient can often be treated by an "alveolar lift" osteotomy procedure. b By elevating the segment above the alveolar plane, subsequent flap exposure for implant placement 4 months later can reduce a thin residual ridge and place an implant with either little or no further grafting. c Final implant restoration with a wider alveolus at the appropriate alveolar plane was placed (in two layers) with particulate overgrafting. d 6 months later, the graft appeared to be consolidated. e A connective tissue graft helped establish keratinization. f Exposure of the site reveals a well-healed graft with one relatively small defect. g Implants were placed with high insertion torque and good stability inadequate height can often "transport" the wider part of the alveolus crestally. Excess vertical height, after healing, is then reduced at the time of implant placement. Access to the osteotomy is made through the vestibule with the lateral osteotomy being made using piezosurgery superficially and deep with a sagittal saw. Inlay material is used to fill the gap, and a bone plate is used to reposition the segment facially as the segment tends to displace lingually using a sandwich technique [15].

The floor of the mouth mucosa extends to the buccal mucosa. b An osteotomy segment is elevated  $2\mathrm{cm}$  using a sandwich osteotomy from a vestibular incision. c A  $15\mathrm{-mm}$  interpositional iliac bone graft


Newer methods of GBR for vertical defects combine block grafting and GBR and sometimes biomimetics in an effort aimed at gaining both width and height to the alveolus. When successful, ridge definition can be better than the osteotomy approach alone, which almost always requires secondary grafting at the time of implant placement.

One variation of the sandwich technique is the internal alveolar split osteotomy used to gain both height and width of the alveolus, but there must be substantial transport width available for dividing the alveolus, which is not often the case [16] (Fig. 12.9).

When the site is  $10\mathrm{mm}$  or more deficient, the use of alveolar vertical distraction should be considered [17] (Fig. 12.10).

# 12.2.2 Mandibular Posterior Segment

The free end saddle is often accompanied by six to eight sound anterior teeth such that removal of the anterior teeth to perform a full-arch fixed hybrid restoration is contraindicated. These sites often have marked atrophy
Fig. 12.8 a, b The anterior edentulous zone can present with marked alveolar width deficiency and as a retrodisplaced alveolar process. c, d Despite adequate height, a sandwich osteotomy used to lift the segment vertically then internally split can not only improve segment anteroposterior position but improve alveolar width. e
Overall segment bone mass for implants are enhanced. f-h Implants are placed in conjunction with bone grafting. i-k 1 year later, implants and the final restoration appears well healed and functioning with short incisor crowns, sometimes difficult to achieve with traditional grafting methods such as GBR with close inferior alveolar nerve approximation. These sites are most often treated with block bone grafting, but iliac or mandibular block source bone resorbs at a high rate in this location so the graft should be overbuilt to take this into account [18]. The development of unique GBR strategies is still frequently being done using high-profile internal structure supports, such as small allograft or autograft blocks, tenting screws, or even high-profile implants with particulate graft [19]. One technique to consider is the "bone-wedge technique," in which small autogenous wedges of bone are inserted into basal bone grooves in high profile and then grafted between and covered by a barrier membrane (Fig. 12.11). If there is sufficient room above the nerve, the posterior edentulous segment is also well suited for the sandwich osteotomy done curved in a smile shape, creating a small chamber for interpositional grafting, most recently done with mortised equine blocks (Fig. 12.12).

# 12.3 Full Arch

Controversy continues regarding full-arch reconstruction. Early use of iliac block grafting to reconstruct jaw bone height, sometimes done in conjunction with implant placement, has become an infrequently done procedure, even though these procedures have passed the test of time [20, 21] (Fig. 12.13). The use of short implants that perforate the inferior border of the mandible or implants done without any grafting for fixed hybrid bridges confound conventional wisdom often undergoing appositional growth of bone mass at both the inferior and the superior borders of the mandible. This suggests that there may be a limited need for bone grafting at all in most settings for the edentulous mandible [22] (Fig. 12.14). The use of the V-4 or V-3 technique is an example of the use of only three or four implants placed in mandibles as vertically deficient as  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of height when immediate functional loading is done [22]. Total edentulous jaw distraction [23] (Fig. 12.15), tent pole iliac grafting from the inferior approach, and nerve transposition to improve implant positioning for anteroposterior spread (Fig. 12.16) are rarely advocated alternatives [24]. When the mandible is in discontinuity due to ablation, free fibula grafts and/or iliac grafting and—now recently BMP-2—allograft ribs used as confining cribs have been used successfully.


# 12.3.1 Discussion

The surgeon's philosophical template for lower jaw bone reconstruction with dental implants is continuing to undergo a significant change in thinking now recently directed toward minimally invasive surgery. Because harvesting of intraoral or extraoral autogenous bone constitutes a certain amount of morbidity, the use of alternative bone graft materials and/or biomimetics, such as BMP-2, remains desirable. Though the use of xenograft and allograft products, even in conjunction with the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP, PRF) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), has not been shown to be as successful at forming de novo bone at one edge. f, g The wedges are tapped into the scored sites and grafted and covered with a membrane. h, i Implants are placed 4 months later into a maintained vertical dimension

Several studies have now evaluated the use of BMP-2 in various treatment strategies in both animal and clinical settings. Wikesjo and associates [26-29] showed that BMP, when placed under a confining membrane around high-profile implants, consistently made bone in a canine model. Also, using a calcium phosphate cement
Fig. 12.13 A 20-year result of vertical iliac block graft placed in both arches with implants placed 6 months later shows stable bone and secure implants with areas of actual bone gain found in the mandible impregnated with BMP-2 without a barrier once again showed bone formation in supra-alveolar implants, this time with greater bone density [29]. In a similar canine model, Sigurdsson and coworkers [30] showed that there was no difference in osseointegration content (55%) in BMP or native bone. Importantly, Javonovic and colleagues [31] showed that high-profile implants grafted with BMP in a canine then restored and left in function for 12 months maintained bone around the implants with no discernable difference between native and BMP-2-induced bone (Fig. 12.17).


These animal research findings are basically a recapitulation of canine studies using iliac bone or allogeneic bone with and without membranes over high-profile implants done in 1990 [21, 32] (Fig. 12.18). There is a proof of principle here that cannot be denied without having to resort to the tibia or ilium for graft material. The oral maxillofacial surgeon must continue to investigate and validate clinically the appropriate system for implant fixation, regenerative grafting, and morphologic space maintenance that is suggested by this preclinical (Fig. 12.19) and clinical research [33, 34] (Fig. 12.20).

# Summary

The reconstruction of the mandible must be addressed with a technique that matches the extent of the defect present. But implant placement is determined by the overall restorative plan. Current restorative treatment plans have become more efficient for number of implants placed, often allowing the surgeon to avoid compromised locations, thereby obviating the need for extensive bone graft reconstruction. Care should be taken to design appropriate therapy according to the age of the patient. Elderly patients are contraindicated for extensive reconstruction and should be considered instead for the simple two-implant overdenture or three-to four-implant fixed denture approach [22]. Bone morphogenetic grafting is no longer a dream of the future and is beginning to supplement common grafting practices for clinical mandibular reconstruction.
