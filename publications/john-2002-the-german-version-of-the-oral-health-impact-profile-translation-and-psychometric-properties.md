The need for cross-culturally adapted oral-health specific health outcome measures is increasingly recognized in Germany. Following accepted cultural adaptation technique guidelines, we report the development of the German version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP). The original 49 items were translated using a forward-backward method. A de novo development of German items established content validity. A priori hypothesized associations between the OHIP summary score and self-reported oral health and five oral disorders were confirmed in a random sample of the general population ( $n = 163$ , age  $20 - 60$  yr). These associations were interpreted as support for construct validity. The instrument's responsiveness, as indicated by a mean OHIP summary score change from 45.0 to 28.3, was established in 67 consecutive patients treated for temporomandibular disorder pain (age  $19 - 85$  yr;  $72\%$  women). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated by intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.63-0.92 for dimensions and summary scores (convenience sample,  $n = 30$ , age  $18 - 85$  yr;  $53\%$  women). Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's  $\alpha > 0.74$ ). Sufficient discriminative and evaluative psychometric properties of the Oral Health Impact Profile German version (OHIP-G) make the instrument suitable for assessment of oral health-related quality of life in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies.

The impact of oral disorders and interventions on patients' perceived oral health state and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is increasingly recognized as an important component of health (1). Subjective indicators used to measure OHRQoL can be of benefit in evaluating oral health for political, theoretical and practical purposes (2). Such measures of patients' perceived oral health are increasingly in demand for epidemiological and clinical studies in Germany (3) because they add a complementary outcome dimension to the traditional use of clinical oral disease indicators. Although well-tested and standardized assessment instruments for measuring OHRQoL are available in the Anglo-American literature, such instruments do not exist in Germany.

The English-language Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) (4), originally developed in Australia, is an intensively used instrument. It consists of 49 items which are grouped into seven domains based on a conceptual model of oral health that uses the framework of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (5). A short version of the instrument has also been developed (6). The OHIP questionnaire has well-documented psychometric properties (4). In cross-sectional studies, it has been used in the general population (7) as well as in patients with specific oral disorders such as temporomandibular disorders and orofacial pain (8). In addition, the OHIP has been used in longitudinal studies (9) and its sensitivity to change has been demonstrated in clinical trials (10). These characteristics suggest that a German-language version of the OHIP questionnaire would be valuable. However, a thorough translation of the OHIP into German would not necessarily ensure applicability across nations because of cultural diversity. Guidelines for cross-cultural validation of health-related quality of life measures have been developed (11). In addition, psychometric testing of the translated instrument in the new cultural context (cross-cultural adaptation) is recommended (12).


This article presents the translation and the psychometric testing of the German version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-G).

# Material and Methods

The German version of the OHIP was developed in two steps using 516 subjects from six independent samples (Table 1). First, the instrument was translated into German using state-of-the-art cultural adaptation techniques (11). The second step involved the assessment of validity, reliability, responsiveness, preference weights, and appropriate recall periods for the OHIP-G.

# The Oral Health Impact Profile

The English-language Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-E) has 49 items which are grouped into seven subscales. For each of the 49 OHIP questions, subjects are asked how frequently they have experienced the impact. Responses are made on a Likert-type scale  $0 =$  never,  $1 =$  hardly ever,  $2 =$  occasionally,  $3 =$  fairly often,  $4 =$  very often).

# Translation and back-translation of the English-language Oral Health Impact Profile

A forward translation was first performed by D. Fink, Institute of German Dentists (Cologne, Germany), a native German speaker with an excellent knowledge of English. This translation was evaluated by five German dentists from the Department of Prosthodontics, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany, who revised this translation. This version was then revised by a native speaker from the USA. Two other German dentists and a professional translator then back-translated the questionnaire. The finalized German version was pilot-tested in the Department of Prosthodontics, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany, and then reviewed by two German dentists. The final OHIP-G (Appendix) was changed accordingly after reviewing the results of the de novo development (described below).

# Content validity - de novo development of the OHIP

The content of the OHIP-G was further tested by a 'de-novo' development of the questionnaire according to the methodology used for the OHIP-E. Subjects in sample A (Table 1) were asked in a personal interview to report 'any experiences with dental and oral disorders and their dentures' they had ever experienced in their lives. The recorded answers were reduced to a smaller representative collection of statements each containing a description of a single event associated with dental and oral disorders. This reduction involved an analysis of the form and content of the individual statement into common themes. The content of the resulting German items was compared with the translated German OHIP and the English-language original.

# Construct (convergent and groups) validity

Two types of construct validity (13) were investigated. Convergent validity describes how closely a measure is related to other measures of the same construct and to which it should be related. A similar concept is groups validity, where two groups of subjects, one of which has the trait and the other does not (or has it to a lesser degree), score differently on the new instrument.

Convergent validity was evaluated by examining the association between self-reported oral health (very good, good, fair, poor) and two OHIP-G summary scores: the number of items reported occasionally, often or very often, and the sum of all 49 item responses (OHIP-G49). Although the OHIP-G49 is an ordinal score, it was considered quasi-interval for the purposes of our analyses (14). Groups validity was assessed by dividing sample B (Table 1) according to several self-reported oral conditions with predicted impact on OHRQoL. We predicted that subjects with no temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain, no burning mouth sensations, less frequently reported bad breath, and better self-reported oral health would have lower OHIP-G49 scores compared with subjects that did not have these conditions. In addition, it was hypothesized that self-report of joint clicking or oral habits (defined as biting on nails, tongue, lip, cheek or objects) would not be notably associated with oral health-related quality of life.


Spearman rank correlations were calculated to examine the association between global rating of oral health or frequency of halitosis and the OHIP-G49. Point-biserial correlations which examine the relationship between a dichotomous and a continuous variable (15) were calculated to examine the association between TMD pain, self-reported joint clicking, oral habits and the OHIP-G49.

The ability of the OHIP-G49 to discriminate between subjects in the general population (sample B, Table 1) and clinical TMD patients (20-60 yr old, sample C baseline data, Table 1) was evaluated. A logistic regression model estimated the probability of being a TMD patient as a function of the OHIP-G49 when adjusted for age and gender to control for confounding.

# Responsiveness

Patients treated for temporomandibular disorder pain (sample C, Table 1) were chosen for the assessment of the instrument's responsiveness. Based on the close relationship between pain and quality of life (16) we hypothesized that OHRQoL would improve over a 1-month treatment period. The difference in OHIP-G49 between baseline and follow up was tested using the paired  $t$ -test. The effect size was calculated as

Mean baseline OHIP-G49 - follow up OHIP-G49 standard deviation of baseline OHIP-G49


according to Allen et al. (10).

# Reliability

Test-retest reliability was assessed in sample D (Table 1) using a time-interval of  $2\mathrm{wk}$  between the administration of the two questionnaires. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for OHIP-subscales proposed in the original publication and for the OHIP-G49. Calculations were performed according to SHROUT & FLEISS's ICC type 2,1 (17). The method of BLAND & ALTMAN (18) was used to compute 'limits of agreement' around the mean difference. Internal consistency was measured in sample B (Table 1) using CRONBACH's  $\alpha$  (19) and inter-item correlation for the OHIP subscales proposed in the OHIP-E publication (4).

# Construction of item weights

Item weights reflecting the relative importance of each statement were obtained using a paired comparison technique (20). The same procedures as in the OHIP-E publication (4) were applied to derive item weights in subjects from sample E (Table 1).

# Recall period

We evaluated three recall period options: lifetime experience, 1-yr recall, and 1-month recall in sample F (Table 1). Two OHIP-Gs were administered at the same time referring to different time periods in three groups (1 month vs. 1 yr, 1 month vs. lifetime and 1 yr vs. lifetime prevalence). Subjects first reported the frequency of oral problems for the shorter time interval and immediately after that for the longer interval before proceeding to the next OHIP question. The ICCs (17) were calculated and BLAND & ALTMAN's method (18) was used to compare the two questionnaires. Internal consistency for all six OHIPs was measured using Cronbach's  $\alpha$  (19).


# Completeness of the German-version OHIP - burden of the instrument

The burden of the instrument was assessed in sample F of Table 1 using the first of the two administered instruments. The questionnaire was self-administered with no supervision, that is, the subjects completed the questionnaire without the possibility of asking for any help or having their questionnaires checked upon completion. The number of missing items was calculated.

# Missing data

Missing data would compromise the calculation of the OHIP-G49. Three subjects with more than five missing items ( $>10\%$  of the 49 items) or more than two missing items in one of the seven OHIP dimensions were discarded. Remaining missing answers ( $<1\%$ ) were imputed using regression imputation within the particular OHIP-E dimension.

# Results

# Content validity - de novo development

Asking about 'any experiences with dental and oral disorders and their dentures' elicited 350 answers, which could be reduced to 53 items. All but one of the original English-language items were found in our investigation. This item was 'digestion has worsened because of problems with the teeth, mouth or denture'. Four additional items were found, two of which have been recommended by MURRAY et al. (8) ('taking longer to complete a meal' and 'avoiding eating with others') and the two other items were 'embarrassing joint noises'/ear ringing' and 'dry mouth'.

Additional items were expressed by TMD patients. Such items were 'pain in the joint', 'pain in the jaw muscles' which may have a counterpart in the OHIP-E ('painful aching in the mouth'). 'Difficulties in opening the mouth wide' in the OHIP-G might be covered by 'difficulties chewing any food' or 'unable to eat with the dentures' or other functional limitations questions or physical disability questions in the OHIP-E. Therefore, they were not considered additional unique items.

# Construct validity

All observed associations between self-reported oral health or self-reported oral conditions and OHRQoL followed the predicted direction (Table 2). Self-rating of oral health and three conditions with hypothesized effects on oral health-related quality of life were very highly statistically significantly correlated with the OHIP-G49 (self-reported oral health:  $r_{\mathrm{Spearman}} = 0.56$

frequency of halitosis:  $r_{\text{Spearman}} = 0.38$ ; TMD pain last month:  $r_{\text{point-biserial}} = 0.31$ . For self-reported joint clicking and oral habits, where no effects on OHRQoL were anticipated, clinically relevant and statistically significant associations with the OHIP-G49 were not observed ( $r_{\text{point-biserial}} = 0.09$  for clicking;  $r_{\text{point-biserial}} = 0.11$  for oral habits). No correlation coefficient was calculated for burning mouth sensations because only two subjects reported positive sensations.

Differentiating between TMD patients and subjects from the general population: Classifying subjects with a predicted probability of  $\geq 0.5$  by the logistic regression model as TMD patients resulted in a sensitivity of  $34\%$  and a specificity of  $94\%$  in a sample of 56 TMD patients and 163 subjects from the general population. Overall,  $79\%$  of all subjects were correctly classified. The OHIP-G49 was able to discriminate between TMD patients and subjects from the general population indicated by an odds ratio of 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.06,  $P < 0.001$ ). Thus, the odds in favor of being a TMD patient increased significantly by an estimated  $5\%$  for each additional unit of the OHIP-G49, adjusted for age and gender.


# Responsiveness

The mean OHIP-G49 changed from  $45.0 \pm 30.9$  to  $28.3 \pm 23.3$  among TMD patients during the 1-month treatment period. The mean change score of 16.7 (95% CI 10.9-22.6) was very highly statistically significant.

# Reliability

The median ICC for the seven OHIP-E subscales was 0.83 (range 0.63-0.92; Table 3). A statistically significant improvement of OHRQoL was observed for the OHIP-G49 and for the subscale 'physical pain'. Limits of agreement indicating the interval where  $95\%$  of the test-retest differences are located presented considerable variability for the subscales and the OHIP-G49.

Internal consistency (Cronbach's  $\alpha$ ) of the OHIP-G49 and OHIP dimensions ranged between 0.74 and 0.96 (Table 4). Average inter-item correlation was between 0.24 and 0.54.

All results from test-retest reliability and internal consistency analyses were consistent with each other.

# Construction of item weights

German item weights ranged between 0.69 and 2.39. This range was slightly larger than the English-language weights (1.11-2.18). The slope of the function relating English-language weights to German weights was 0.76 (95% CI 0.36-1.15). The intercept was 0.4 (95% CI -0.25-1.05). Confidence intervals around slope and intercept included a value for the slope of 1 and a value for the intercept of 0, demonstrating that the relative ranking of items by the German- and English-language subjects were compatible. Although German- and English-language weights were correlated  $(r = 0.49$ ,

$P < 0.001$ , the limit of agreement of 0.61 indicated notable differences in values of individual weights between the two measures.

Applying the weights in the OHIP summary score calculation of sample B (Table 1) resulted in a very high correlation  $(r_{\mathrm{Spearman}} > 0.99)$  between the simple sum of item responses and the weighted sum of the item responses. The strong correlation between the two OHIP-G49s suggests that both summary scores were exchangeable. Therefore, the simpler score, the sum of all 49 unweighted items, was preferred.

# Recall period

Among the three recall period comparisons, the comparison of mean OHIP-G49 using 1-month recall and 1-yr recall had the highest ICC and the narrowest limits of agreement. Mean scores for 1-month recall and 1-yr recall did not differ significantly (Table 5). On average, subjects reported 1.2 units of the OHIP-G49 more when asked about problems in the last year compared with problems in the past month. This suggested that individual's answers referring to these recall periods were similar, on average, although considerable differences were noted with limits of agreement in the range -9.2 to 11.6 OHIP-G49 units. Questions concerning lifetime experience of OHIP-G49 indicated a less impaired OHRQoL than the 1-month recall (mean difference -5.7;  $95\%$  CI -0.5 to -10.8). No difference was observed between 1-yr and lifetime. However, the ICC was moderate and the limits of agreement indicated a wide range of differences. Internal consistency measured by Cronbach's  $\alpha$  ( $\geq 0.90$ ) was high for all three recall periods administered twice. The highest internal consistency was reached by the OHIP-G referring to the recall period of the last month (0.92/0.96).


# Completeness of the German-version OHIP - Burden of the instrument

Two subjects (1.5% out of 136) had more than 20 missing items, which might severely compromise the interpretation of the OHIP-G. They were considered complete non-responders. Another subject did not fulfill the criteria of having five or less missing items in total or more than two missing items in one dimension, which would probably compromise the calculation of OHIP-G49 or dimension scores. Therefore, for 98% of the subjects, the OHIP-G49 and dimension scores could be calculated. Most subjects filled the questionnaire in 8–12 min.

# Discussion

When used as a self-completed questionnaire among a variety of patient- and population samples, the German version of the Oral Health Impact Profile was found to be a valid and reliable instrument with psychometric properties similar to the English-language original. The OHIP-G has sufficient discriminative and evaluative psychometric properties. Therefore, it is suitable for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies.

To adapt the OHIP cross-culturally, we followed a 5-step procedure recommended by GUILLEMIN et al. (11), with only minor modification. For example, the guidelines suggested a multidisciplinary review committee whereas only two dentists formed our committee to review the translated version. Bilingual people recommended to participate in such adaptation studies (12) were in short supply in our study. We used only one person – the native US-speaker currently at the Institute of English and American language and literature at the University of Halle as a bilingual person. We did not encounter notable difficulties in this translation and adaptation process.

It was a strength of our adaptation process that the final translation result could be compared with the de novo development of OHIP-items. This ensured cross-cultural equivalence because our de novo development of the OHIP presented the same content of the German version when compared with the English original. According to GUILLEMIN et al. (11), important components of equivalence in cross-cultural validation

HERDMAN et al. (21) introduced the concept of functional equivalence, which is 'the extent to which an instrument does what it is supposed to do equally well in two or more cultures'. The combination of de novo development of the OHIP-G and the translation process of the OHIP-E ensured this. Although more refined translation processes exist (22), i.e. by using quality ratings of translation and sophisticated statistical analyses, our translation process ensured at least minimal criteria according to other published requirements for a successful adaptation process (23). There is evidence that combining elements from 'resource intensive' and 'resource-saving' strategies (24) in a moderately resource-intensive translation is able to produce adequate results (25). We consider our approach as falling into that category.


Not unexpectedly, our findings differed from the OHIP-E in only a few specific respects. In our de novo development, we were able to find three statements about handicap which were added to the OHIP-E from another instrument. While dental patient samples were used for development of both the OHIP-E and OHIP-G, underlying differences in the patient populations might be responsible for slight differences in wording and the identification of additional mostly TMD-related items in the German version.

Construct validity of the OHIP-G was similar to that of the OHIP-E, which is well established (4). Here, an expected association between social impact and perceived need to visit a dentist was found and differences between dentate and edentulous subjects were demonstrated. Relationships between OHRQoL and site of last dental visit (private dentist, public clinic), perceived need for dental treatment, financial hardship, number of missing anterior teeth, number of missing unreplaced anterior teeth, number of teeth with attrition, number of reported medical conditions, and age were demonstrated (6).

Our study also demonstrated responsiveness of the OHIP-G49 to treatment - a property that is considered by some to be an additional aspect of validity and not a distinct psychometric property in addition to reliability and validity (26). We observed an effect size of 0.54 in patients with TMD pain, a result that is almost identical to the report of an effect size of 0.5 (2) for patients referred to a craniofacial pain unit.

Our weight assignment results are consistent with findings reported by ALLISON et al. (27) who found that item weights generated by an Australian sample showed a similar ranking when compared with those generated by a sample of English-speaking Canadians and a sample of French-speaking Canadians, although the weight magnitudes were quite different. This may be an indication of little cultural variation of the construct OHRQoL as measured by OHIP. Nonetheless, hoped-for improve ments in measurement properties by using item weights in cross-sectional or longitudinal studies have not been demonstrated for the OHIP (10,28). Based on our findings and literature results, we do not recommend weighting of OHIP-G items for most purposes.


Findings from the Sickness Impact Profile - a general health status measure (29) - support a remarkable stability of health status values across cultures. A study in head and neck cancer patients using a HRQoL instrument that was developed for multinational trials suggested that the cultural background did not substantially influence the majority of HRQoL domains (30). It was hypothesized that the role of cultural background may depend upon the instrument and subject group studied. Based on our study, the OHIP seems to be an instrument well-suited for multinational research because of a lack of substantial differences in the cross-cultural concepts of OHRQoL.

The original OHIP-E publication specified that all 49 questions should refer to a fixed time-period, but did not recommend a specific one. We found that a 1-month recall period for the OHIP-G had the highest internal consistency, although no substantial differences among the three different recall periods were observed. The single statistically significant difference in mean OHIP-G49 scores was observed when 1-month and lifetime recall periods were compared. At first, it may seem paradoxical that higher scores were found for the 1-month recall period compared with the lifetime recall period. The finding may indicate that, as people age, they experience a higher rate of impacts from chronic oral conditions that have worsened over time. Hence, they may report impacts occurring 'very often' during the last month compared with 'occasionally' over their lifetime, reflecting the lower average rate of impacts occurring throughout their lives. However this interpretation is speculative. The response format for the OHIP asks 'how often have you had the following problems during the last ...', relying on subjects to make their own subjective evaluation of frequency. It is not known whether subjects think in terms of the absolute number of impacts or an average rate of impacts. For example, some may regard 12 episodes of pain as 'very often', whether or not they all occurred within the previous month; others may consider 12 episodes of pain within the previous year to be equivalent to one episode of pain within the previous month. Finally, it is possible that there is a response bias, in which respondents forget about impacts experienced earlier in life, causing them to underestimate their true lifetime level of impact. Regardless of these speculated effects, it was encouraging to observe no statistically and clinically significant difference between 1-month and 1-yr recall (the two recall periods reported most frequently in the literature). The similarity of the 1-month and 1-yr results may reflect a tendency for subjects to use their recent impression about OHRQoL and extrapolate to the 1-yr period. Although we did not have data available comparing OHIP-G validity when different recall periods were used, from a theoretical point of view, a short recall period is preferred because memory is expected to be more accurate over shorter periods. Hence, for the samples studied here, we recommend using the 1-month period because it accomplished both aims, namely to capture the present status and to give a most accurate impression about perceived oral health.


Estimates for test-retest reliability of the OHIP-G were better than for the English-language original (ICC 0.42-0.77) (4). Differences in the populations studied might contribute to these differences. More importantly, we restricted the time between the administration of the questionnaires to  $2\mathrm{wk}$ , whereas the English-language version presented an interval of 3 months.

A different aspect of reliability is the homogeneity of the items. It is recommended that items should correlate with the total score above 0.20 (31). This was the case for OHIP-G items. Coefficient  $\alpha$  should be between 0.70 and 0.90 (32). All German subscales reached this level. Our results were slightly better than the English-language original (Cronbach's  $\alpha$  0.37-0.83) (4).

The burden for the subjects was usually acceptable with the self-administered questionnaire. The rejection rate and the number of missing items was very low, which corroborates findings with the OHIP-E (6). The general impression of a low burden and high acceptability of the instrument is supported by the use of the OHIP-G in clinical interviews and as a self-administered questionnaire (with and without supervision and control) (33).

Although the OHIP-G has many advantages, it might characterize only one aspect of OHRQoL. Other instruments exist, especially in the English literature, which describe possibly different OHRQoL aspects. This situation is not unique for oral health. Two well-known general health status measures, the SF-36 (34) and the WHOQOL instrument (35) differ substantially in the conceptual breadth claimed. In a situation where no unanimously agreed-upon definition of quality of life exists (36), other internationally accepted instruments warrant a cross-cultural adaptation to enrich the concept of oral health-related quality of life in Germany. However, based on the widespread international use of the OHIP-E we expect that the German counterpart will be a well-accepted instrument for clinical trials and health surveys.
