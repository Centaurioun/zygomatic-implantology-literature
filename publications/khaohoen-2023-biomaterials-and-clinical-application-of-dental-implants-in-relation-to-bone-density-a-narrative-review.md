# 39.2 Preoperative Considerations

For the definition of the osteotomy lines we start from the assumption that the maxillary sinuses must be avoided in order to avoid oro-antral communications; therefore, the shape and size of the sinus cavities represents the height limit of osteotomies. In this case, the sinus cavities, very close to the alveolar ridge, limited the height of the osteotomies in the posterior areas. We first hypothesized two osteotomies oriented on different planes, the posterior one approximately horizontal and the anterior one on an angled plane to get a higher cut of the bone (Fig. 39.6a-c). The two osteotomies, however, would have created an angle in the premolar area that we considered undesirable (Fig. 39.6b). Therefore, we preferred a horizontal osteotomy in the same plane which would have largely, but not completely, eliminated the knife-edge ridge (Fig. 39.7a, b). The osteotomy lines were drawn with a software (Mimics Innovation Suite, Materialize, Heverlee, Belgium), leaving a minimum of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  of bone below the maxillary sinuses. To guide the vertical osteotomy we designed the Vertical Osteotomy Guide (VOG) (Geomagic Freeform Plus, 3D systems GmbH, USA) (Fig. 39.8a-e) and the Horizontal Osteotomy Guide (HOG) (Fig. 39.9a-d) for the horizontal remodeling. The two cutting guides can be fixed with osteosynthesis screws. The holes for the fixation of the second guide are the same as the first one. This allows to verify the correct execution of the first osteotomy through the positioning of the second guide. A 3D rendering with the diagram of the position and length of the screws is always provided to the surgeon (Fig. 39.10a, b). The AMSJI implant is then designed considering the osteotomies to be executed. For the fixation of the implant to the maxillary bone, a diagram is provided for the location and length of the osteosynthesis screws (Fig. 39.11).

Fig. 39.6 The osteotomies were designed using a software (Mimics Innovation Suite, Materialize, Heverlee, Belgium). We initially hypothesized two osteotomies on different planes to eliminate a greater amount of "knifeblade" bone from the anterior area, reaching the nasal spine (a). However, the two cuts would have created an angle between them in the premolar area (b). They would have been angled to each other because of the prominence of the sinus cavities, which shall not be involved in the bone cuts. We found this angle undesirable from the perspective of the design of the AMSJI. Air cavities are highlighted in red (c)

# 39.3 Surgical Procedures

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. We used a crestal incision with releasing incisions in the midline and distal areas to expose the maxillary bone. In particular, we exposed the pyriform opening edge, the emergencies of the infraorbital nerves, and the body of the zygomatic bone. The thinness of the alveolar bone crest was immediately evident (Fig. 39.12a, b). Following the surgical planning, we carefully positioned the VOG (Vertical Osteotomy Guide) (Fig. 39.13) on the bone crest (Fig. 39.14) and fixed it with osteosynthesis screws to the maxillary bone (Fig. 39.15a-c).

For the vertical osteotomy we used a piezoelectric micro-saw (OT12S, Mectron s.p.a. Genoa, Italy), which makes a very thin and precise cut (Fig. 39.16a-d). Much of the alveolar ridge was trimmed and eliminated. After the osteotomy, before removing the VOG guide, we used a reciprocating bone file (Osteomed LP, Addison, Tex, USA) to carefully remove any residual bone (Figs. 39.17a, b and 39.18). To fix the second guide (HOG) (Fig. 39.19a, b) for bone remodeling on the horizontal plane, we used the same holes of the first guide. This detail is very important because it allows to check the accuracy of the first osteotomy.

The surgical protocol is therefore divided into successive phases: vertical osteotomy, horizontal osteotomy, and positioning of the AMSJI. The accuracy in the execution of each step affects the subsequent ones.

For the guided horizontal remodeling, we used rotary instruments of different sizes (Figs. 39.20a, b, 39.21 and 39.22). The bone surface was thus modified, removing the sharpest and thinnest parts (Fig. 39.23) to accommodate the AMSJI implants.

The right (Fig. 39.24a, b) and left implants were placed on the bone surface using a metal plunger (Tampers metal plunger, KLS Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany) and light hammer blows (Fig. 39.25). At this point, the temporary prosthetic structure is screwed to the implants (Fig. 39.26a, b), the temporary prosthesis is mounted, and the patient is brought into centric occlusion before preparing the sites for the osteosynthesis screws.

AMSJI implants are fixed, to the zygomatic bone (Figs. 39.27a, b and 39.28) and to the edge of the pyriform opening (Fig. 39.29a, b). The implants are joined by the temporary prosthetic structure and fixed to the maxillary bone with eight osteosynthesis screws (Fig. 39.30). Flaps are sutured by resorbable sutures (Vicryl, Ethicon, J&J, NJ), with single and mattress stitches around the prosthetic connections (Fig. 39.31). After completing the suture, the prosthetic structure is repositioned by screwing it at  $20 - 25\mathrm{Ncm}$  (Fig. 39.32a, b) and the temporary prosthesis is cemented to it (Fig. 39.33a, b). At the end of the surgery, the patient can immediately regain his masticatory function but will have to follow a soft diet for a couple of months.

The patient was discharged with antibiotic (Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) and anti-inflammatory (ketorolac tromethamine) therapy.

# 39.4 Postoperative Considerations

The postoperative period passed normally with regard to edema and pain but was characterized by a loss of sensitivity to the right hemi-face in the area of the infraorbital nerve. Probably this was due to an accidental stretching of the nervous structures. This alteration lasted for nearly a month before the sensibility spontaneously returned to normal.

A postoperative control CT was performed to assess the accuracy in the positioning of the AMSJI implant, having used the guided osteotomy technique. The postoperative CT was superimposed on the preoperative one and a finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to evaluate any abnormal compression of the implant structure on the maxillary bone surface. After the osteotomies, the positioning of the implant was in any case precise and corresponding to the planned one, the areas eliminated with osteotomies were evident at the FEA, but there were no abnormal load compressions on the maxillary bone (Fig. 39.34a-d).

Approximately three months after surgery, the provisional structures were removed (Fig. 39.35) and impressions were taken to make the resin coating of the titanium hybrid prosthesis (Fig. 39.36). The state of the soft tissues around the prosthetic connections was good and there were no recessions or dehiscences (Fig. 39.35).

The coating of the hybrid prosthesis was carried out with the CAD-CAM technique, after testing various mock-ups (Fig. 39.37a, b) to evaluate the esthetic aspects of the final prosthesis (Fig. 39.38a-d). The hybrid prosthesis was placed in the patient's mouth and screwed to the AMSJI implant at  $30\mathrm{Ncm}$  (Fig. 39.39a, b).

The patient was satisfied with the result and completed an evaluation questionnaire (Van C, et al. Patient- and clinician-reported outcomes a prospective multicenter one-year follow-up study, Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg (2021), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijom.2021.05.015).

About a year and a half after surgery, during the follow-up visits, we detected small tissue dehiscences, uncovering parts of the mainframe (Fig. 39.40). These areas, free of inflammation, do not create any problems to the patient who was asymptomatic and satisfied with the result of the implant rehabilitation. Nevertheless, the presence of these dehiscences has led us to consider the gingival biotype of the patients as a risk factor, but above all it suggested us to modify the design of the AMSJI, especially in cases of use of the VOG and HOG osteotomy guides, eliminating the "knees" in the arms and in the case of using cutting guides also evaluate a biphasic approach (preliminary data from the third International Workgroup Meeting on AMSJI, December 16, 2021 which will be followed by multicenter studies that will be the subject of further publications).

# 40.1 Medical and Clinical Picture

A man, born in 1972, presented at the age of 45 years with complaints of persistent pus exudation from his right cheek skin and of inability to chew properly. He was on a soft diet and perceived speech articulation problems. The patient was a professional chef in a one-star Michelin restaurant and his job was at risk, because he suffered from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and felt exhausted.

History taking revealed that he developed an alveolitis and consequently a mandibular osteomyelitis after right lower third molar removal for which multiple sequestrectomies had been performed. He had undergone a segmental mandibular resection comprising the mandibular angle and simultaneous reconstruction with a free vascularized fibular flap (DCIA flap) at the age of 38 years. Flap failure resulted in bone loss, TMJ ankylosis, and extraoral fistulation. The patient was on continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) therapy at night because of the OSA which resulted from the right-sided drop back of the remaining mandible. His oral hygiene had deteriorated and he was advised by his general dentist to undergo total edentulation (Fig. 40.1a, b).

(b) 3D reconstructed multi-slice computer tomogram of the craniofacial complex. The ankylosis in the joint area seems to be between a residual part of the fibular flap and the skull base (A)

# 40.2 Preoperative Considerations

Intravenous antibiotic therapy and removal of infected teeth cured the multiple skin fistulae (Fig. 40.2a-c). Planning the corrections in Proplan CMF (Materialise NV, Heverlee, Belgium) suggested a rotational repositioning of the swinging mandible and a unilateral sagittal split osteotomy to correct the resulting crossbite in the left premolar area (Fig. 40.3a-c).

Design of the alloplastic extended TMJ prosthesis (eTMJ R) was done with the help of CADskills (Ghent, Belgium), using Geomagic

Freeform Plus and Sculpt (3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC, USA) (Fig. 40.4a-c). The implants were selectively laser melted (SLM Solutions, Lübbeck, Germany) using a titanium Gr23 extralow interstitial alloy in the CADskills company. Joint surfaces were optimized using medical-grade, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (Quadrant EPP, Vreden, Germany) and coated with nondisclosed HadSat®. Surfaces were roughened for increased tissue integration using alumina grit peening and oxalic acid etching (Fig. 40.4d-e).

# 40.3 Surgical Procedures

In March 2018, the patient received a customized extended TMJ prosthesis (Fig. 40.5a-c). His lower teeth were removed and the residual crest leveled. A gunning splint was used to control the positioning of the mandible at the left side using a unilateral sagittal split osteotomy.

The postoperative right-sided facial paresis (Video 1), resulting from neuropraxis due to soft tissue retraction, resolved within 4 months.

The patient stopped CPAP therapy in April 2018, after polysomnography revealed he was cured from OSAS.

However, he developed a nonunion at the left osteotomy site. The provisional lower denture had to be regularly adjusted. Pain, intraoral dehiscence and loss of the gonial angle prompted us to action.


In October 2018, he underwent total edentulation and alveoloplasty in the maxilla, release, debridement, and segment repositioning at the nonunion site.

In March 2019, the osteotomy site was revised, osteosynthesis material replaced, and bridging bone grafts from the posterior iliac crest screw-fixed over the nonunion site. At the same time, 5 Astra Tech implants (Dentsply Sirona, Konstanz, Germany) of  $3.6\mathrm{mm}$  diameter and  $11\mathrm{mm}$  length were inserted between the mental foramina (Fig. 40.6). This time, delayed but complete union occurred at the osteotomy site.

A scan prosthesis (Fig. 40.7a, b), this time made using 1part BaSO4 per 2 parts acrylic powder, instead of dual scan markers fixed on a provisional prosthesis, was made in April 2019.

An AMSJI was designed with the help of CADskills BV (Ghent, Belgium) (Fig. 40.8a-d).

By the end of May 2019, an AMSJI complex was placed in the upper jaw and the implants in the lower jaw were denuded (Fig. 40.9a-c).

Consequently, a fixed upper and lower bridge were made and installed (Fig. 40.10a-g).

Mastication, facial esthetics, speech, and oxygenation were restored. Figure 40.11a, b shows a happy patient 9 months after AMSJI surgery.
