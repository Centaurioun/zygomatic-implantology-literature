# Diagnostic Imaging for Zygomatic Implants

Bernard Koong

Pre-implant diagnostic imaging is essential for the correct placement of zygomatic implants. The limitations of two-dimensional (2D) radiography and tomographic techniques including the panoramic radiograph are well known. These techniques are clearly insufficient for the precise planning of zygomatic implants. The application of volumetric imaging in the planning of alveolar implants is well accepted [1-7]. It is even more critical that volumetric imaging be employed for zygomatic implant planning. The benefits of the three-dimensional nature of volumetric techniques in relation to designing the location and orientation of zygomatic implants are obvious and volumetric data sets may be used for virtual planning and fabrication of computer-generated surgical guides [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]. Pre-surgical identification of diseases related to the maxillary-zygomatic complex is of importance and more likely to be missed or not well visualised with 2D and/or panoramic radiography.

# Volumetric Imaging Modalities

CBCT uses a cone- or pyramidal-shaped divergent X-ray beam. Multiple sequential projections are captured by an area detector on the opposite side of a rotating gantry [1, 9, 10]. Another term also used for this modality is cone beam volumetric tomography.

MDCT employs a collimated fan-shaped X-ray beam that rotates helically around the patient. A second collimator related to rows of solid-state detectors reduces the scattered photons. Several other terms are also used for this modality, including multislice CT.

# Image Quality

An advantage of CBCT is the high resolution achieved. Some scanners are able to produce isotropic 3D voxel sizes potentially as small as  $0.076\mathrm{mm}$  [1, 2, 10]. However, the extremely high-resolution scans are limited to small field of view (FOV) scans. The planning of zygoma implants with CBCT requires larger FOVs, which are typically associated with voxels much larger than  $0.076\mathrm{mm}$ , closer to those of MDCT.

In addition, CBCT image resolution in practice ranges widely, potentially less than MDCT [11]. Orofacial CBCT is subject to more detrimental effects on image quality than MDCT, including:

- Noise

- CBCT scans are associated with increased noise compared to MDCT. The amount of Compton's scattering is proportional to the volume of tissues in the X-ray beam [1, 9] and CBCT scans for zygoma implants require relatively large FOVs.

Signal-to-Noise Ratio

- CBCT scans are associated with lower signal-to-noise ratios [1, 9, 10, 12]. The substantially higher signal-to-noise ratio associated with MDCT [1, 8, 11] contributes to improved image quality.

- Beam Hardening

- This is a common issue with orofacial CBCT [1, 3, 9, 10, 12, 13] and not usually associated with MDCT studies of the orofacial structures. This results in the appearance of streaks (Figs. 1 and 2), decreasing image quality. The size and density of a patient's head contribute to the degree of beam hardening [1].

Motion Artefact

- This is a common problem with CBCT, as the scan times are generally substantially longer than with MDCT. Selection of a shorter CBCT scan time may reduce motion artefact [9, 13], but this reduces image quality.

- In addition, the vast majority of orofacial CBCT scans are performed with a patient in an upright position and the head held with various devices. MDCT scans are performed with a patient in a supine position and his/her head is at rest on the table, which facilitates a patient keeping still during the scan.

Cone Beam Effect

- The peripheries of CBCT scans are subject to more image distortion, streaking artefacts and greater noise [9, 10]. This can be an issue when the zygomas are at the periphery of the FOV, particularly when a more limited FOV machine is employed and/or if a patient is larger. This is not an issue with MDCT.

The compromises in image quality associated with CBCT discussed above, when more severe or if there is a combination of these factors present, potentially compromise the accuracy of measurements made with a particular scan. Therefore, the potential impact on accurate interpretation of these studies should be considered. Generally, orofacial CBCT scans of persons who are larger and/or have difficulty keeping still in the upright position often result in less than optimal image quality. Consideration of these factors in the selection of the optimal modality is therefore important. Post-acquisition evaluation of the scan for image quality is equally important.


Metal streak artefacts related to dental restorations occur with both CBCT and MDCT. These may obscure key structures, although these are usually limited to the region of the dentoalveolar structures and are usually a consequence of previous restorative therapy. Various techniques/programmes have been developed in an attempt to reduce metal streak artefacts, with varying degrees of success. This is not an issue for cases considered for zygomatic implants which present with an edentulous maxilla. In some cases, however, there may be remaining teeth planned for extractions which are heavily restored (particularly restorations which extend cervically) or are associated with posts. For these cases, pre-imaging extractions could be considered to improve image quality, which potentially facilitates more accurate implant planning.

# Accuracy of Linear Measurements

Both CBCT and MDCT linear measurements (over lengths comparable to a tooth) have been shown to be accurate to within  $1\mathrm{mm}$  [14-16]. However, these studies are performed under ideal conditions and the factors influencing image quality (discussed in section "Image Quality") must be taken into account. Also, distances associated with planning zygomatic implants are typically greater, and larger margins of error should be considered. This is particularly important with CBCT. Care should also be taken when using volume-rendered images for implant planning, as these can be influenced by the selected window width and levels.

# Bone Density Measurements

The relative density of body tissues can be quantified with MDCT, based on a calibrated grey-level scale (Hounsfield units/CT numbers). In contrast, grey values associated with CBCT scans cannot be accurately quantified [4, 10, 13, 17-20]. However, the bone density and quality in both MDCT and CBCT scans can be qualitatively evaluated by examining the architecture and thickness of trabecular bone as well as the thickness of the cortical bone.

# Soft Tissues

Soft tissues are not well examined with CBCT, which is associated with lower contrast resolution compared to MDCT [1-3, 5, 8-10, 17, 21]. The contrast resolution of CBCT is essentially limited to calcified structures [2, 8, 10, 21, 22]. MDCT is associated with high contrast resolution and able to discriminate between tissues with  $1\%$  density difference [1, 8, 9]. Hence, soft tissues are relatively well examined with MDCT which maybe clinically/surgically significant in some cases (Figs. 17, 23 and 24), although MRI or ultrasound may be better for soft tissue lesions. In contrast, CBCT scans are limited to essentially demonstrating the soft tissue-air interface and the presence of soft tissue lesions cannot be fully excluded with this technique. MDCT scans with intravenous contrast further characterise a lesion/condition which may be critical in some cases [1, 8, 9].

# Radiation Dose Levels

Orofacial CBCT scans potentially deliver lower radiation doses than MDCT [3, 8, 9, 17, 20-23]. However, not all CBCT scans deliver low radiation doses and the reported range of doses delivered is large;  $5 - 1073\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  [1, 9, 17, 20, 23-26]. In comparison, MDCT effective dose range of  $280 - 1410~\mu \mathrm{Sv}$  has been reported [1, 20, 23, 25, 26]. It is, therefore, evident that CBCT scans can deliver relative large radiation dose levels, potentially higher than low-dose MDCT scans [1, 27]. CBCT doses are dependent on the type of unit and the protocols employed [1, 3, 20, 24, 25] and MDCT scanners are more powerful and flexible. While there is some variation between different types of MDCT scanners, imaging protocols can be substantially altered, significantly changing the doses delivered accordingly [1]. It should be noted that there are challenges in making comparisons between the various CBCT units and between different imaging modalities [1, 17, 21, 22, 27].

Some CBCT units are capable of stitching multiple small FOV scans together to capture a larger FOV. This results in an increased radiation dose [9, 10] and is generally not recommended for the planning of zygomatic implants. In most cases, a single larger FOV CBCT scan or an MDCT scan is more suitable.

# The Relevant Anatomic Structures

# Zygoma

The zygoma is one of the more irregular bones of the skull. The morphology of this bone, particularly the body, is obviously relevant in the planning of zygomatic implants. Like many other bones, there are variations in morphology which can only be appreciated pre-surgically with volumetric imaging. Of note is the variation in the morphology and bone volume of the body of zygoma (Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6), which may be asymmetric (Figs. 7 and 8). It is clear that the relatively complex morphology of this bone cannot be fully appreciated with 2D radiography.

# Maxillary Sinus

The paired maxillary sinuses represent the largest of the paranasal sinuses. As zygomatic implants are located at the anterior and lateral aspects, the morphology and health of these sinuses are of importance.

The maxillary sinus is essentially pyramidal, the medial wall (lateral wall of nasal cavity) representing the base with the apex at the zygomatic process of the maxilla. There is a large variation in the size and morphology of these sinuses, which are not infrequently asymmetric. The degree of pneumatisation of the alveolar process (alveolar recess), palatal process (palatal recess), zygomatic process of maxilla (zygomatic recess) (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) and superiorly (infraorbital recess) also varies substantially. The prominence of the zygomatic recess influences the bone volume at the region of the zygoma.

The infraorbital canal is located in the maxillary sinus roof (orbital floor) forming a ridge at the antral aspect (Fig. 8), which runs to the anterior wall inferior to the orbital rim. Neurovascular grooves are also seen at the sinus walls, notably related to the anterior, middle and posterior superior alveolar arteries/nerves. Of note are the middle and posterior superior alveolar canals/grooves (Fig. 8), which are potentially of surgical relevance in relation to the preparation of a sinus wall window during the implant surgery. These canals/grooves are typically well demonstrated in volumetric scans.

The ostiomeatal complex (ostiomeatal unit) consists of structures that form a common channel which facilitates air flow and drainage between the maxillary sinus, anterior ethmoid air cells, frontal sinus and the middle meatus (Fig. 9). Drainage of the maxillary sinus is via the ostium, through the infundibulum into the hiatus semilunaris at the middle meatus. The maxillary ostium is located at the superior aspect of the sinus medial wall. The infundibulum is a common channel which connects the ostia of the maxillary antra and anterior ethmoid air cells to the hiatus semilunaris. The hiatus semilunaris is a horizontal region between the bulla ethmoidalis (ethmoid bulla) and the free margin of the uncinate process. The bulla ethmoidalis is the largest anterior ethmoid air cell that projects over the hiatus semilunaris. The uncinate process of ethmoid is a sickle-like process that forms the anterior boundary of the hiatus semilunaris.

There are many osteomeatal complex-related anatomical variations, some of which potentially contribute to narrowing of the drainage pathways. These include Haller (infraorbital) air cells (lateral extension of the ethmoid air cells along the medial aspect of the orbital floor) (Figs. 10 and 11), enlarged bulla ethmoidalis, concha bullosa (Fig. 11) and an enlarged or deviated uncinate process. A deviated nasal septum (Figs. 8 and 11) or paradoxical middle turbinate also potentially compromises the drainage pathways.

Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is an intranasal paranasal sinus procedure aimed at restoring normal aeration and drainage. FESS is often used in the surgical management of recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis, although there are other indications. It commonly involves the removal of the uncinate process, and opening of the anterior ethmoid air cells and Haller cells as well as antrostomy at the maxillary medial wall (Fig. 12). It should be noted that accessory medial wall ostia are not infrequently seen and may occasionally resemble a medial wall antrostomy.

# Maxillary Alveolar Process

Patients presenting for zygomatic implants demonstrate limited maxillary alveolar bone volume due to atrophy, periodontal bone loss and/or proximity of the maxillary sinus floors (Fig. 8). These patients are often edentulous. When partially

# Related Pathology

A comprehensive review of the potential conditions affecting the maxillary-zygomatic complex and adjacent structures relevant to zygomatic implants is beyond the scope of this chapter. From a diagnostic imaging perspective, it is crucial that the person responsible for the study ensures that all structures included in the scan length/field of view are thoroughly evaluated [8, 10, 20, 28–30]. Interpretation of volumetric data sets requires a different and more advanced skill set than that employed for the interpretation of 2D radiographic studies, especially when larger regions of the orofacial structures are included. Prerequisite knowledge includes relevant radiologic anatomy, orofacial pathology, radiologic features of pathoses and a thorough understanding of the limitations of the techniques employed. The challenges that dentists encounter with respect to the identification of the presence of disease in CBCT scans have been demonstrated [31], and it has been recommended that CBCT scans be interpreted by those with sufficient advanced training [3, 20, 28–30]. Scans for zygomatic implants include several extra-gnathic head and neck structures, including the paranasal sinuses, pharynx, skull base and cervical spine. Where the clinician presiding over the scan does not possess the required skill set and knowledge to accurately evaluate the CBCT or MDCT data in their entirety, it is prudent that an appropriately skilled radiologist is engaged to perform this.

Evaluation of the zygoma and maxilla, including the maxillary process and sinuses, for pathoses is of particular significance in relation to the planning of zygomatic implants.

Abnormalities involving the alveolar process include odontogenic and non-odontogenic conditions, inflammatory dentoalveolar lesions being the most common. With atrophic residual ridges, the inferior aspect of the incisive canal and the foramen is not infrequently widened, likely related to atrophy and pressure from a tissue-borne denture. The differential diagnosis would include a nasopalatine duct cyst.

Pathology within or adjacent to the zygoma also warrants identification (Figs. 13 and 14).

The health of the maxillary sinuses is also relevant to the planning of zygomatic implants. A comprehensive discussion of sinus diseases is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, the conditions include mucous retention cysts, sinus osteoma, acute

Pathology associated with adjacent soft tissues may also be of substantial surgical significance (Figs. 23 and 24). The limitations of CBCT in the evaluation of soft tissues have been discussed.

# Post-implant Imaging

Accepted CBCT and MDCT artefacts remain a challenge in spite of the development of various artefact-reducing programmes. The severity of the degree of artefact associated with zygomatic implants varies substantially, and may be significant with both techniques. In spite of the potentially higher resolution, challenges related to CBCT technology have been discussed, beam hardening and signal-to-noise ratios being of particular significance in post-zygoma implant imaging. Anecdotally, pathology associated with zygomatic implants that is small and immediately adjacent to the implant may not be demonstrated with either modality. Larger defects, beyond the zone of artefact, are usually identified. Correlation with clinical findings is, therefore, paramount.


Associated sinus disease is usually well demonstrated. Soft tissue changes such as infection/cellulitis are best examined with MDCT.
