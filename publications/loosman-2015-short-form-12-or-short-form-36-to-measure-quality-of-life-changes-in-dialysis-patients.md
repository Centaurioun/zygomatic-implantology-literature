# ABSTRACT

Background. Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is a self-report health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) questionnaire, widely used in dialysis patients. It consists of physical and mental component scores (PCS/MCS), ranging from 0 to 100. To improve efficiency, the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) was developed to reproduce PCS and MCS. We assessed the ability of SF-12 versus SF-36 to detect change over time, and the association of SF-12 versus SF-36 with short-term and long-term mortality in dialysis patients.

Methods. Patients were selected from the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis  $(N = 1379)$ , a prospective follow-up study among incident dialysis patients (62.1% HD) who completed SF-36 measurements every 6 months. Changes in scores of SF-12 versus SF-36 were compared with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Subsequently, Bland-Altman plots were used to assess limits of agreement. Relationship with mortality was assessed with Cox models with and without a time-dependent variable, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity and dialysis modality at baseline.

Results. ICC for change in scores was 0.90 for MCS and 0.84 for PCS. Mean difference was  $-0.1$  and 0.2, respectively, and limits of agreement were  $-8.3$  to 8.4 for MCS change in scores and  $-8.8$  to 9.2 for PCS. Adjusted hazard ratio's for mortality per 5 units increment were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.91) for MCS12, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90) for MCS36, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76-0.83) for PCS12 and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71-0.78) for PCS36.

Conclusions. SF-12 can be used to detect change in HRQOL in cohort studies on dialysis patients. SF-12 and SF-36 were similarly associated with short-term and long-term mortality. However, the wide limits of agreement indicate that SF-12 and SF-36 can give different scores on the individual level, suggesting that for individual purposes SF-36 instead of SF-12 should be used.

# INTRODUCTION

Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is a self-reported questionnaire that is frequently being used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL). SF-36 has been validated in the general population as well as in various sub populations [1] including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [2]. From this questionnaire, a physical component score (PCS) and a mental component score (MCS) can be calculated. The questionnaire can also be used to measure eight domains to give more specific information about a patient's HRQOL. The 36 items bring a burden on the patient, especially when patients need to fill out concomitant questionnaires in research settings. Therefore, a shorter questionnaire, Short-Form 12 (SF-12), has been developed [3]. This questionnaire consists of 12 items selected from SF-36 to calculate and reproduce PCS and MCS. With this short questionnaire, it is not possible to accurately reproduce the eight domains.

SF-12 has been validated in the general population [4] and in various subgroups of patients such as patients with myocardial infarction [5] and ischaemic stroke [6]. Three studies evaluated the use of SF-12 in patients with ESRD. First, an Iranian study of 140 dialysis patients showed high internal consistency and good test-retest reliability [7]. Second, an American study of 44 395 prevalent ESRD patients showed a correlation of 0.94 for both the physical as well as the mental component scores between both questionnaires [8]. These results were confirmed by a Norwegian study of 301 prevalent dialysis patients, which also showed correlations above 0.9 [9].

However, so far the validity of the SF-12 has only been determined in a cross-sectional manner. This poses a problem for using the SF-12 in clinical practice, as the validity is not evaluated for using the SF-12 as a screening instrument to detect changes over time. It is thus unknown whether the SF-12 is a good instrument to detect HRQOL changes over time, for example, to study the effect of a new treatment. Furthermore, lower HRQOL has been associated with increased mortality in dialysis patients [10-15]. Previous studies showed comparable associations with mortality for the SF-12 as the SF-36 [8, 9]. Follow-up time in these studies was fixed, ranging between 1 and 4.5 years. As a consequence, we do not know whether the SF-12 can also be used as a marker for short-term mortality in clinical care. No studies have been done that compared the associations of SF-12 and SF-36 with short-term mortality using updated component scores.


The objective of this study is (1) to compare the ability of SF-12 with SF-36 to detect change in HRQOL in dialysis patients, and (2) to compare the relationship between SF-12 and SF-36 scores with short-term and long-term mortality.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

# Study population

The study population was selected from the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD), a nationwide multi-centre prospective follow-up study among ESRD patients. From 1997 until 2007, incident patients were enrolled from 38 dialysis centres. Inclusion criteria were age above 18 years and starting renal replacement therapy for the first time. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committees of all participating hospitals. All patients gave written informed consent. To allow for stabilization of laboratory data and treatment modality, the baseline measures were taken at 3 months after the start of dialysis. The following patient's demographics and clinical characteristics were collected at 3 months: gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, having children, employment status, dialysis modality, body mass index, the Davies co-morbidity index indicating the level of co-morbidity (no, intermediate, severe) [16], and primary causes of ESRD. Patients were followed up until time of death, transplantation, 25 May 2009 or for this current analysis a maximum follow-up of 4.5 years, whichever was earliest. For the current analysis, patients were selected with available data on SF-36 at 3 months after start of dialysis.

# Health-related quality of life scores

The participants filled out the SF-36 questionnaire at 3 and 6 months after start of dialysis and every 6 months thereafter. SF-36 component scores (PCS36 and MCS36) were calculated as standardized scores towards the USA population as a reference group. This reference population has a mean score of 50 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 [17]. Thus, a score below or above 50 indicates a respectively worse or better quality of life than the reference group. Furthermore, a higher score indicates a better HRQOL. SF-12 scores were obtained by using 12 questions from SF-36. PCS12 and MCS12 scores were calculated with orthogonal regression weights, and are also presented towards the

US population as a reference group [4, 18]. Of both SF-36 and SF-12 questionnaires version 1 was used.

The EuroQol is a questionnaire to assess HRQOL and has been used in dialysis patients to assess HRQOL for economic evaluations [19-22]. The questionnaire consists of a classification system and a health thermometer. The classification system consists of five questions which covers five domains of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). The health thermometer is a visual analogue scale on which patients had to indicate their health status on a thermometer scale of 0-100 after answering the following question: 'what is your health status today?' A score of 100 indicates the best health status. The EuroQol thermometer was assessed at the same measurement points as the SF-36. For the current analysis, the change of the health thermometer score was used as an external criterion for changes in HRQOL.

# Statistical analysis

The time course of the SF-12 and SF-36 component scores were described using linear mixed models. Changes in scores were calculated between each consecutive measure point for the SF-12, SF-36 and the EuroQol thermometer scores. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated between the component scores derived from the SF-12 and the SF-36 at the different measurement points as well as for the change in scores. In addition, ICCs were calculated between both SF-12 and SF-36 change in scores and the EuroQol thermometer change in scores.

To assess agreement between the scores of the SF-12 and SF-36, we used the Bland-Altman plot [23]. In this scatter plot, individual differences between SF-12 and SF-36 scores are plotted against the mean of both measurements. The graph shows the population average of all individual differences between SF-12 and SF-36 scores and the  $95\%$  limits of agreement. These limits of agreement were calculated as the mean difference between SF-12 and  $\mathrm{SF - 36}\pm 1.96$  SDs of the differences. To explore whether the degree of disagreement on an individual level is driven by subgroups of patients, we compared characteristics of patients with large individual differences between the two scores ( $>5$  points on both PCS and MCS) with the group of patients with good agreement. Baseline characteristics were compared between both groups. Survival time was calculated as the difference between the first measurement (i.e. 3 months on dialysis) and date of death or the last follow-up recorded. Followup was assessed by employing the reverse Kaplan-Meier method [24]. Patients were censored after death, transplantation and loss of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the associations between the different component scores and all-cause mortality. The baseline scores were used to determine long-term mortality. The proportional hazard assumption was assessed graphically by creating cumulative hazard plots of SF-36 and SF-12 scores, and by adding interaction terms with time. Short-term mortality risk was determined using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model using updated information on the component scores. In the case of missing data at a specific time point, the component scores of the preceding measurement point were used instead (last carried forward). Hazard ratios were calculated per 5 units increase of the component scores. Analyses were performed with and without adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity (Davies score), ethnicity and dialysis modality. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 20).


# RESULTS

A total of 2051 incident patients were enrolled in NECOSAD, of whom 1956 were still in the study after 3 months. For 1379 participants, SF-12 and SF-36 component scores were available. Baseline characteristics of patients with and without SF-36/SF-12 scores at baseline are summarized in Table 1. Patients with complete scores were younger  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.05)$ , more often white  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.01)$ , and had less often cardiovascular disease  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.01)$ . At baseline, mean PCS36 and PCS12 scores were 38.4 (95% CI 37.9–38.9) and 37.8 (95% CI 37.3–38.3), respectively. Median and inter-quartile range (IQR) for PCS36 and PCS12 were 37.4 (30.6–44.8) and 38.1 (30.9–45.2), respectively. Furthermore, mean MCS36 and MCS12 scores were 44.8 (95% CI 44.3–45.5) and 46.4 (95% CI 45.9–47.0), respectively. Finally, median and IQR for MCS36 and MCS12 were 47.6 (38.0–55.2) and 46.3 (35.7–53.7), respectively.

# Cross-sectional analyses

Mean SF-12 and SF-36 scores were relatively stable over time (Figure 1). Both at baseline and during follow-up, population mean PCS12 scores were equivalent to the PCS scores derived from the SF-36. For the MCS, slightly higher scores were observed using the SF-12 than the SF-36, which was consistent during follow-up. At baseline, correlations between SF-12 and SF-36 scores were very good with an ICC of 0.92 for PCS and 0.94 for MCS. Comparable ICCs were observed at the other measurement points (data not shown). Individual differences between the component scores of the SF-12 and the SF-36 at baseline are shown in the Bland-Altman plots (Figure 2). Limits of agreement ranged from  $-6.8$  to 8.0 for PCS scores and from  $-8.7$  to 5.5 points for MCS scores.


Four hundred and fifteen of 1379 patients had a difference of  $>5$  points on both PCS and MCS scores. These patients received more frequent haemodialysis  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.01)$ , had a lower education level  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.01)$ , had a higher comorbidity score  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.01)$  and were older  $(\mathrm{P} < 0.01)$ . The differences remained the same after comparing patients above and below 5 points difference on both PCS and MCS change in scores.

# Change in scores

Changes in SF-12 and SF-36 component scores between the baseline measurement, i.e. at 3 months after start of dialysis, and at 6 months after start of dialysis could be calculated for 1117 patients. The mean changes in scores were comparable for the SF-12 and SF-36. The mean difference between PCS36 and PCS12 change in scores was 0.2 and between the MCS36 and MCS12 change in scores was  $-0.1$  (Figure 3). Furthermore,

the changes in scores were also strongly correlated with an ICC of 0.83 for PCS and 0.90 for MCS, respectively. Limits of agreement between the PCS change in scores ranged from  $-8.8$  to 9.2 points and between the MCS change in scores from  $-8.3$  to 8.4 points (Figure 3).

Mean change in score of EuroQol thermometer between the first two measurements (i.e. at 3 and 6 months) was 0.24 (SD 13.42). Mean change in score of PCS36 and PCS12 was 0.21 (SD 7.41) and  $-0.04$  (SD 8.01), respectively. Mean change in score of MCS36 and MCS12 was 0.01 (SD 9.85) and 0.13 (SD 9.50), respectively. Table 2 summarizes ICCs for SF-12 and SF-36 change in scores with EuroQol thermometer change in scores for the first three measurements (i.e. at 3, 6 and 12 months). These correlations were moderate, but not different for the SF-12 and SF-36 component scores. Both questionnaires had slightly higher Pearson correlations than ICCs. The analyses with the changes in scores were repeated for the subsequent measurement points. Comparable results were found (data not shown).

# Mortality

Median survival time was 4.4 years. (95% CI: 4.1-4.8) and the median follow-up time was 3.8 years with a minimum of 0 years and a maximum of 9.7 years. Higher MCS and PCS scores were associated with lower short-term mortality in the time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model (Table 3). Associations for PCS scores were somewhat more pronounced than for the MCS scores.

The observed associations were not different for the SF-12 and the SF-36 scores. The analysis using baseline scores, reflecting long-term mortality, gave similar results for both questionnaires with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77–0.85) for PCS12 and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81–0.90) for MCS12. By adding interaction terms with time, differences between SF-36 and SF-12 remained the same (data not shown).

# DISCUSSION

The component scores derived from the SF-12 showed good agreement with the SF-36 scores and the patterns over time were very similar. Responsiveness was also comparable between the short and long version of the questionnaire. In addition, SF-12 scores, as well as SF-36 scores, were associated with mortality with comparable risk estimates.

Our finding that SF-12 and SF-36 give comparable results is in line with other studies in dialysis patients [8, 9]. However, these studies only investigated agreement between SF-12 and SF-36 at one moment in time, and did not compare changes over time. Responsiveness to change of SF-12 has been assessed in various other populations such as patients with stroke, myocardial infarction or a trauma population [25-29]. These studies also showed that SF-12 is comparable with SF-36 with respect to their ability to detect change in HRQOL over time. However, the majority of these studies used effect sizes to determine responsiveness to change. An effect size is calculated as a mean difference over time divided by the SD at baseline or the SD of that difference (standardized response mean). A major problem with this type of measurement is that it reflects the magnitude of the change in scores rather than the validity of the change in scores [30]. Thus, large changes over time result in large effect sizes and small changes in small effect sizes. This, however, does not give any information on whether the observed change is valid. Therefore, we chose not to use effect sizes but to assess responsiveness of SF-12 and SF-36 by calculating ICCs and create Bland-Altman plots. Our result showed that MCS12 and MCS36 change in scores were comparable. The same holds true for PCS12 and PCS36. However, for the PCS change in scores, a somewhat lower ICC was observed. Thus, MCS12 change in scores seems to be a good substitute for MCS36 change in scores. PCS12 change in scores should be interpreted with more caution than MCS12. In addition, we used the EuroQol thermometer change in scores as an external criterion. The ICCs between SF questionnaires and the EuroQol thermometer were moderate, but the same for SF-36 and SF-12. The moderate ICC is probably due to the difference in type of measurement which could result in a greater variation of the EuroQol thermometer change in scores. The thermometer indicates today's HRQOL with one question and the SF questionnaire consists of 36 or 12 questions which indicates the HRQOL of the last 4 weeks. However, the ICCs of SF-36 and SF-12 with EuroQol thermometer were comparable which supports the ability of SF-12 to reproduce SF-36 scores.


The Bland-Altman plots showed a small average difference between SF-12 and SF-36 scores, which indicates that SF-12 is comparable with SF-36 when an average of multiple SF-12 scores is calculated. However, the  $95\%$  limits of agreement showed that the difference between individual SF-12 and SF-36 scores can vary up to 8 points. In other words, the SF-12 score of an individual patient, represented by 1 dot on the Bland-Altman plot, can vary up to 8 points in comparison to the SF-36 score. A clinical meaningful change is often set to 5 points [31]. Therefore, it is important to realize that by using SF-12, clinical meaningful changes in HRQOL might be missed in individual patients. Consequently, it might be preferable to use SF-36 instead of SF-12 to detect changes in HRQOL over time in individual patients. To find an explanation for these individual differences, we compared two groups of patients: one group with large differences between SF-12/SF-36 and the other group with a small difference between SF-12/SF-36. Results showed that more vulnerable patients (i.e. higher co-morbidity and older) were less consistent in their answers. Future research could address the differences between subgroups of patients. Furthermore, the eight specific domains calculated by SF-36 were lost when SF-12 was calculated. Thus, when specific information about HRQOL is needed SF-12 is not useful, and SF-36 should be used instead.

A lower HRQOL is related to a higher mortality rate as shown in studies with dialysis patients [10-15]. Results found in our study showed that MCS12/MCS36 and PCS12/PCS36 were equally associated with both short-term and long-term mortality. This is in agreement with the paper by Lacson et al. [8]. The paper written by Osthus et al. [9] showed less consistent results but this is probably due to a small sample size.


A few limitations should be noted for this study. First, SF-12 and SF-36 were not administered separately but SF-12 was extracted from SF-36 items. Therefore, it is possible that the ability of SF-12 to reproduce PCS and MCS was somewhat overestimated. Second, SF-36 and SF12 scores can differ between countries. Generalizability of study findings could therefore be difficult, but associations between SF-36 and SF-12 scores will probably be the same. Finally, not all patients had complete SF-36/SF-12 scores, and as expected baseline characteristics differed between patients with and without complete questionnaires. It is not to be expected that this changes the ability of SF-12 to reproduce SF-36 scores.

In conclusion, SF-12 scores can be used to replicate SF-36 scores in cross-sectional studies and can also be used to detect HRQOL changes over time in cohort studies on dialysis patients. SF-12 and SF-36 were similarly associated with shortterm and long-term mortality. However, for individual patients, considerable differences were observed between SF-12 and SF-36. We therefore recommend to use the SF-36 for individual purposes.

# ABSTRACT

Background. Patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease have an increased circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity, but there is little information about changes in ACE2 in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients without history of CV disease. We examined circulating ACE2 activity in CKD patients at stages 3-5 (CKD3-5) and in dialysis (CKD5D) without any history of CV disease.

Methods. Circulating ACE2 activity was measured in human ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma samples from the NEFRONA study  $(n = 2572)$ : control group (CONT)  $(n = 568)$ , CKD3-5  $(n = 1458)$  and CKD5D  $(n = 546)$ . Different clinical and analytical variables such as gender; age; history of diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and hypertension; glycaemic, renal, lipid and anaemia profiles; vitamin D analogues treatment and antihypertensive treatments (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockade) were analysed. Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities were measured using modified fluorimetric assay for EDTA-plasma samples, where zinc chloride was added to recover enzymatic activity.

Results. In CKD3-5 and CKD5D, significant decrease in circulating ACE2 activity was observed when compared with CONT, but no differences were found between CKD3-5 and CKD5 when performing paired case-control studies. By multivariate linear regression analysis, male gender and advanced age were identified as independent predictors of ACE2 activity in all groups. Diabetes was identified as independent predictor of ACE2 activity in CKD3-5. Significant increase in the activity of circulating ACE was found in CKD3-5 and CKD5D when compared with CONT and in CKD5D when compared with CKD3-5. By multiple regression analysis, female gender and younger age were identified as independent predictors of ACE activity in CONT and CKD3-5. Diabetes was also identified as an independent predictor of ACE activity in CKD3-5 patients.

Conclusions. Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities can be measured in human EDTA-plasma samples with zinc added to recover enzymatic activity. In a CKD population without previous history of CV disease, ACE2 activity from human EDTA-plasma samples directly correlated with the classical CV risk factors namely older age, diabetes and male gender. Our data suggest that circulating ACE2 is altered in CKD patients at risk for CV event.
