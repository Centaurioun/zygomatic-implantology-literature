# Zygomatic Implants After 20 Years: Systematic Overview and Global Perspective

Chantal Malevez

# Introduction

Despite the fact that standard endosseous implants have been used for the treatment of total and partial edentulism due to the discovery of the osseointegration phenomenon, restrictions have appeared due to the lack of bone in certain clinical situations such as the posterior maxilla where bone height may be less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  and also in the anterior region corresponding to classes 4, 5 and 6 of Cawood and Howell [1] or the similar classification of Lekholm and Zarb [2].

Bone augmentation procedures, be they onlay or inlay grafting with or without Lefort I osteotomies [3], have been proposed and used. In addition, synthetic biomaterials and angled implants in the parasinus region [4], implants in pterygoid apophysis [5], and short and wide implants [6] are available options to address maxillary bone deficiency.

Sinus grafting was developed by Boyne in the 1980s [7].

These augmentation techniques are reliable and scientifically documented even in long-term follow-up [8]. However, they are time-consuming, not cost-effective, and need invasive surgery with possible associated morbidity. Furthermore, the duration of treatment is extended and can be uncomfortable for the patients who are not allowed to wear a removable prosthesis during the healing time and have to undergo two surgeries. With regard to short implants, these are often placed in bone with lower density and failure rates are higher with shorter implants [9].

In the 1980s, P-I Brænemark's concern for patients suffering from atrophic jaws, whom he referred to as handicapped patients, led to his conception of the idea that implants could find sufficient anchorage in the zygoma, even though their anchorage was quite far from the maxilla. He was accustomed to using zygoma implants for anchorage in hemimaxillectomy cases [10, 11] and adapted this concept to totally edentulous patients with very atrophic posterior maxillae [12]. These zygoma implants, when combined with standard implants placed in the anterior maxilla, would be able to support masticatory forces transmitted through a fixed implant complete denture prosthesis screwed to the implants and employing cross-arch stabilization. The first zygomatic implants were straight, but according to prosthetic requests, they were transformed into angulated implants with a  $45^{\circ}$  angulation at the intraoral head of the implant. This  $45^{\circ}$  angulation corresponds to the angulation of the zygoma and the maxilla and through this degree of angulation, the collar of the implant is more or less perpendicular to the occlusal plane and facilitates prosthetic reconstruction. The implant head that will be subsequently restored is a Brænemark system external hexagon.

In 1997, the protocol was spread all over the world with a first multicenter study involving 16 centers and the results were published after 1 and 3 years postplacement [13, 14]. Results were overwhelmingly positive.

This open prospective study, in which patients have been consecutively included during one and a half years and followed up for 3 years after prosthetic insertion, was conducted from December 1997 to January 2000. Seventy-six patients received 420 implants including 145 zygomatic fixtures. The cumulative survival rate (CSR) for the zygomatic fixtures was  $97\%$  after 1 year and  $96.3\%$  after 3 years.

The protocol included a two-stage surgery with the placement of the implants and covered by the soft tissues, and a reopening 6 months later with placement of the abutments and placement of a screw-retained fixed prosthesis. The connection at the abutment level was simply that of a regular platform implant of the Brænemark system. Since this first multi-center study, additional papers have been published reporting success rates up to  $100\%$  and with up to 10 years of follow-up [15].

With the evolution of the general concepts in implant-based therapy and the appearance of immediate loading, these same concepts were applied to zygoma implant therapy around 2004. The first paper was published by Chow et al. in 2006 [16] describing a short series of patients treated with immediate placement of prostheses on the implants.

In addition, oral surgeons were confronted with more cases of severe atrophy of the premaxillary region and the impossibility to place standard implants in this site. A protocol to place four zygomatic implants, widely known as the "quad zygoma," grew from this clinical need and its use was taken up quickly [17, 18] with the four implants being immediately loaded.

# The Anatomy of the Zygomatic Bone

The anatomy of the zygoma was investigated with regard to volume, distance from the maxilla, bone quality and quantity, external convexity, and internal concavity to allow for the best insertion site and path of the implants [19-21]. In summary, the zygoma bone presents trabecular bone useful for osseointegration and strong cortical bone useful for primary stabilization. The sinus wall was investigated and a classification has been elaborated by C. Aparicio [22]. Effectively, the sinus wall can be flat or concave. Due to these particularities, the classification system of ZAGA 1, 2, 3, 4 was established.

The zygoma was also analyzed in terms of pillars and buttresses by Prado et al. [23, 24] in a review including bone strain studies and finite element models (FEM) in human and nonhuman primates. The authors concluded that the concept of a zygomatic "pillar" does not describe well the behavior of the human skeleton during biting because, during biting, especially in the molar region, the zygomatic complex is first loaded in bending and shear.

Brunski [25] estimated, in a chapter evaluating the biomechanics of tilted implants including zygoma implants, that the advantage of tilted implants is to reduce the length of prosthetic cantilevers, but that the stresses and strains will be larger with tilted implants than with straight implants. The specific benefit, therefore, of zygoma implants is that the anchorage is not at the maxillary level but in the zygoma.

Freedman [26, 27] used FEM for cases treated with two or four zygomatic implants and demonstrated that the masticatory load applied to the zygoma was diminished by the presence of adequate buccal bone around the collar of the implants.

Wen et al. [28], having analyzed three different surgical techniques, the ad modum Brænemark, the exteriorized one, as well as the extra maxillary one, confirmed that the exteriorized one appears most appropriate for the severely atrophic edentulous maxilla.

# Imaging

Although P-I Brænemark conceived the placement of the zygomatic implant using only orthopantogram (OPG) or tomography Scanora type imaging, today, with the spiral CT scan and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), irradiation doses are diminished and it is desirable to utilize these imaging modalities to plan zygoma therapy. In 1998, Verstreken et al. developed a program in 2-D and 3-D on which implants could be inserted. As described by Verstreken et al. [29], with the Nobel clinician program as well as with others, it is possible to virtually position zygoma implants during the planning stage relative to available bone and desired prosthesis location. The advantage of this program is to be prepared before surgery regarding implant length to be utilized as well as to better aware of implant positioning. This will be developed in another chapter.

# The Surgery

In 1997, the original protocol consisted of the following:

After an incision on the palatal side of the maxillary crest, the soft tissue is reflected up to the level of the zygoma. A little window in the sinus wall allows for displacement of the sinus membrane inside the sinus and with four different drills, the path of the zygoma implant is created at the level of the first or second premolar. Then, the machined self-tapping implant is inserted and stabilized in the superior cortex of the zygoma with careful focus to ensure primary stability of the implant. This protocol led to the complete trans-sinus position of a zygomatic implant. Sinuscopy was performed by Petruson [30] and published for 15 cases showing that sinusitis was not a systematic complication and that the sinus could remain healthy, findings further confirmed by Davó et al. [31]. The collar of the implant covered by a cover screw was completely buried under the soft tissues and, after 6 months, soft issues were reopened at the level of the zygomatic collar and abutments installed together with a fixed prosthesis. This protocol was followed by many surgeons with a success rate up to  $100\%$  [32, 33].

Over time, a better understanding and appreciation of the anatomy of the anterior sinus wall have been gained [22] as sustained efforts have taken place to improve prosthetic outcomes. Further, initial modification of the surgical protocol took place [34-36] so that zygoma implants emerged more on the maxillary crest in an exteriorized position (meaning the implants were no longer introduced into the sinus) [37], and, then later, in an extramaxillary position providing easier prosthetic reconstructions while avoiding the need to enter the sinus. Avoiding entry into the sinus drastically reduced problems with sinusitis that can cause oroantral fistulae and, therefore, possibly the need to remove the zygomatic implant. All these new techniques and anatomical precisions will be provided in other chapters of this book.

Relevant to these surgical changes, an interesting thesis [26, 27] with a finite element analysis showed that it was important to keep some buccal bone around the implants in order to diminish the masticatory loads on the zygoma.

The development of the quad zygoma protocol could take place, thanks to improved imaging and especially to a program like Nobel clinician that allows for the positioning of implants in 2D and 3D images. Van Steenberghe et al. [20] published a study with cadaver's heads and patients showing that the anteroposterior width of the zygoma that permitted the insertion of two zygomatic implants per zygoma would need to be  $20\mathrm{mm}$ . Even if this surgery is more demanding, more and more patients can be treated with four zygoma implants. This procedure completely restores their quality of life [17].

# Prosthetics

Since the traditional immediate loading protocol was successfully adapted to use with zygomatic implants, a provisional prosthesis made of acrylic (and that can be an adaptation of the removable prosthesis of the patient where the palatal shelf is removed) is screw-retained to the implants on the day of the surgery.

Four months later, a fixed prosthesis made of either titanium and acrylic teeth (resin hybrid) or a ceramic prosthesis is screwed onto the implants. Some practitioners prefer removable prosthesis adapted on a bar screwed on to the implants.

# Literature Review

In the initial years after 1997, most scientific publications concerning the zygoma spoke about zygoma fractures and mini plates. The first papers concerning zygomatic implants for totally edentulous patients were published in 2000 by Stevenson et al. [38] and Higuchi [39]. Today, more than 400 publications are found on PubMed/Medline including reviews and meta-analyses. Some of these reviews concern the surgical steps [40]. Others led to the potential for meta-analyses, but the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not always clear and could lead to bias. The advantage of these reviews for the readers is the compilation of many articles that could be tedious to read. But are these reviews a summary of evidence-based medicine or dentistry? For example, case reports are usually excluded, but the case report that describes an infrequent but significant complication should be noticed in a review of complications. Moreover, one systematic review selected 751 files [41] on the basis of abstracts. After filtering, 313 abstracts were selected for reading which led to the full text of 42 publications being read. Based on the eligibility criteria, only 25 of the 42 articles were included in the final review. Do these 25 papers give a true statistical analysis of the method and the results? Of note, if inclusion criteria were that a 10-year follow-up be required, there will be only one paper according to this criterion [42]. Should this single paper be credible and considered as significant?

However, different reviews have been analyzed by the author of this chapter.

Sharma and Rahul [40], in April 2013, conducted a systematic review on zygomatic implants after a PubMed search and limited to papers published in English. There is no information about the number of papers reviewed and no description of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. The authors describe zygomatic implant design, anatomic considerations, surgical considerations, and prosthetic rehabilitation. They concluded that the zygomatic implant therapy appears to be a promising development in implant technology.

In 2012, Candel-Marti et al. [43] reviewed indications for treatment, number of patients, number of implants, length, and diameter of the implants, surgical technique, prosthetic rehabilitation, success rate, complications, and patient satisfaction. Despite the fact that the number of reviewed papers was not indicated in the abstract and that the author of this chapter could not find publications in 1987, they included 16 studies with an impressive number of zygomatic implants (941 placed in 486 patients between 1987 and 2010). The authors concluded that zygomatic implants have a high success rate (89–100% with delayed loading and 96.37–100% with immediate loading) and may be a suitable alternative to other treatment protocols for the atrophic maxilla.

In 2013, Esposito and Worthington [44] raised a challenging question because they did not identify any RCT investigating whether zygomatic implants offer some advantages over alternative techniques such as bone augmentation or sinus augmentation with bone or biomaterials.

In 2014, Goiato et al. [41] published a systematic review evaluating clinical studies published between 2000 and 2012 on the follow-up survival of zygomatic implants.

As mentioned before, from a database search on 751 titles, only 25 titles were considered as clinically relevant and were included. One thousand five hundred and forty-one zygomatic implants were inserted with 33 implant removals. Interestingly, failures occurred generally during the first year and were related to recurrent acute and chronic sinusitis. However, after 36 months of follow-up, the survival rate was  $97.86\%$ .

In 2015, Wang et al. [45] published a review based exclusively on the use of four zygomatic implants. As far as the author of this chapter knows, it is the only study about four zygomatic implants, the survival of the implants being the primary outcome assessed with complications and quality of life also evaluated. The mean implant survival rate was  $96.7\%$  and the authors concluded that four zygomatic implants in severely atrophic maxillae offer a reliable treatment option.

In 2017, Tuminelli et al. [46] conducted a systematic review of implant survival, prosthesis survival, and potential complications while focusing on immediate loading protocols. From 236 titles, 38 articles were included in this review and the authors concluded that immediate loading is a reliable alternative to delayed loading for the treatment of atrophic maxilla.

In 2018, Aboul-Hosn Centenero [47] et al. published an interesting paper where survival rates of two zygomatic implants combined with standard implants in the anterior maxillae were compared to quad zygoma therapy outcomes. This is the first paper directly comparing the two protocols and showed no difference between the protocols with regard to implant survival. Clearly, the data analysis showed comparable results for the quad zygoma protocol compared to the two zygomas plus standard implants.

Concerning complications with zygomatic implants, two interesting reviews have been published. Chrcanovic et al. first published their findings regarding complications in 2013 and followed with a thorough update in 2016 [48, 49]. Inclusion criteria consisted of clinical human studies with patients receiving zygomatic implant therapy and subjects could be totally or partially edentulous or have had surgery for cancer. Clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case-and-control studies, and case series were considered and implant failure represented by complete loss of the implant. One thousand four hundred and fourteen records were obtained from which 68 were included in qualitative and quantitative analysis. A total of 4556 zygomatic implants placed in 2161 patients were included with a total of 103 failures from 68 studies.

Specific results were as follows:

The 12-year cumulative survival rate was  $95.21\%$ .  
- Most failures appeared within the 6-month postsurgical period.  
- Some studies  $(n = 26)$  evaluated immediate loading and showed a statistically lower zygomatic implant failure rate than studies  $(n = 34)$  evaluating delayed loading protocols  $(P = 0.003)$ .  
Studies  $(n = 5)$  evaluating zygomatic implants for the rehabilitation of patients after maxillary resections presented lower survival rates.  
Postoperative complications with zygomatic implants can be:

- Sinusitis:  $2.4\%$  (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8–3.0). Although sinusitis may appear early, it has also been observed long after implant placement.  
- Soft tissue infection:  $2.0\%$  (95% CI, 1.2–2.8);  
- Paresthesia:  $1.0\%$  (95% CI, 0.5–1.4);  
- Oroantral fistula:  $0.4\%$  (95% CI, 0.1–0.6).

However, complications may be underestimated because many studies failed to mention the prevalence of these complications.

In summary, Chrcanovic et al. concluded that zygomatic implants have a high survival rate after 5 years, and that the number of complications is quite low.

In 2016, Molinero-Mourelle et al. [50], through a PubMed search along with a manual search yielding 455 studies, finally selected 14 articles for further in-depth review. Despite the fact that case reports were excluded and the exclusion criteria were quite severe, the advantage of this review is that complications are reviewed and that the incidence of complications is quite low. Although complication rate and type can be influenced by surgical protocol, sinusitis is considered the most frequent complication with a prevalence of  $3.9\%$ . In cases where implants are placed bilaterally, sinusitis may affect one sinus and not the other one.

Non-osseointegrated implants appear with a  $2.9\%$  frequency. The absence or loss of osseointegration can be due to overheating of the zygomatic bone, infection, insufficient bone quantity/volume, lack of primary stability, or incorrect application of immediate loading. Local infection shows a prevalence of  $4\%$ . Fistula at the maxillary level occurs with a frequency of  $2\%$ , and paresthesia has a frequency of  $1.6\%$ .

Bruising is not always mentioned by the authors because it seems to be a regular complication of implant placement and it usually disappears without consequences. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the frequency of bruising is  $3.9\%$ . Labial laceration can be due to an absence of protection during the drilling and is not well documented. Some studies do not mention any kind of complications.

# Randomized Studies

As noted by Esposito and Worthington in 2013 [44], there was an urgent need for a randomized study concerning zygomatic implants. A proposition was raised in 2014 to compare the advantages and success rates of two rehabilitation procedures of the very atrophic maxilla using zygomatic implants with standard implants or quad zygoma therapy versus sinus lifts with biomaterials.

The study was conducted by Esposito et al. [51] in a multicenter study with a publication reporting 4-month findings (by Esposito) and then reporting 12-month findings (by Davo et al.). Results suggest that despite the fact that more complications are described with the placement of zygomatic implants, a more favorable outcome appears with zygomatic implants in terms of survival rates since a smaller number of implant and prosthesis failures occurred with zygomatic implants. Of course, longer follow-up is needed, but it is already known that the complications except sinusitis occur in the first months postoperatively. Therefore, it is anticipated that the initial promising results with zygoma implants will ensue over time [52].

# Conclusions

Extensively developed over the past 20 years, the zygoma concept conceived by P-I Brænemark for the totally edentulous patient without discontinuity of the maxilla, may today be considered the treatment of choice for the significantly atrophic maxilla due to improvement in quality of life and lower costs, shorter time for rehabilitation and less surgery and prosthodontic work needed [53]. Scientific evidence demonstrates that the technique is reliable and predictable. For the clinician, excellent clinical expertise with a good knowledge of the anatomy in three dimensions is necessary, along with an understanding of the physiology of the sinus and the biomechanics of the prosthetic reconstruction. Even if standard implants and zygoma implants share the commonality of an external hexagon restorative platform, the anchorage mechanism is fundamentally different. The primary stability of zygoma implants is mandatory and careful attention to establish a harmonious occlusion is a key factor in the success of zygoma implant-based therapy. Future improvements are likely, given the possibilities afforded by guided surgery and navigation.
