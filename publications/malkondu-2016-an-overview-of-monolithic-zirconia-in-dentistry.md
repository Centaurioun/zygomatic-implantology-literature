# ABSTRACT

Zirconia restorations have been used successfully for years in dentistry owing to their biocompatibility and good mechanical properties. Because of their lack of translucency, zirconia cores are generally veneered with porcelain, which makes restorations weaker due to failure of the adhesion between the two materials. In recent years, all-ceramic zirconia restorations have been introduced in the dental sector with the intent to solve this problem. Besides the elimination of chipping, the reduced occlusal space requirement seems to be a clear advantage of monolithic zirconia restorations. However, scientific evidence is needed to recommend this relatively new application for clinical use. This mini-review discusses the current scientific literature on monolithic zirconia restorations. The results of in vitro studies suggested that monolithic zirconia may be the best choice for posterior fixed partial dentures in the presence of high occlusal loads and minimal occlusal restoration space. The results should be supported with much more in vitro and particularly in vivo studies to obtain a final conclusion.

# Introduction

Metal ceramic restorations are a type of ceramic system for fixed prosthetic rehabilitation that has been widely used since the early 1960s.[1] They have superior physical properties, and their marginal and internal adaptation and aesthetics are clinically acceptable.[1-4] However, light reflecting from the opaque porcelain used to mask the metal, particularly at the cervical third of the restoration causes a light grey appearance of the adjacent gingival tissue. This phenomenon led researchers to search for more aesthetic solutions to produce fixed prostheses. Although the first feldspathic porcelain crown was introduced to the field of dentistry by Land [5] in 1903, the development of metal-free ceramics only gained speed after the first attempt to strengthen feldspathic porcelain by adding  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  by McLean [6] in 1965. Since then, several types of full ceramic systems have been developed to meet the demands of both patients and dentists for highly aesthetic and natural-appearing restorations. However, some of the mechanical properties of these materials, such as brittleness, crack propagation, fracture toughness, low tensile strength, wear resistance, marginal accuracy and difficulty of repair, have limited their clinical use.[7] Zirconia was introduced in dentistry in the early 1990s and has been used as a core material to support more aesthetic ceramic materials. Zirconia shows similar mechanical properties to stainless steel [8] and the highest ones among ceramics used in dentistry. As the strongest and toughest of all dental ceramics,[9] zirconia has 900–1200 MPa flexural strength, and 9–10 MPa·m $^{1/2}$  fracture toughness.[10] These characteristics enable the manufacturing of posterior fixed partial dentures (FPDs) with diminished core thickness. Clinical failure of zirconia-supported restorations, regardless of the applied zirconia veneer system, is mostly due to chipping of the veneering ceramic (cohesive fractures within the veneering ceramic).[10] The rates of chipping of zirconia veneering ceramics have been reported to be  $2\% - 9\%$  for single crowns after 2–3 years and  $3\% - 36\%$  for FDPs after 1–5 years.[11,12] Differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the zirconia substructure and the veneering ceramic,[13] improper framework design, rapid cooling rates and low fracture toughness and flexural strength of veneering ceramic compared to the zirconia core have been considered as the cause of this cohesive failure.[14–17] In addition, the amount of the occlusal load, the size and location of occlusal contacts [18] and the thickness of the porcelain [19] are thought to play a role in this failure. Various techniques have been used to prevent veneering failure. Some of these are sintering high-strength computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-fabricated veneering porcelain cap onto zirconia coping,[20] applying veneering ceramic via pressing it over to zirconia copings (press-on technique),[21] and in addition to press-on veneering ceramic, layering veneer ceramics on zirconia copings (double veneering technique).[22] Recently, there has emerged a trend of fabrication of full-contour zirconia restoration to avoid veneering failure as an alternative to the aforementioned methods. To increase the translucency and aesthetics of full-contour zirconia, some modifications, such as the sintering temperature, fabrication processes and addition of colouring liquids, have been applied. These modifications may affect the mechanical and autocatalytic surface-transformation (low-temperature degradation (LTD)) properties of zirconia.[23] This mini-review examines the current scientific literature on the performance of monolithic zirconia (full-contour zirconia).



# In vitro studies

The performance of monolithic zirconia has been extensively studied in vitro, since such studies are fast, repeatable, relatively inexpensive and simple and also allow precise control of the environment. Over the last five years, most in vitro studies have focused mainly on the effect of surface treatment on the wear of the material itself and/or antagonists,[24-35] surface roughness,[24,25,27,34,36-38] fracture resistance,[35,39-45] flexural strength,[23,44,46] chipping resistance,[23] compressive strength,[44] elastic modulus,[44] hardness,[33] laser transmission,[47] LTD [48] and CTE-generated stress fields in monolithic zirconia,[49] translucency and colour (Table 1).[35,46,50-56] Although the results from in vitro studies may not fully reflect the clinical performance of the materials due to the complexity of the clinical

environment, they have still contributed to the accumulation of a growing body of useful information on the performance of monolithic zirconia.

# Wear

The effect of different surface treatments of monolithic zirconia on antagonists has been extensively studied in recent years because the use of zirconia without porcelain overlay became popular.[24-35] For example, in a study by Sabrah et al., [24] polished zirconia was shown to cause the least wear on synthetic hydroxyapatite in a two-body rotating pin-on-disk wear test as compared to glazed and as-machined zirconia (1.3, 2.7 and  $2.7\mathrm{mm}^3$  respectively). Janyavula et al. [25] evaluated the wear of polished or glazed zirconia, polished then reglazed zirconia, enamel and veneering porcelain on enamel, using an Alabama wear-testing device. The authors reported that the volume loss of enamel was least in the polished zirconia group  $(0.11\pm 0.04\mathrm{mm}^3$  at 200,000 cycles and  $0.21\pm 0.05\mathrm{mm}^3$  after 400,000 cycles). Glazed and polished then reglazed zirconia showed significant opposing enamel wear  $(0.59\pm 0.1\mathrm{mm}^3$  and  $0.87\pm 0.21\mathrm{mm}^3$  at 200,000 cycles and  $0.4\mathrm{~0.88}\pm 0.12\mathrm{~mm}^3$  and  $1.18\pm 0.2\mathrm{~mm}^3$  after 400,000 cycles). The most pronounced enamel wear was observed for veneering porcelain  $(1.46\pm 0.5\mathrm{mm}^3$  and  $2.15\pm 0.5\mathrm{mm}^3$  at 200,000 and 400,000 cycles, respectively). Thus, the authors concluded that polished zirconia is wear-friendly for the opposing teeth. Kontos et al. [26] tested the wear capacity of zirconia after various surface treatments using an Alabama wear-testing device. Polished zirconia had a low wear effect  $(66\pm 23\mu \mathrm{m})$  on the antagonist steatite ball, whereas, glazed zirconia had the highest wear effect  $(85\pm 33\mu \mathrm{m})$ . Kim et al. [27] investigated the volume loss of enamel and feldspathic porcelain after simulated mastication against three types of monolithic zirconia, heat-pressed ceramic and feldspathic porcelain. The zirconia specimen caused the least wear volume of the enamel (Prettau, Lava and Rainbow:  $0.04\pm 0.02$ ,  $0.04\pm 0.02$  and  $0.04\pm 0.02\mathrm{~mm}$  respectively), but the difference in wear compared to the other specimens (e.max Press,  $0.06\pm 0.03$  and VitaOmega 900,  $0.11\pm 0.03$  ) tested was not significant. In the study by Sripetchdanond and Leevaloj,[28] the enamel wear mean depth caused by monolithic zirconia  $(1.83\pm 0.75\mathrm{~mm})$  was significantly lower than that caused by glass ceramic  $(7.32\pm 2.06\mathrm{~mm})$  and enamel  $(10.72\pm 6.31$  and  $8.81\pm 5.16\mathrm{~mm})$ . Another study by Jung et al. [29] reported that polished zirconia caused less wear  $(0.031\pm 0.033\mathrm{~mm}^3)$  on enamel when tested with a chewing simulator than glazed zirconia  $(0.078\pm 0.063\mathrm{~mm}^3)$ . The polished zirconia full-coverage crown without glazing was, therefore, more effective in reducing antagonistic teeth wear. In accordance with previous results, Amer et al. [30] found that polished crystal zirconia  $(4.2 \pm 1.27 \mathrm{~mm}^{2})$  resulted in less wear of the antagonist enamel than the glazed surface  $(5.58 \pm 0.66 \mathrm{~mm}^{2})$  after the three-body wear test. The two-body wear test of monolithic zirconia showed similar results. A lower wear rate on enamel antagonists was found in the polished monolithic zirconia group (manually polished zirconia;  $27.3 \pm 15.2 \mathrm{~mm}$  and mechanically polished zirconia;  $28 \pm 11.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) compared to the glazed (glazed with a glaze ceramic;  $118 \pm 30.9 \mathrm{~mm}$ ). However, it caused higher rates of enamel cracks.[31] Polished zirconia showed similar results against steatite antagonist in a two-body wear test in a study by Preis et al. [32] In another two-body wear test, monolithic zirconia showed no material wear and low wear of the enamel antagonist. In addition, monolithic zirconia behaved similarly or better in terms of tooth brushing wear than natural enamel.[33]


Glazed zirconia caused greater wear (mean height of  $84.9\mu \mathrm{m}$ , volume loss of  $9.9~\mathrm{mm}^3$ ) on the antagonist Empress than as-machined zirconia (mean height of  $68.4\mu \mathrm{m}$ , volume loss of  $7.6~\mathrm{mm}^3$ ), whereas, they showed similar wear effect on e.max.[34] In contrast, Beuer et al. [35] reported that polished zirconia showed more contact wear at stainless steel antagonist than glazed and veneered zirconia, using a special wear method in the chewing simulator (120,000 mechanical cycles, 5 kg load, 0.7 mm sliding movement, 320 thermocycles).

Taken together, these reports illustrate that the type of restoration materials and the surface conditions obviously have an impact on the wear potential of the restorative materials. Based on the results from in vitro studies, it could be concluded that polished zirconia seems to be used safely as an antagonist to enamel or feldspathic porcelain.

# Surface roughness

Surface roughness could affect the amount of wear on natural enamel antagonists. Different surface treatment methods of a restoration result in different roughness values. With regard to this issue, Sabrah et al. [24] found that the glazed surfaces  $(R_{a}:0.42\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $R_{q}:0.63\mu \mathrm{m})$  were the smoothest among the fired ones  $(R_{a}:0.84\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $R_{q}:1.13\mu \mathrm{m})$ , the surfaces finished using diamond burs  $(R_{a}:0.89\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $R_{q}:1.20\mu \mathrm{m})$  and those polished after finishing with diamond burs  $(R_{a}:0.49\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $R_{q}:0.76\mu \mathrm{m})$ . Janyavula et al. [25] reported that glazed zirconia  $(R_{a}:0.76\pm 0.12\mu \mathrm{m})$  and polished and then glazed zirconia  $(R_{a}:0.69\pm 0.1\mu \mathrm{m})$  had smoother surfaces than enamel  $(2.6\pm 1.1\mu \mathrm{m})$  and veneered zirconia  $(1.6\pm 0.16\mu \mathrm{m})$  but were rougher than polished zirconia  $(R_{a}:0.17\pm$

0.07  $\mu$ m). The surface roughnesses of three different brands of polished zirconia (Prettau, Lava and Rainbow;  $R_{a}$ : 0.284 ± 0.052, 0.459 ± 0.075 and 0.411 ± 0.034  $\mu$ m, respectively) were found to be greater than that of e-max press (0.249 ± 0.015  $\mu$ m) but less than that of feldspathic porcelain ( $R_{a}$ : 0.704 ± 0.094  $\mu$ m) in a study by Kim et al. [27] As-machined monolithic zirconia showed significantly higher mean roughness values ( $R_{a}$  = 0.83  $\mu$ m,  $R_{q}$  = 1.09  $\mu$ m) than glazed zirconia ( $R_{a}$  = 0.53  $\mu$ m,  $R_{q}$  = 0.78  $\mu$ m) in the study by Luangruangrong et al. [34] Hmaidouch et al. [36] found that the maximum roughness depth ( $R_{\max}$ ): the perpendicular distance between the highest peak and lowest valley of the roughness profile within the measurement line) of glazed zirconia (4.311 ± 0.93  $\mu$ m) was higher than that of fine-polished zirconia surfaces (2.41 ± 0.51  $\mu$ m) but not statistically significant.

Preis et al. [37] investigated the surface properties (roughness, composition and phase transformation) of monolithic zirconia after dental adjustment procedures (grinding and polishing) and wear simulation. The findings of the study revealed that grinding significantly increased the roughness of sintered zirconia, whereas, polishing significantly reduced  $R_{a}$ . Wear had little effect on roughness and no influence on phase transformation. Amer et al. [38] reported that surface roughness of monolithic zirconia did not change after being subjected to three-body wear-opposing human enamel as conventional feldspathic porcelain.

Overall, these results indicate that zirconia restorations are required to be polished intra-orphally after the final occlusal adjustments.

# Fracture resistance

The fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia has been explored by different authors, since it has been recommended to use full-contour zirconia especially in load-bearing areas. Preis et al. [39] evaluated the failure and fracture resistance of three-unit zirconia-based FPDs under the influence of different surface treatments (veneering and glazing) and adjustment (polishing and grinding) procedures. All the groups were subjected to thermal cycling (TC) and mechanical loading (ML). Except for one group, all the groups were anatomically designed. Sintering, sandblasting and glazing procedures were performed on the specimens of the control group without TC and ML. The authors [39] observed no failure of FDPs during TC and ML conducted in a chewing simulator, but wear occurred at contact points. The median fracture force ranged between 1173.5 and  $1316.0\mathrm{N}$  without significant differences either between the groups, or in comparison to the control. Full-contour polished or glazed zirconia FDPs might be an alternative to veneered restorations because of their high resistance to failure and fracture. Zesewitz et al. [40] used single monolithic zirconia crown (MZC), monolithic lithium disilicate and monolithic feldspar ceramic in their study. Monolithic zirconia showed the highest fracture resistance of all the samples studied under axial loading. The highest mean fracture force was reported as  $5.620\mathrm{N}$  for zirconia crowns. Beuer et al. [35] tested the load-bearing capacity of full-contour zirconia with different surface treatments. Polished, sintered and glazed zirconia showed a significantly higher load-bearing capacity than conventional veneering. The authors found no significant difference in the fracture load between polished and glazed zirconia, while sintered zirconia had a significantly lower load-bearing capacity than polished zirconia and glazed zirconia. The mean fracture load for both polished and glazed zirconia was above 10,000 N, which is higher than most values reported in the literature. The authors ascribed this result to the abutment material, which was metal, and the diameter of the loading piston (tungsten ball with a  $10.0\mathrm{mm}$  diameter).


Sun et al. [41] performed a load-to-fracture test to evaluate the load-bearing capacity of monolithic zirconia with different thicknesses. The fracture load for MZCs (1.5 mm), calculated as  $4109.93 \pm 610.18\mathrm{N}$ , was found to be significantly higher than that of monolithic lithium disilicate (1863.16 ± 116.81 N), metal ceramic (2284.77 ± 355.60 N) and layered zirconia (2308.0 ± 510.94 N). The value of the fracture load of monolithic zirconia decreased with reduced material thickness (3068.31 ± 233.88 N for MZC (1.2 mm), 2429.88 ± 315.03 N for MZC (1.0 mm), 1814.60 ± 68.21 N for MZC (0.8 mm) and 1308.38 ± 111.38 N for MZC (0.6 mm)). The fracture mode was catastrophic failure for MZCs, which indicates better resistance to fracture load than veneered crowns.

In a study by Nakamura et al., [42] the effect of the axial and occlusal thickness of MZCs on the fracture load was tested. The fracture resistance of MZCs with reduced thickness was compared with that of monolithic lithium disilicate crowns with regular thickness. The load-to-failure test revealed that the fracture load of the zirconia crowns with occlusal thickness of  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ $(5558\pm 522\mathrm{N})$  was significantly higher than that of lithium disilicate crowns with occlusal thickness of  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$ $(3147\pm 409\mathrm{N})$ . The axial wall thickness did not affect the fracture resistance of MZCs.

High translucent zirconia crowns (two different brands) were found to have higher fracture resistance (2795 and 3038 N) than heat-pressed monolithic lithium disilicate crowns (1856 N), porcelain-veneered zirconia crowns (2229 N) and porcelain-veneered high translucent zirconia (1480 and 1808 N) in a study by Johansson et al. [43]. Kok et al. [44] reported that implant-supported anatomic contour zirconia crowns (LAVA Plus) showed a higher initial load to failure (6065 N) than veneered lithium disilicate (2788 N).


The influence of LTD (autoclaved at  $134^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for 0-200 h) and cyclic loading (300 N for 240,000 cycles) on fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia was studied by Nakamura et al. [45] The fracture load of the crowns significantly decreased from 5683 to 3975 N after LTD induced by autoclaving. The effect of cyclic loading on fracture load was not statistically significant.

Generally, the results from in vitro studies show that MZCs exhibit high fracture resistance even at minimum thicknesses. Therefore, they could be used in load-bearing areas without the chipping problem as frequently observed in their veneered counterpart.

# Chipping resistance, flexural strength, compressive strength and elastic modulus

In a study by Zhang et al., [23] monolithic zirconia ceramics were found to have superior chipping and flexural fracture resistance compared to glass-infiltrated zirconia, lithium disilicate and veneering porcelain. In another study conducted by Kok et al., [44] the flexural strength (1235 MPa), compressive strength and elastic modulus (113.1 GPa) of anatomic contour zirconia were found to be significantly higher than those of lithium disilicate and composite resins. Ebeid et al. [46] investigated the effect of sintering temperature on flexural strength of monolithic zirconia and found that increased sintering temperature did not change the flexural strength of monolithic zirconia. With these superior mechanical properties, monolithic zirconia suggests promising future for both durable and aesthetic restorations.

# Hardness

Mörmann et al. [33] reported that the mean hardness (Martens Hardness, MH) value of monolithic zirconia is 7996 (MH). Among the nine aesthetic CAD/CAM materials, a resin-based nanocomposite, human enamel and a zirconium dioxide ceramic had the greatest hardness. One can expect that the hardest materials would have the greatest wear potential to antagonist teeth. However, the wear potential of a material does not only depend on the hardness but also on other properties such as surface roughness. This has been confirmed by several studies which showed that the surface condition of monolithic zirconia affected the wear of antagonist enamel and restoration.


# Transmission of ER-YAG laser

Sari et al. [47] tested the erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG) laser transmission ratio through different dental ceramics with a thickness of 0.5 and  $1\mathrm{mm}$ . The transmission values decreased with increasing thickness of the ceramic sample. For both the 0.5 and  $1\mathrm{mm}$  thicknesses, monolithic zirconia showed higher transmission ratios (0.78-0.01 for  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  and 0.69-0.00 for  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ) than feldspathic ceramics (0.68-0.01 for  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  and 0.44-0.00 for  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ) and yttrium stabilized zirconia core ceramic (0.62-0.01 for  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  and 0.47-0.01 for  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ). Lithium disilicate reinforced glass ceramics had the highest transmission values (0.88-0.01 for  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  and 0.70-0.01 for  $1\mathrm{mm}$ ) regardless of the thickness. Thus, this study demonstrated that the parameters of laser irradiation should be adjusted according to the restoration material and the thickness during laser debonding of ceramic restorations.

# Low-temperature degradation

Alghazzawi et al. [48] showed that low-temperature exposure during the fabrication procedures for monolithic zirconia restorations significantly increased the surface roughness (from 12 to  $22\mathrm{nm}$ $(R_{a})$  and monoclinic phase fractions but significantly decreased the hardness (17 to  $15\mathrm{GPa}$ ) and Young's modulus (276 to  $257\mathrm{GPa}$ ). No significant effect on the yttria content and flexural strength was observed. The authors concluded that the LTD induced a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation during the fabrication of zirconia restorations. Consequently, this study suggests that food debris could be a concern due to increased surface roughness resulting from the fabrication procedures of monolithic zirconia. Therefore, surface-conditioning methods should be used to achieve a smoother surface.

# Residual thermal stress level

Bonfante et al. [49] evaluated the CTE-generated stress fields in monolithic zirconia when cooled from high-temperature processing using finite element analysis. They reported that the Y-ZTP crown showed less compressive stresses in the volume of the cusp compared to the all-ceramic crown but more than the alumina crown cusp. The least compressive stress in the volume of the material occurred in the all-metal crown. The results of this in vitro study suggest that high residual stresses in some fields of a restoration may cause fracture or cracking of materials when these areas overlap with functional occlusal stress fields.


# Effects of surface treatments on colour of monolithic zirconia

Colour was studied by Kim et al. [50,51] in two different studies. In one, they investigated the effect of the number of colouring liquid applications on the colour, translucency and opalescence of monolithic zirconia restorations.[50] A double-beam spectrophotometer was used to measure the colour and spectral distribution of the zirconia specimens. Although the colour coordinate CIE  $L^{*}$  and the opalescence parameter values decreased, CIE  $b^{*}$  increased with increasing the colouring liquid applications. However, the translucency parameter (TP) values were not significantly altered. The highest colour difference was observed between the no treatment group and the five applications of coloured liquid group ( $\Delta E_{ab}^{*}$  of 15.7). The authors concluded that repeated application of coloured liquid causes the zirconia to become darker and more yellowish. In addition, the opalescence of monolithic zirconia is reduced with coloured liquid application. The authors also concluded that translucency cannot be controlled by the colouring procedure.

The other study by Kim et al. [51] investigated the effect of polishing and glazing on the colour and spectral distribution of monolithic zirconia, using reflection spectrophotometry. Significant differences were found in the colour coordinates CIE  $L^{*}$ ,  $a^{*}$  and  $b^{*}$  values and spectral reflectance between different surface treatments. The authors concluded that polishing procedures decrease the lightness of monolithic zirconia and created a perceptible colour difference. Glazing also decreased the lightness, and after this surface treatment, monolithic zirconia restorations became yellow. Thus, since the surface treatment methods and coloured liquid application may cause deviations in the final colour of a restoration, clinicians should take this into consideration when selecting the shade of restoration.

# Translucency

Beuer et al. [35] reported that the light transmission of the polished zirconia full-crown, determined by direct transmission in an industrial spectrophotometer, was significantly higher than that of glazed and veneered zirconia. In another study, Ilie et al. [52] compared the amount of light transmission through translucent zirconia and conventional zirconia and glass ceramic with respect to material thickness and different polymerizing modes. The study revealed that zirconia was less translucent (the light passing through specimens ranged from

48.4 to  $102.6\mathrm{mW/cm}^2$  ) than glass ceramic (190.3-536.7  $\mathrm{mW/cm}^2$ ) and the translucency decreased with increased material thickness. The irradiance transmission was affected by the polymerizing mode of the light-emitting diode polymerizing unit. The results were consistent with another study by the same authors.[53] Another study by Sulaiman et al. [54] reported that zirconia thickness affects the degree of conversion of luting cement and more polymerizing time may be needed for some brands of zirconia. Harianawala et al. [55] observed that the transmittance value of translucent zirconia was significantly lower than that of lithium disilicate. Ebeid et al. [46] investigated the effect of sintering temperature on the translucency of monolithic zirconia restorations. The results indicated that increased sintering time and temperature lead to increased translucency (the contrast ratio decreased from 0.75 to 0.68). Wang et al. [56] reported that the TP values of the zirconia ceramics ranged from 5.5 to 15.1 for thicknesses ranging from 1.0 to 0.4 mm.

Although the translucency of zirconia has increased in recent years with improved technology, it is not comparable to glass ceramics. The results from the studies indicate that care should be taken in selecting the shade and polymerizing modes.

# In vivo studies

Although in vitro studies are fast, simple and inexpensive and generally avoid the ethical and legal issues, they may not replicate the oral environment exactly and misleading results may be obtained. That is why, to obtain more reliable results, in vivo studies are needed. In their in vivo study, Stober et al. [57] evaluated the enamel wear caused by MZCs under clinical conditions (20 MZCs placed in 20 patients requiring full molar restoration). The patients had natural opposing teeth, and two natural contralateral antagonistic teeth were included. Subjects with clinical signs or/and symptoms of bruxism were excluded from the study. Tooth wear was evaluated based on plaster models made at baseline and after six months with three-dimensional (3D) laser-scanning methods. Mean vertical loss (maximum vertical loss in parentheses) was found to be 10 (43)  $\mu$ m for the zirconia crowns, 33 (112)  $\mu$ m for the opposing enamel, 10 (58)  $\mu$ m for the contralateral teeth and 10 (46)  $\mu$ m for the contralateral antagonists. The authors concluded that MZCs caused more wear on the opposing enamel than natural teeth. However, they noted that the amount of wear caused by zirconia even after six months is less than that of other ceramics based on previous studies.

In another study, Batson et al. [58] assessed the quality of CAD/CAM fabricated single tooth restorations in terms of contour, marginal adaptation, occlusion and shade, as well as the gingival response to selected CAD/ CAM materials. Ten zirconia restorations were compared to 12 metal ceramic and 10 lithium disilicate counterparts. Impressions and clinical measurements were used to compare the parameters among groups. The association among crown types and their marginal adaptation, shade or contour was not statistically significant. The gingival response did not differ among crown systems. Zirconia crowns showed the least amount of marginal discrepancy. Eighty per cent of zirconia crowns needed no occlusal adjustment.


Mundhe et al. [59] compared the wear of enamel opposing natural enamel, polished zirconia and glazed metal ceramic crowns one year after the cementation. A total of 36 crowns were placed in 10 participants and evaluated from casts by 3D analysis software. The occlusal wear of the antagonistic enamel one year after the cementation of metal ceramic crowns ranged from  $69.20 \pm 4.10$  to  $179.70 \pm 8.09 \mathrm{~mm}$ , whereas, for zirconia crowns, it was from  $42.10 \pm 4.30$  to  $127.00 \pm 5.03 \mathrm{~mm}$ . The occlusal wear of natural enamel opposing natural enamel ranged from  $17.30 \pm 1.88$  to  $35.10 \pm 2.60 \mathrm{~mm}$ .

The results from these in vivo studies suggest that zirconia restorations could be used as an antagonist to enamel with good marginal adaptation, contour and minimum gingival response. However, the number of in vivo studies is still limited and further studies are needed.

# Clinical reports

Implant-supported fixed-dental prosthesis with monolithic zirconia have been reported to serve successfully up to four years with pleasing aesthetics.[60-67] In an 18-month follow-up study, Chang et al.[68] stated that zirconia cylinders may be exposed to excessive stress when screw retained zirconia restorations were fabricated. Inlay retained fixed-dental prosthesis using monolithic zirconia has been recommended as a clinical alternative to traditional full-coverage fixed-dental prosthesis and implant-supported crowns.[69] The clinical reports indicate that monolithic zirconia has a very high expectancy of surviving for a long time when treatment planning and case selection are done properly.

# Conclusions

Taken together, the reviewed reports suggest that monolithic zirconia may present some clinical advantages over veneered zirconia restorations. While selecting a restorative material, the wear of natural dentition is an important factor, particularly in the presence of paraphunctional habits. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that polished zirconia causes less wear on enamel than glazed zirconia and glazed-veneering porcelain. Considering its high mechanical strength, polished monolithic zirconia is the best candidate for posterior FPDs in the presence of grinding or clenching. However, it should be noted that although the mechanical properties are still clinically acceptable, zirconia shows increased LTD in the presence of wetness and the long-term results are not well known. Dental adjustment procedures after cementation may also increase the wear of antagonist enamel by increasing the surface roughness. To prevent this situation, zirconia should be polished afterwards.


Limited occlusal crown space may be another case in which monolithic zirconia should be used due to its higher fracture resistance compared to veneered counterparts and other monolithic ceramics even at minimum thicknesses. As an anterior restoration, although it has improved translucency, the effect of surface treatment and coloured liquid application procedures on the colour of monolithic zirconia restorations should be kept in mind while selecting the shade of the restoration. These procedures can cause perceptible colour difference. Based on the data considered in this review, further studies should be conducted both in vitro and particularly in vivo with larger sample sizes and over longer periods of time. Moreover, ways to improve the aesthetic properties of MZCs other than translucency, such as texture and opalescence, need to be investigated.
