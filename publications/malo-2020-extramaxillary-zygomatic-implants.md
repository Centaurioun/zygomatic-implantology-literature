# The All-on-4 $^{\circ}$  Concept

The All-on-4® treatment concept was developed in the 1990s to rehabilitate the completely edentulous maxilla through a full arch fixed prosthesis supported by implants used for immediate function without any grafting or additional surgeries. The protocol delivers a fixed prosthesis on the same day of surgery aiming for reduced chair-time and fewer surgical and biomechanical complications. By placing four implants, two anterior (axial implants) and two posterior implants distally tilted between  $30^{\circ}$  and  $45^{\circ}$ , it is possible to achieve an optimal implant position that provides an even distribution of occlusal forces and reduced cantilever extensions that otherwise would risk failure of osseointegration of the distal implants [1-3]. The All-on-4® concept has proven to be very effective even in more challenging cases of bone atrophy [4-6]. Furthermore, in situations of extreme atrophy that contraindicates the placement of only conventional implants, it is still possible to apply the All-on-4® concept through either a combination of conventional and zygomatic implants (All-on-4® Hybrid) or “end line cases” with the insertion of four zygomatic implants (All-on-4® Extramaxilla) [7-12] (Figs. 1 and 2).

The extensive bone atrophy present in patients who need to be rehabilitated with zygomatic implants, associated with rehabilitation performed through a classical surgical technique and, depending on the maxillary anatomy, may cause prosthetic screw exit to be located on the palate and predispose to aesthetic, phonetic, and oral

# Principles/Clinical Rationale

With an extra-maxillary surgical approach, zygomatic implants are placed extramaxillary and extra-sinusally (avoiding the sinus), with only zygomatic anchorage attained [7-10]. Despite the zygomatic implant being anchored exclusively in the zygomatic bone with this surgical approach, the implant will engage a larger thickness of the zygomatic bone compared with the classic approach due to the implant position being more superficial and external [11, 13].

In this technique [7], the zygomatic implant osteotomy typically starts buccally on the residual crest, creating a buccal groove, followed by a channel-shaped

Using an extra-maxillary approach with the NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  implant (Nobel Biocare AB) allows the head of the implant to be located buccally to the crest in an excellent prosthetic position. This "less bulky" reconstruction provides patients with increased comfort, less phonetic complications, and improved hygienic capabilities. Despite being an extra-maxillary approach with a portion of the implant covered only by soft tissue, the bone preparation creates a "channel" on the external wall of the sinus where the implant fits, closing the communication between sinus and the oral environment as well as creating desirable conditions for promotion of osseointegration at the edges of the "channel" (Fig. 3). This technique was developed to be used with immediate function provided an insertion torque above  $30\mathrm{Nm}$  is achieved.

# Implant Design: NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  Implant

The NobelZygoma  $0^{\circ}$  implant used in the extra-maxillary technique features a special design. The implant has a diameter of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in the apical third, an anodized oxidized surface, no threads in the coronal third of the implant (aiming for less chronic inflammation compared to a threaded surface as well as to increase

# Immediate Function with Extra-Maxillary Zygomatic Implants

The immediate provisional prosthesis is extremely important for patients treated with zygomatic implants. The goals are to provide good aesthetics as well as masticatory and speech function during the healing phase. Additional advantages of placing a provisional prosthesis include placement of the abutments at the time of implant placement dispensing for a second surgery and, therefore, mitigating the risk of establishing an oroantral communication in case of rupturing the tissues around the implant head (multiple connection/disconnection of trans-epithelial components has been hypothesized to imply a slow establishment of the soft tissue barrier and an increased risk of oroantral communication) [14]. In addition, placement of the final abutment at the time of implant placement improves the ability of screws being tightened to an increased force of  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$  and reducing the risk of loosening. Finally, connecting all the zygomatic implants together, and especially in

All-on-4 Extramaxilla cases, is important for cross-arch stress distribution of occlusal forces from a biomechanical point of view.

# Biomechanical Considerations

In the classic approach, despite the zygomatic implant crossing four cortices (alveolar crest, maxillary sinus floor, maxillary sinus roof, and zygomatic upper border), it is known that even if the first stage of osseointegration occurs in all areas, the most coronal anchorage is lost over time and, mechanically, the behavior is similar to what is expected from the extra-maxillary approach where an implant is anchored only in the zygomatic bone. For this reason, zygomatic implants have been reported to bend under horizontal loading and an inverse correlation observed between increasing implant length and decreasing amount of supporting bone. This scenario led Brænemark to advise that, whenever possible, two stable conventional implants be placed [15].

However, the zygomatic implants used in the All-on-4® Extramaxilla or All-on-4® Hybrid approaches are always loaded using a provisional prosthesis that acts as a splint during immediate function and, ultimately, followed by a definitive prosthesis using the same principle. This procedure is used to distribute axial and lateral loads and to stabilize the rehabilitation through cross-arch stabilization [16]. This procedural benefit is supported by three-dimensional finite element analysis of stress distribution in craniofacial structures of zygomatic osseointegrated implants, demonstrating that occlusal forces are mainly supported by the zygomatic bone. Specifically, the model shows that when implants are connected, stress does not concentrate around the alveolar bone supporting zygomatic implants, but is otherwise transferred through the infra-zygomatic crest and is divided between the temporal and frontal process of the zygomatic bone in several directions [17].

# Advantages of the Extra-Maxillary Approach

In brief, the potential advantages of zygomatic implants being placed via an extramaxillary surgical technique are:

- Faster, simpler, and less invasive procedure with fewer surgical steps compared to the classical surgical technique.  
- Improved prosthetic screw exit (zygomatic implant head emerging at the center of alveolar crest), reducing the prosthesis thickness and providing a more hygienic, comfortable and phonetic prosthesis.  
- A shorter cantilever (distal and buccal) as the implant emerges on the crestal ridge in the first molar region and, therefore, a stronger prosthesis (more fracture resistant).  
- More implant-bone contact in the zygomatic bone that leads to a reduced lever arm and, therefore, improving the outcomes of immediate function.  
- Reduced manipulation of the sinus membrane and, consequently, a lower risk of sinusitis.

# Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Zygomatic implants are considered as a treatment choice when the patient has a bone volume/ridge with less than  $5\mathrm{mm}$  of width by  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of height, from canine to canine region which is the mandatory bone volume needed for the standard All-on-4®. Whenever the maxillary bone quantity in the posterior region does not meet the previously mentioned protocol, but the bone proximal to the midline is maintained (C-VI, Cawood, and Howell classification), two extra-maxillary zygomatic implants should be placed in the posterior region in combination with two standard implants in the anterior region (All-on-4® Hybrid) [7]. In situations in which the residual bone crest does not fulfill the minimum prerequisite to allow a standard maxillary implant placement proximal to the midline (more than C-VI, Cawood, and Howell Classification), only extra-maxillary zygomatic implants are used: These are the anatomical conditions that indicate use of the All-on-4® Extramaxilla protocol [7].

# Technique Description

# Treatment Planning

# Patient Examination

The treatment planning of the All-on-4® surgical protocol starts with a review of the medical history, followed by detailed clinical and radiographic examinations, intra- and extra-oral photographs and impressions (Fig. 5).

# Radiographic Evaluation

The quantity and quality of bone between maxillary sinuses is a key factor guiding the surgical All-on-4® approach whether it is for an All-on-4® Standard, Hybrid, or Extramaxilla protocol. Either an orthopantomogram and Computerized Tomography

The thickness and height of the zygomatic bone is also evaluated with 2D and 3D CBCT scan (Fig. 7). Cross-sectional images are mandatory to diagnose zygomatic bone thickness and height. The zygomatic bone is a small quadrangular bone situated on the upper part of the face, and is part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit. It articulates with the frontal, sphenoidal, temporal, and maxillary bones. It is mostly composed of cortical bone  $(\pm 83\%)$  and it is relatively narrow (average thickness between 4.4 and  $8\mathrm{mm}$ ) [18].

For greater precision in the planning of this surgery, a stereolithographic model or Nobel Clinician software is used to visualize optimal final implant position. Also, the zygomatic bone as well sinus status should be analyzed. The sinus should be carefully analyzed for radiopaque images or shadows in order to prevent the placement of zygomatic implants in patients with signs of sinusitis. If there is any sign of pathology, the patient should be sent to an otorhinolaryngologist to be treated before implant placement. Along with scrutiny of bone availability, an aesthetic study is made to evaluate parameters such as lip support (extra-oral soft tissue support), smile line, prosthetic space, and occlusal vertical dimension changes [7].

# Surgical Protocol: Step by Step

The planned surgery can be performed under local or general anesthesia depending on patient desires, health status, and case complexity.

The surgery starts with extractions (in case of remaining teeth—Fig. 8) followed by a crestal incision slightly palatally to mid-crest allowing for preservation of keratinized tissue in the buccal flap. In addition, two vertical releasing incisions are made over the zygomatic process. A mucoperiosteal (full thickness) flap is then raised until the following anatomical limits are reached: (a) nasal cavity floor in the anterior portion of the maxilla; (b) the posterior-superior edge of the zygomatic bone; and (c) and the posterior edge of the maxilla allowing for identification of the infraorbital nerve and direct observation of the inferior edge of the zygomatic bone

(Fig. 9). The infraorbital nerve is a sensory nerve responsible for innervation of the face, lower eyelids, upper lip, and nose wing. It constitutes the terminal branch of the maxillary nerve and emerges from the maxillary bone through the infra-orbital foramen with accompanying artery and vein. The surgical area available to place the implants is limited by the bone shape, as well the infra-orbital foramen position, as it is positioned below the rim of the orbit with a distance that varies widely from patient to patient. Furthermore, its distance from the infra-orbital margin as well as from the piriform aperture may render less bone available.

The zygoma retractor (Modified Austin Tissue Retractor: Hu-Friedy, Leimen, Germany) is used to retract soft tissues (Fig. 10). The palatal mucosa is also reflected about  $1\mathrm{cm}$  and sutured across the midline.

Depending on the need for bone recontouring due to a thin crest ridge or bone irregularity, a bur in combination with a Rongeur forceps (Rongeur Bayer; Hu-Friedy) may occasionally be used.

# All-on-4 $^{\circ}$  Hybrid

Whenever the maxillary bone proximal to the midline is maintained with a minimum of  $7\mathrm{mm}$  of height and  $4\mathrm{mm}$  of width, conventional implants can be placed. A midline osteotomy perpendicular to interpupillary line is performed with a  $2\mathrm{mm}$  twist drill to place the direction indicator (Nobel Biocare AB). Two straight implants are placed parallel to the direction indicator in the incisor area (Fig. 11). If low primary stability  $(<30\mathrm{N})$  and suboptimal bone availability are observed, additional implants should be placed.

The zygoma implant positions and length are determined peroperatively (although they can be evaluated before with Nobel Clinician software) according to the anatomy of the external wall of the sinus, the zygomatic bone shape, and the surrounding structures such as the infraorbital foramen and floor of the orbit. The osteotomy begins as posterior as possible keeping a safe  $3\mathrm{mm}$  distance from the posterior edge of the zygomatic bone. This posterior position allows for the placement of an additional implant in the zygoma, if needed.

The maxillary crest and the wall of the sinus are prepared first with a crestal bur (Fig. 12), followed by a diamond bur (Fig. 13), creating an implant bed and initiating the path into the residual crest and directed outside the sinus until reaching the zygomatic bone. This can also be performed by using an ultrasound piezo device (EMS piezo, Nylon, Switzerland). Both instruments are less aggressive to the Schneiderian membrane that must be kept intact. In order to achieve this, it is mandatory that before starting the drilling sequence, the membrane is carefully retracted  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  along the "channel" from the internal wall of the sinus (Fig. 14). This "channel" facilitates access and an optimal path to the zygomatic bone for the implant drills without any tissue interference and often helps to "buttress" the implant against the external maxillary wall.

The zygomatic portion of the sinus is probed allowing further definition with a round bur and subsequent drill directions. The round bur is used to make an entrance mark on the medial surface of the zygomatic bone (Fig. 15). After this, the  $2.9\mathrm{-mm}$

During the procedure, the surgeon's middle finger (of the hand holding the retractor) is positioned at the external surface of the upper edge of the zygomatic bone to feel the preparation of the external cortical bone to prevent damage to overlying soft tissues.

After considering the thickness and density of the zygomatic bone, the sequence of drills is continued as follows: 3.5, 4.0, and  $4.4\mathrm{mm}$  twist drills (Nobel Biocare AB) (Fig. 16). A calibrated probe is inserted and the length of the zygoma implant is measured from the zygoma's posterior-superior cortical extension to the maxillary crest (Fig. 17).

Due to the type/density of the bone in this area, the adjusted drilling protocol as well as the new shape of the Zygoma implant, these implants can easily achieve sufficient primary stability to perform immediate function ( $>30$  Ncm) as they engage the outer cortex of the zygomatic bone (2.2 mm on the tip). Usually, the

# All-on-4° Extramaxilla

When the anterior maxilla is severely resorbed preventing the placement of any conventional implant, the All-on-4® Extramaxilla is required. In this situation, assuming that the zygomatic bone shape and surgical area (limited anteriorly by the infra-orbital foramen and posteriorly by the posterior edge of the maxilla) are sufficient, two more zygomatic implants are placed bilaterally following the same drilling protocol previously described (Fig. 21).

When two bilateral zygomatic implants are needed, a minimum distance of  $5\mathrm{mm}$  is maintained between the implants, with the posterior implant serving as reference. Especially in All-on-4® Extramaxilla, particular attention is given to the infraorbital foramen and the base of the orbit to avoid damaging these anatomical structures during implant site preparation and placement.

Because the distance between the posterior-superior zygoma edge and the maxillary crest is shorter in the posterior region, the posterior zygomatic implant is usually shorter than the anterior zygomatic implant.

The emergence of the implants depends on their 3D inclination, which depends on the shape of the atrophied maxilla and the patient's facial morphology. The emergence of the distal implant head varies in position from the first molar to the second premolar, while the anterior implant's head emerges between the canine and the lateral incisor. Despite a clear improvement in the emergence of the implant head

Following implant placement, abutments are connected. The implants are selected and placed in order to be level at the same crystal height and to promote correct emergence of the prosthetic screws in the interim and definitive fixed prostheses. Buccal soft tissue should not be reduced; otherwise, insufficient keratinized tissue may result around the abutments or lead to buccal muscle tension.

After suturing, open tray multi-unit impression copings are screwed to the abutments and splinted through means of steel wire and pattern resin (GC Corp, Tokyo, Japan). The impression is made using only putty consistency elastomer (Zhermack Co, Rovigo, Italy). Once impressions are removed, healing caps are screwed to the abutments to support the peri-implant mucosa while the definitive prosthesis is being fabricated.

After this, a high-density acrylic resin prosthesis (PalaXpress Ultra, Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau; Germany) with titanium cylinders (Nobel Biocare AB) is connected to the abutments using screw retention and occlusal adjustments performed to establish bilateral and stable occlusal contact in centric relation (Fig. 22).

Antibiotic, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medication (to start after the corticosteroid therapy given in a regressive mode), analgesics, and gastric protector are prescribed for patients for 15 days. Patients are instructed to eat a soft food diet for 2 months and to use a chlorhexidine or hyaluronic acid gel in their daily dental hygiene routine for the first 2 months. To clean the prosthesis, patients are instructed to use a toothbrush and dental floss. The use of an oral irrigator is discouraged since it can lead to rupture of the seal around the implant.

Patients are included in a follow-up protocol according to the MALOCLINIC protocol and evaluated clinically (at 10 days, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months, 1 year, and every 4 months thereafter) and radiographically (at 10 days, 4 months, and 1-year follow-up visits, and yearly thereafter) [7-11]. The prosthesis is removed at each follow-up appointment to perform clinical assessments and prophylaxis.

# Definitive Prostheses

Considering patient preference, either a metal-ceramic implant-supported fixed prosthesis with titanium framework and all-ceramic crowns (MALO CLINIC Ceramic bridge, utility model no. 10759) or a metal-acrylic resin implant-supported fixed prosthesis with a titanium framework and acrylic resin prosthetic teeth (MALO CLINIC Acrylic Bridge) are used to replace the provisional prosthesis after a minimum of 6 months post-surgery healing time. The extra-maxillary surgical approach allows a less palatal exit of the prosthetic screws (Fig. 23).

Special care must be taken to reduce the contact surface between natural and artificial gingiva creating a more convex base as possible. In addition, it is necessary to remove any angles, concavities, and leave the prosthesis as polished as possible to enable proper oral hygiene.

# Results

The rehabilitation of atrophic jaws using zygomatic implants with immediate function is well documented with high survival rates in medium- and long-term follow-up [9, 10]. Maló et al. [9], in a study reporting 5-year outcomes of the first sample enrolled in 2006 for the full-arch rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla through zygomatic implants in immediate function, reported a cumulative implant survival rate of  $98.8\%$ . Furthermore, Maló et al. [10], in the largest study evaluating the long-term outcomes of atrophic maxillae rehabilitated with the All-on-4 Hybrid (Nobel Biocare AB) or All-on-4 Extramaxilla (Nobel Biocare AB) in 352 patients featuring the use of extra-maxillary 747 zygomatic implants, reported a cumulative success rate of  $94.4\%$  and a cumulative survival rate of  $98.2\%$  for zygomatic implants after 7 years of follow-up. Furthermore, the same study reported a  $99.7\%$  prosthetic survival rate.

# Complications

Despite a low frequency of complications associated with the insertion of zygomatic implants, some complications may occur. It is important to acknowledge that the majority of full-arch rehabilitations of the atrophic maxillae are rehabilitated through All-on-4 standard high skill (involving the insertion of implants with dehiscences, fenestrations, trans-sinus, or pterygoid) [4-6] leaving only extreme situations to be rehabilitated via the extra-maxillary zygomatic implant approach. Such extreme inclusion criteria for full-arch atrophic maxillae rehabilitations should be taken into consideration when analyzing potential biological and mechanical complications.

# Biological Complications

Considering the largest study published on the zygomatic extra-maxillary surgical technique with 352 patients and 747 zygomatic implants with follow-up ranging between 6 months and 7 years, the biological complication rate was  $22.7\%$  [10]:

1. Maxillary sinus infection or rhinosinusitis (7.4%;  $n = 26$  patients with 21 patients with sinusitis diagnosed prior to the implant rehabilitation).  
2. Peri-implant pathology  $(15.3\%)$ $n = 54$  patients).

# Maxillary Sinus Infection: Epidemiology, Prevention, and Treatment

Maxillary sinus pathology has a low incidence in and around extramaxillary zygomatic implants (7.4%) [10], but is the most prevalent complication related to zygomatic implants described in the literature (up to 37.5%) [19, 20] being reported both soon after implant placement and over the long term.

Nevertheless, sinus infection does not seem to preclude osseointegration at the level of the zygomatic bone. Disease is manifested through several signs and symptoms with the most common divided into major and minor classes. For a patient to be diagnosed as positive for sinusitis, it is imperative for at least two of the following major criteria to be present: facial pain or pressure, facial congestion or fullness, nasal obstruction, purulent discharge, hyposmia or anosmia, purulence on (nasal) examination, and fever; or the presence of one major criteria and two of the following minor criteria: headache, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain, cough, otalgia, or aural fullness; or, alternatively, whenever a purulent discharge is observed on endoscopic examination, as this sign is pathognomonic of disease presence [21].

In cases where patients present an over-countered external maxillary sinus wall, increasing the risk of sinus membrane disruption, a three-dimensional computerized tomography scan that includes the maxillary bone, the zygomatic bone and the floor and external wall of the orbit (seen in the correct rotation) assists in predicting this risk. These patients should be informed before the surgery about the risk of membrane rupture and the consequently higher risk of developing sinusitis [8].

There seems to be a higher risk of maxillary sinus infections when rehabilitating patients with a previous diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis [7-10]. Therefore, identifying these patients is mandatory, and surgery should not be performed if any sign of pathology is present. These patients should be informed very clearly about the increased risk of maxillary sinus infection.

In case of pathology (Fig. 24), the first choice is always antibiotic therapy with quinolones or cephalosporins for 2-3 weeks, usually combined with anti-histamines and topical decongestants. In case of failure of initial therapy, the patient should be sent to an otorhinolaryngologist for diagnosis and treatment using protocols for

If an oroantral communication is present, surgical intervention is mandatory to clean the sinus of the debris originated from the mouth as well as to remove any tissue that has resulted from a reaction to the infection. Concurrently, oral surgery is performed for oroantral closure.

In case of recurrent sinus infection, after these procedures or in case of important oroantral communications, the implant must be removed even if osseointegrated. The two rescue approaches are either to cut the implant and leave the osseointegrated part in the zygomatic bone or to remove the entire implant.

# Peri-implant Pathology

According to a previous study of extra-maxillary zygomatic implants [10], the incidence rate of peri-implant pathology was  $15\%$ , which is comparable to other studies investigating fixed prosthetic rehabilitations using standard implants [22]. Furthermore, a previous study comparing oral hygiene and clinical indexes of zygomatic implants inserted through the extra-maxillary surgical technique with those of standard implants found no statistically significant differences between the two types of implants or placement protocols [11]. Soft tissue inflammation located around the base of a prosthesis or around the implants occurs with similar frequency and intensity as observed with other types of fixed rehabilitations with the main reason for soft tissue inflammation being a lack of proper and adequate oral hygiene.

The extra-maxillary approach potentially reduces the biological complication rate since it facilitates fabrication of a more narrow prosthesis and, therefore, a prosthesis that makes oral hygiene easier to perform. Biological complications of a prosthetic origin can usually be easily resolved with prosthetic modification (recontorting, polishing, and finishing). Proper oral hygiene habits and, if needed, occasional use of antibiotics and local debridement (scaling and irrigation with  $0.2\%$  chlorhexidine) are usually sufficient remedies to resolve these complications.

# Mechanical Complications

According to a previous publication on full-arch maxillary rehabilitations supported by zygomatic implants inserted using the extra-maxillary technique, it appears that mechanical complications are similar to those observed with prostheses supported by standard implants, including prosthetic screw loosening or fracture of the prostheses [10]. In this study, over a follow-up period up to 7 years, 101 patients fractured the prosthesis ( $n = 50$  patients with a provisional prostheses fracture;  $n = 51$  patients with a definitive meta-acrylic prosthesis fracture or ceramic chipping) and 53 patients had loosening of prosthetic components. Nevertheless, a third of these complications occurred in heavy bruxers diagnosed prior to the rehabilitation and

141 patients presented with an implant-supported fixed rehabilitation as the opposing dentition—two conditions that we have previously identified as posing a higher risk for the occurrence of mechanical complications [23-26].

These complications are easily resolved mending the prostheses and tightening the prostheses components (screw loosening). The occlusion should be assessed and a night guard manufactured.

When an abutment screw and abutment loosen causing inflammation of the surrounding tissues, the abutment should be removed, the head of the implant should be irrigated with saline solution, and a new sterilized abutment should be connected to the implant. In the presence of soft tissue inflammation around the zygomatic implant, it is important to evaluate if an infection is present and, if so, if it extends into the sinus.

# Future Challenges

Considering the potential of the extra-maxillary surgical technique described herein as an optimal solution to avoid bone grafting while maintaining high success and survival rates, there are additional improvements such as preparation of the maxillary sinus wall in order to preserve the sinus membrane, increasing bone-implant contact in the coronal aspect (at the maxillary crest) to enable an oroantral seal, and the development of prosthetic solutions to increase shock absorbance and decrease the potential for mechanical complications.
