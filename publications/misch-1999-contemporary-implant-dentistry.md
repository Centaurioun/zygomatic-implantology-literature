In the rapidly changing world of dental implants, it is fortuitous that the 1993 copyrighted, Contemporary Implant Dentistry has undergone a thorough update with the publication of its second edition. The new second edition has been updated with the addition of nine chapters. The text is comprised of 684 pages, plus 133 color plates in a new enlarged page-size format. The flow of the book has been improved by the reorganization of the 40 chapters into four parts by the author and 13 contributors. The implant treatment section has been divided into two parts, surgical and prostodontic, enabling the reader to more rapidly reference desired material.

The highlight of the text is Part I, a comprehensive 14-chapter overview of diagnosis and treatment planning. This part devotes 203 pages to a sequential review of terminology, patient-assessment techniques and technologies, and treatment methodologies for all types of potential dental implant patients. It provides a thorough overview of diagnosis and treatment planning, not just for the new student of dental implants, but also a meaningful review for the experienced clinician. In his preface, Dr. Misch states that "it is as important to know when not to incorporate an implant and treatment, as it is the opposite." The Diagnosis and Treatment Planning section provides an essential foundation for the implant clinician to make sound diagnostic and treatment planning judgments.

Part II of the text reviews critical scientific topics that are pertinent to the practice of implant dentistry. Many excellent contributors are utilized in this section to provide the reader with the clinically oriented scientific background necessary to make critical treatment decisions. The primary focus of the section is anatomical, physiological, pharmacological, biomechanical, and biomaterial.

The final two parts of the text are devoted to the surgical and prosthodontic aspects of dental implant care. It is important for clinicians, although specializing in the surgical or restorative facet of dental implants, to be aware of the opportunities and limitations of the other clinical discipline. The section on surgical procedures addresses not only normal anatomical conditions, but also thoroughly reviews suboptimal bone levels and augmentative procedures. The prosthodontic section addresses both screw-retained and cement-retained implant prostheses. A thorough review of occlusal considerations and progressive bone loading is also provided in this section, as is an excellent chapter on the maintenance of dental implants.

Throughout this well-illustrated text, text boxes are well placed throughout each chapter to list and highlight important information. Each chapter is well-referenced with sequential references. The text is completed with a particularly thorough 21-page subject index, which will enable the clinician to immediately index specific topics.

The second edition of Contemporary Implant Dentistry is recommended as a resource for all clini cians interested in providing dental implant care for their patients. This is a substantial implant reference text that will provide meaningful and clinically useful information for the dental student as well as for the more advanced practitioner of implant dentistry.

The second edition of Contemporary Implant Dentistry by Carl E. Misch is a comprehensive review of implant dentistry. Contributions represent a broad range of experts, and topics ranging from anatomy, engineering, materials science and pharmacology, to periodontics, orthodontics, and restorative dentistry.

The book is divided into four sections with the first section discussing indications, medical considerations, evaluation, diagnostic procedures, and treatment planning. The second section examines the scientific basis for integration of the implant in the hard and soft tissues. Section three documents the surgical considerations of not only placing implants, but also techniques for bone grafting and sinus surgery. The last section details restoration of implants with both cement-retained and screw-retained prostheses, including consideration of occlusal loading and maintenance of the implant.

The second edition of this book represents an updated review of current techniques used in implantology. This book is a comprehensive text that is beneficial to either the novice or the experienced implant practitioner.

Editors' Note: To obtain different perspectives of the same textbook, two reviews have been written by two different authors. David Cochran is a periodontist and Robert Cronin is a prosthodontist. Each review was submitted separately without one author knowing what the other would write.
