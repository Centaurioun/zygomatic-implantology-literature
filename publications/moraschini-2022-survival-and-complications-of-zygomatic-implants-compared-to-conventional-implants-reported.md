# Abstract

Background: Zygomatic implants (ZI) have been frequently indicated to rehabilitate patients with extensive atrophies in alternatives to major bone reconstructions. It can be installed inside the maxillary sinus, called intrasinus zygomatic implant (IZI) or outside the maxillary sinus (EZI), depending on the surgery technique.

Objective: To evaluate the survival and complication rates of ZI in longitudinal studies when compared with conventional implants (CI).

Methods: An electronic search was performed in five databases and in Gray literature for articles published until April, 2022. The eligibility criteria comprised observational cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 5 years of follow-up, reporting survival rate of ZI versus CI. A meta-analysis was conducted with 18 studies.

Results: A total of 5434 implants (2972 ZI and 2462 CI) were analyzed in 1709 patients. The mean survival rate was  $96.5\% \pm 5.02$  and  $95.8\% \pm 6.36$  for ZI and CI, respectively (mean follow-up time of 78 months). There were observed no statistically significant between ZI and CI in prospective studies (risk ratio [RR] of 1.21;  $95\%$  confidence intervals [Cls]: 0.28 to 5.28; chi-squared  $[\mathrm{Chi}^2] = 11.37$ ;  $I^2 = 56\%$ ; degrees of freedom  $[\mathrm{df}] = 5$ ; z-score  $= 0.25$ ;  $P = 0.80$ ), retrospective studies IZI (RR of 1.29;  $95\%$  Cls: 0.52 to 3.23;  $\mathrm{Chi}^2 = 4.07$ ;  $I^2 = 2\%$ ; df  $= 4$ ; z-score  $= 0.55$ ;  $P = 0.58$ ) and retrospective studies EZI (RR of 0.72;  $95\%$  Cls: 0.31 to 1.66;  $\mathrm{Chi}^2 = 1.99$ ;  $I^2 = 0\%$ ; df  $= 3$ ; z-score  $= 0.78$ ;  $P = 0.44$ ). The biological complications most related to ZI was sinusitis, followed by infection and oroantral communication.

Conclusion: ZI have a high long-term survival rate (96.5% with a mean of 91.5 months of follow-up), showing no significant difference when compared with CI. The most prevalent biological complication is sinusitis, being most commonly to the IZI technique. This systematic review (SR) was registered in INPLASY under number INPLASY202280025.

# Summary Box

# What is known

- Although the zygomatic implant (ZI) technique is widely used, few long-term data support ZI survival and complication rates.

# What this Study Adds

- This study analyzed a total of 2972 ZI with 102 failures (96.5% survival rate). These data show that the technique is predictable and safe in the long term, even in immediate loading.
- The survival rates of ZI and conventional implants were very similar (96.5 vs. 95.8, respectively), which suggests that ZI may have good long-term predictability.
- Sinusitis was the most reported event in the included studies. Mainly when the intrasinus ZI technique was performed.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Rehabilitation of atrophic maxilla through dental implants is a challenging procedure. Techniques such as maxillary sinus lift, guided bone regeneration, and surgical reconstruction with extraoral autogenous bone are frequently used. $^{1}$  However, despite being predictable, these techniques routinely increase the treatment time, cost, possible complications, and post-surgical morbidity, $^{2,3}$  which can decrease patient acceptance. $^{4}$

Some less severe cases can be treated with implants of reduced diameter and length, as well as by optimizing the distribution, inclination, and number of implants. However, these options are unfeasible in cases of severe atrophy. In these cases, alternatives to bone reconstruction, such as subperiosteal implants and ZI, have been proposed. These alternatives often prove to be faster and provide immediate provisional prostheses, thereby resulting in greater patient acceptance. However, in the case of subperiosteal implants, a greater number of studies with long-term follow-up are needed.

The ZI was first introduced by Brænemark et al.7 ZI are long implants that reach and anchor in the zygomatic process, a structure that offers high primary stability. This allows for most rehabilitations performed through ZI to be carried out through immediate prosthetic loading.3 ZI were primarily designed for the rehabilitative treatment of patients with maxillary resection after pathological injuries, patients with congenital malformations, or after facial trauma. However, currently, ZI are frequently indicated to rehabilitate patients with extensive atrophy after dental extractions as alternatives to major bone reconstruction.

To reach the zygomatic bone, the Zl can be installed inside or outside the maxillary sinus depending on the surgical technique adopted. In the original protocol proposed by Branemark et al.,<sup>7</sup> the implants pass inside the maxillary sinus (instrasinus zygomatic implant [IZI]) until they anchor in the zygomatic bone, which can increase the chance of chronic sinusitis and compromise the final positioning of the prosthesis. $^{8}$  On the other hand, the extrasinus zygomatic implant (EZI), proposed by Maló et al., $^{9}$  reduces intrasinus pathologies in addition to allowing the prosthetic connections to be located over the alveolar ridge, which improves the prosthetic profile. $^{10,11}$  Other modifications of the extrasinus technique have also been described, such as the zygomatic Anatomy-Guided Approach concept proposed by Aparicio et al., $^{12}$  which can be applied to different types of maxillary anatomy.


In the field of digital dentistry, ZI have been associated with computer-guided surgery to increase the accuracy and safety of the technique. In this approach, they are positioned with the help of metal guides printed by laser sintering and supported on the bone.[13,14] However, the support of the guides on the mucosa can decrease the precision. A study in an ex vivo model tested the positioning of ZI with mucosa-supported guides; however, large variations in positioning were observed.[15] Another digital tool used for ZI comprises real-time global positioning system (GPS) navigation, which reduces the chance of injury to valuable anatomical structures.[16,17]

Although widely used, few long-term data support ZI survival rates. For this reason, the present study aimed to evaluate the survival and complication rates of ZI in longitudinal studies with more than 5 years of follow-up when compared with CI.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

# 2.1 | Protocol and registration

The protocol of this systematic review (SR) followed the PRISMA- $P^{18}$  guidelines and was registered in the INPLASY database under the number INPLASY202280025. The final version of the SR did not deviate from the initial protocol and followed the PRISMA $^{19}$  guidelines.

# 2.2 | Focused question

What are the survival rates and complications (biological and mechanical) of ZI compared with CI reported in longitudinal studies with more than 5 years of follow-up?

# 2.3 | Eligibility criteria and study selection process

The main question and the eligibility criteria were determined through the PICOS strategy. The titles and abstracts of all studies were uploaded to the Rayyan website,[20] where they were screened by two independent authors (V.M. and Tiago Rocha de Queiroz) First, the titles and abstracts were analyzed. Next, selected studies were read in full to verify that they met all eligibility criteria. The search concordance between the two reviewers was evaluated by the Cohen's kappa  $(\kappa)$  test. Disagreements between the reviewing authors were resolved through careful discussion.

The following eligibility criteria were established:

(P) Population: Patients with atrophic maxilla rehabilitated through ZI or rehabilitations with ZI associated with CI.
(I) Intervention: ZI.
(C) Comparison: Survival rate of ZI versus Cl.
(O) Outcome: Implant survival rate (primary outcome) and complications (biological and mechanical; secondary outcome)
(S) Study design: Observational cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) and RCTs with at least 5 years of follow-up.

The exclusion criteria included animal studies, in vitro studies, case series, case reports, and reviews. Studies with  $< 5$  years of follow-up were also excluded. No studies were excluded for reasons of language, date of publication, and number of patients included.

# 2.4 Search strategy

PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, and LILACS were searched for relevant articles published prior to April 2022 without any restrictions regarding date of publication or language. Gray literature was searched using the OpenGrey database (www.opengrey.eu). Additionally, the studies' reference lists were evaluated (cross-referenced) to identify other potential studies for inclusion.

The following search terms were used: "zygomatic" [MeSH Terms] OR "Zygoma" [MeSH Terms] OR "zygomatic implants" [All Fields] AND "survival rate" [MeSH Terms], OR "prognosis" [MeSH Terms] OR "implant failure" [All Fields] OR "prosthetic rehabilitation" [All Fields] OR "complications" [MeSH Terms] OR "maxillary sinus" [MeSH Terms] OR "sinusitis" [MeSH Terms].

# 2.5 Data items and extraction

The study data were extracted by Tiago Rocha de Queiroz and systematically reviewed by V.M. When available, the following data were obtained from the studies: authors, study design, length of follow-up, number of patients, number of implants (ZI and CI), number of implant failures, surgical technique, type of prosthesis, mechanical complications, and biological complications.


# 2.6 Risk of bias within studies

Two reviewing authors (Daniel Costa Ferreira de Almeida and Monica Diuana Calasans-Maia) performed the risk-of-bias analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)[21] was used in the analysis of prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Studies can obtain one star/point per item in the selection and ascertainment categories; the comparability category awards two stars/points. According to the NOS, the maximum score for a given study is nine stars/points. High-quality studies scored  $\geq 6$  stars.

# 2.7 Statistical analysis

The dichotomous variable (implant failure) of the included studies was categorized into subgroups based on study design (prospective or retrospective) or surgical technique (IZI or EZI), and a meta-analysis was conducted at implant level using Review Manager software (version 5.2.8, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2014). For the dichotomous variables, crude numbers were considered because of the presence of 0 events in at least one group of each possible comparison, which prevented any synthesis by means of effect measures. The estimates of the intervention effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with  $95\%$  CIs.

For the analyses, the random effects model was considered due to the variation between the studies (population, follow-up time, and settings) with the generic variance approach. To address within-patient correlation of treatment outcomes in clustered studies, the methods described in the Cochrane Manual were used. A within-patient correlation coefficient of  $0.07^{22,23}$  was used and the sample size was revised in studies that did not adjust for clustering.  $\mathrm{Chi}^2$  tests evaluated heterogeneity, considering it to be low for values  $\leq 25\%$ , moderate for values  $>25\%$  and  $\leq 50\%$ , and high for values  $>50\%$ . The statistical significance level of the meta-analysis effect was set at  $P < 0.05$ .

# 2.8 Risk of bias across studies

Publication bias was investigated through funnel plot visualization. This was possible because all meta-analyses had  $< 10$  studies included, thus preventing the use of the Egger's and Begg's tests.[25]

# 3 | RESULTS

# 3.1 Study selection

The initial search produced 1032 titles from MEDLINE/PubMed, six from the Cochrane Library, 793 from Embase, 284 from Web of Science, and 45 from LILACS. The first evaluation (title and abstract assessment)
FIGURE 1 Flow diagram (PRISMA format) of the screening and selection process excluded 2120 articles because was duplicated or they did not fulfill the previously established eligibility criteria. Upon careful reading of the remaining studies, 14 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria and were therefore excluded. Consequently, 26 studies published between 2004 and 2021 were included in this SR. The coefficient of agreement  $(\kappa)$  between reviewers in relation to the search process was 0.97 (titles and abstracts) and 0.85 (inclusion of studies). These results demonstrated an almost perfect agreement.[26] Figure 1 shows the search flow.


# 3.2 Study characteristics

The general characteristics of each included study are shown in Table 1. Eleven prospective $^{7,27-34}$  and 15 retrospective $^{3,8,35-48}$  cohort studies were included in the present SR. A total of 5434 implants (2972 ZI and 2462 CI) were analyzed in 1709 patients. The mean follow-up time was 78 months (6.5 years). Regarding the surgical technique used to place the ZI, 15 studies $^{7,27,28,30,32,34-37,39,40,44,45,47,49}$  used IZI and five studies $^{3,31,41,42,48}$  used EZI, while six studies $^{8,29,33,38,43,46}$  used both techniques. Seven studies $^{33,37,40,45-48}$  analyzed only rehabilitations involving four ZI (Zygoma Quad). The implants underwent immediate loading in 13 studies and delayed loading in 11 studies, while two studies evaluated both types of prosthetic loading. The patients were rehabilitated through partial fixed prosthesis, full-arch prosthesis, and overdentures.

Seven studies $^{33,37,40,45-48}$  analyzed only rehabilitations involving four ZI (Zygoma Quad).

# 3.3 | Implant survival

The overall survival rate ranged from  $77.8\%$  to  $100\%$  and  $71.8\%$  to  $100\%$ , with a mean of  $96.5\% \pm 5.02$  and  $95.8\% \pm 6.36$  for ZI and CI, respectively. For rehabilitations that involved only ZI (Zygoma Quad), the survival rate ranged from  $86\%$  to  $100\%$ , with a mean of  $95.9\% \pm 4.75$ . In order to improve the accuracy of the results and reduce the risk of bias, the mean survival rates were also analyzed in subgroups. Table 2 presents the mean survival rates according to each present variable.

# 3.4 Meta-analysis

# 3.4.1 Prospective studies (IZI)

Eight prospective studies compared ZI and CI regarding the number of failures. A high heterogeneity was observed between the studies  $(I^2 = 56\%; P = 0.04)$ . There was no statistically significant difference  $(P = 0.80)$  between the two types of implants, with an RR of 1.21 (95% CI: 0.28 to 5.28; Figure 2).

# 3.4.2 Retrospective studies (IZI)

Six retrospective studies compared between ZI and CI regarding the number of failures. A low heterogeneity was observed between the studies  $(\mathrm{I}^2 = 2\%; P = 0.40)$ . There was no statistically significant

# 3.6 Biological complications

The biological complication most frequently related to ZI was sinusitis, followed by infection and oroantral communication. Evidence has shown that these complications are relatively common, suggesting that sinusitis is more prevalent when the IZI technique is used. The pattern of occurrence of sinusitis was late, being reported by the included studies in a range of 1 to 180 months after the surgery.

# 3.7 Mechanical complications

A low number of mechanical complications were reported by the reviewed studies. The most commonly reported mechanical complication was prosthesis fracture, followed by screw fracture. All biological and mechanical complications are presented in Table 1.

# 3.8 Risk of bias within studies

Twenty studies had a higher risk of bias. Questions like "comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis" and "ascertainment of outcome" scored the lowest in the analysis. The risk-of-bias analysis is detailed in Supplementary Material 2.

# 4 DISCUSSION

# 4.1 | Main findings

This SR analyzed long-term (≥5 years) ZI data. This study analyzed a total of 2972 ZI, with 102 failures (mean follow-up period was 78 months;  $96.5\%$  survival rate). These numbers show that the technique is predictable and safe in the long term, even when immediate loading of implants is performed (Table 2). Another recent SR observed a cumulative success rate of ZI for the treatment of severe maxillary atrophy of  $98.5\%$  at  $< 1$  year,  $97.5\%$  between 1 and 3 years,  $96.8\%$  between 3 and 5 years and  $96.1\%$  after more than 5 years.[50]

A greater survival of ZI that received immediate loading was observed compared with implants that received delayed loading. This data was also noted by a previous SR.[51] The original technique recommends that the prosthetic loading procedure be in two stages. $^{7}$  However, several studies have shown good outcomes when the ZI was subjected to immediate prosthetic loading. $^{29,52,53}$


The survival rates of ZI and CI were very similar (96.5 vs. 95.8, respectively), which suggests that ZI may have good long-term predictability, as CI have shown in previous studies.[54] These outcomes also proved to be positive in rehabilitations involving four ZI (Zygoma Quad). Studies analyzing marginal bone loss around the ZI are rare. The dissipation of occlusal forces in the ZI tends to be in the region of the prominence of the zygomatic bone, while in the CI, this dissipation occurs over the occlusal ridge.[55] The more apical dissipation observed in the ZI favors less bone loss due to the greater distance from the bacterial line and better bone quality.[56] However, several parameters can interact with the level of bone loss around the implants, such as the placement and number of implants,[57] implant length,[58] type of prosthesis (implant-supported or muco-implant-supported),[56] and presence of keratinized gingiva.[59]

The performed meta-analyses did not show a significant difference in prospective and retrospective studies ( $P = 0.80$  and  $P = 0.58$ , respectively) in relation to the survival of ZI when compared with CI for the IZI technique. There was also no significant difference ( $P = 0.44$ ) by the EZI technique (retrospective studies). A previous  $\mathrm{SR^{60}}$  observed that ZI had a significantly higher survival rate ( $P = 0.02$ ) compared with CI. However, this review includes studies with shorter follow-up times, which may have influenced the results. In addition, the previous study did not analyze the evidence by subgroups (e.g., design of included studies and surgical technique used). Another point was that the present SR adjusted the data for the within-patient correlation of dental implants, which showed a wider confidence interval of the results when compared with previous studies. This may demonstrate that there is more uncertainty regarding the survival of ZI than recognized in previous studies.

Regarding biological complications, sinusitis was the event most reported by the included studies, especially when the IZI technique was performed. The approach of the implant from the inside of the maxillary sinus can be a means of contamination, even if late, as evidence shows. However, the prevalence of sinusitis in patients with ZI is considered to be the same as in individuals without ZI.[61] According to the evidence, the rate of occurrence of sinusitis is  $6.6\%$  for the classic protocol (two-stage),  $2.2\%$  for the immediate loading protocol, and  $5.5\%$  for both cases.[61] However, a prospective study found that  $15\%$  to  $20\%$  of patients with sinuses penetrated by ZI may have early radiological findings without clinical symptoms. $^{62}$  Long-term randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the IZI and EZI techniques in relation to the occurrence of sinusitis are needed in the future.


Recently, a decision-making method for the type of osteotomy based on the anatomy of the zygomatic bone called zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA) was proposed.[63] This method represents an evolution of the EZI technique. The surgical management of the implant site is guided by the anatomy of the patient according to specific prosthetic, bio-mechanic, and anatomic criteria. The main advantages of the technique are less traumatic osteotomy; better implant stability; improved bone to implant contact, and bone sealing around the implant neck.

The most prevalent mechanical complications reported were prosthesis fractures, followed by screw fractures. These complications are often related to the type of prosthesis, location and number of implants, and the patient's occlusal function. There is a tendency for the ZI to deflect when subjected to horizontal forces.[39] This occurs mainly because they are long implants and there is no anchorage in the region of the alveolar ridge. In this sense, the union of the ZI with the IC located in the anterior region of the maxilla offers better stabilization of the rehabilitation.[61]

# 4.2 Limitations

This SR analyzed longitudinal data according to each type of study included, which brings strength and robustness to the data. However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of the current SR. First, all included studies were of observational (cohort) design, which decreases the strength of the evidence and may increase the risk of bias in the results. In addition, several included studies were at risk of bias according to the analysis performed. Thus, the results presented by this SR must be interpreted with caution.

# 4.3 | Clinical implications

Although ZI have a high long-term survival rate, trans-surgical and biological complications are frequently observed. In this sense, careful planning and the correct choice of surgical techniques are essential. In addition, patients should be followed up on a long-term basis.

# 4.4 Recommendations for future research

A greater number of RCTs comparing the long-term results of surgical techniques as well as the efficiency of ZI and bone regenerative techniques is fundamental in the future.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

The available evidence suggests that ZI have a high long-term survival rate (96.5% with a mean of 91.5 months of follow-up), with no significant difference when compared with CI. The most prevalent biological complication is sinusitis, being most commonly related to the IZI technique.
