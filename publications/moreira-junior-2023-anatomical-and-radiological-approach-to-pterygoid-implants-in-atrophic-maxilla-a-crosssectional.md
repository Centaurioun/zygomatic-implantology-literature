# Abstract

Objective: This retrospective study aimed to analyse the anatomical dimensions of the pterygomaxillary region, installation angulations of pterygoid implants and bone density in the pterygoid pillar region by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examinations used in planning dental rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses in patients with atrophic jaws.

Materials and Methods: We analysed 360 CBCTs of patients with atrophic jaws using Xoran® software v.3.1.62 (Xoran Technologies). In addition, the angulation of virtual implants installed in the pterygomaxillary region was analysed in relation to the Frankfurt plan, as well as the length required for the installation of implants in this region.

Results: The implant length installed in the pterygoid pillar varied between 13 and  $20\mathrm{mm}$ , with an average of  $16.17\mathrm{mm}$  (SD  $2.16\mathrm{mm}$ ). The pterygoid implant angulation on the latero-lateral axis (frontal view) averaged  $78.71^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.58^{\circ}$ ) and  $73.50^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.49^{\circ}$ ) in the anteroposterior direction (sagittal view). Bone density was found to be significantly higher in the pterygoid pillar region compared the maxillary tuberosity region  $(p < 0.05)$ ; the region of the tuberosity and pterygoid pillar had an average density value of 132.9 (SD 230.24) and 513.91 (SD 291.63) respectively.

Conclusion: According to the results of this study, a pterygoid implant with a minimum length of  $13\mathrm{mm}$  should be used in the pterygomaxillary region to reach the pterygoid bone pillar.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The partial or total rehabilitation of edentulous patients using osseointegrated implants has become a routine practice in implant dentistry with satisfactory and predictable long-term results. However, the posterior edentulous maxillary region presents a challenge for rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses due to anatomical factors such as low bone volume, low bone quality (bone type III or IV), pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and restricted surgical accessibility of the area. This condition of maxillary atrophy can prevent the installation of implants even with first having a bone reconstructive procedure. In this sense, bone grafts and implantation of biomaterials have been used as previous surgical alternatives for dental rehabilitation with implants in this region. However, some disadvantages of this rehabilitation alternative are observed, including increased treatment period, need for additional surgery, possibility of surgical complications, possibility of increased failure therapy and increased treatment cost.[7-10]



An alternative for dental rehabilitation in patients with atrophic jaws is the pterygoid implantation technique initially described by Tulasne and Tessier.[11,12] The authors described the installation of an implant in the bone pillar consisting of the maxillary tuberosity, pyramidal process of the palatal bone and pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, an implant called pterygoid.[13-18]

As shown in Figure 1, the pterygoid implant crosses the maxillary and pyramidal tuberosity of the palatal bone, and then reaches the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, a region considered as a bony pillar made up of cortical bone (type I-II). If the implant is locked and osseointegrated in this compact bone pillar, it can provide support and stability for prosthetic bone anchorage without the need for bone graft and/or posterior prosthetic cantilever. This technique has been recommended by some authors with high success and predictability rates.[13-18]

The technique of installing a pterygoid implant requires knowledge of each patient's anatomy, an experienced surgeon and adequate planning of each case. Some authors propose that the pterygoid implant should be installed with a  $45^{\circ}$  mean anteroposterior axis in relation to the Frankfurt plane.[19-21] Other studies recommend that the anterior-posterior angulation of the pterygoid implant should be approximately  $70^{\circ}$  in relation to the Frankfurt plane.[14,22,23]

Since there are few studies on the anatomical and radiological analyses of the three-dimensional corridor of the pterygomaxillary region, and due to some controversies between these studies, this study has a purpose to provide increased knowledge for the proper planning of pterygoid implant installation.

Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to analyse the anatomical dimensions of the pterygomaxillary region, angulations of installation of pterygoid implants and bone density in the pterygoid pillar region by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examinations used in planning dental rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses in patients with atrophic jaws. This report was written using the STROBE recommendations for reporting cross-sectional studies.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

# 2.1 Sample selection

The CBCT examinations of 520 patients performed between January 2008 and December 2014 with indications for rehabilitation with implants in the maxillary region were analysed.

The study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee on Humans (Ethics Committee,

# Clinical Relevance

Scientific rationale for study: The rehabilitation of atrophic jaws with implants in the facial pillars has become an important rehabilitation aspect, with the pterygoid pillar being an important case for anchoring implants in these.

Principal findings: The average length of the virtual implant that could be installed in the pterygoid pillar was about  $16\mathrm{mm}$ , considering that the entire implant is inside the bone tissue, and the implant must be inclined medially and posteriorly in relation to the ridge.

Practical implications: More studies need to be carried out in patients with clinical follow-up to verify the conditions obtained in CBCT analyses.

The sample was selected from the private radiology service archives, in the city of Goiânia-Go, Brazil. Each file was recovered in DICOM format and made anonymous by assigning an identification number to protect patient's personal data.

All the images analysed were obtained using the I-CAT® Cone Beam 3D Imaging System (Imaging Sciences International) and the volumes were reconstructed with a  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$  isometric voxel.

# 2.2 Participants

Only patients with atrophic posterior maxilla in the following conditions were considered for inclusion in this study: the absence of upper molars, the absence of residual roots and intraosseous lesions and a residual alveolar bone smaller than  $8\mathrm{mm}$  between the bony crest and floor of the maxillary sinus. Images that did not meet the inclusion criteria and those that were incomplete (not including the area of the sphenoid bone or pterygoid process), with little clarity (movement of the patient during the examination, or with errors in the technique and positioning) were excluded. In cases of bilateral atrophy, only one side was measured, and the selection was made at random.

# 2.3 Study designer

The CBCT images were analysed by a single examiner with the software of the CT scanner manufacturer Xoran® v.3.1.62 (Xoran Technologies), on a desktop computer having the following properties: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP-2 (Microsoft Corp), Intel® CoreTM 2 Duo-6300 1.86 Ghz processor (Intel Corporation), NVIDIA GeForce® 6200 graphics

card (NVIDIA Corporation) and EIZO monitor Flexscan S2000, resolution  $1600 \times 1200$  pixels (EIZO NANAO Corporation).

The images were analysed in the axial, sagittal and coronal planes. Among the exams selected to be included in this study, virtual implants were installed in the pterygoid region. The virtual implants had a diameter of  $3.75\mathrm{mm}$  and variable length (13, 15, 18 and  $20\mathrm{mm}$ ) according to the amount of bone available in the bone corridor of the pterygomaxillary area. In the virtual planes, a safety distance of at least minus  $1\mathrm{mm}$  between the palatal bundle and pterygoid implant was observed in all cases.

All implants were installed such that they were completely covered with bone. If the implant showed any exposure of its threads exceeding the bone limits, the virtual implant was replaced, repositioned and exchanged for a smaller virtual implant. The pterygoid implant was positioned at the level of the alveolar bone crest of the maxillary tuberosity and apex of the implant in the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, as suggested by Tulasne.[11] The longitudinal axis of the implant was slightly tilted in the palatal direction to reach this region. This positioning resulted in an implant emerging on the distal surface of the second molar.[11,12]

# 2.4 | Anatomical and radiological measurements

The following parameters were measured: (1) angulation of the longitudinal axis of the pterygoid implant in relation to the Frankfurt plane in the anteroposterior direction of the sagittal section in the CBCT (Figure 2); (2) angulation of the longitudinal axis of the pterygoid implant in relation to the Frankfurt plane in the vestibulo-palatal direction of the coronal CBCT section (Figure 2); and (3) length of the virtual pterygoid implant positioned from the alveolar ridge of the tuberosity to the most apical point of the pterygoid apophysis, completely covered by bone tissue. The Frankfurt plane was chosen instead of the occlusion plane because the edentulous molar region becomes irregular or tilted posteriorly in the maxilla, while the Frankfurt plane remains stable, regardless of bone atrophy.

Bone density analysis was performed with the bone density tool of the Xoran® software v.3.1.62 (Xoran Technologies), which, despite not being a standardized unit of measurement, allows us to compare different areas within the same CBCT volume using Xoran®.

# 2.5 Statistical analysis

The data obtained were tabulated and analysed using SPSS v.20.5 software (IBM). Student's  $t$ -test was applied to compare groups and descriptive statistics. Differences were considered significant at  $p < 0.05$ .

# 3 RESULTS

Of 520 CBCTs analysed, 360 were eligible for inclusion in this study, giving a rate of  $69.23\%$ , consisting of 123 men  $(34.17\%)$  and 237 women  $(65.83\%)$  (Table 1).

# 3.1 | Anatomical and radiological measurements

The length of the implant installed in the pterygoid pillar varied between 13 and  $20\mathrm{mm}$  (Table 2 and Figure 3), with an average of  $16.17\mathrm{mm}$  (SD  $2.16\mathrm{mm}$ ). In the statistical analysis with the Student's  $t$ -test, there was no statistically significant difference between the sexes  $(p = 0.101)$ , with an average implant length of  $15.91\mathrm{mm}$  (SD  $2.15\mathrm{mm}$ ) for men and  $16.30\mathrm{mm}$  (SD  $2.15\mathrm{mm}$ ) for women.

The angulation of the pterygoid implant on the laterolateral axis (coronal view) (Figure 4) averaged  $78.71^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.58^{\circ}$ ), showing a statistically significant difference between men and women  $(p = 0.022)$ , with an average of  $79.36^{\circ}$  (SD  $4.10^{\circ}$ ) for men and  $78.38^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.25^{\circ}$ ) for women (Figure 5).

In the anteroposterior direction (sagittal view) (Figure 6), the mean angulation was  $73.50^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.49^{\circ}$ ), and with an average of  $73.33^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.87^{\circ}$ ) for men and  $73.59^{\circ}$  (SD  $3.28^{\circ}$ ) for women (Figure 7). There was no statistically significant difference in implant angulation between men and women  $(p = 0.517)$ .

The bone density was found to be significantly higher in the region of the pterygoid pillar compared to the region of

atrophic posterior jaws not needing bone reconstruction, allowing for a shorter treatment period and lower costs. Dental rehabilitation with pterygoid implants has shown predictable results and high long-term success rates similar to those obtained with conventional implants.[2,13,16,18,24,25]

The installation of pterygoid implants should be guided by the knowledge of each patient's anatomy, but there is no consensus on the ideal position for this type of implant.

Several authors propose the installation of the implant at approximately  $45^{\circ}$  in relation to the Frankfurt plane, while others propose the installation of the more vertical implant at approximately  $70^{\circ}$  in relation to the same plane.[14,19-23]

The results of the present study are in accordance with the proposal to install the pterygoid implant in a more vertical position, with the mean angulation identified being  $73.50^{\circ} \pm 3.138^{\circ}$  on the anteroposterior axis (sagittal view) and  $78.70^{\circ} \pm 2.658^{\circ}$  on the buco-palatal axis (frontal view), in relation to the Frankfurt plane. From a biological and biomechanical point of view, the angulations of the pterygoid implant found in this study seem to coincide with the longitudinal axis of the upper second molar, and its installation must be more physiological when installed in a more vertical position. Another interesting finding of this study was the average length (mm) of the virtual pterygoid implants installed in the pterygomaxillary region, which reached the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. Most of the pterygoid implants installed were 13, 15 and  $18\mathrm{mm}$  long (326 implants/90.5% of cases) and based on this result, it would be very difficult to reach the pterygoid process using implants smaller than  $13\mathrm{mm}$  in length. However, contrary to our studies, other studies described the use of pterygoid implants with measurements less than  $13\mathrm{mm}$  in length.[2,25]

A retrospective clinical study published by Balshi et al.,[25] analysed 930 implants installed in the pterygomaxillary region assembled in groups of different implant lengths and demonstrated that longer pterygoid implants  $(15 - 18\mathrm{mm})$  had a higher survival rate  $(94.16\%)$  than the shorter pterygoid implants  $(7 - 13\mathrm{mm})$ $(88.06\%)$ .

The result of the present study suggests that a pterygoid implant of at least  $13\mathrm{mm}$  in length should be used in this region in order to reach this bone pillar consisting of the maxillary tuberosity, pyramidal process of the palatal bone and pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. Thus, we assume that longer implants are necessary to reach this bone pillar and consequently acquire better primary stability, resulting in a higher rate of survival of the implants. Studies with implants installed in the maxillary tuberosity area describe this region composed of quality bone types III and IV.[5,6]

It was reported a failure rate of  $35\%$  for implants installed in 'type IV' bone, in contrast to a failure rate of  $3\%$  for implants installed in quality I, II and III bones. These authors conclude that good primary stability of the implant is essential for its success and, therefore, pterygomaxillary implants installed in atrophic jaws should possibly reach this bone pillar with better bone quality.[2,6,19,26]

Bone density information can be obtained preoperatively by CBCT examination. Although the Hounsfield units represent the standardized scale for CT scans, there is no consensus regarding the standard unit for cone beam computed tomography.[22] Some authors used the terms 'density value' and 'number of CT' to define bone density in CBCT examinations.[23] In this study, there was a statistically significant difference in bone density between the areas of maxillary tuberosity and pterygoid bone pillar, being 132.90 and 513.90 respectively. In this sense, it is assumed that the involvement

However, further anatomical studies of the pterygomaxillary region are recommended to determine the bone density of the pterygomaxillary areas, as well as for the proper selection of the pterygoid implant (implant dimensions) with the aim of promoting better surgical planning.


# 4.1 Risk of bias and future perspective

This work was carried out based on computed tomography images from an image bank of a non-representative sample of the population and without access to data that can stratify patients by ethnicity or age, as well as data regarding the time and causes of edentulism, which can limit data analysis and extrapolation. The measurements of the implants were all virtual, under clinical conditions these values may change due to the anatomy and also the surgical technique used, as well as the surgeon's experience, since the technique for installing pterygoid implants is complex due to lack of reliable anatomical landmarks to guide implant positioning, thus limiting the results found here.

To facilitate the understanding of the technique and also a greater safety in the surgical planning for the installation of pterygoid implants, a series of cases demonstrating the average length of the implants as well as the success rate after rehabilitation could be very useful.

Descriptive anatomy and implant placement studies could also be useful to help the clinician make a decision about the use of pterygoid implants.

# 5 CONCLUSION

The surgical planning for the installation of the pterygoid implant must be guided by the individual anatomy of each patient. A pterygoid implant must be at least  $13\mathrm{mm}$  long to be used in this region, with an average of  $16.17\mathrm{mm}$ , and your installation angles should have an average angulation of  $73.50^{\circ}$  on the anteroposterior axis and  $78.7^{\circ}$  on the laterolateral axis in relation to the Frankfurt plane, in order to take advantage of the greater quantity and better quality of bone in this region. The pterygoid implant allows anchoring in a bone tissue with a higher density, which can result in better primary stability, with no significant differences in the bone density of the pterygoid pillar between men and women.
