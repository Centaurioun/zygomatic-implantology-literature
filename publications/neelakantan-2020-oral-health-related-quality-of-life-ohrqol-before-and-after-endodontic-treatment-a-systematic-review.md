# Abstract

Objectives This systematic review was undertaken to determine the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) before and after endodontic treatment.

Materials and Methods Based on the PRISMA guidelines, electronic databases  $(n = 7)$  were searched and from 1038 citations, 16 papers were included in this review. Information on study design, sample size, intervention/treatment modality, methods of assessing OHRQoL, and the key findings were extracted and analyzed.

Results Among the 16 studies, 3 were cross-sectional surveys, 9 were longitudinal studies, and 4 were randomized clinical trials. The cross-sectional studies reported improvements in OHRQoL following root canal treatment. Comparative longitudinal studies did not identify a significant association between improvements in OHRQoL and the method of root canal instrumentation or number of instruments used. Clinical trials found that improvements in OHRQoL were significantly associated with instrumentation technique, surgical-incision approach, and the application of platelet-concentrate during surgery. Several methods of assessing OHRQoL were employed with the most common being the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP), albeit using different versions.

Conclusions The results of this systematic review indicate that the QoL of patients improved after endodontic treatment. Nevertheless, these results are limited to patients who seek endodontic treatment and cannot be generalized. The lack of well-designed observational studies with standardized assessment approaches, coupled with heterogeneity of study design and interventions, precluded quantitative synthesis.

Clinical relevance Pragmatic clinical trials are more meaningful to understand patient-centered outcomes of treatment. This review shows that endodontic treatment does improve the QoL. However, future studies should use standardized tools and data reporting, which are critical to make meta-analyses possible.

# Introduction

There has been a paradigm shift in health care to assess treatment needs and treatment outcomes from the perspective of the patient rather than rely on the perspective of clinicians alone [1]. Pain and discomfort arising from endodontic diseases have long been considered in diagnosis and treatment planning [2]. However, arguably, it is the impact and consequence of these symptoms on the quality of life (QoL) or daily living that are important in providing understanding of the burden of the diseases and ultimately in determining the benefit of care to the lives of patients. To this end, there has been a growing interest into assessing the impact of endodontic disease on health- and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and on studies to identify key factors associated with its impact [3-5].


Another important consideration is whether treatment can ameliorate the burden that oral diseases have on the lives and/or improve life quality for patients [6]. Findings from systematic reviews of other dental treatments have provided evidence of positive outcomes and health gains from the perspective of patients in areas ranging from complete maxillary denture treatments [7], implant-supported mandibular overdentures [8], and dental implant rehabilitation [9]. Likewise, a systematic review has highlighted the positive benefits of periodontal therapy (non-surgical and surgical) to OHRQoL [10]. Assessment of QoL is a type of pragmatic clinical trial wherein the effectiveness of treatment strategies is measured under real-world conditions. Hence, the benefits that the treatment produces in routine clinical practice are evident. Such trials produce results that are more meaningful to patients than explanatory clinical trials [11, 12].

"Endodontic treatment" includes a wide variety of therapies including vital pulp therapies, root canal treatment, root canal retreatment, and surgical endodontics (e.g., root-end resection and filling) [13-16]. In endodontics, several reviews have considered outcomes of pain and symptoms from care [13, 14], and increasing attention is being paid to quality of life outcomes in endodontic studies and clinical trials, either as a primary or secondary outcome measure [17].

Several approaches may be used to assess the impact of treatment on quality of life, including both generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and OHRQoL assessments. Determining impact of endodontic treatment on HRQoL has a certain appeal in that effects can be compared with those of other dental and medical interventions, and potentially inform health economic analyses [18, 19]. However, there are concerns that it may be challenging to assess the often subtle and specific change to QoL that arise from dental/endodontic interventions from HRQoL assessments and thus the more widespread use of OHRQoL measures [5]. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) is the most commonly employed, which is a well-established standardized measure that has been adapted for use in several languages and numerous countries [1, 4, 20, 21].

There is an acceptance that research outcomes should ultimately be of relevance and benefit to patients rather than purely focus on technical aspects of treatment or treatment modalities. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to determine the OHRQoL before and after endodontic treatment.

# Materials and methods

The topic of this systematic review was constructed according to the PICO principle [22]. Population: all subjects in need for endodontic treatment; Intervention: endodontic treatment (specifically in this review: root canal treatment, root canal retreatment, root-end resection, and filling in endodontic surgery); Comparison: quality of life before and after endodontic treatment; comparison between different treatment modalities in endodontic therapy; Outcome: oral health-related quality of life.

A search was conducted among 7 electronic data bases—PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Registry, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform—using a search strategy that was developed using terms and keywords relating to endodontics and quality of life based on previous systematic reviews of oral health-related quality of life [6] and endodontics [13, 14, 23] from inception up to December 31, 2018. No restrictions were placed. Based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a sample search strategy is presented in Table 1. The search strategy followed the PRISMA guidelines [24].

The titles and abstracts of the identified articles were screened by two of the authors (P.N, P.L) independently. Articles were excluded if they did not pertain to endodontic treatment or assessment of quality of life. Agreement between raters was assessed using kappa statistics. Where disagreement occurred, the supervising authors (C.M, P.M.D) were consulted and agreement was reached whether to include or exclude articles. Full texts of the articles included after the title and abstract screenings were downloaded to confirm if they measured the QoL after endodontic treatment. Agreement between raters for the articles to be included in the review was assessed using kappa statistics and disagreements over inclusion were resolved by a supervising author (C.M). These included studies were reviewed to extract the following data: (i) study design, (ii) study site and sample, (iii) methods of assessing OHQoL, (iv) intervention/treatment modality, and (v) key findings and statistical inferences. Where similar interventions and similar QoL assessments existed, a quantitative synthesis was considered by way of meta-analysis.

# Risk of bias

Assessment of the risk of bias in the included studies was undertaken using the modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [25]. The following criteria were considered: representativeness of the sample, comparability (presence of a control group), calibration of exposure, outcome assessment tool, blinding of outcome assessors, adjustment for confounders and non-response rate. A percentage score was established for each study based on the items present.

# Results

The initial search yielded a total of 1038 citations among the 7 databases (PubMed, 282; Cochrane Library, 0; Web of Science, 75; Scopus, 484; Embase, 219; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Registry, 0; and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, 0). Following removal of the duplicates, 415 citations remained. After screening the titles and abstracts, 20 articles were identified for further full-text analysis; kappa value of inter-reader agreement was 0.80. Full texts of the 20 papers were assessed and 16 papers met inclusion criteria to be considered for inclusion in this systematic review. The kappa value of inter-reader agreement was 0.89. The PRISMA flowchart for the selection process is presented in Fig. 1.

The general characteristics of the included studies are provided in Table 2. Among the 16 studies, 3 were cross-sectional surveys (conducted following root canal treatment) [3, 4, 20], 9 were longitudinal studies [1, 5, 21, 28-31, 34, 35], and 4 were randomized clinical trials [32, 33, 36, 37]. The sample size ranged from 15 [28] to 1257 [20].

# Method of assessing QoL

Six studies used the standardized OHIP-14 [1, 4, 5, 20, 30, 31], and three used a 17-item version of OHIP [3, 21, 34]. Three studies employed modified versions of the Patient Perceptions Questionnaire of Oral Surgery—a 15-item version [35] and a 9-item version [36, 37]. The remainder used different measures: OQoL [29]; modified health-related quality of life index [28], POQoL [32], and American chronic pain association quality of life scale [33]. There was a wide variability in the first time point after treatment, at which the QoL measurements were carried out, and this may have an impact on the reported outcomes. Five studies [22, 32, 33, 36, 37] reported the QHRQoL measures on the day of treatment, while 1 study reported this, one day after treatment [28]. Table 1 also summarizes the time point post-intervention when QoL measurements were carried out. All studies reported a pre-operative QoL measure except the 3 cross-sectional studies [3, 4, 20], 1 longitudinal study [35], and the 4 randomized controlled trials [32, 33, 36, 37].


# Longitudinal studies

Among the 9 longitudinal studies, 5 were related to root canal treatment without control/comparison groups [1, 5, 21, 28, 29] and one was related to root canal retreatment without control/ comparison groups [34]. Three longitudinal studies had control/comparisons groups; two were related to root canal treatment and compared root canal preparation using hand instruments versus automated-reciprocating instruments [30], single file (automated-reciprocation) versus multiple files (automated-rotary) systems [31]; and one was related to root-end resection and filling using traditional versus microscope-assisted surgical endodontic treatment [35].

All longitudinal studies reported significant improvements in OHRQoL following root canal treatment [1, 5, 21, 28] and after root canal retreatment [34]. Among comparative longitudinal studies, significant improvements in OHRQoL occurred following root canal treatment. However, the improvement in OHRQoL was not significantly associated with the instrumentation approach during canal preparation: hand versus automated-reciprocation [30] or number of instruments (single- versus multiple-file approach) [31]. Wright et al. [29] did not identify a significant improvement following root canal treatment (effect size minimum). Furthermore, this study reported no significant difference in changes in OHRQoL among those who underwent root canal treatment compared with those who received denture treatment. Among the cross-sectional studies (survey), variations in OHRQoL following root canal treatment were related to periradicular pathosis and pain on percussion [20], and operator expertise [3]. No significant difference was observed in OHQoL following root canal treatment and implant treatment [4].

# Randomized controlled trials

Four randomized controlled trials were identified: two related to root canal treatment [32, 33] and two related to root-end resection and filling [36, 37]. One root canal treatment clinical trial compared automated-rotary instrumentation of root canals versus automated-reciprocating instrumentation [32], while the other compared foraminal enlargement or no enlargement during root canal preparation with a rotary instrumentation system [33]. Among the surgical endodontic treatment trials, one compared different types of mucoperiosteal surgical incisions (sulcular incision compared with papilla

One root canal treatment clinical trial observed a significant improvement for both those who underwent canal preparation with automated-rotary instruments and those who underwent automated-reciprocation instruments [32]. In addition, a significantly greater improvement was observed among those who underwent treatment by automated-rotary instruments compared with those by automated-reciprocation instruments. The other root canal treatment clinical trial reported that there was no significant difference in the quality of life between patients where foraminal enlargement was performed versus those where it was not, during root canal treatment [33]. However, this study did not present baseline scores of QoL and hence, it could not be deduced if there was an improvement in the OHRQoL.

Among the surgical endodontic (root-end resection and filling) clinical trials, intra-group differences in OHRQoL were not reported but significant inter-group differences were observed in some aspects. Those who had papilla-base incisions fared better than those who had sulcular incisions [36]. Significantly greater improvements in OHRQoL (in some aspects) were observed following the use of platelet concentrate to fill bone defects, after root-end surgery in surgical endodontics compared with no use of platelet concentrate.

# Cross-sectional studies

Three cross-sectional studies were identified [3, 4, 20]. One compared the improvements in OHRQoL at the recall visits in 2 locations, and reported improvements with time, site of study, and operator level [3]. However, this study did not provide any pre-treatment OHRQoL scores. Another study [4] reported that there was no significant difference in the OHRQoL between endodontic treatment and implant treatment. This study also reported that the OHRQoL was scored low in women who underwent endodontic treatment. The third cross-sectional study [20] reported OHRQoL scores, 3-5 years after root canal treatment, and reported that periapical pathologies or pain on percussion were clearly associated with the QoL.


# Risk of bias

The risk of bias among studies has been presented in detail in Table 3 of the Appendix. Although the quality of the evidence was judged to be good, it may not be possible to draw the conclusion that quality of life could be improved by the endodontic treatment because of the variations in interventions and the lack of the assessment of QoL before endodontic treatment (baseline assessment). There is no evidence that a surgical approach leads to better quality of life in the short-term after treatment (e.g., 1 day to 7 days follow-up). However, people treated surgically reported pain and an inferior quality of life during the first week after treatment. So, long-term follow-up studies seem to be better for observing a change of quality of life.

According to Newcastle-Ottawa criteria [25], scores ranged from 2 to 6 out of a possible maximum score of 9 (Appendix 2). Issues relating to the domains "representativeness of samples" and "calibration of examiners" were frequently absent. Due to the heterogeneity in study characteristics and the method of QoL assessment, quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) of the data could not be carried out.

# Discussion

A broad and systematic search of the literature was conducted, employing standardized keywords and terms across 7 key electronic databases. The search yielded many studies highlighting the growing interest in endodontics and quality of life that has evolved since the concept and approaches to assessing the impact of oral health on quality of life were proposed several decades ago [18, 19]. Studies included in this review were conducted in a wide variety of settings, of varying study designs, and sample sizes were generally small. Although endodontic treatment encompasses a wide range of treatments ranging from vital pulp therapy to surgical interventions, as outlined in the "Introduction" section, this review only aimed to address the impact of root canal-based procedures (non-surgical and surgical; primary treatment and retreatment). Vital pulp therapies (VPTs) include a very wide variety of treatments including pulp capping (direct and indirect) and pulpotomy. The decision to intentionally not include VPTs in this systematic review was based on the significant controversy regarding complete vs selective caries removal, status of pulp tests prior to treatment planning for vital pulp therapies, and materials used for the procedures [38, 39]. Therefore, the impact of VPTs on OHRQoL should be addressed as a separate research question.


The risk of bias varied among studies with domains of "representativeness of sample" and "calibration for examiner" being of concern [25]. With regard to the clinical trials, although the data was interesting from the context of the groups being compared, they did not provide direct answers to our research question through randomization. Thus, their significance in this present systematic review is similar to other longitudinal studies, as only the pre-treatment and posttreatment values can be used for informing the results of this present review. Therefore, the risk of bias for clinical trials was analyzed using the same parameters as those for the other longitudinal studies.

The present study intended to investigate the effect of endodontic treatment (root canal treatment and retreatment and surgical endodontic treatment) on OHRQoL. A recent systematic review concluded that conventional endodontic treatment improved the OHRQoL [40], based on 2 studies, which were also included in our study [5, 22]. However, to provide a robust conclusion to this question, the benefit of endodontic treatment needs to be evaluated against a non-intervention (no endodontic treatment) group, which clearly has ethical concerns. That said, the best evidence to answer this question should come from well-planned observational studies. Thus, the results drawn from this study can only inform the pre- and post-intervention OHRQoL changes in patients who seek endodontic treatment, possibly at the time of their poorest QoL.

An array of measures had been used in measuring the OHRQoL, and this in part reflects that there is no one set gold standard measure [3, 4, 34, 36]. Such variability negated the possibility of performing a meta-analysis. For the most part, studies reported improvements in OHRQoL following endodontic treatment; however, studies varied based on how this was deduced. Some studies deduced improvement in OHRQoL based on changes to the summary index score; others based their reports on improvements on changes to individual domain score(s), while others used changes at the individual item level. The underlying theoretical frameworks and confirmed statistical factor structure do support the notion of domain/index level analyses rather than at individual item level as in the case of battery measures [9].


Another important issue to consider in the endodontic context is to determine the minimum important clinical difference (MICD), that is, the difference in HRQoL/OHRQoL which is clinically meaningful, i.e., the change that patients can perceive following treatment and regarded as an important change [41]. This can be determined using anchored-based or distribution-based approaches. This is of key importance in determining meaningful clinical effects of different endodontic treatment approaches, and to make comparisons across treatment modalities.

In summary, the findings of this systematic review provide evidence of an increased and widespread interest in the impact of endodontic treatment on quality of life. Although the available evidence points to a high level of uncertainty in the conclusions drawn, qualitative synthesis of findings provides support of an improvement to quality of life following endodontic treatment albeit with evidence gleaned from several assessment approaches, different indices/ instrument, and various forms of the same index.

# Recommendations

To date, quantitative synthesis (meta-analyses) is hampered by the lack of a standardized approach to assessment and, in addition, how changes/improvements in quality of life are reported. One reason for this is the method of recording and reporting OHRQoL scores. The authors of this review strongly opine that papers on QoL should report effect sizes. An effect size of 0.5 may be considered the MICD [42]. Additionally, reporting of patient satisfaction and pain alone should not be considered an improvement in OHRQoL although they may be related factors [43-45]. Furthermore, studies should report the OHRQoL scores prior to intervention to be able to obtain clinically reliable data. Moving forward, there is a need to provide further evidence of improvement in OHRQoL and to determine the magnitude/effect size of statistical changes, responsiveness, and MICD, and, in addition, assesses outcomes of different endodontic treatment approaches.

# Assessment of risk of bias for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies included in this review

The following criteria (Newcastle-Ottawa scale) was used to score each study that was included in this review.

A maximum of two stars  $(^{**})$  is awarded for item 1.

A maximum of one star  $(^{*})$  is awarded for items 2 and 3.

A maximum of five stars (\*\*\*\*\*) is awarded for the items "Outcomes measurement."

1. Representativeness of sample (max.  $2^{*}$ )

Evaluated by the sample generation methods and sample origin (e.g., community, specific population) a) Random sample of specific population groups*

b) Random sample of individuals of a population (or community)** c) Non-random sample of specific population groups d) Non-random sample of individuals of a population (or community) e) No description of whether sample was random or not

2. Comparability (max.  $1^{*}$ )

Evaluated by the presence of control group a) Presence of control group (without endodontic treatment)

b) Absence of control group

3. Calibration for exposure (max.  $1^{*}$ )

a) Calibrated examiner: *Description of training/ calibration procedure b) Non-calibrated examiner: report of absence of calibration; report of calibration, but with no description of procedure; no report of whether calibration was performed

4. Outcome measurement (max.  $5^{*}$ ) including outcome assessment tool; concealment; adjustment of confounding factors; and non-response rate

Assessment tool for outcome (In this review, the outcome was impact of endodontic treatment on quality of life).

a) Use of validated assessment tool* b) Use of non-validated assessment tool or databank records (secondary data)

Concealment for evaluation of outcome (In this review, the examiner was considered to be blinded to exposure (received or not received endo-treatment) when evaluating the outcome (quality of life)).

5. Adjustments for confounding factors

a) Adjustment for confounder of outcome* b) Adjustment for second confounder of outcome**

6. Non-response rate

a) Description of non-response rate* b) No description of non-response rate

Although references [32, 33, 36, 37] were performed with control groups for comparison of two treatments, we evaluated them using this risk of bias tool due to the absence of a negative control group (no endodontic treatment). Albeit this being an issue of ethical concern, this strategy was adopted to fit to the research question in this paper.
