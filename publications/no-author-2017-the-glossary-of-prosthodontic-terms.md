# PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION

"The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug."
—Mark Twain

I live down the street from Samuel Clemens' (aka Mark Twain) home in Hartford, Connecticut. I refer to his quotation because he is a notable author who wrote with familiarity about our spoken language. Sometimes these spoken words are objectionable and more appropriate words have evolved over time. The editors of the ninth edition of the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms ensured that the spoken vernacular is represented, although it may be nonstandard in formal circumstances. I hope that authors, poster presenters, and lecturers will use this edition as a guide for the "right word".

This ninth edition of the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms upholds the same objectives and standards as it did when it was first authored by the Academy of Denture Prosthetics in 1956. Throughout the world of prosthodontics, it has been valued as a reference for "uniform terminology [that] would permit authors to discuss their concepts and techniques and be sure that these would be understood by those who would read the articles, regardless of the geographic location or the specialty of the reader." The generation of new terms and the modification of the old definitions, significant as much today as they were a century ago, are a resounding hallmark in the collective advancements of new knowledge in our specialty.

The Fellows of the Academy of Prosthodontics, with the leadership of the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms Committee, have strived to faithfully execute the duties of lexicographers. It holds true throughout these several decades that we should continue the improvement of this document with contributions by many

prosthodontic organizations regardless of geographic location or political affiliations. Acknowledgments are recognized by many of the Academy fellowship, too many to name individually, with whom we have consulted for expert opinion. Also recognized are Gary Goldstein, Charles Goodacre, Albert Guckes, Steven Morgano, Stephen Rosenstiel, Clifford VanBlarcom, and Jonathan Wiens for their contributions to the Glossary, which have spanned many decades. We thank them for guiding us in this monumental project and teaching us the objectiveness and the standards for evidence-based dentistry to be passed on to the next generation of dentists.

# PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

This Glossary is a collection of words and terms and their special connotations in the art and science of prosthodontics. It is in the nature of a progress report in a tremendous effort to standardize the nomenclature used in this field. The advantages to the dental profession of a successful effort in this direction are manifold. The most important of these is that the use of a uniform terminology would permit authors to discuss their concepts and techniques and be sure that these would be understood by those who would read the articles, regardless of the geographic location or the specialty of the reader.

The need for a glossary of terms used in prosthodontics has been recognized for many years. In 1923, Ottofy stated, "It is to be hoped that members of the profession and specialists through their organizations will reach an agreement as to the terms to be given preference or to be used exclusively." He called particular notice to the confused state of the prosthodontic terminology of that time, and it is even worse now because of the progress in the art and science of prosthodontics. Many new terms and words intended to describe or explain modern philosophies or procedures have been added to the literature. Authors, clinicians, and teachers have ascribed many different interpretations and meanings to the same terms and words. Many "old" terms have been given "new" definitions by contemporary authors. Many "old" terms have been redefined in the light of the increased knowledge of the problems of prosthodontics.


Through the years, individuals, specialty groups, and the Bureau of Library and Indexing of the American Dental Association have made many sincere attempts to develop a standard and acceptable nomenclature in dentistry. The major obstacle has been the difficulty in obtaining universal acceptance of proposed interpretations.

The Academy of Denture Prosthetics has studied the problem throughout its existence and, until recently, has reached unanimous agreement on very few terms. This was in spite of sincere and valiant efforts on the part of the nomenclature committees, and it was due to the wide differences of opinion and background among those who considered the committees' recommendations. This lack of progress was most discouraging, but three years ago it was agreed by the Fellowship of the Academy that this Glossary would be prepared, and that the majority opinion would be adopted. This decision made possible real progress toward the ultimate goal—a universal terminology for prosthodontics.

The "workshop" technique was used in the course of two meetings of the Academy for the study of nearly 1000 words or terms. The Nomenclature Committee of the Academy restudied the results of these "workshop" sessions. At least sixteen outstanding prosthodontists have given serious study to each term included in this Glossary. The definitions represent a composite of their understanding of the terms. The Fellows of the Academy of Denture Prosthetics have combined their efforts to serve as lexicographers.

The chief role of a lexicographer is to record the current usage of words. The chief function of words in science is to convey meaning.

The lexicographer has a duty to lead as well as to follow. Where clearness demands it, he should place such restrictions as are necessary to avoid ambiguity. That is, he must narrow down some definitions so they will not carry too much generality. Where voids exist, he should fill them in. Where more than one term is used to express the same idea or concept, he should indicate the preference on the basis of logic and other considerations.

Many instances could be cited in the Glossary where the Academy and its Nomenclature Committee have performed these various "duties" of the lexicographer. Certain terms were determined to be objectionable for some reason and are marked  $(Obj)$ . Some new terms have been added which seem to express the desired idea or meanings more accurately than the corresponding terms in current usage. Where more than one term which carries the same connotation was found, the preferred term is listed first. Likewise, when more than one definition was assigned to the same term, the preferred definition is listed first. These decisions were made on the basis of majority opinion. It is hoped that eventually obsolete or objectionable terms and terms which tend to mislead and confuse will be eliminated entirely.

This, the first edition of the Glossary, is offered to the dental profession for its consideration. Since it is recognized that there are some terms that have not been included and that some other terms and definitions that may be objectionable to some authorities have been included, revisions will be necessary from time to time. Constructive suggestions are invited, and these will be given thorough consideration in future editions. In its present form, this Glossary can serve as a good temporary standard.

It is impossible to give due credit here to all that have worked to make this Glossary possible. The Fellows of the Academy of Denture Prosthetics have supplied the fundamental information and have made the necessary decisions. The Editorial Council of THE JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY, and The C. V. Mosby Company, its publisher, have provided encouragement and technical assistance in its development. Special acknowledgment is due to Dr George B. Denton of the Bureau of Library and Indexing of the American Dental Association, for his advice and counsel, and to Mrs. Marice K. Musgrove and Miss Barbara Eichhorn for the tremendous amount of secretarial work which was necessary. Acknowledgment is made, also, to certain dictionaries and textbooks from which the definitions for some of the terms have been taken. These are: Dorland, W. A. Newman, The American Illustrated Medical Dictionary, ed. 22, Philadelphia, 1951, W. B. Saunders Company (Dor.); Dunning, William B., and Davenport, S. Ellsworth, Jr., A Dictionary of Dental Science and Art, Philadelphia, 1936, P. Blakiston's Son & Company, Inc. (D. & D.); Swenson, Merrill G., and Terkla, Louis G., Partial Dentures, St. Louis, 1955, The C. V. Mosby Company (S.); Blakiston's New Gould Medical Dictionary, ed. 1, Philadelphia, 1949, The Blakiston Company (Gould). To all of these, the Nomenclature Committee expresses its gratitude.

# EXPLANATORY NOTES

# Entries

# Main entries

Any boldface letter or combination of letters that is set flush with the left-hand margin of each page constitutes a main entry or main-entry word. Such main entries may consist of letters, letters joined by hyphens, or letters separated by one or more spaces:

glare ... vb

glass-ceramics ... n

gold foil ... n

The subsequent explanation in lightface type that follows each main entry on the same line and, as necessary, on succeeding indented lines explains its inclusion in the glossary. Variations in compound words are frequent and widespread. Generally, although several acceptable variations may occur, one single style for any compound word has been chosen, usually on the basis of its frequency of occurrence, because that usually is its predominant form.

# Order of main entries

All main entries are listed in their alphabetic order, letter by letter, without regard to intervening spaces or hyphens; that is, iatrogenic follows I-bar clasp. Generally accepted abbreviations have been spelled out in the alphabetic order. Full words come before parts of words made with the same letters.

# Homographs

Some main entries have precisely the same written form. Two or more similarly spelled words are distinguished by superscript numerals that precede each word:

1 lute ... n' articulate ... vb
2 lute ... vt  $^2$  articulate ... adj

Homographs are generally entered in order of their first use in the English language.

# Guide words

Pairs of words, termed guide words, are printed at the top of each page. All main entries that fall alphabetically between the guide words are found on that page. The first guide word is alphabetically the first entry on the page, and the second guide word is the last entry:

agenesis  $\cdot$  alveolar resorption

# Variants

If a main entry is followed by another variation of the word with another spelling, the two spellings are equal variants. Both may be assumed to be standard, and either one may be used according to personal inclination:

color or colour

# Run-on entries

A main entry may be followed by one or more derivatives or by a homograph with a different functional label. These constitute run-on entries. Each is introduced by a lightface dash and each has a functional label. They are, however, not defined because their meanings are readily derived from the root word's meaning:

$^{2}$ curve ... vb ... -curved ... -curving ... vi

# FUNCTIONAL LABELS

An italic label indicating a part of speech or some other functional classification follows the main entry. The eight standard parts of speech are:

adjective ... adj

adverb ... adv

conjunction ... conj

interjection ... interj

noun ... n

preposition ... prep

pronoun ... pron

verb ... vb

If a verb is transitive and intransitive, the functional labels vt and vi introduce the subdivisions. Other italicized labels used to indicate functional classifications that are not traditional parts of speech are:

-prefix
-suffix
-trademark

# CAPITALIZATION

Most main entries in this glossary begin with a lowercase letter. Some, however, begin with an uppercase letter, which indicates that the word is usually capitalized:

myocentric

Myo-monitor

The capitalization of entries that are open or hyphenated compounds is indicated by the form of the entry:

Dolder bar ...
curve of Spee ...
Davis crown ...

GPT terms related to the main entry are capitalized and placed after the definition. Non-GPT related terms are in lowercase, italicized, and placed after the definition.

# ETYMODOLOGY

All material in square brackets preceding the definition constitutes the etymology. Etymology traces a vocabulary entry as far back as possible in English, and, where possible, its origins.

# DATES

Some main entries will have a date enclosed in parentheses immediately preceding the boldface colon that introduces the first sense or sense number when one is present. This represents the date of earliest recorded use, in English, as far as could be determined. Many prosthodontic terms have evolved without prior dating. As such, few dates appear in this glossary.

# USAGE

# Usage notes

Only one status label (temporal) is used in this glossary to denote that a word, the sense of a word, or a phrase is not part of the standard vocabulary of prosthodontics. The label obs for "obsolete" means that there is no evidence to support its use in current literature:

# balancing side ... obs ... syn, NONWORKING-SIDE

The label obs is a comment by the editorial staff on the word being defined. An appropriate definition is provided where no current term is available or, alternatively, current acceptable terminology is suggested.

The stylistic label slang is used with words or senses that are especially inappropriate or in contexts of extreme informality. There is no satisfactory objective test for slang. Many are composed of shortened forms or extravagant or fictitious figures of speech:

bite registration ... n ... slang ... syn, MAXILLOMANDIBULAR RELATIONSHIP RECORD suck-down ... n ... slang ... syn, VACUUM THERMOMOLD


The stylistic label nonstand for "nonstandard" is used for words or senses that conform to a widespread pattern of usage in informality that differs in choice of word or expression from that of the general prosthodontic community language standard. In fact, many words, invariably nonstandard, are in our spoken vernacular:

black triangle ... nonstand ... syn, INTERDENTAL GINGIVAL SPACE pink porcelain ... nonstand ... syn, GINGIVAL PORCELAIN


# Usage paragraphs

Brief usage notes or paragraphs, labeled Editorial note for usage, have been placed in several entries for words or phrases that are considered to present special problems in terms of confused or disputed usage. A usage paragraph typically summarizes the historic background of the issue and its associated body of opinion, compares these with available evidence of current usage, and often adds comment for the use of the inquirer.

# DEFINITIONS

# Division of senses

A boldface colon is used in this glossary to introduce a definition:

1abrasive n (1853): a substance used for abrading, smoothing, or polishing

Boldface Arabic numerals separate the senses of a word that has more than one sense:

equilibrium  $n$  (1608): 1. a state of even adjustment between opposing forces; 2. the state or condition of a body in which any forces acting upon it are so arranged that their product at every point is zero; 3. a balance between active forces and negative resistance

The system of separating the various senses of a word by numerals is strictly a lexical convenience. It tends to reflect something of the semantic relationship, but it may establish a hierarchy of importance within them. Sometimes a particular relationship between senses is suggested by use of an italicized sense divider: comp (for compare). A brief statement that discriminates words of closely associated meaning has been placed in some entries. They are signaled by an italic: syn (for synonym). Italicized sense dividers are followed by the all CAPITALIZED glossary term or an italicized term if it is not in the glossary. With respect to the hierarchy of the use of a term, the primary term is defined.

# Omission of a sense

Occasionally the glossary user, having turned to an entry, may not find an expected or hoped for particular sense. This usually means that the editors judged the sense insufficiently common or otherwise unimportant to include in the glossary. Because our language is dynamic, revision by future editors may reflect changes in the sense of a word not found in this edition.

# APPENDIX B Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index (PDI) for Complete Edentulism

The official classification system for edentulism developed by the American College of Prosthodontists. The system classifies edentulous patient treatment complexity using four diagnostic criteria: (a) mandibular bone height, (b) maxillo-mandibular relationship, (c) maxillary residual ridge morphology, and (d) muscle attachments. These four criteria identify patients as Class 1 (ideal or minimally compromised), Class 2 (moderately compromised), Class 3 (substantially compromised), or Class 4 (severely compromised).

# The PDI for the Edentulous Class 1 Patient

A patient who presents with ideal or minimally compromised complete edentulism that can be treated successfully by conventional prosthodontic techniques. The Class 1 patient exhibits (a) a residual mandibular bone height of at least 21 millimeters measured at the area of least vertical bone height, (b) a maxillo-mandibular relationship permitting normal tooth articulation and an ideal ridge relationship, (c) a maxillary ridge morphology that resists horizontal and vertical movement of the denture base, and (d) muscle attachment locations conducive to denture base stability and retention.

# The PDI for the Edentulous Class 2 Patient

A patient who presents with moderately compromised complete edentulism and continued physical degradation of the denture supporting anatomy. The Class 2 patient exhibits (a) a residual mandibular bone height of 16-20 millimeters measured at the area of least vertical bone height, (b) a maxillo-mandibular relationship permitting normal tooth articulation and an appropriate ridge relationship, (c) a maxillary residual ridge morphology that resists horizontal and vertical movement of the denture base, and (d) muscle attachments that exert limited compromise on denture base stability and retention.


# The PDI for the Edentulous Class 3 Patient

A patient who presents with substantially compromised complete edentulism and exhibits (a) limited interarch space of 18-20 millimeters and/or temporomandibular disorders, (b) a residual mandibular bone height of 11-15 millimeters measures at the area of least vertical bone height, (c) an Angle Class I, II, or III maxillomandibular relationship, (d) muscle attachments that exert a moderate compromise on denture base stability and retention, and (e) a maxillary residual ridge morphology providing minimal resistance movement of the denture base

# The PDI for the Edentulous Class 4 Patient

A patient who presents with the most debilitated form of complete edentulism, where surgical reconstruction is usually indicated and specialized prosthodontic techniques are required to achieve an acceptable outcome. The Class 4 patient exhibits (a) a residual mandibular bone height of 10 millimeters or less, (b) an Angle Class I, II, or III maxillomandibular relationship, (c) a maxillary residual ridge morphology providing no resistance to movement of the denture base, and (d) muscle attachments that exert a significant compromise on denture base stability and retention.

# APPENDIX C Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index (PDI) for the Partially Edentulous Patient

The official classification system for the partially edentulous patient developed by the American College of Prosthodontists. The system classifies the partially edentulous treatment complexity based on four diagnostic criteria: (a) the location and extent of the edentulous areas, (b) the condition of the abutment teeth, (c) the occlusal scheme, and (d) the residual ridge. These four criteria identify patients as Class 1 (ideal or minimally compromised), Class 2 (moderately compromised), Class 3 (substantially compromised), or Class 4 (severely compromised).

# PDI for the Partially Edentulous (PE) Class 1 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) partial edentulism confined to a single arch, (b) minimal compromise to the abutment teeth, (c) an ideal or minimally compromised occlusion, (d) an Angle Class I molar and jaw relationships, and (e) an Angle Class I residual ridge (refer to the PDI for the Class I Completely Edentulous Patient, Appendix B). The PE Class 1 patient includes those with any anterior maxillary span not exceeding two incisors, any anterior mandibular span not exceeding four missing incisors, and any posterior span not exceeding two premolars or one premolar plus a molar.

# PDI for the Partially Edentulous Class 2 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) partial edentulism that is moderately compromised, confined to a single arch, (b) moderate compromise to the abutment teeth in at least one sextant, (c) a moderately compromised occlusal scheme that requires adjunctive therapy, (d) an Angle Class I molar and jaw relationships, and (e) an Angle Class II residual ridge (refer to PDI for the Class II Completely Edentulous Patient, Appendix B). The PE Class 2 patient includes those with any anterior maxillary span not exceeding all incisors, any anterior mandibular span not exceeding four missing incisors, and any posterior span not exceeding two premolars or one premolar plus a molar or any missing canine.


# PDI for the Partially Edentulous Class 3 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) partial edentulism that is substantially compromised, in multiple areas in one or both arches, (b) substantial compromise to the abutment teeth in three sextants, (c) a substantially compromised occlusal scheme requiring reestablishment of the entire occlusal scheme without a change in the vertical dimension, (d) an Angle Class II molar and jaw relationship, and/or (e) an Angle Class III residual ridge description (refer to PDI for the Class III Completely Edentulous Patient, Appendix B).

# PDI for the Partially Edentulous Class 4 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) partial edentulism that is severely compromised in multiple areas and opposing arches, (b) severe compromise to the abutment teeth in four or more sextants, (c) a severely compromised occlusal scheme requiring reestablishment of the entire occlusal scheme and a change in the vertical dimension, (d) an Angle Class II and/or Angle Class III molar and jaw relationships, and (e) at least one edentulous ridge having a guarded prognosis. The PE Class 4 patient also includes congenital or maxillofacial defects, those with at least one severely compromised edentulous arch, severe manifestations of local or systemic disease, severe ataxia or dyskinesia and the refractory patient.

# APPENDIX D Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index (PDI) for the Completely Dentate Patient

The official classification system for the completely dentate patient developed by the American College of Prosthodontists. This standardized identification grouping of dentate patient treatment complexities is based on two criteria: (a) the condition of the teeth and (b) the occlusal scheme. These criteria identify patients as Class 1 (ideal or minimally compromised), Class 2 (moderately compromised), Class 3 (substantially compromised), or Class 4 (severely compromised).

# Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index for the Completely Dentate Class 1 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) a dentition that is minimally compromised and (b) with contiguous, intact dental arches requiring prosthodontic treatment on three teeth or less that do not require adjunctive therapy (periodontal treatment, endodontic treatment, orthodontic treatment, etc.).

# Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index for the Completely Dentate Class 2 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) a dentition that is moderately compromised with no edentulous areas, (b) an intact anterior guidance, (c) pathology affecting the coronal morphology of 4 or more teeth in only one sextant, and (d) teeth that require adjunctive treatment (periodontal treatment, endodontic treatment, orthodontic treatment, etc.) on four or more teeth in one sextant.


# Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index for the Completely Dentate Class 3 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) a dentition that is substantially compromised with no edentulous areas, (b) an impaired anterior guidance, (c) substantial posterior occlusal wear and a normal vertical dimension, (d) pathology affecting the coronal morphology of 4 or more teeth in three or more sextants, and (e) teeth that are substantially compromised requiring adjunctive therapy (periodontal treatment, endodontic treatment, orthodontic treatment, etc.) in two sextants.

# Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index for the Completely Dentate Class 4 Patient

A patient who presents with (a) a dentition that is severely compromised with no edentulous areas, (b) an impaired anterior guidance, (c) severe posterior occlusal wear with loss of vertical dimension, (d) the need for the reestablishment of the entire occlusion with a change in vertical dimension, and (d) teeth that require adjunctive therapy (periodontal treatment, endodontic treatment, orthodontic treatment, etc.) in three or more sextants.
