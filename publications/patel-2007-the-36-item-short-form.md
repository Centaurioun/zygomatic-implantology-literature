# Abstract

The use of patient-derived, objective outcome measures has expanded substantially within the orthopaedic literature. Quality-of-life instruments are categorized as general health or as condition-specific questionnaires. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) is a general health-based survey of quality of life. It has been validated, is used widely across medical disciplines, and can be self-administered by the patient with reliability. The SF-36 has been implemented to define disease conditions, to determine the effect of treatment, to differentiate the effect of different treatments, and to compare orthopaedic conditions with other medical conditions. However, a bias of lower over upper extremity function has been demonstrated with the SF-36, as have limitations in assessment of certain physical activities of daily living as well as upper and lower limits on the detection of certain changes in quality-of-life status. Nevertheless, with an adequate knowledge of its effectiveness and limitations, the SF-36 can be a useful tool in many branches of orthopaedic surgery.

The assessment of patient outcomes is at the core of clinical research. Historically, outcomes have been described in surgeon-driven formats, such as personal observations and interpretations. The inherent bias present within such anecdotal data is problematic. Furthermore, the patient's perspective is either marginalized or ignored. The most notable example of this phenomenon in the orthopaedic literature is the use of radiographic parameters to define treatment outcomes.

Interest in patient-derived assessment of health care outcomes has grown during the past decade. Patient-derived outcome measures improve the objectivity of results and, when used appropriately, offer critical feedback to the treating physician. In addition, as patients become increasingly well-informed consumers of health care, objective outcome measures can guide a pa tient through treatment options. Finally, third-party payers are interested in ascribing a relative value to surgical procedures. The use of comparative outcome scores is already in use in many markets to justify authorization of procedures and payment schedules to providers. The potential implications of outcome measures on the daily practice of every orthopaedic surgeon render the understanding of these tools critically important.


Health outcome surveys can be broadly divided into two categories: general and condition-specific. General health questionnaires measure overall health through a wide breadth of questions covering multiple aspects of health. Condition-specific surveys focus on the functional impact and symptoms of a given condition. Both general and condition-specific outcome tools are widely reported and can be implemented together. General health surveys, however, allow for comparisons among patients with the same condition and between patients with different conditions. Additionally, general health surveys may detect unintended side effects of the treatment.


The use of patient-based measures in orthopaedic clinical outcome studies is now common; in fact, it is a requirement for publication in many journals. A comparison of six orthopaedic journals in 1991 and 2001 showed an increase in the use of patient-based measures, from  $8\%$  to  $18\%$  of published papers. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36; Medical Outcomes Trust, Waltham, MA) was the outcome measure most commonly employed.

# Basics of the SF-36

The SF-36 is a shortened version of 149 validated health-related questions originally reported as part of a medical outcomes study of more than 22,000 patients[2,3] (Figure 1). The RAND Corporation (Santa Monica, CA) and QualityMetric (Lincoln, RI), founded by one of the original authors of the SF-36, offer proprietary versions of the SF-36 that are available for licensed use.

The SF-36 measures three aspects of health: functional ability, wellbeing, and overall health. In an attempt to quantify these aspects, the SF-36 assesses eight domains of quality of life (Table 1). A single item also assesses the patient's perception of changes in health.

The SF-36 has been validated, and normative population data have been obtained. Validated translations into other languages have also been produced, in addition to normative international population data sets. Initial validation of the SF-36 was performed among general medical populations. One of the initial validation studies of the SF-36, performed among 1,980 randomly selected subjects, found high levels of reliability between patients of similar health status.6 Validity in distinguishing health differences was also determined through a comparison with a historical health measurement. In a survey of 1,700 patients and 900 healthy subjects, Garratt et al7 also reported high levels of reproducibility among patients with similar medical conditions. In addition, marked differences were consistently observed between patients with medical conditions and the general population. Subsequently, the SF-36 has been found to be reliable and valid across many medical conditions, including pulmonary, cardiac, endocrine, renal, and orthopaedic disorders.8-11


# Administration

The SF-36 is designed to be self-administered by the patient. It is available in both paper and computer formats. The survey can be given during an office visit or can be sent to the patient by mail to be completed at home. The average time to complete the survey is between 5 and 10 minutes, although the ideal interval for administration depends on the condition, treatment, patient population being examined, and purpose of the study.

# Scoring and Results

Scoring of the SF-36 items is completed for each of the individual subscales. A scoring manual provides normative values of the eight subscales. Scores are weighted and transformed into a scale from 0 (worst possible health, severe disability) to 100 (best health, no disability). Scoring takes place only when the patient has responded to at least half of the items within each scale. No total score is calculated.

Results can be displayed in numerous formats. Tables allow for direct comparison of numeric values. The use of bar graphs with markers of standard deviation allows for direct visual comparison of scores between data sets (Figure 2).

# Modifications

A modification to the original scoring that has been widely used groups the eight subscales into two components: a physical component summary (PCS) score and a mental component summary (MCS) score. These scores are adjusted by population mean and standard deviation to produce normative scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 (Figure 3). The PCS and MCS scales can be calculated only when there are sufficient data to calculate each of the subscale scores.

Summary scores generally have been reported in addition to individual scale scores. The isolated use of PCS and MCS scores can be useful in particular situations—for example, when limiting the number of analyzed outcomes, as in very large studies, or when there is interest in a more general effect on health. In a review of 226 total hip and total knee arthroplasty patients, Marx et al $^{13}$  found the PCS scale to be as responsive to postoperative changes as joint-specific measurements.

A further modification has been the development of the SF-12 questionnaire. [14] A validated scale, the SF-12 contains a subset of the items used in the SF-36, utilizes a weighted scoring algorithm, and can be interpreted using physical and mental summaries. [15] Because of its length, the SF-12 shortens the time of administration. However, with only one or two items per subscale, less information is gathered with regard to a patient's general health. Furthermore, the smaller amount of data per subscale also limits the precision and interpretation of mean scores. Studies with a smaller number of patients therefore may be better served with use of the SF-36.

# Statistical Analysis

The measured outcomes, both from the SF-36 subscales as well as from the SF-36 component summaries, can be compared with different control data sets: normative popula

Standard deviation calculations among data sets can be used to determine statistically significant differences. In addition, the use of a standardized response mean (observed change divided by the standard deviation of change) has been described to better define significant changes in scores.[13,16] This value normalizes measured change to the standard deviation of change for each data set. Multivariate analysis may identify certain factors (eg, patient demographics, smoking status) that are positively or negatively correlated with SF-36 scores.


# Use of SF-36 in Orthopaedic Literature

The SF-36 survey has been utilized for four distinct goals: (1) to determine the effect of a condition on the patient's quality of health; (2) to determine the outcome of a treatment; (3) to compare the effect of treatment options for a condition; and (4) to compare the effect of a procedure against other unrelated procedures and medical conditions.

The x-axis is composed of the eight SF-36 subscales—physical functioning (PF), physical role functioning (PRF), bodily pain (BP), general health (Gen), vitality (V), social functioning (SF), emotional role functioning (ERF), and mental health (MH)—and two component summary scales: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS).

# Determining the Effect of a Condition on Quality of Health

SF-36 measures can enhance our understanding of the impact of a condition on the patient beyond condition-specific symptoms. A better understanding of the patient's pretreatment physical and mental health can help in counseling patients on treatment options and expectations.


Smith et al<sup>17</sup> analyzed the health status of patients with rotator cuff tears. A total of 191 patients were observed; each completed the SF-36 form as well as shoulder-specific surveys. The authors reported that all of the individual SF-36 domains, except mental health and general health, were below mean scores for age- and sex-adjusted population norms. The information obtained in this study quantifies the impact of rotator cuff tears on both physical and mental health. Furthermore, good correlation was found between scores from the shoulder-specific survey and the SF-36.[17]


King et al[18] assessed the quality of life among patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) by using the SF-36 form. Eighty-eight patients with CSM, within the Veterans Administration (VA) hospital system, underwent structured interviews and completed SF-36 forms. Scores were compared with age-adjusted, VA population normative values. Patients with CSM exhibited worse scores on all SF-36 domain scales as well as on PCS and MCS scales. Patients with a history of cervical spine surgery demonstrated similar or worse scores compared with patients with no history of cervical spine surgery. There was a positive correlation between the SF-36 PCS and individual myelopathy scale scores. The authors of this study concluded that patients with CSM exhibit decreased quality of life in all health domains associated with the SF-36 and that the impact of the disease extends beyond motor, sensory, and bladder dysfunctions recorded with myelopathy scales to involve emotional and mental health.[18]

Thordarson et al[19] assessed the functional and health-related quality of life on a population of patients with hallux valgus about to undergo surgery. The patients completed a baseline SF-36 as well as condition-specific questionnaires. Preoperative radiographic data with regard to the hallux valgus angle and the intermetatarsal angle were stratified and grouped according to severity of the deformity. Bodily pain scores were consistently worse for patients with a bunion through all age groups compared with the general population. Interestingly, the severity of the deformity did not correlate with any of the outcome scores. The authors of the study concluded that the bodily pain score from the SF-36 appears to be a sensitive measure of problems experienced by patients undergoing bunion surgery and suggested that pain, not deformity, should be the primary rationale for surgical intervention.[19]


Daffner et al[20] assessed the general health impact of neck pain and radicular pain in a prospective multicenter study. SF-36 data were obtained from 1,809 patients. Patients were categorized by symptoms (radicular pain, axial pain, or combined), age (<40, 40 to 60, or >60 years), and symptom duration (acute, <6 weeks; subacute, 6 weeks to 6 months; or chronic, >6 months). Patients who presented with both axial and radicular symptoms had the lowest SF-36 scores relative to age and sex norms. These scores were significantly lower than those for patients with only axial or only radicular symptoms across all eight subscales  $(P < 0.05$  to  $P < 0.0001)$ . Scores for patients with only axial pain were significantly lower than for patients with only radicular pain for vitality  $(P < 0.04)$  and general health  $(P < 0.004)$ . Younger patients were significantly more affected by their symptoms than were patients aged >60 years for all eight scales  $(P < 0.01)$ . Physical component scores were similar for acute, subacute, and chronic groups, whereas mental component scores were significantly  $(P < 0.001)$  worse for patients with chronic pain. The authors concluded that patients with combined neck and arm pain, younger patients, and patients with chronic symptoms experienced significantly greater disability from their symptoms. The amount of disability experienced by patients in these groups may account for differences in treatment outcomes.[20]


# Determining the Outcome of a Treatment

The SF-36 can be used to justify or refute both surgical and nonsurgical treatment plans. It can also identify patient-specific variables (eg, demographics, smoking status, workers' compensation) in addition to surgical variables that can be correlated with outcomes.

Bhandhari et al[21] prospectively observed 30 patients with unstable Weber type B ankle fractures who were otherwise healthy. Prior observational studies reported less than satisfactory outcomes in up to  $24\%$  of patients.[21] Detailed information regarding alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and educational level were obtained, and each patient completed the SF-36 questionnaire at regular follow-up intervals. The patients experienced notable improvement in all domains of the SF-36 questionnaire except general health, which remained unchanged. Study patients achieved scores similar to those of age-matched US normative data across six of the eight subscales (role emotional, social function, mental health, bodily pain, vitality, and general health). Patients' physical function and role physical scores remained markedly lower than US norms at 24 months. Smoking history, presence of medial malleolar fracture, and lower levels of education were significant independent predictors of lower physical function up to 3 months postoperatively. Lower mental health scores were notably associated with alcohol use. This study concluded that social factors may be important determinants of outcome in patients with traumatic fractures and that care also should involve attention to these modifiable risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, to maximize outcomes.[21]

A prospective clinical trial to correlate radiographic parameters and functional outcome in patients undergoing spinal osteotomy was performed by Ahn et al.[22] No previous prospective reports had studied whether correction of specific radiographic parameters is associated with improvement in functional outcome. Eighty-three patients with fixed sagittal and/or coronal deformity were followed during a 7-year period. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically as well as through SF-36 scores. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between correction of radiographic parameters and functional outcome. Among patients with correction of lumbar lordosis  $\geq 25^{\circ}$ , a significant association was found between radiographic measurement and the role physical outcome scale of the SF-36 ( $P = 0.018$ ). Among patients with coronal gravity-line correction to  $\leq 2.5$  cm, a significant association was found between measurements of SF-36 outcomes in physical function, vitality, social function, and mental health ( $P = 0.023$  to 0.05). The results of this study suggest that adequate radiographic correction of deformity in this population group can be expected to lead to significant improvements in functional outcome.[22]


Glassman et al $^{23}$  examined preoperative SF-36 data in patients who required additional surgical procedures following lumbar spine fusion to identify potential predictors of this adverse surgical outcome. Their study demonstrated a relationship between preoperative SF-36 assessment of pain  $(P = 0.013)$ , social function  $(P = 0.021)$ , and mental health  $(P = 0.61)$  with an increased likelihood of a subsequent surgical procedure. Although a causal basis of this relationship cannot be determined definitely from this study, several hypothetical explanations seemed plausible. Higher pain scores may indicate a low pain tolerance that persists into the postoperative period; recurrent reports of pain may increase the likelihood for further sur gical intervention. The fact that subscales related to mental health and social function are also associated with revision surgery is consistent with the well-documented impact of psychological factors on the outcome of spine patients. This study, therefore, raises the possibility of using the SF-36 in predicting poor outcomes based on pretreatment scores.[23]


# Comparing the Effect of Treatment Options

Using the SF-36, comparisons can be made between surgical procedures as well as between surgical and nonsurgical treatment. In addition, variables that may influence outcomes can be identified.

In a prospective randomized clinical study, Buckley et al[24] compared general and disease-specific health outcomes between patients with calcaneal fractures who were treated either surgically or nonsurgically. Validated outcomes measures included the SF-36 and a visual analog scale. A total of 309 of 512 patients were followed and assessed for a minimum of 2 years with a maximum follow-up of 8 years. The outcomes after nonsurgical treatment were not found to be statistically different from those after surgical treatment  $(P = 0.13)$ . The study did show that patients who were not receiving workers' compensation and were managed surgically had significantly  $(P = 0.001)$  higher satisfaction scores. Furthermore, women and younger patients who were managed surgically scored significantly  $(P = 0.015)$  higher on the SF-36. The authors of this study concluded that, without stratification of the groups, the functional results after nonsurgical care were equivalent to those after surgical care; however, after removal of the patients who were receiving workers' compensation, the outcomes were significantly better in some groups of surgically treated patients.[24]

# Comparing a Condition or Treatment Against Other Unrelated Conditions or Treatments

The use of SF-36 scoring across medical disciplines allows comparisons to be made between otherwise disparate conditions and procedures. This information defines the impact of a musculoskeletal condition or treatment in relative terms, thereby giving the patient, physician, and payer perspective on the severity of condition. A more complete understanding of the significance of musculoskeletal conditions clarifies the importance of good orthopaedic care.

Hozack et al[25] used the SF-36 form to prospectively compare patients' self-reported assessment of health and function before and after five common orthopaedic procedures: primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) (151 patients), total hip revision (49), primary total knee replacement (149), lumbar laminectomy (41), and spinal fusion for adult scoliosis (43). Primary THA and lumbar laminectomy gave the best results, producing similar follow-up scores. Primary THA showed significant improvements in physical function  $(P = 0.01)$  and health perception  $(P = 0.02)$  compared with revision THA, but all other health parameters were equal. Primary THA showed markedly better follow-up scores and greater improvement in scores in four categories of the SF-36 compared with primary total knee arthroplasty. The authors concluded that the SF-36 can be a useful outcome measurement across surgical disciplines. Additionally, the data show that lumbar spine surgery, which has been criticized as a questionable practice, can be as beneficial as total joint arthroplasty.[25] van Tetering and Buckley26 compared patients' general health status after treatment of displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures to normative data, to other orthopaedic procedures, and to other medical conditions. A total of 312 patients


between the ages of 25 and 64 years were treated for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures, with follow-ups of 2 to 8 years. The SF-36 form was used for outcomes measurement. Results showed that the scores in all eight SF-36 subscales were notably lower than age- and sex-matched normative values. Outcomes in patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures were not as good across most SF-36 categories as reported outcomes of other orthopaedic procedures (eg, primary THA, knee arthroplasty). Outcomes in patients with displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures were equivalent to or worse than those across most categories in patients who had organ transplants or myocardial infarction. The results suggest that displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures are serious life-changing events with quality-of-life implications equivalent to those of significant medical conditions.[26]

In a retrospective cohort study, Pollak et al[27] assessed the general health status after surgical treatment of tibial plafond fractures. SF-36 data were compared with normative values as well as with reported values from other orthopaedic and medical conditions (eg, congestive heart failure, hemodialysis, diabetes, myocardial infarction, spinal cord injury). At an average follow-up of 3.2 years, patients had significantly  $(P < 0.05)$  lower scores than did age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Additionally, scores were lower than published scores for patients with diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and chronic asthma. The authors suggest that tibial plafond fractures can have persistent consequences beyond purely physical limitations.[27]

# Limitations of the SF-36

The SF-36 has limitations that can affect the interpretation of outcomes data. Common to all patient-derived measures, patient literacy and language barriers can limit the applicability of the SF-36. Additionally, the SF-36 has been shown to have more specific limitations.


First, the responses tend to be affected more by lower extremity function than by upper extremity function. Gartsman et al[28] prospectively analyzed 50 patients who had undergone surgery for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Patients completed the SF-36 as well as shoulder-specific surveys before and at an average of 13 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative scores demonstrated highly significant improvements in the patients' assessment both of general health (general outcome measure) and of function of the shoulder (disease-specific measure). The SF-36 revealed significant improvements in all subscales (range,  $P = 0.0001$  to 0.0213). All three shoulder-specific rating systems also demonstrated significant  $(P = 0.001)$  improvements in the postoperative scores for pain and function. This study demonstrated that self-assessment tools, such as the SF-36, can accurately demonstrate the effect of a tear of the rotator cuff on a patient's perception of his or her general health. Disease-specific questionnaires elicited additional information by providing the degree of improvement as well as by detailing specific activities that were affected by the musculoskeletal lesion. The authors noted a potential for error when the SF-36 was relied on exclusively; some of the patients in this study had successful results with regard to region-specific scales but had decreased scores on the SF-36. If the SF-36 were relied on solely, the shoulder might erroneously be thought to be the source of the impairment.[28]

The ability of the SF-36 survey to detect certain changes in quality-of-life status may be another limitation. Hozack et al[25] noted that, de spite higher preoperative scores, patients who had undergone scoliosis surgery compared unfavorably at 2-year follow-up with patients who had undergone primary THA. The authors suggested that the SF-36 may not be adequate to identify the impact of many orthopaedic interventions on function. The SF-36 does not incorporate basic quality-of-life domains, such as sexual function, sleep, and family function; improvements in these significant daily functions would not be reflected in the SF-36 score. This suggests that a "ceiling effect" may be present; notable improvements in quality of life would not be measured. In addition, notable diminishments may go undetected, as well, indicating a "floor effect."25


Shapiro et al[29] obtained SF-36 data on patients prospectively undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The authors attempted to assess the SF-36 as a predictor for treatment (surgical versus nonsurgical). Baseline SF-36 data, although showing markedly poorer scores compared with population normative values, were unable to predict the results of treatment. The study was unable to demonstrate a correlation of the SF-36 scores with objective measures of knee laxity (eg, Lachman test, pivot shift, instrumented laxity), the primary indication for surgical intervention. The authors concluded that, although the SF-36 did objectively document improvements in these patients, the SF-36 was not a good predictor for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The SF-36 may be limited in its ability to detect clinically relevant functional limitations in this population.[29]

# Summary

The SF-36 is a widely used general health measurement of quality of life. It has been validated across medical disciplines as well as across international borders. The use of general health measurements, strengthened when combined with condition-specific surveys, provides an objective, patient-derived assessment of orthopaedic conditions as well as the results of treatment. Information obtained from the SF-36, as well as from other condition-specific outcome measurements, is valuable to both the patient and the treating physician. Improvements in patients' physical and mental health validate treatment options and serve as a powerful tool in the advancement of health care. These objective measures also will prove to be useful tools for the advocacy of orthopaedic surgery in an economically constrained environment.
