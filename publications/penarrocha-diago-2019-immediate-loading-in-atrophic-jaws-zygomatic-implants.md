# Take-Home Message

- The rehabilitation of atrophic maxillas with zygomatic implants and immediate loading is a predictable treatment option that shortens treatment time, reduces treatment costs, and improves patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is a demanding treatment option that requires high surgical skills and experience to avoid or, in the event of happening, manage the complications that can be severe.

# Introduction

PI Brænemark introduced the concept of zygomatic implants in 1989 using the zygoma bone, away from the alveolar ridge, as anchorage for oral rehabilitation. In 1998, after proven clinical success, this implant started to market (Brænemark 1998; Brænemark et al. 2004). The zygomatic fixture is an extended length  $(35 - 55\mathrm{mm})$  titanium implant, placed into the zygomatic and maxillary alveolar bone. It was designed for situations where atrophy of the posterior maxilla complicates or prevents the placing of conventional implants (Vrielinck et al. 2003; Parel et al. 2001; Stevenson and Austin 2000). The use of zygomatic implants avoids the need for bone grafting, shortens treatment times, and reduces morbidity. Widmark et al. in 2001 obtained a survival rate of  $74\%$  after 3-5 years of follow-up in patients with bone grafts and conventional implants, while treatment with implants placed in unusual locations provided an  $87\%$  success rate (Widmark et al. 2001).


Zygomatic implants have been used in atrophic posterior maxilla and in cases with pneumatization of the maxillary sinus (Bedrossian and Stumpel 2001; Stevenson and Austin 2000), avoiding the need for bone grafts in the posterior area (Boyes-Varley et al. 2003b). They have also been used in patients with maxillectomies resulting from tumors or diseases associated with atrophic conditions of the maxilla (Weischer et al. 1997; Tamura et al. 2000). It was also indicated for those who preferred to avoid multiple surgeries and extended treatment times for healing and subsequent implant placement. It also eliminated the need to employ long-term transitional removable prosthesis prior to fabrication of the final prosthesis (Tuminelli et al. 2017).

The original Brænemark protocol consisted in the placement of two zygomatic implants bilaterally in the posterior maxilla and four additional axial implants in the premaxilla. Following a submerged healing period of 6 months, a final fixed dental prosthesis was made. This approach achieves a high implant survival rate of  $94\%$  and a prosthetic success rate of  $96\%$  after 5 years (Brænemark et al. 2004). The two major limitations of this approach were the palatally emergence of the prosthetic abutment, which can cause speech alterations, tongue irritation, and hygiene difficulties, and the intrasinus pathway of the implant, which was associated with asymptomatic sinus mucosal alterations and sometimes sinusitis (Davó et al. 2008a).

With the development of new surgical techniques, the limitations of the original protocol were gradually solved, achieving a more natural implant emergence into the alveolar ridge and less invasiveness to maxillary sinus. Additionally, with the advance of the technique, a purely zygoma approach was used to rehabilitate patients with absence of the bone in the premaxilla. With this protocol, four zygomatic implants were placed (two in each zygoma). An adequate anterior-posterior

# Immediate Loading with Zygomatic Implants

Balshi and Wolfinger first describe immediate loading of zygomatic implants in a case report published in 2003 (Balshi and Wolfinger 2003). After this initial mention,

Chow and Bedrossian published the first case series in 2006 with 5 and 14 patients included, respectively. Both obtain an implant survival rate of  $100\%$  at 10 and 12 months of follow-up (Chow et al. 2006; Bedrossian et al. 2006).

We elaborated a literature review for this chapter, and Table 1 summarizes the implant survival rates of zygomatic implants immediately loaded. Of a total of 1040 patients treated with zygomatic (2179 implants) and regular implants (3117 implants), an implant survival rate of  $95.12 - 100\%$  and  $94.9 - 100\%$  is expected, respectively, up to 10 years. For patients treated with the all-on-four zygoma or quad zygoma

The most frequent mechanical complication is the fracture of the prosthesis or the veneering material. Screw loosening and screw fracture were two common complications too. Because the original protocol to insert zygomatic implants needs an intrasinusal approach, sinus complications are reported frequently in the literature associated with this procedure (Chrcanovic et al. 2016). In our review, of 764 patients, 63  $(8.24\%)$  suffered sinus complications. The main sinus complication was acute sinusitis followed by the formation of an oro-antral fistula. The treatment of the sinusitis consists in the administration of oral antibiotics. In cases that this measure is not enough, endoscopic surgery was done, consisting in the opening of the maxillary ostium to improve sinus drainage. In extreme cases or in the presence of oro-antral fistula that don't close, the explantation of the zygomatic implant is mandatory.


# Treatment Plan for Immediate Loading in Atrophic Maxillas

According to Bedrossian et al. (2008), the maxilla can be divided into three zones: (1) the premaxilla, (2) the premolar area, and (3) the molar area (see chapter "Diagnosis and Planning in Immediate Loading: Implant Selection"). The clinician should determine the availability of bone in all three zones. Cone beam computed tomography can be used to determine the amount of bone in these zones as well as in the zygomatic arch, in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. Moreover, any pathology in these areas, as well as in the maxillary sinuses, needs to be verified preoperatively.

- Bone presence in zones 1, 2, and 3: Traditional four, six, or eight axial implants.
- Bone presence in zones 1 and 2: Four implants. Two anterior axial implants and two posterior-tilted implants guided by the anterior maxillary sinus wall. All-on-four protocol.
- Bone presence only in zone 1: Two anterior axial implants and two zygomatic implants bilaterally in molar/premolar area. All-on-four hybrid protocol.
Insufficient bone in all zones: Four zygomatic implants. Quad zygoma or all-on-four zygoma.

In cases where the bone ridge is narrow, implants can be placed in a palatal position in the anterior or premolar zones. With this approach it is possible to achieve good primary implant stability and overcame the deficiency of a thin marginal crest (less than  $4\mathrm{mm}$  wide). The placement of implants palatal to the alveolar crest in the maxilla allows maximum use of the available bone in patients with severe horizontal bone resorption, reducing patient morbidity compared to conventional augmentation procedures (Peñaarrocha et al. 2009).


# Clinical Procedures

# Zygomatic Implants Surgical Procedure

When an all-on-four standard procedure cannot be performed due to the lack of bone in zones 2 (premolar) and 3 (molar) and even in zone 1 (premaxilla), the use of zygomatic implants is indicated to provide these patients with a fixed immediate load restoration.

The realization of a CBCT is mandatory to know the anatomy of the zygoma bone of the patient. The knowledge of the anatomy of this bone is extremely important, especially in the quad zygoma approach where two areas in the zygoma bone are necessary to host the apex of two implants.

The zygoma is an irregular bone with various thicknesses, and its characteristics are diverse between ethnicities and gender (Takamaru et al. 2016; Zhou and Wu 2001). In a recent study by Hung et al. (2017), the thickness of the zygoma ranged from 4.51 to  $8.01\mathrm{mm}$  and the lengths from 25.67 to  $32.54\mathrm{mm}$ ; in female these measurements were smaller than in male. No differences were found between the zygoma bone of dentate and edentulous patients. Apart of the zygoma bone, the radiologic examination should include the maxilla, a full view of the maxillary sinuses, and the floor of the orbit. Information about the health of the sinuses, the opening of the meatus, and the position of the infraorbital nerve must be recorded (Malevez 2012).

# Anesthesia

In the original protocol, general anesthesia with nasal intubation is required for the surgery. Local anesthetic (lidocaine with epinephrine 1:50,000) was infiltrated to block the superior alveolar nerves (posterior, middle, and anterior) and the palatal nerves (posterior and nasopalatal) and to obtain local hemostasis.

An alternative approach combining intravenous conscious sedation and local anesthesia can be used especially by experienced surgeons and in interventions that are expected to last less than  $90\mathrm{min}$  (Penarrocha et al. 2005; Aparicio et al. 2008). No differences were found regarding patient satisfaction between these two types of anesthetic procedures because both have high satisfaction. Nevertheless a conscious sedation procedure would be of choice regarding simplicity, economic cost, and the possibility to go home after surgery sooner (Almeida et al. 2017).

The intravenous sedation procedure requires the simultaneous use of local anesthetic procedure. The procedure starts with the infiltration anesthesia in the buccal vestibule from the central incisor to the third molar, using articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, the block of the palatal posterior nerve and the infraorbital nerve block. Also it is necessary to infiltrate anesthesia around the zygoma area through the skin or the oral mucosa.


# Surgical Techniques

According to a recent systematic review (Chrcanovic et al. 2013), five different surgical techniques have been described in the literature for zygomatic implants: the classical approach or Brænemark approach, the sinus slot technique, the exteriorized approach, the minimally invasive approach by the use of custom-made drill guides, and the computer-aided surgical navigation system approach. In this chapter we are going to resume the first three, because these are still the most common approaches for the placement of zygomatic implants.

# The Classical Approach

The original technique was first described by Brânemark in 1998 (Brânemark 1998) and was used by many other authors in several clinical studies (Parel et al. 2001; Bedrossian et al. 2002, 2006; Boyes-Varley et al. 2003a; Nakai et al. 2003; Brânemark et al. 2004; Hirsch et al. 2004; Malevez et al. 2004; Becktor et al. 2005; Ahlgren et al. 2006; Aparicio et al. 2006; Chow et al. 2006; Farzad et al. 2006; Aghabeigi and Bousdras 2007; Davó et al. 2007, 2008a, b, 2010; Duarte et al. 2007; Kahnberg et al. 2007; Mozzati et al. 2008; Pi-Urgell et al. 2008; Balshi et al. 2009; Davó 2009; Bedrossian 2010; Stievenart and Malevez 2010). The surgery starts with a vestibular incision similar to a LeFort I incision between first molar regions. A palatal flap is raised to expose the alveolar ridge and the entire hard palate. The nasal mucosa is dissected to increase visibility and to orient the surgeon into the local anatomy. The dissection is continued along the infrazygomatic crest toward the zygomatic bone. The infraorbital nerve is localized and the zygomatic region exposed. The periosteum of the medial part of the zygomatic body and the zygomatic arch is raised. A window  $(5 \times 10 \mathrm{~mm})$  is opened in the uppermost lateral aspect of the sinus wall in the extension of the infrazygomatic crest, using a round bur. The sinus mucosa is then elevated with no special effort to keep it intact. The window provides direct visibility of the roof of the sinus and allows localization of the optimal point for entrance of the drill into the zygoma bone. From a prosthetic point of view, the optimal entrance is as far posterior and close to the alveolar ridge as possible. The entrance on the palatal side of the crest is marked, and a round bur  $(\varnothing 2.9 \mathrm{~mm})$  is used to penetrate the crest and mark the entrance in the roof of the sinus. The entire site in the zygoma is then prepared with a twist drill  $(\varnothing 2.9 \mathrm{~mm})$ . A  $3.5-$  mm pilot drill is then used to enlarge the site. To ensure that the wider drill does not deviate from the planned direction, it is equipped with a non-cutting tip  $2.8\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter. The preparation continues with a  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  twist drill with a cutting apex. A depth indicator is inserted into the site to decide the correct length of the zygoma fixture. A  $4\mathrm{-mm}$  countersink drill may be used only when the palatal bone is thick or dense because of the risk of excessive widening of the palatal entrance. The zygomatic implant is inserted slowly until its apical portion is anchored in the zygoma bone, and it is manually inserted to adequate depth and positioned in an optimal way from the prosthetic point of view. The muscles that were released from the lower anterior aspect of the zygoma should be carefully repositioned to avoid the formation of a retrozygoma space. The submucous tissue should be reattached with individual absorbable sutures that connect to the lateral horizontal incision over the distal aspect of the maxilla, so that tissue with periosteum provides a cover over the window in the upper anterior maxillary body. The initial incision is then closed with individual mattress non-absorbable sutures. In this protocol, adequate alveolar bone must be present in the anterior maxilla to allow the placement of two to four anterior maxillary implants combined with the zygomatic implants (Branemark 1998; Branemark et al. 2004).


# The Sinus Slot Approach

The sinus slot technique was introduced by Stella and Warner in 2000 (Stella and Warner 2000) and has been used by other authors in clinical studies (Ferrara and Stella 2004; Peñarrocha et al. 2005, 2007; Davó et al. 2008a, b). The operative technique begins with a crestal incision extending from one maxillary tuberosity to the contralateral tuberosity. A vertical-releasing incision is made bilaterally at the posterior extent of the incision. Thus it extends around the base of the piriform rim, up to the inferior aspect of the infraorbital nerves, and around the inferior halves of the body of the zygomas. The palatal mucosa is reflected only to expose the bone crest. A fissure bur is then used to make a hole through the bone and into the sinus cavity at the superior extent of the contour of the zygomatic buttress. The depth gauge is placed in the bur hole and positioned to simulate the angle of approach of the implant twist drill. A second bur hole is made on this line  $5\mathrm{mm}$  above the crest of the ridge. A slot is then made that connects the two bur holes. The superior aspect of the slot extends to the base of the zygoma, while the inferior extent of the slot approximates the floor of the maxillary sinus. This slot is made directly through the buttress wall without concern of compromise to the sinus membrane. The slot results in a smaller antrostomy than the classical technique but will serve to orient the twist drills for implant placement. With a round bur, a small point is marked at the ideal location on the crest of the maxillary ridge, which lines up with the sinus slot. This places the implant abutment in the first molar region. The tip of the zygomatic twist drill  $(\varnothing 2.9\mathrm{mm})$  is placed directly over the crest of the ridge, and the drill is directed such that it extents directly through the sinus slot that was previously fabricated. The tip of the drill is guided through the center of the slot under direct visualization. The drill is advanced superiorly toward the junction of the lateral orbital rim and zygomatic arch. The  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  pilot drill and  $3.5\mathrm{-mm}$  twist drill are then used in the same fashion, being directed through the center of the sinus slot. The depth of preparation is checked with the depth gauge, and the appropriate implant length is chosen. As the implant is being placed, it can be seen directly as it cuts threads on either side of the sinus slot (Stella and Warner 2000). Two cases treated with this approach were showed in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.


# The Exteriorized Approach

The exteriorized approach was first described by Miglioranca et al. in 2006 (Miglioranca et al. 2006) and is also called "extramaxillary" or "extrasinus zygomatic implants" (Miglioranca et al. 2006, 2011; Maló et al. 2008; Aparicio et al. 2010a; Chow et al. 2010). A midcrestal incision from one tuberosity to the other was done, along with two vertical-releasing incisions in the zygomatic pillar region. A mucoperiosteal flap is elevated, allowing visualization of anatomical structures. The zygomatic implants are placed outside the sinus, contacting the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus, as distal as the anatomy of the patient allows, in the second premolar or first molar region. No maxillary antrostomy is necessary. The zygomatic implant osteotomy begins with a spherical drill, which penetrates the residual ridge near to the top of the crest, from palatal to buccal. The drill transfixes the crest and emerges in the buccal aspect of the ridge, external to the maxillary sinus. The drilling continues toward the zygoma bone along the outer aspect of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus until it reaches the zygoma in its lateral portion. With the same drill, the zygomatic bone is perforated until the outer cancellous layer of the bone is surpassed. The depth indicator is then used to determine the length of the zygomatic implant. The osteotomy is progressively widened using the usual drill sequence. Then, the implants were placed and the insertion is completed manually. The zygomatic implant platform emerges over or close to the top of the crest of the residual alveolar ridge (Miglioranza et al. 2006, 2011).


This technique is especially indicated in those patients with pronounced buccal concavities on the lateral aspect of the maxillary sinus, in whom the use of the original technique with an intrasinus path results in excessive palatal emergence of the implant head. This commonly results in a bulky dental bridge at the palatal aspect, which sometimes leads to discomfort and problems with oral hygiene and

Caused by a poor prognosis, it was decided to extract remnant teeth of the maxilla and do a fixed rehabilitation on implants speech (Boyes-Varley et al. 2003b; Al-Nawas et al. 2004; Becktor et al. 2005; Farzad et al. 2006). Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 show three cases treated with this approach.


# Selection of the Surgical Technique for Zygomatic Implants

The selection of the surgical technique must take into consideration the concavity formed between the alveolar crest, the maxillary sinus wall, and the region of the zygoma where the implants are going to be placed, as well as surgeon preference. When this concavity is small, the original classical technique or the sinus slot technique should be more indicated because of the anatomical impossibility to exteriorize the implant. Of these two, the sinus slot is of preference because it is less invasive. When a more pronounced concavity exists, it would be better to exteriorize the zygomatic implant or use the sinus slot technique. At this respect, Aparicio in 2011 suggest a classification (zygoma anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA)) of the anatomy of the maxillary-zygomatic complex to guide the selection of the surgical technique based on the relation between the alveolar crest, the zygoma, and the concavity they formed (Aparicio 2011; Aparicio et al. 2014a).

The exteriorized approach, when possible, should be considered as the technique of choice, as it has fewer surgical steps than the classical and sinus slot techniques, is less invasive, and reduces surgical time. As an alternative technique or when anatomy does not permit the exteriorized approach, the sinus slot technique is of choice (Chrcanovic et al. 2013).

# Rehabilitation of Atrophic Maxillas with Zygomatic Implants

# All-on-Four Hybrid

The all-on-four hybrid treatment protocol is indicated when the maxilla of the patient doesn't have enough bone in zones 2 (premolars) and 3 (molars) for axial implant placement, but the bone is available in zone 1 (premaxilla). In this type of cases, the tilted posterior implants used in the all-on-four standard protocol cannot be used because their emergence would be at cuspid level, and consequently a very short prosthetic arch length can be obtained.

The all-on-four hybrid treatment protocol consists in the use of zygomatic implants anchored in the zygoma bone to provide posterior support to the prosthesis combined with the placement of anterior regular implants in the premaxilla. This technique was called hybrid and described by immediate loading protocol, caused by a low primary stability of the right frontomaxillary implant. (o and p) Temporary titanium abutments were placed to perform a bite register and sent to the dental technician for mounting the models. (q-s) The impression abutments were placed and splinted and an open tray impression was made. (t) Detail of the temporary prosthesis sent by the dental technician. (u) Intraoral and (v) extraoral aspect of the temporary prosthesis. (w) Aspect of soft tissues at 1 week of suture removal. (x) Postoperative panoramic x-ray. The immediate loading was performed using the zygoma implants, the left frontomaxillary implant, and the implant placed in the nasopalatine canal. The two pterygoid implants and the right frontomaxillary implant were left for a submerged healing (Phibo TSH®, Phibo Dental Solutions, Sentmenat, Barcelona, Spain)

(b and c) In the CBCT 3D reconstruction is possible to see the absence of bone in the premaxilla. (d) Two zygoma implants and two anterior implants in the frontomaxillary region were planned for this patient, associated with an immediate loading protocol

Miglioranza et al. (2008) due to the use of two different implant types: regular implants anchored in the maxilla and zygomatic implants anchored in the zygoma bone.

For the all-on-four hybrid, we can use the following combinations depending on the anatomy of the patient:

- One zygomatic implant, one posterior regular tilted implant and two anterior regular axial implants
- Two zygomatic implants with two anterior regular axial implants
- Three zygomatic implants with one anterior regular axial implant

From a biomechanical point of view, this technique is very similar to the all-on-four standard technique, not being necessary the use of more than four implants to support a complete full-arch rehabilitation.

The use of immediate loading follows the aforementioned protocols for the all-on-four standard concept, being necessary a minimum of  $35 - 40\mathrm{Nm}$  in each implant.

Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13 show three cases rehabilitated with this approach.

# All-on-Four Zygoma or Quad Zygoma

The all-on-four zygoma or quad zygoma protocol consists in the use of four zygomatic implants, anchored in the zygoma bone, to support a full-arch maxillary rehabilitation. It was first described by Duarte et al. (2007) and is indicated when only the basal bone of the maxilla is present—no bone in zones 1, 2, and 3—so there is no possibility of regular implant insertion. It is a rescue procedure when regular implants have failed, leading to a situation of extreme bone atrophy, and when bone grafting has failed if bone grafting had been the first choice of treatment (Malevez 2012).

See the angulation of the preparation, to save the nasal cavity and reaching the frontomaxillary buttress. The preparation is slightly palatinized to maintain a thick buccal bone around implants (Nobel Parallel™, Nobel Biocare, Gotheborg, Sweden).

The impression abutments were splinted with resin, and three cuts were done to divide the structure in four stretches. The verification guide was screwed to prosthetic abutments, and the adjustment was checked by x-rays. After this, the stretches were splinted with hard resin, and a new impression was taken.

The treatment consists in the extraction of all the maxillary teeth and the rehabilitation with a fixed implant prosthesis. (d) After the extraction of the teeth with bad prognosis, the VDO was registered, and a mock-up with barium teeth, which also serves as radiographic guide, was done. (e) The esthetic aspect of the teeth and the occlusion were checked with the mock-up; likewise the loss of hard and soft tissues was evaluated. (f) With the radiographic guide, a new panoramic x-ray and CBCT were done

See that the frontomaxillary implants pass palatally the anterior zygoma implants (Noris Medical, Nesher, Israel)


Fig.15 (continued)

The insertion technique is the same as when a single zygomatic implant is inserted. It is suggested that the anterior implant must be inserted first in order to avoid the infraorbital nerve, and then the posterior implant is placed. The anterior zygomatic implant should emerge at the level of the lateral incisor and the posterior one at the level of the second premolar.

If zygomatic implants achieve enough insertion torque (35-40 Ncm), an immediate loading protocol is recommended, because immediate stabilization of the four implants is achieved by splinting to a rigid prosthesis. The prosthetic protocol follows the aforementioned for all-on-four standard (chapter "Immediate Loading in All-on-Four") and all-on-four hybrid protocols. Figures 14, 15, and 16 show one case rehabilitated with this approach.
