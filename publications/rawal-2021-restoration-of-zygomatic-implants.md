# Introduction

The restoration of the edentulous or soon to be edentulous maxilla with severely deficient residual bone has historically been a complex process. Designing, constructing, and delivering both an interim and a definitive prosthesis can be more challenging than for patients with ample bone and ridge support. With severe bone loss and expansion of the antrums, or in the case of pathologic or traumatic loss of facial structure, the clinician is confronted with the need to rebuild the arch form of the maxilla, from the peak of the vault to the functional occlusal surfaces of the teeth, to the lip and cheek support and the creation of an appropriate prosthetic dentition with ideal smile line, function, and esthetics.

Presurgical prosthetic planning is a major factor in producing a successful outcome $^{1,2}$  and failure to do so leads to suboptimal outcomes, the most common being palatal placement of the head of the zygoma implant. $^{2}$  This leads to poor patient outcomes, including difficulties with speech, function, esthetics, and comfort.

When the head of the zygoma implant is placed solely to engage crestal maxillary bone without consideration of ideal tooth position (Fig. 1A), the resulting position commonly results in a prosthesis that is not ideal on the palatal aspect with poor patient outcomes in terms of resulting satisfaction. However, if ideal tooth position is accounted for and the placement of the head of the zygoma implant is positioned under the proposed teeth (Fig. 1B), the contours of the definitive restoration follow an ideal geometry resulting in positive patient satisfaction.

# Presurgical prosthetic planning

Highly valuable ingredients to successful outcomes begin with a distinct coordination between the surgery and the prosthodontic treatment. The initial evaluation of the patient should include the digital acquisition of facial esthetics, digital impressions, intraoral jaw relationship records, and radiographic analysis using 3-dimensional cone beam computed tomography scanning.

All data including facial scans and intraoral digital impressions are then transferred to CAD/CAM software (Fig. 2), which allows for digital smile design, which is the process of identifying the position of teeth and supporting structures based on esthetics and function in relation to the existing facial and intraoral soft tissue and bone anatomy. $^3$

Once the proposed tooth position is established, data are transferred into implant planning software (Fig. 3), which contains zygoma implants in the virtual library so ideal position of the implants can be planned. A virtual plan of the implant positions can also yield a surgical template to guide the initial penetration of the planned osteotomy and provide the ideal position of the coronal aspect of the implants $^{4}$  (Fig. 4). That same virtual plan can digitally be converted to files that are used to fabricate a fully milled, monolithic polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) conversion denture (Fig. 5).

# Zygoma implant placement and conversion of interim prosthesis

As mentioned elsewhere in this article, at the time of implant placement, a surgical template can be used to determine in initial drill penetration position for the crestal position of the zygoma implants. Once the implants are placed (Fig. 6), transmucosal abutments are installed and prosthodontic intervention occurs with the installation of abutment level temporary prostodontic cylinders (Fig. 7). The conversion denture is adjusted to fit around the temporary cylinders (Fig. 8).

(B) Diagram of the extramaxillary approach placing the head of the zygoma implant in the ideal position with respect to the proposed tooth position and the resulting ideal contours of the prosthesis.


A soft, flowable mix of auto polymerizing acrylic is carefully injected around the temporary prosthetic cylinders (Fig. 9) and the conversion denture seated. The opposing dentition is closed in the acquired centric position to establish optimal orientation of the dentition. When the acrylic has polymerized, the conversion prosthesis is removed from the patient and refined. This process will include the addition of acrylic to fill obtained as needed. Specific oral hygiene instructions are provided for the patient and an additional oral hygiene visit is schedule six to 8 weeks after surgery. At that session, again the conversion prosthesis is maintained in its position while the hygienist preforms standard cleaning procedures.

# Fabrication of the definitive prosthesis

At 12 weeks or later, the patient presents for the initiation of the definitive phase of therapy for the construction of the definitive prosthesis. The first step of the process is to record information from the interim conversion prosthesis including:

Smile analysis
- Lip and cheek support analysis

any voids and the removal of the palate and flanges to establish a cleansable intaglio surface, and the entire conversion prosthesis is highly polished (Fig. 10).

One to 2 weeks after surgery, the patient returns for follow-up care. This visit includes suture removal and any additional occlusal adjustments if indicated, but it is important to remember that the conversion prosthesis should not be removed. Postoperative radiographic records can be made at this visit and a smile analysis and photographic records are also

Occlusal analysis
- Confirmation of tooth and gingival shade
Photographic records
- Intraocclusal bite registration
- Facebook registration

The next step is to make a final impression of the implant positions, which can be done in 2 ways. The first is to use the existing prosthesis following a protocol including:
Fig. 7 Titanium temporary copings placed on zygoma multiunit abutments.

- Removal of the conversion prosthesis
- Reinstallation of the conversion prosthesis with long guide pins after injecting light-body polyvinylsiloxane impression material in the intaglio areas (Fig. 11A)
- An open tray impression technique is used with a heavy body polyvinylsiloxane material in the tray and is fully seated over the conversion prosthesis
- The impression, with the conversion prosthesis embedded, is removed from the mouth (Fig. 11B)
- Abutment analogues are installed in the temporary prosthetic cylinders contained in the conversion prosthesis

If the provisional has appropriate extensions, then the following protocol can also be used:

- Removal of the conversion prosthesis
- Reinstallation of the conversion prosthesis after injecting light body polyvinylsiloxane impression material in the intaglio areas (Fig. 12A)
- The conversion prosthesis is removed from the mouth
- Abutment analogues are installed in the temporary prosthetic cylinders contained in the conversion prosthesis (Fig. 12B)

The second protocol is a conventional material-based full arch impression with splinted, open tray impression copings if it is deemed necessary instead of the conversion prosthesis. This protocol includes:

- Removal of the conversion prosthesis
- Installation of the open tray impression copings and rigid splinting (Fig. 13)
- The open tray impression technique is used with light and heavy body polyvinylsiloxane material
- The impression is removed from the mouth
- Abutment analogues are installed in the open tray impression (Fig. 14)

# Laboratory procedures

At the same appointment, while the patient waits, standard laboratory procedures are followed to construct an accurate master cast, including:
Fig. 8 Milled conversion denture with holes drilled where the titanium copings will be luted.

- A soft gingival moulage is injected around the abutment analogues (Fig. 15)
- Type 4 die stone is mixed and poured
- When set, the master cast is articulated against the opposing using the still mounted conversion prosthesis and the facebow and occlusal registration taken earlier in this visit; this practice ensures an accurate transfer of information from the mouth to the articulator (Fig. 16)
- Once the master cast is accurately articulated, scans are completed with an intraoral scanner to capture the interim conversion prosthesis on the master cast, the opposing, and the occlusion (Fig. 17)
- The conversion prosthesis is then redelivered to the patient.

Assuming all records are accurate, and the tooth position of the conversion prosthesis is acceptable, these records can be imported into CAD/CAM software from which the definitive prosthesis is constructed. The definitive prosthesis can be manufactured with various designs,[7,8] the most common of which are (1) milled acrylic on a CAD/CAM milled or 3-dimensional printed titanium framework (Fig. 18), (2) monolithic Zirconia with or without minimal facial and gingival layering of porcelain (Fig. 19), or (3) a combination prosthesis, consisting of a fully milled framework, individually milled zirconium crowns, and a gingival veneer of ceramic, composite, or milled high-density PMMA (Fig. 20).

# Delivering the definitive prosthesis

The delivery of the definitive prosthesis is a routine procedure composed of the following protocol:

- Removal of the conversion prosthesis
Delivery of the definitive prosthesis
- Check and adjustment of occlusion if necessary
- Check soft tissue contact with the intaglio surface of the prosthesis
- Seal the screw access channels with an easily retrievable silicone-type material
Postdelivery radiographic imaging
Postdelivery photographs
Postdelivery intraoral digital impressions for night guard
- Schedule hygiene re-care visits.

# Potential complications during the restorative process

Of note is that the most important factor in efficient restorative protocols is that all records, including the fit and tooth position of the interim conversion prosthesis, must be appropriate. If the initial intraoral records have erroneous recordings, or the interim conversion prosthesis is inaccurate, there may be a need to do a subsequent milled PMMA provisional to reestablish the correct occlusal relationships. This should only be done after 3 months of healing once

osseointegration has occurred. Other potential complications include:

- Implant failure: if after 3 months, an implant is determined to not be osseointegrated, it should be removed and replaced. If more than 4 implants including the zygoma implants had originally been placed, there may be sufficient remaining implant support to proceed with the construction of the definitive prosthesis.
- If additional implant support is required, then when the implant placement occurs, the new implant should be reconnected to the conversion prosthesis.
- If traditional denture processing methods are used for the construction of the conversion prosthesis, there is a likely chance that the teeth may delaminate and need repair. Such repair should be accomplished intraorally, without the removal of the conversion prosthesis (Fig. 21).
- If the horizontal beam of the conversion prosthesis cracks, the conversion prosthesis will need to be removed to recheck the stability of the abutments and reassemble the pieces of the conversion prosthesis in the mouth. Then reevaluate the occlusion and adjust as warranted.
