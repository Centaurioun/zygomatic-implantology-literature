# ABSTRACT

Objective: To assess if immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation meets the expectations of and satisfies patients with atrophic edentulous maxilla.

Methods: This study included an analysis of data obtained from the dental records of 22 consecutive patients with atrophic edentulous maxillae who received immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation between 2017 and 2020. Patients' expectations and satisfaction scores were recorded on a validated  $100\mathrm{-mm}$  visual analog scale (VAS). Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations.

Results: The results showed a majority of patients had high expectations (VAS > 90) of the rehabilitation with regard to their general satisfaction (71%), aesthetics (71%), chewing (66%), speech (66%), and influence on social life (81%). At 6 months, a majority of the patients showed high general satisfaction (72%), and high satisfaction with aesthetics (77%), chewing (72%), speech (66%), and social life (72%) (VAS > 90). There was a statistically significant increase in the level of satisfaction with chewing from 2 weeks to 6 months after immediate loading (B = 0.309, SE = 0.138, 95% CI: 0.038, 0.580,  $p = 0.025$ ). A statistically significant association was found between pre-treatment expectations and satisfaction with the rehabilitation's impact on speech, aesthetics, and social life. The satisfaction levels were not influenced by age and sex. All participants agreed that they would recommend this procedure to their peers.

Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation could meet the expectations and satisfy edentulous patients with atrophic maxilla.

# 1 | Introduction

Prosthodontic rehabilitation has undergone a transition from conventional complete dentures to implant-supported prostheses as the primary choice of treatment for edentulism (Thomason et al. 2012; Srinivasan et al. 2023). However, for patients with severely atrophic maxilla, the significant reduction in bone volume and density, along with the pneumatization of the maxillary sinus, precludes conventional implant therapy without complex rehabilitation techniques such as sinus augmentation and bone grafts (Spencer 2018). Despite high implant survival rates, these techniques carry high risks of complications and morbidity, including infection, graft rejection, neurosensory problems, and pain (Mckenna et al. 2022). Furthermore, they contribute to the

patient's burden in terms of cost, treatment duration, and number of visits (Tiwana et al. 2006).

Subsequently, zygomatic implant rehabilitation has emerged as a viable treatment alternative for atrophic maxillary rehabilitation, offering advantages over bone graft techniques and addressing their limitations (Ramezanzade et al. 2021). Depending on the available bone in the anterior maxilla, the technique involves the placement of either a combination of zygomatic implants and axial conventional implants or four bilateral zygomatic implants. The rationale behind this technique is that the dense zygomatic bone remains unaffected by morphological or volumetric changes due to complete tooth loss and maxillary atrophy and can provide adequate anchorage for the long zygomatic implants (Lorusso et al. 2021). In addition, the potential for immediate loading with accelerated aesthetics and function and fewer dental visits makes it an attractive treatment modality for patients with unfavorable maxillary ridges (Al-Nawas et al. 2023; Esposito et al. 2018).

Over the past decade, zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation has been subject to several clinical studies that have demonstrated high implant survival rates with infrequent and manageable complications (Ramezanzade et al. 2021; Lorusso et al. 2021). While disease-oriented outcomes play a significant role in evaluating the success of oral rehabilitation, patient-reported outcomes such as the fulfillment of patients' expectations and satisfaction are crucial (Feine et al. 2018; Lang et al. 2012). In fact, the Strength-of-Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) (Ebell et al. 2004) has categorized recommendations based on disease-oriented outcomes as Level C, indicating that improvements in these outcomes may not respond to patients' expectations of treatment and may not satisfy patients.

Patient satisfaction is a multidimensional construct and a real indicator of treatment success (Batbaatar et al. 2017). According to Perneger (2004) and other researchers (Batbaatar et al. 2017; Menassa et al. 2016), patient satisfaction is an inherent cognitive appraisal, shaped by patient attributes, the healthcare provider, and quality of services, the experience of care, and patients' expectations of the treatment. It is the subjective experience and the result of the fulfillment of what is expected from the treatment (Janzen et al. 2006). Expectations are formed by complex cognitive mechanisms and are influenced by several factors including the patient's characteristics, beliefs, and previous experiences with care (El-Haddad et al. 2020). Moreover, the outcome expectations are regarded as predictors of treatment outcomes (Laferton et al. 2022), as they can potentially trigger specific neurophysiological processes that may impact treatment response (Laferton et al. 2022; Mondloch et al. 2001; Enck et al. 2013). Additionally, expectations may motivate patients to adopt favorable health behaviors and coping strategies (Enck et al. 2013). However, unrealistically high expectations can be detrimental, as a mismatch between expectations and treatment outcomes can lead to dissatisfaction (Laferton et al. 2017; Bialosky et al. 2010). This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the rehabilitation from a patient-centered perspective, using an adapted version of Perneger's model for patient satisfaction (Perneger 2004) as a conceptual framework. The study sought to answer the following research question: Does immediately loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation meet the expectations of and satisfy patients with atrophic edentulous maxilla within a 6-month period?


# 2 | Methods

This study involved the analysis of the patients' clinical information obtained from the dental records of 22 consecutive patients who received immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation between 2017 and 2020. The study was conducted in collaboration with East Coast Oral Surgery, Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. Since 2013, this center has a sustained partnership with the Faculty of Dental Medicine & Oral Health Sciences, McGill University, for practice-based research. The Centre's patients' clinical records have been designed to allow retrieval of patients' clinical information within thematic research and validated tools. Moreover, in this Centre, all patients have been asked to sign a consent form to allow their clinical data to be collected before and after surgery and to be analyzed retrospectively. Previous studies have been conducted at McGill University using the practice-based data from this Centre (McGill University Health Centre IRB number: 12-321 GEN).

The inclusion criteria for the study were the patients who received the immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation during the period of 2017 to 2020 and who had signed the consent form allowing access to their data for research purposes. To be eligible for immediate-loaded zygomatic implant placement, patients were required to be above 18 years of age with completely edentulous atrophic maxillae and have no history of acute maxillary sinusitis, zygomatic bone trauma, presence of any disease, mental disorder, condition, or medication that could have compromised healing or osseointegration (pregnancy, Paget's disease, hyperthyroidism, bisphosphonate administration, or severe osteoporosis).

Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board, McGill University (IRB no.: A11_B119_22B). The study adhered to the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and is reported in accordance with the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al. 2008). As this study involved the retrospective analysis of data from patients' records, it was not required to register it in a clinical trial database.

# 2.1 | Clinical Procedures

The clinical procedures followed standard surgery and prosthodontic protocols (Aparicio et al. 2014) and were performed by the same surgeon and the same prosthodontist, both experts in research and clinical practice.

In the pre-operative phase, the rehabilitation procedure, including the surgical technique, sedation, medications, postoperative care, and costs, was explained to all patients verbally using a standard information pamphlet and with models illustrating the type of prosthetic restoration. Patients were encouraged to discuss any concerns related to their treatment. The preoperative radiographic assessments of all patients were performed using a Cone-Beam Computed Tomography scan (iCAT FLX, Henry Schein, Melville, NY, USA). Surgical planning for implant placement was conducted using the DTX Studio software (Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden). The zygomatic implants (Branemark System Zygoma Ti-Unite Implant RP, Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden) were placed, achieving bi-cortical anchorage on the zygomatic bone. If  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of bone or more was present in the anterior maxilla, 2-4 conventional implants were placed in addition to 2 zygomatic implants. Alternatively, if there was less than  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of bone, 4 zygomatic implants were placed. To achieve relative parallelism of the implants, straight or angled Multiunit abutments (Nobel BioCare, AB) were used. Provisional all-acrylic screw-retained prostheses with accessible and cleanable fitting surfaces were fabricated and delivered 3 to  $4\mathrm{h}$  after the surgery.


Postoperatively, all patients were prescribed antibiotics for 7 days (amoxicillin  $500\mathrm{mg}$ , orally, 3 times per day, or in case of allergy, Clindamycin  $300\mathrm{mg}$ , orally, 4 times per day), and analgesics (Tylenol  $500\mathrm{mg}$  and or codeine  $30\mathrm{mg}$ ) as required for 10 days. Oral hygiene instructions included rinsing with  $0.12\%$  chlorhexidine solution 3-4 times a day for the first 7 to 10 days after the procedure and brushing the prostheses with a soft toothbrush. Also recommended was a soft diet for the first  $72\mathrm{h}$ , followed by a semi-solid diet for the next 3 months. Patients were recalled for the removal of sutures 2 weeks after surgery. At this stage, they were instructed to use unwaxed dental floss along with brushing. Patients were then recalled for follow-up at 1 month and 6 months, or whenever they encountered any problems. The final screw-retained prostheses, fabricated with a titanium framework, wrapped with pink acrylic resin and acrylic teeth, were delivered 6 months later.

# 2.2 | Outcome Measures and Data Collection

The outcomes of interest for this study were patients' expectations and satisfaction with immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation. Patients answered questions regarding their expectations before surgery (baseline  $T_0$ ). Satisfaction questions were answered at the follow-up appointments at 2-weeks  $(T_{1})$ , 1 month  $(T_{2})$ , and 6 months  $(T_{3})$  after immediate-loading. The satisfaction questions corresponded to each of the pre-treatment expectation items. Both expectation and satisfaction questions were answered on a  $100\mathrm{-mm}$  visual analog scale (VAS), which was validated through a previous study on immediate-loading (Menassa et al. 2016). The patient's socio-demographic information was also retrieved from the clinical records.


# 2.3 | Statistical Analysis

The post hoc power calculation was performed using the two-tailed MANOVA for repeated measures in the G*Power software. With an effect size of 0.37, an alpha of 0.05, and a correlation of 0.75, the sample size of 22 patients yielded a power of 0.99, indicating a very high likelihood of detecting the observed effect. Descriptive statistics were used to examine patient characteristics, frequency, and distribution of the variables. Patients' expectation and satisfaction scores were categorized into three groups: high (VAS > 90), medium (VAS > 10 and ≤ 90), and low (VAS ≤ 10). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the changes in patient satisfaction scores over time and their association with independent variables, including age, sex, and pre-treatment expectations. The level of significance was set at  $p \leq 0.05$ . The data analysis was performed using SPSS 28.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

# 3 Results

The study sample included 22 patients (10 male and 12 female, mean age  $69.7 \pm 6.9$  years). The 6-month survival rate for all implants was  $100\%$ . At baseline  $(T_0)$ , the patients reported varied expectations regarding the rehabilitation (Figure 1). Seventy-one percent of the patients expected to be highly satisfied with the immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation. Moreover, the patients had high expectations of the positive impact of the treatment on their social life

(81%), their aesthetics (71%), their ability to speak (66%), and their ability to chew (66%). At  $T_{3}$ , 72% of them reported high satisfaction with the immediate-loaded zygomatic implants-supported fixed rehabilitation. In addition, high satisfaction was found among the majority of the patients regarding the rehabilitation's impact on their social life (72%), their aesthetics (77%), their ability to speak (66%), and their chewing abilities (72%) (Figure 2). There was no statistically significant difference in the level of expectation between male and female patients for all the items ( $p > 0.05$ ).

# 3.1 | Patients' Satisfaction With the Immediate-Loading Protocol

The regression model (GEE) based on the continuous VAS showed that overall satisfaction, as well as satisfaction regarding aesthetics, speech, and social life, remained stable during the entire follow-up period from  $T_{1}$  to  $T_{3}$  ( $p > 0.05$ ) (Table 1). There was a significant improvement in satisfaction with chewing from  $T_{1}$  to  $T_{3}$  ( $B = 0.309$ , SE = 0.138, 95% CI: 0.038, 0.580,  $p = 0.025$ ). A statistically significant association was found between pre-treatment expectations and satisfaction with the rehabilitation's impact on speech ( $B = 0.02$ , 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03,  $p < 0.001$ ), aesthetics ( $B = 0.002$ , 95% CI: 0.001, 0.003,  $p = 0.007$ ), chewing ( $B = 0.008$ , 95% CI: 0.005, 0.012,  $p < 0.001$ ) and social life ( $B = 0.007$ , 95% CI: 0.003, 0.01,  $p < 0.001$ ). The satisfaction levels were not influenced by age and sex ( $p > 0.05$ ). There was 100% agreement among patients on recommending this procedure to others.

# 4 | Discussion

To support clinicians' and patients' decision-making, strong evidence from patient-reported outcomes is necessary (Rivera et al. 2019; Bingham et al. 2017). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated patients' expectations with immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation. Using a theoretical framework by Perneger (2004) allowed a comprehensive understanding of patients' expectations and the multifaceted nature of patient satisfaction with this treatment.

Our findings indicate that immediate loading of zygomatic implant fixed rehabilitation meets patients' expectations and doesn't dissatisfy them in terms of oral function, aesthetics, and social life, with improvement in chewing ability during the healing period. These findings are consistent with prior research on the immediate loading protocol with removable and fixed implant-supported rehabilitation (Menassa et al. 2016; Komagamine et al. 2022; Peñarrocha-Oltra et al. 2014), suggesting that immediate loading can mitigate the functional and aesthetic challenges associated with conventional loading (Sanz-Sánchez et al. 2015; Morton et al. 2023).

Our study revealed high expectations regarding the immediate loading of zygomatic implant fixed rehabilitation in the majority of patients. While no other studies assessed patient expectations of this procedure, studies on conventional dental implant rehabilitation (Menassa et al. 2016; Colvin et al. 2019; da Cunha et al. 2015; de Lima et al. 2012) have yielded comparable findings. Our study also showed high patient satisfaction with the rehabilitation, which was significantly associated with the pre-treatment expectations of the rehabilitation's impact on oral functions, aesthetics, and social life. There is strong evidence in the medical literature suggesting that patients' expectations are associated with treatment outcomes (Laferton et al. 2022; Bingel 2020; Wen et al. 2022; Frisaldi et al. 2023). In clinical trials, treatment expectations are considered a central mechanism of the placebo and nocebo effect, wherein inert interventions can induce subjective and physiological changes (Laferton et al. 2022; Basedow et al. 2023). However, unrealistically high expectations could potentially lead to dissatisfaction and poorer outcomes (Laferton et al. 2022). These high expectations regarding treatments may arise from unreliable information, marketing tactics, the novelty, and high costs of the treatment (Yao et al. 2014). Understanding patient expectations can enable the clinician to have open communication with patients and help bridge the gap between patients' and clinicians' perceptions of treatment (El-Haddad et al. 2020). Therefore, it is recommended that every clinical encounter begins with an assessment of the patient's expectations (Main et al. 2010).

Our results are comparable to the previous studies on immediate-loaded zygomatic implant rehabilitation, thus supporting the

evidence that this treatment modality can highly satisfy completely edentulous individuals (Sartori et al. 2012; Mozzati et al. 2015). However, these studies did not investigate how patients' characteristics might affect their satisfaction, a factor that, according to Perneger's model, could influence patient-reported outcomes. In our study, we observed no sex difference in the satisfaction levels, and patients' age didn't influence the outcome. While no similar studies related to immediate loading were found for direct comparison, Erkapers et al. reported no differences in Oral Health-Related Quality of Life among patients above and below 60 years of age, and no differences between male and female patients with edentulous atrophic maxilla who received rehabilitation with immediately loaded six maxillary implants (Erkapers et al. 2017). However, with dental implant-supported fixed and removable prosthodontic rehabilitation, there are conflicting findings on the influence of age and sex on patients' satisfaction (Colvin et al. 2019; Pradyachaipimol et al. 2023; Adler et al. 2016; Derks et al. 2015). Some studies suggest higher satisfaction among male patients compared to female patients and a more positive perception of the treatment among older patients (Derks et al. 2015), while others found no significant differences between the sexes or the impact of age on satisfaction (Colvin et al. 2019).

Our study included patients who received either two zygomatic implants combined with conventional anterior implants, or four zygomatic implants, depending on the available bone in the anterior maxilla. Regardless of the implant configuration, rehabilitation for all patients followed a prosthetically driven approach, involving close collaboration between the surgeon and prosthodontist. Careful attention was given to ensure crestal emergence of the implants and proper buccopalatal positioning of the prosthesis in all patients for optimal speech, function, and esthetics. The use of the four zygomatic implants has been recommended for patients with inadequate anterior maxillary bone for conventional implant placement, with studies reporting high patient satisfaction, high implant survival rates, and few complications with this technique (Al-Nawas et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2015).

The present study was a single-arm retrospective study conducted in a practice-based setting. This study design is particularly beneficial when evaluating complex interventions with a restricted pool of patients or when randomized controlled trials are not always practical or ethical, mainly due to strict eligibility requirements, patients' reluctance to be randomized, or their preferences regarding specific interventions (Liu et al. 2023; Evans 2010). Furthermore, pragmatic studies in clinic-based settings provide real-world information that better reflects real-life clinical practice, thereby enhancing external validity. In our study, we implemented a 6-month follow-up period, which is deemed adequate for assessing the effect of immediate loading (Chen et al. 2019). Longer durations could potentially introduce recall bias (Menassa et al. 2016), so it was important to evaluate the immediate loading protocol shortly after surgery to capture its effect on satisfaction accurately.


However, there are some limitations to our study. First, the pragmatic nature of the study with the lack of a control group subjects the study to potential bias with threats to internal validity. Second, the generalisability of the findings may be limited as consecutive patients included in our study may not fully represent the broader population due to possible differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics. Third, the study was conducted in a single practice. The clinical setting in this practice follows stringent operating procedures and protocols and is run by a team of clinicians highly experienced in zygomatic implant surgeries and prosthetic rehabilitation. These factors may not reflect the conditions or levels of expertise available in other clinical environments. Our theoretical model and other research suggest that the clinician's technical expertise (Fecso et al. 2017) and quality of care can impact patient outcomes (Hamilton et al. 2013; Lilly et al. 2023). Finally, while our study focused on patient-reported outcomes with immediate-loading within 6 months, clinical decision-making also requires evidence on overall treatment effectiveness. Considering the nature of the rehabilitation and its potential complications, such as sinusitis, peri-implant mucositis, and neurological complications (Al-Nawas et al. 2023), long-term clinical and disease-oriented information is necessary to complement positive patient satisfaction to ensure the overall rehabilitation success.

# 5 | Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that immediate-loaded zygomatic implant-supported fixed rehabilitation could meet the expectations and satisfy edentulous patients with atrophic maxilla within a 6-month period. However, given that the study was conducted in a single practice and in the absence of a control group, the results need to be confirmed by larger multi-centre pragmatic clinical trials.
