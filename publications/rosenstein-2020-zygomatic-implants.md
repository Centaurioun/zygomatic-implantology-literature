# INTRODUCTION

In recent decades, endosseous dental implants have become an increasingly popular solution to the problem of replacing lost or missing teeth. Because of the near-constant strides in research relating to dental implants, advances in effectiveness, efficiency, and cost have made dental implants a viable option for a large percentage of the population. However, limitations still exist. Sufficient bony height and width are still required for successful placement and retention of functional dental implants. In some patients, this can present a challenging scenario for the oral surgeon and restorative dentist, both in the placement and in the restoration of the dental implants.

Osseointegration of implants in even a healthy and robust maxilla has been shown to have lower success rates when compared with the mandible. This is especially true for implants placed in the posterior maxilla. $^{1}$  In patients with a severely atrophic maxilla, successful dental implant placement is especially difficult. Various solutions have been proposed for restoring the maxillary dentition in a patient with an atrophic maxilla. Options such as onlay bone grafting with autogenous iliac crest bone, sinus lift procedures, ridge split procedures, and even LeFort I surgical downfracture with interpositional bone grafting have been utilized. However, the zygomatic implant may present a far simpler approach to restoring the atrophic maxilla. $^{2}$

# OVERVIEW OF MAXILLARY BONE QUALITY

As referenced previously, the quality and quantity of maxillary bone are often less than that of the mandible. This is mainly because of the type of bone present in the posterior maxilla. Lekholm and Zarb (1985) described 4 main bone types in the maxilla and mandible:

1. Type 1: bone comprised mostly (if not all) of homogenous cortical bone
2. Type 2: bone that contains a core of densely packed cancellous bone, surrounded by at least  $2\mathrm{mm}$  of cortical bone
3. Type 3: bone that contains a core of densely packed cancellous bone, but surrounded by only a thin layer of cortical bone.
4. Type 4: bone comprised of mostly nondense cancellous bone, surrounded by only a thin layer of cortical bone

The higher the overall bone density, the greater the success rate of osseointegration. This is likely because of higher levels of bone-to-implant contact and stabilization, which occurs readily in dense cortical bone as compared with the more loosely organized cancellous bone. Generally, healthy maxillae have been shown to have type 3 bone in the anterior and type 4 in the posterior. In resorbed maxillae, the bone density is often even further diminished. $^{3}$  This diminishment in the quality and quantity of maxillary bone is only exacerbated the longer a patient remains edentulous. It has been documented that the maxilla resorbs, on average,  $2\mathrm{mm}$  within the first year after tooth extraction, and then at a rate of  $0.5\mathrm{mm/y}$ , compared with  $0.2\mathrm{mm/y}$  in the mandible. $^{4}$

# TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE ATROPHIC MAXILLA

In order to solve the problem of low quality and quantity of maxillary bone for placing implants, various treatments have been proposed. For many years, the gold standard of treatment was considered to be bone grafting procedures. This included techniques such as crestal onlay grafts, sinus lifts, and, as mentioned previously, Lefort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafting. It is beyond the scope of this article to go into these techniques in detail, other than to mention that bone grafting procedures are not always a viable or desirable option for many patients. For patients who have undergone maxillary resection and/or radiation therapy for cancer treatment, bone grafting may not be a viable option, because of compromised vasculature. The same can be said for patients with certain metabolic disorders, congenital deformities, or those in an immunocompromised state. Even in a healthy edentulous patient, factors such as graft donor site morbidity, increased healing time, longer surgical time, and increased chance of infection can all be factors that would deter an individual from wanting to undergo extensive grafting procedures. It has also been reported that there is a lower implant survival rate for areas in the maxilla that have been grafted, compared with native bone.[2] Because of this, a nongrafting option to restore the resected or atrophic maxilla could be of great value to surgeons and patients.

# ZYGOMATIC IMPLANTS

As early as 1988, the Branemark System described a standard surgical technique for intrasinus placement of zygomatic implants.5 Many have documented the placement of these implants for use as supports for an obturator or other larger maxillofacial prostheses for patients who have undergone maxillectomies.6 Since then, Branemark and others have described various surgical techniques and approaches for placement of zygomatic implants that could be used to restore a patient's dentition. To this end, there have been 2 main treatment designs utilized. $^{7}$


First, for patients with sufficient anterior maxillary bone for traditional implant placement, 1 zygomatic implant should be placed on each side of the posterior maxilla. Two or more traditional endosteal implants should be placed in the anterior maxilla. For patients without sufficient anterior maxillary bone, 2 or more zygomatic implants should be placed on each side of the posterior maxilla.

Both of these designs have been shown to have high rates of success when used to support a fixed dental prosthesis or overdenture. The success of zygomatic implants as supports for full arch restorations has been documented by some to be at  $100\%$ . Other studies have shown some failures, but most authors agree that zygomatic implants are successful well over  $95\%$  of the time.

It should be noted that the success of zygomatic implants is likely not due to the bone quality of the zygoma, itself. On the contrary, the zygoma is comprised mainly of loose cancellous bone that is not favorable for implant success. The stability of zygomatic implants is thought, instead, to stem from the fact that the implant usually passes through 3 to 4 cortical layers of bone, compared with the single cortical layer that most traditional implants would pass through.[10] This will be explained.

# INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS

The obvious indications for zygomatic implants, as mentioned previously, include those patients with a severely resorbed posterior maxilla who require an implant-supported prosthesis. These patients may include those with systemic diseases that cause resorption of the maxilla, patients who had undergone maxillary resection or radiation therapy, immunocompromised patients, or those with congenital deformities such as severe cleft palate. More routine indications could include patients for whom bone grafting would not be desirable because of possible donor site morbidity, increased pain, longer surgical time, or even cultural/religious aversion to foreign bone material.

Contraindications and relative contraindications for zygomatic implants would be similar to those for normal dental implant placement, such as tobacco smoking addiction, head and neck radiotherapy, and bisphosphonate therapy. Additionally, some have stated that because zygomatic implants often pass through the maxillary sinus, their placement may increase the risk of chronic maxillary sinusitis if a patient contracts an upper respiratory tract infection that closes off the sinus ostium. For patients prone to these infections, zygomatic implants may be contraindicated.[11]

Although not a contraindication, it is worthwhile to state a possible drawback to zygomatic implants. Because of their angulation, the head of zygomatic implants will often emerge more pallatally than traditional dental implants. This may make the dental prosthesis excessively bulky in this area, which can cause discomfort to selected patient. The extreme angulation of the zygomatic implant necessitates the use of angled abutments, which come in standard  $25^{\circ}$ ,  $35^{\circ}$ ,  $45^{\circ}$ , and  $55^{\circ}$  angulations.

# TECHNIQUE FOR PLACEMENT OF ZYGOMATIC IMPLANTS

Various surgical approaches for zygomatic implant placement have been described and shown to be successful. The most common and basic approach, known as the intrasinus approach, will first be explained. Other approaches will then be described as variations or modifications on the intrasinus approach.

# Surgical Incision and Flap

A crestal incision is made on the palatal aspect of the maxillary crest from the area of the first molar to opposing first molar. A flap is then elevated to expose the lateral surface of the maxilla until the zygomatic process is revealed, similar to the flap used in a LeFort 1 osteotomy. The infraorbital neurovascular bundle should also be visualized. At this point, because of the placement of the incision, both the buccal and palatal aspect of the alveolar crest should be fully exposed

# Lateral Window

A window should be made into the lateral aspect of the maxillary sinus, bilaterally, close to the inferior border of the zygomatic crest. This can be performed with a rotary handpiece and round bur, Piezo, or any such instrument that would normally be used for the osteotomy of a lateral window approach for a maxillary sinus lift. The dimensions of the window should be such that it will facilitate easy visualization of the implant drill and zygomatic implant itself (Fig. 1). The suggested size is approximately  $10 \times 5 \mathrm{~mm}$ .

# Elevation of Schneiderian Membrane

Similar to the technique used for a lateral window sinus lift, the sinus membrane should be carefully elevated off of the inferior, lateral, and superior walls of the sinus. This is to prevent perforation of the membrane by the implant drill or implant itself. Although this is not necessary for the success of the zygomatic implant, it is ideal, as some have theorized it may decrease the chance of an oroantral communication and future sinus disease. Many current authors, however, are not concerned with this as a significant risk.

# Implant Osteotomy

Based on the presurgical and prosthodontic planning, the zygomatic implant drill should be used to start the osteotomy on the alveolar crest at the point from which the head of the implant will emerge. The osteotomy should be continued in a superior-lateral-posterior direction, through the alveolar crest, into the sinus cavity, and eventually end within the superior cortical layer of the zygoma itself. It is important to use a specialized drill guard during osteotomy formation in order to prevent contact between the shaft of the drill and surrounding soft tissue (Fig. 2). Just as with traditional endosteal implants, the zygomatic drill burs are used under irrigation and in ascending orders of width until the appropriate size is reached. At this point, a depth indicator is used to confirm appropriate implant length (see Fig. 1). These implants are usually between  $35\mathrm{mm}$  and  $55\mathrm{mm}$  in length.
Fig. 1. The dimensions of the window should be such that it will facilitate easy visualization of the implant drill and zygomatic implant.


# Implant Placement

Once the osteotomies have been completed and the appropriate length and angulation of the implant has been finalized, the zygomatic implant can be placed. It should be placed on the rotary handpiece at low speed, being guided along the same route taken with the implant drills. It should be advanced until the apex reaches the superior cortex of the zygoma, and then further rotated until the angled implant head is at the desired position at the maxillary alveolar crest (Fig. 3). At this point the cover screw can be placed, and the surgical flap re-approximated and closed with sutures.

# Variations on the Intrasinus Approach

A common variation to the intrasinus approach, known as the sinus slot procedure, has been described by Stella and Warner. $^{12}$  In this technique, a slot is drilled into the side of the malar bone, extending from  $5\mathrm{mm}$  superior to crest of the alveolar ridge to the superior extent of the contour of the zygomatic buttress. The implant drills, and the path of the implant will follow the line of this slot. This allows the zygomatic implant to pass directly through the lateral wall of the maxillary bone on its way to the zygomatic bone. This bypasses the need for a lateral window, decreases the chances of sinus membrane perforation, and also allows for the head of the implant to emerge at the height of the alveolar crest, rather than the palatal aspect.

Some patients may present with a deep buccal concavity of the lateral surface of the maxilla. Such a concavity may make it impossible to extend the zygomatic implant through the sinus or maxillary bone and into the zygoma, while still having the emergence of the implant head at an appropriate location on the alveolar ridge. In order to accommodate this anatomy, the extrasinus approach was developed. In this technique, the implant will pass from the alveolar ridge, then out through the lateral surface of the maxilla, where it would otherwise have entered the sinus cavity, before re-entering the maxilla at the zygomatic buttress, and then eventually entering the zygoma, itself.[13]

A more recent method, known as the extramaxillary technique, was developed to simplify the surgical technique and to facilitate a more prosthodontically appropriate emergence of the implant head. Similar to the extrasinus approach, the extramaxillary approach does not have the path of implant insertion enter into the sinus. However, in the extramaxillary approach, the implant will only contact the maxilla at the height of alveolar ridge before traveling lateral-superior-posterior and then anchoring the implant apex within the zygoma. In this approach, it is said that the alveolar ridge only accommodates the implant, meaning that it will pass through a channel made just at the lateral surface of the alveolus, in order to allow for ideal prosthodontic placement at the height of the crest, but that no actual anchorage or osseointegration occurs at this location(Fig. 4). All of the support for the implant comes from the osseointegration occurring within the zygoma itself.[14]
Fig. 3. The zygomatic implant should be advanced until the apex reaches the superior cortex of the zygoma, and then further rotated until the angled implant head is at the desired position at the maxillary alveolar crest.

Note extramaxillary implant placed posteriorly in inferior edge of zygoma,  $3\mathrm{mm}$  from posterior vertical edge of zygomatic bone. Extramaxillary implant used exclusively zygomatic anchorage. Maxillary crest only accommodates implant, meaning that implant osseointegration only occurs in zygomatic bone. Note infraorbital foramen indicated by arrow. (From Malo P, Nobre MDA, Lopes I. A new approach to rehabilitate the severely atrophic maxilla using extramaxillary anchored implants in immediate function: a pilot study. J Prosthet Dent. 2008;100(5):357; with permission.)

Although not a separate technique, it is of note that the advent of computer-guided virtual surgical planning has provided the surgeon with novel ways to improve upon the aforementioned techniques. Using a computed tomography scan of a patient's facial bones, a surgical guide can be fabricated that will be able to accurately predetermine the appropriate length and width of the implant and direct the implant drills and placement of the implant along the preplanned path of insertion. This can obviate the necessity for such a large lateral window in the intrasinus technique, other than for intraoperative verification of implant placement.

# COMPLICATIONS

As with any surgical procedure, there are risks and complications involved with the placement of zygomatic implants. Most of the complications associated with zygomatic implants are no different than those associated with standard dental implant placement, such as bleeding, swelling, infection, and failure of osseointegration. Other complications thought to be more strongly associated with zygomatic implants could include sinusitis, oroantral fistula formation, periorbital and conjunctival hematoma or edema, facial pain and edema, and epistaxis. Some of the more serious complications could even include paresthesia of the infraorbital nerve, caused by possible proximity of path of zygomatic implant insertion, orbital floor perforation, and perforation into the infratemporal fossa. In a cadaver study performed by Yuki Uchida and colleagues in 2001, it was shown that deviation from a fairly narrow range could cause severe damage to sensitive anatomic structures. If a line were drawn the point of ideal emergence of the zygomatic head in the alveolar bone to the point at which the temporal and frontal processes of the zygomatic bone meet (ie: jugale), it was shown that directing the implant at an angulation of  $43.8^{\circ}$  or less above this line could cause perforation of the infratemporal fossa, while directing the implant at an angulation of  $50.6^{\circ}$  or more above this line could cause perforation of the orbital floor.

# SUMMARY

Studies of zygomatic implants placed in patients with severely atrophic or resected maxillae have shown that zygomatic implants constitute a successful and predictable method for supporting fixed or removable prostheses, and can be used to restore the maxillary dentition. These implants demonstrate high survival rates of  $98.4\%$  over the course of at least 12 years and lack significant risk factors.[16] Given the relative simplicity of zygomatic implant placement compared with the drawn out process of significant bone grafting to restore the severely atrophic or resected maxilla, zygomatic implants continue to be an ideal, stable, and viable option for many patients who would have difficulty or be unable to undergo more traumatic treatment.
