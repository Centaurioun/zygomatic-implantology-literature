# Impact of tooth loss on the quality of life of elderly people

Introduction: There is scientific evidence that shows health contributes to the quality of life. These measurements have not been well guided towards the free response of oral health in people's lives.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the impact of tooth loss on the quality of life of elderly people. Material and methods: Qualitative investigation with descriptive features - which used a random sample out of the total edentulous elderly people, who lived in an institution in Fortaleza, Brazil - was carried out. From 250 residents screened, 72 completely edentulous elderly, with ages from 60 to 79 years were selected. A semi-structured questionnaire was used with closed and opened questions in which the last one was used for the free flow of the interviewee's responses. The content was analysed and codified according to Bardin.

Results: In total,  $84.7\%$  had attended the dentist to have exodontia. Of them,  $81.9\%$  reported difficulties after losing their teeth. Physical dimensions, characterised by the difficulties in eating and social dimensions, because of interference in communication with other people were obtained.

Conclusion: Tooth loss causes disorder in the individual's quality of life, mainly when it affects their well-being and appearance.

Keywords: oral health, tooth loss, elderly, quality of life.

# Introduction

According to Buss<sup>1</sup>, there is a great deal of scientific evidence that shows the contribution of health to the quality of life of people.

There are oral diseases in all population groups, which are strongly related to age, and as people get older they increase in prevalence and severity. The goals established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) concerned with dental caries have been used in different countries to find ways to minimise the social consequence of oral diseases<sup>2</sup>.

In dentistry, there is also extensive research and measurements to evaluate the quality of life: development and evaluation of oral health impact profile $^{3}$ , oral health quality $^{4}$ , impact of dental conditions on patients' quality of life $^{5}$ , evaluation of subjective oral health status indicators $^{6}$ , assessing oral health-related quality of life: findings from the normative ageing study $^{7}$ , the development of measures of dental impacts on daily living $^{8}$ , development of the geriatric oral health assessment index<sup>9</sup>, components of self-reported oral health and general health in racial and ethnic groups<sup>10</sup> among others. However, those measurements have not been well guided towards free responses and evaluation of the oral health condition as well as its repercussions on people's lives.


The population survey<sup>11</sup> shows that the oral diseases, mainly dental caries and periodontal diseases, are still major public health problems. These two conditions cause major problems that affect the quality of life, as dental caries and periodontal disease may lead the individuals to tooth loss.

Brazil reached the desired goals from the WHO in oral health by the year of 2000, but only up to the age of 12 years<sup>11</sup>. In all other ages, oral health conditions are below these goals, mainly because of edentulism, and they are getting worse as people get older. It is expected that decreasing caries in children will have positive effects in the medium and long term as well as the conditions of the health of adult, even though it is not possible to state that it is going to happen<sup>12</sup>.

Investigation into the conditions that provide good quality of life for people as well as the variations of the age is of great social and scientific importance, besides providing and generating alternatives towards interventions which are aimed at the well-being of the elderly $^{13}$ .

Quality of life is defined by the WHO as 'individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns $^{14}$ . Thus, several factors have the potential to influence the quality of life of a person, including oral health.

Good oral health should include the absence of facial pain, ability to chew properly, ease of ingestion and digestion of food. This should also contribute to communication, especially when speaking and smiling, which have the potential to increase the self-esteem of people<sup>15</sup>.

Quality of life means maintaining the possibilities that people have been enjoying through their life<sup>16</sup>. To Sheiham<sup>17</sup>, oral health problems probably have many more similarities related to an individual's quality of life and in personal well-being than the ability of the person to perform daily activities.

Starfield<sup>18</sup> states that the health of an individual or population is determined by their genetic combination and it is largely modified by the physical and social environment and their behaviour which is culturally and socially determined by the attention that was given to health.

Nowadays, in Brazil, only  $10\%$  of people from 65 to 74 years of age have 20 or more teeth<sup>11</sup>. However, the Ministry of Health has launched a programme 'Brasil Sorridente', and expectations have been raised to achieve an improvement in the Brazilian population's oral health conditions that might be effective in minimising the damage caused by poor dental conservation among most of the Brazilian elderly people.

Epidemiological studies about health from the last 20 years show that the improvement related to oral health has been considered slow for most Brazilian adults and elderly people. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of tooth loss on people's quality of life within this context on a group of elderly people, taking into account some individual perspectives, as well as evaluating the importance that was given to the dental elements.

# Methodology

The study was based on a qualitative investigation with descriptive and exploratory aspects, which involved a sample of edentulous people through the study of convenience. The residents who participated were from an institution that takes care of elderly people located in the county of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Two hundred and fifty residents were screened; 72 completely edentulous elderly people were selected by age, which varied between 60 and 79 years old and they belonged to the socio-economic class with low income. Most of them were retired and received the minimal wage and others depended on philanthropic support. The variants of the study were obtained from the primary data through the interviews, when they were used as a research tool. A semi-structured questionnaire without nominal identification of closed and opened questions was used, with the last one being to allow for the free flow of the interviewee's responses. The criteria of inclusion were individuals aged 60 years old or more, edentulous and who were able to answer the questions. Two conductive questions were asked: 1) what is the major problem caused by the loss of the teeth, based on your own experience? 2) how do you feel without your teeth? Interviews lasting  $1 - 2\mathrm{h}$  each were conducted during routine clinical activities and were enriched with participant observation.


In this study, the qualitative analysis of the content is to highlight the important data of the interviewee's responses and to co-operate with the understanding of the attitudes, competence and social relations within dentistry. According to Minayo $^{19}$  (p.17) 'nothing could be intellectually considered a problem whether this would not be firstly a problem from the daily life'. The author considered that the phenomenon or social process had to be understood within their determinations and transformations, which were given by the individuals.

The data interpretation was carried out by the interviews towards a descriptive analysis of the interviewees' responses that was interpreted by the content. A researcher recorded the patient's responses as brief handwritten notes on a prepared form, expanded into descriptive text immediately afterwards. After repeated readings, its content was analysed and codified according to Bardin $^{20}$ . The responses were interpreted against a theoretical backdrop on ageing, medical and community dentistry.

The interviews were made under free agreement and explanation. All the interviewees were initially informed about the research objective and the importance of their reports to have a deeper knowledge about people's feelings, their difficulties and anxieties relating to the loss of their teeth and the repercussion on their quality of life. The research protocol was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research from the University of Fortaleza in May of 2003.


# Results and discussion

Within the 72 participants, 50  $(69.4\%)$  were women and 22  $(30.6\%)$  were men. More than half  $(54.2\%)$  had not graduated from elementary school and only seven  $(9.7\%)$  of them had graduated from elementary school. With regard to marital status, 24  $(33.3\%)$  were widowed, 17  $(23.6\%)$  were married, 17  $(23.6\%)$  were single and 14  $(19.5\%)$  were separated or divorced. With regard to their origin, 41  $(56.9\%)$  elder people came from the cities and 31  $(49.1\%)$  migrated from rural communities. All the participants were edentulous; only 38  $(52.8\%)$  used a dental prosthesis and the remainder had no prostheses.

From the 72 elderly people who were interviewed, only 11  $(15.3\%)$  stated that they had gone regularly to the dentist. Most of them  $(84.7\%)$  had gone to the dentist to have extractions. Throughout the reports relating to the answers which were given to the question 'what is the major problem caused by the lack of teeth, based on your own experience?' it was possible to group the participants into two dimensions: one with a negative impact and another with a positive one.

In the first situation, more than two-thirds of the interviewees 59  $(81.9\%)$  reported difficulties after losing their teeth. Most of them reported that they were more concerned with the physical level than the social level.

... Lord takes out the teeth, but he widens the throat... We ourselves eat like animals...

The ultimate dehumanisation of human beings is atrocities of war which animalises the body of the enemy[21]. In oral health, edentulism may lead to dehumanisation of the patient who is deprived of food for their needs, as the interviewees reported:

... Everything seems to be as a whole... To eat carefully... We have to tear the meat with the hands, otherwise we have to eat everything well-cooked...

For these researchers $^{22-27}$ , tooth loss is the result of a complex interaction of dental diseases, lack of preventive measures, poverty, faulty nutrition and hunger, access barriers, inadequate treatment and much more. Within this context, the interviewees' response was:

.... Unfortunately we can't eat all sort of food... It is very sad, when a person can't eat... I can't eat hard brown sugar made of sugar cane... I can't suck sugar cane either... nor chewing naturally... We wish we could bite, but we can't...


Researchers showed that depression associated with both lower quality of diet and lower self-assessment scores included decreased appetite[28], as reported in an individual's response:

... The digestion of food... The food is not chewed enough... everything becomes heavy... and disturbs our sleepiness...

Researchers showed in the distribution of responses to the OHIP-14 items that  $37.3\%$  of the patients have painful mouths and  $32.3\%$  feel uncomfortable eating any kind of food[29].

# Tooth loss and communication limitation

The social representation was marked by the most remarkable comments from the interviewees.

...The speech gets blurred; the pronunciation of the words is different... I get embarrassed when I have to talk to someone... That is, when a person is toothless; he puts the hand over the mouth in order to cover it...

... After taking out my teeth, I couldn't meet my boyfriend anymore... I was ashamed of him... I started crying... There are so many gap-toothed people... The fact is that I am one of them...

...There are so many... The toothless people don't worth anything... The face gets ugly... It gets older... The mouth gets thinner... Toothless means to be ugly, horrible...

...It is very good to have your own teeth... I miss them a lot... I feel well with my denture... With my denture I feel complete...

In these responses, the denture represents the importance of the teeth which were lost.

Foods such as nuts, apples and raw carrots cannot be eaten easily by over half the edentulous. Daily intake of non-starch polysaccharides, protein, calcium, non-haem iron, niacin, vitamin C, intrinsic and the milk sugar was significantly lower in this group. Plasma ascorbate and retinol were significantly lower in the edentulous than dentate patients, affecting intakes of nutritional status[30].

With regard to the dimension of the positive impact, 13 elderly people  $(18\%)$  answered that they felt relieved after tooth extraction. From this dimension, emerged the category below.

# Pain relief because of tooth loss

... It was a relief... It was the best thing, have no toothache anymore... When I used to have my teeth, I had so much headache... I couldn't sleep well... I have swollen face... I used to have all kind of herbs to relieve the pain...To take out the teeth was the best thing I did, because I don't suffer with toothache anymore... The toothache is strong ...


In the research of Fleck et al.13, the importance of eating well and having an appetite were considered relevant to the evaluation of elderly people's quality of life. In this context, the need for dentures also remains associated with the influence of oral health in establishing relationships31.

Nowadays, it is understood that collective health represents the direction to improve the quality of life and the population's health as a priority of the Agenda  $21^{32}$ . It is urgent and necessary to discuss the problem related to health in the social, collective and public field to incorporate effectively the complex 'promotion-health-disease-care' under a new pragmatic perspective through public health policies with effective society participation<sup>33</sup>. According to Esan et al.<sup>34</sup>, edentulism is attributed to low educational level as well as the patient's social and economical status.

Research about the perception of the conditions of elderly people's oral health concluded that agreements between the needs that are defined clinically and subjectively are not so huge. The objectivity offered by elderly patients is useful as complementary evaluation for clinical information to identify those who need educational, preventive and curative actions $^{35,36}$ .

The information offered by the second conducive question 'how do you feel without your teeth?' is somewhat similar to the first one 'what is the major problem caused by the teeth loss, based on your own experience?'

# Personal experience regarding tooth loss

I'm getting used to it... God will help me... I'm adapting myself... It is difficult to chew... I can't eat well...The denture has to be used... Gosh, it is very bad...To swallow like an animal... There is a lack... It is like a punishment... I never get used to... It is somewhat strange... I miss them... tasteless... Well, because of the pain relief... I don't suffer anymore... I don't have bad breath anymore...

The analysis of the situations presented by elderly people in relation to 'how do you feel without your teeth?' is agreed by Dolan<sup>37</sup> when the author defines oral health as the absence of pain and infection as a result of a functional and comfortable dentition which could be natural or prosthetic that let the individual play his social role. Pinto<sup>38</sup> says that the fundamental problems such as edentulism have strong social and economical roots and could only be well understood and explained when the edentulous are heard and when self-diagnosis and opinions from these people are respected. In this context, Saintrain and Lopes<sup>39</sup> point out the importance of identifying the fragmentations of the current oral health system as well as finding operational ways to contribute to the improvement of the population's oral health.


# Conclusion

Tooth loss causes disorder in the quality of life of the individual, especially when it affects their wellbeing, appearance and nutritional status. The elderly people in this research contributed significantly through their reports for the strengthening of new ways of observing dentistry, which is essential to the improvement of the health professional considering people's belief and knowledge, as well as their perception of values.
