# Abstract

Background This work evaluated the accuracy and safety of a protocol for minimally-invasive flapless zygomatic implant placement that uses computer-guided stereolithographic mucosa-supported surgical templates.

Methods A total of six zygomatic implants were placed in three formalin-fixed human cadaver heads, with edentulous and severely atrophic posterior maxillae. CT scans of each cadaver head were performed after zygomatic implant placement, to evaluate the lateral error (LE) at implant tip and base, and the angular error (AE) of the implant body.

Results Excluding the implant placed outside the drilling channel, the LE at the implant base was less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$  in all cases. The average LE at the tip was  $3.86\mathrm{mm}$ , and the AE was less than  $6^{\circ}$  in all cases, with an average of  $4.5^{\circ}$ .

Conclusion Computer-guided minimally-invasive flapless zygomatic implant surgery remains challenging. Careful planning and perfect stability of the surgical guide are essential. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

# Introduction

Implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation of severely resorbed maxilla poses a clinical challenge; it usually requires extensive bone augmentation, entailing autogenous iliac bone graft harvesting and extensive maxillary sinus augmentation techniques (1,2). These procedures are well documented and widely successful, but involve relatively major surgery, which must often be completed under general anaesthesia; they carry additional morbidity, also associated with the distant donor site. Treatment is lengthy, considering the postoperative healing period of 4-6 months, a second surgical procedure for implant placement, and delayed loading after an additional healing period (3). Patients may not use the existing denture during the graft healing period, and require temporary solutions for a considerable time. The procedure is expensive, and also includes the costs entailed in hospitalization.

Accepted: 23 December 2014

In recent years, zygomatic implants, in conjunction with the placement of 3-4 conventional implants in the premaxilla, have emerged as a viable graftless solution for prosthetics, and for the functional rehabilitation of highly resorbed posterior maxillae (4,5). This approach markedly reduces treatment time and morbidity, and brings very good success rates and long-term results (6). However, zygomatic implant placement is not a routine procedure in most dental practices, and requires very experienced surgeons (7). Compared with regular implants, zygomatic implants require the appropriate implant length to be determined, and anatomical conditions with extreme angulations and difficulties must be tackled during drill guidance.

More recently, computer aided techniques based on 3D treatment planning, in which both planning and surgical guidance are based on computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), have been implemented (8). Many clinical reports confirm the accuracy and utility of guided techniques for flapless surgery, and also the validity of immediate loading protocols (9,10). In a theoretical extension of this approach, the use of computer guidance might also be expected to facilitate flapless placement of zygomatic implants.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and safety of a minimally-invasive flapless computer-guided protocol that uses stereolithographic and premaxillary implant supported surgical templates with long intrasinus guiding tubes.

# Material and methods

Three formalin-fixed human cadaver heads with edentulous and severely atrophic maxillae were obtained from the Department of Anatomy, University of Innsbruck, through official channels. As is required by National law, these persons had donated their bodies for academic education and scientific use, by testamentary disposition.

# CT imaging

The cadaver heads were scanned in a Siemens SOMATOM Sensation Open scanner (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) using the following protocol:  $1\mathrm{mm}$  axial slice thickness,  $120\mathrm{kV}$ ,  $100\mathrm{mAs}$ , reconstruction bone, reconstructed slice thickness  $0.6\mathrm{mm}$  and reconstruction interval  $0.6\mathrm{mm}$ . The following protocol was applied:

(a) Initial preoperative CT scan of each cadaver head.

(b) Planning CT scan of each cadaver head, for zygomatic implant placement with registration template.

(c) CT scan of registration templates as required by the double scan registration technique.

(d) Control CT scan of each cadaver head after zygomatic implant placement.

# Surgical procedure

Following a protocol published in the form of a pilot clinical case study (11) three or four primary implants (PI) (Nobel biocare MK III Ti Unite) were placed in the premaxilla and/or in the tuberosity, prior to zygomatic implant placement. Conventional dental impressions were taken after primary implant placement, and dental stone casts with laboratory implants were fabricated (master model). A double scan radiographic template capable of being fixed to the primary implants was fabricated in a dental laboratory.

CT-scans were performed following the above protocol. The DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) data was transferred to a personal laptop computer for zygomatic implant planning using dedicated software (SIMPLANT, Materialise Dental NV, Leuven, Belgium). A stereolithographic surgical template and stereolithographic phantom of each cadaver's maxilla and zygomatic process were fabricated by a commercial company (SURGIGuide, Materialise Dental NV, Leuven, Belgium). The stereolithographic surgical template was checked on the master model of the corresponding cadaver, and additionally on the stereolitographic model, which also shows the mucosa of the cadaver maxilla (Materialise Dental NV, Leuven, Belgium). Surgery was simulated on the stereolithographic model before cadaver surgery, as would be done in a live patient, to ensure the correct direction of approach to the zygomatic area, and the correct drilling depth. After this verification, the stereolithographic surgical template was loaded onto the cadaver's maxilla and screwed onto the three or four PIs. A customized surgical kit, consisting of an innovative intra-sinusal drilling tube, was used in conjunction with the customized original sleeve and components for flapless placement of the zygomatic implants (zygoma  $\mathrm{N}^{\circ}$  2 implants MKIII ti unite -  $\mathbf{N}^{\circ}$  4 implants zygoma Southern implants). The lengths of the zygomatic implants placed, which depended on anatomical conditions, were, respectively:

Case 1: Southern,  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$  (implants 1 and 2);
Case 2: Southern,  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$  (implant 1) and Southern,  $45\mathrm{mm}$  (implant 2);
Case 3: Nobel Biocare,  $40~\mathrm{mm}$  (implants 1 and 2).

In case 1, three PIs had been placed: two in the tuberosity, and one in the premaxilla; two additional screws also helped to stabilize the surgical template. In case 2, three PIs had been placed: two in the tuberosity, and one in the premaxilla; there was no additional fixation device. In case 3, four PIs had been placed: two in the tuberosity, and two in the premaxilla; there was no additional fixation device.


# Postsurgical evaluation

CT scans of each cadaver head were performed after surgery. The corresponding postsurgical images with the zygomatic implants in place were compared (Figures 1 and 2) with the presurgical images (Materialise Dental NV, Leuven, Belgium). The following placing errors were determined for each case: (a) lateral error - LE (normal distance between planned and actual perpendicular axis of the zygomatic implant) at implant tip and at implant base; and (b) angular error - AE (angle of deviation between planned and actual zygomatic implant axis). Since the guides used in this study did not have specific depth control, deviations in depth of placement were not determined.

# Results

Case 1: Three PIs (two at tuberosity; one at premaxilla) + two fixation screws
Figure 1. Fusion of pre-operatively planned implants with post-operative scanning data
Figure 2. The same measurements of case 1 without bone structure

The result for implant 1 (Southern,  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) was poor: LE at base,  $1.7\mathrm{mm}$ ; LE at tip,  $15.5\mathrm{mm}$ ; AE,  $14.2^{\circ}$ . However, it was clear that this implant had not been positioned in the drilling channel (Figures 3 and 4, see dashed line): implant placement had not followed the drilled trajectory. The maxilla was extremely thin at bone entry, and the implant had been planned to lie partly outside the maxillary sinus.

The result for implant 2 (Southern,  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) was very good: LE at base,  $0.9\mathrm{mm}$ ; LE at tip,  $0.9\mathrm{mm}$ ; AE,  $1.3^{\circ}$  (Figure 4).

Case 2: Three PIs (two at tuberosity; one at premaxilla); no screws or pins

The result for implant 1 (Southern,  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$ ) was good: LE at base,  $0.8\mathrm{mm}$ ; LE at tip,  $4.2\mathrm{mm}$ ; AE,  $5.6^{\circ}$ . The result for implant 2 (Southern,  $45\mathrm{mm}$ ) was good: LE at base,  $0.2\mathrm{mm}$ ; LE at tip,  $5.7\mathrm{mm}$ ; AE,  $5.8^{\circ}$  (Figure 6).

Case 3: Four PIs (two at tuberosity; two at premaxilla); no screws or pins

The result for implant 1 (Nobel Biocare,  $40\mathrm{mm}$ ) was very good: LE at base,  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ ; LE at tip,  $1.3\mathrm{mm}$ ; AE,

$1.8^{\circ}$ . The result for implant 2 (Nobel Biocare,  $40\mathrm{mm}$ ) was acceptable: LE at base,  $1.6\mathrm{mm}$ ; LE at tip,  $7.2\mathrm{mm}$ ; AE,  $8^{\circ}$ .

The stability of the PIs was not a true reflection of an actual clinical case, in the premaxilla nor in the tuberosity; this is due to the bone structure in the cadaver, and its inability to achieve conventional osseointegration. Two additional fixation devices, namely screws, were planned and placed as per clinical routine in one case (case 1). In all cases, however, the fit of the guide was a crucial factor in handling the surgery.

Furthermore, in case 1, an implant that had already been placed in previous scientific research, post mortem, was removed since it would have been in collision with the planned trajectory of the zygomatic implant (case 1, implant 1; Figures 7 and 8). This fact played a crucial role in the decision not to drill through the long intra-sinusal tube, but to opt for flapless zygomatic implant placement.

# Discussion

Computer-aided implant surgery has become a widespread clinical reality for implant treatment, offering
Figure 7. The implant 1 of case 1 was planned in collision with an old implant already placed in previous scientific research
Figure 8. The old implant was removed, leaving a complete lack of basal bone numerous benefits in terms of accuracy, minimally-invasive procedures, and good final results of the restoration (12,13). Guided surgical protocols, used in conjunction with 3D anatomical diagnosis, flapless surgery, and immediate-loading implant protocols, offer major improvements, enabling many different clinical situations to be resolved (14). However, before adapting this technology for placing zygomatic implants, some important issues must be addressed.


The clinical accuracy of computer-aided surgical guides is not negligible, and may reach significant levels (15,16). In clinical studies using stereolithographic guides for conventional implants, mean lateral errors of  $1.1 - 1.6\mathrm{mm}$  for the tip of the implant and mean angular errors of  $2.6 - 7.9^{\circ}$  have been reported (17,18). In a 2009 prospective study, D'Haese et al. (19) investigated the accuracy data in maxillary edentulous cases treated with mucosa-supported stereolithographic surgical guides. The range of apical deviation was  $0.32 - 3.01\mathrm{mm}$ ; the range of angular deviation was  $0.16 - 8.86^{\circ}$ . The length of routinely-used implants was found to be the main discriminating factor for apical accuracy; statistically-significant differences occurred between the overall apical deviation of short implants  $(8 - 11\mathrm{mm})$  versus long implants  $(13 - 15\mathrm{mm})$ .

Since zygomatic implants are longer (35-50 mm, compared with 8-15 mm for conventional implants) the angular error becomes the most important parameter, since slight deviations in the drill path direction will result in significant errors (20). Using bone-supported sterolithographic guides to place a total of six zygomatic implants in human cadavers, van Steenberghe et al. (21) reported differences of  $0.7 - 6.0\mathrm{mm}$  between planned and actual entry at the maxilla,  $0.8 - 7.9\mathrm{mm}$  for the exit at the zygoma, and angular errors of  $0.61 - 6.93^{\circ}$ . Chrcanovic et al. (22) conducted a similar cadaver study, and reported angular deviations of  $8.06 \pm 6.4^{\circ}$  in the anterior-posterior view, and  $11.20 \pm 9.75^{\circ}$  in the caudal-cranial view. Although the guides were fixed to the maxilla with two or three osteosynthesis screws, one implant showed a maximum angular deviation in the caudo-cranial view of  $37.6^{\circ}$ . In 12 randomly selected cases out of 29 patients, Vrielinck et al. (20) evaluated a total of 18 zygomatic implants, and reported mean errors of  $2.77 \pm 1.61\mathrm{mm}$  for the implant base (maximum  $7.4\mathrm{mm}$ ),  $4.46 \pm 3.16\mathrm{mm}$  for the implant tip (maximum  $9.7\mathrm{mm}$ ), and angular errors of  $5.14 \pm 2.59^{\circ}$  (maximum  $9.0^{\circ}$ ).

All these studies used bone-supported surgical guides. However, these guides require extensive preparation of mucosal flaps, to reveal bone for template stabilization. This seems contradictory to the rationale underlying a technology that offers a minimally- invasive flapless approach. However, there may be substantial differences between tooth-supported, mucosa-supported, and bone-supported surgical guides, depending on the degree of precision and the stability provided by the radiographic registration template and the surgical guide, during imaging and surgery (19,23). In a study using three fixed mini-implants, Widmann et al. (24) found it was possible to improve the degree of accuracy of mucosa-supported surgical guides for flapless implant placement, and reported mean lateral errors of  $0.7 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$  at the implant base, and  $0.9 \pm 0.7 \mathrm{~mm}$  at the implant tip, with a mean angular error of  $2.8 \pm 2.21^{\circ}$ . Following a similar principle, in this study the radiological mucosa-supported template and stereolithographic surgical template were fixed using three previously-placed PIs. The procedure to reposition the screwed surgical guide onto the master model, using PI analogs, achieved a high degree of clinical precision. Van Assche and Quiren (25) experimentally demonstrated the importance of ensuring precise dimensions of drill and guiding tube, and the correct length of the guiding tube, in order to reduce angular errors. In the present study, a specific surgical kit together with a customized long intra-sinus guiding tube were thus adopted, to improve drill guidance (11). In case 2, the lateral deviation for both implants was very small at the coronal point (base) despite the length of the implants ( $52.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) that were used. Angular deviations were around  $5^{\circ}$ , which is in line with the angular deviations reported for conventional implant guidance systems, and explains the larger error at the implant tip. In case 1, one of the implants (implant 1) was visibly not positioned in the drilling channel. The surgical guides failed to guide implant placement, but only guided drilling. This failure appears to be correlated to the partly extramaxillary trajectory, and to the extremely weak support provided by the thin maxillary basal bone. Further, as mentioned above, it was also necessary to remove an implant that had been placed in the cadaver for previous scientific activities, since it was in collision with the planned zygomatic trajectory. This meant that, in this case, the basal bone was entirely missing; Figure 4 clearly shows a large empty region corresponding to the entry point of the zygomatic implant. This situation played a crucial role, not in drilling through the long intra-sinusal tube, but in the subsequent flapless zygomatic implant placement.


Sufficient bone support at the maxillary entry point appears to be essential; a number of reports state that guidance of the implant would be beneficial (7,22,26). In case 3, after placement of the first implant, the stability of the PIs in the premaxilla was severely lessened. Attempts were made to compensate for this lack of stability, and to stabilize the guide in other ways; however, it was noted that the surgical guide shifted somewhat during drilling for the second implant. This might explain the considerably larger lateral error at the tip (almost 6 mm). Template stability is known to be extremely important. Any asymmetrical distribution of the screws, or uneven tightening of the screws, can bring the drilling template out of balance (22). If the implant that was placed outside the drilling channel, in case 1, and the implant that was placed after the PIs had lost stability, in case 3, are excluded, then the entry-point deviation was less than  $1\mathrm{mm}$ , with an average deviation of  $0.59\mathrm{mm}$  (the average is  $0.78\mathrm{mm}$  if implant 2 of case 3 is included); the tip deviation was on average  $3.03\mathrm{mm}$  (the average is  $3.86\mathrm{mm}$  if implant 2 of case 3 is included); the angular deviation was below  $6^{\circ}$ , with an average of  $3.63^{\circ}$  (the average is  $4.5^{\circ}$  if implant 2 of case 3 is included).

# Conclusion

The present study on cadavers followed a clinical protocol in all respects, although the instability of the PIs is a significant difference between the two conditions. As a limitation, only three cadaver heads were available, and thus only a small number of zygomatic implants could be placed. The results appear to be promising, provided that every step of the protocol can be followed precisely, and provided that the surgical guide remains stable. However, it must be remembered that, even using customized long intra-sinus guiding tubes, after confirming zygomatic anchorage on a stereolithographic model, significant deviations of the zygomatic implant may occur. The combined use of a surgical guide together with the modified sinus slot technique, which allows visual control, may be preferred to improve safety and predictability (7).


As an alternative, surgical navigation systems with actively-tracked surgical drills provide real-time control of the drill position, which may offer a technical advantage over passive mechanical guides (27-29). Watzinger et al. (30) found an accuracy of  $1.3 \pm 0.8 \mathrm{~mm}$  (maximum error  $2.8 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) in the implant position at the external perforation of the zygoma, in a study on five cadaver heads, with a total of 10 zygomatic implants.

Unfortunately, surgical navigation systems are very expensive, and they are generally only available in larger hospitals (27). Despite its attractions, computer-aided minimally-invasive flapless zygomatic implant surgery remains challenging. Meticulous preparation, careful trajectory planning, and painstaking execution are essential to minimize errors. The anatomical risks and complications must be taken into account, and computer-aided surgery will not compensate for any lack of knowledge and skills in prosthetics and surgery. Further refinement in technology and clinical trials will be needed to improve the predictability of the procedure.
