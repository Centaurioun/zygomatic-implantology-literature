# MEASURING QUALITY OF LIFE IN BRITAIN: INTRODUCING THE WHOQOL-100

SUZANNE M. SKEVINGTON

(Received 21 December 1998; accepted 1 June 1999)

Abstract—Quality of life is an important outcome measure in the evaluation of treatments for a range of chronic physical and psychological disorders. The psychometric properties of a new British quality-of-life instrument—the WHOQOL-100—are presented, as part of an international project to create a multilingual, multidimensional profile for cross-cultural use. The WHOQOL was completed by an adult sample  $(N = 320)$  of well people and patients attending GP surgeries and out-patient clinics and from in-patient wards. The sick represented 16 disease categories and all were selected for age, gender, and disease severity. The levels of quality of life of different disease groups and sociodemographic categories are reported. The presence or absence of positive feelings provides the best single predictor of quality of life in Britain today, and this improves when supplemented by information about mobility and energy. The scores of the scale discriminate well between sick and well people and concur with reported health status. The concept of quality of life covering 25 facets (hierarchically organized within six domains) was largely confirmed by mapping intercorrelations. The WHOQOL-100 shows excellent overall internal consistency reliability and can be used with individuals. This level of reliability extends to all domains and patient subgroups. Seven UK national items were also assessed for inclusion. The results show that WHOQOL-100 promises to be a comprehensive profile for generic use in the evaluation of contemporary health care. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

# INTRODUCTION

Demand is increasing for a good quality-of-life measure that will enable health and health care interventions to be properly evaluated, and such an instrument can assist with policymaking and planning in health service. The concerns and perceptions of the patient are central to the assessment of quality of life and thus subjective measures must be both applicable and acceptable to the people who use them. Any new scale for use in health settings must at the same time display the valued psychometric properties of sensitivity to changes in clinical condition as well as reliability and validity [1]. The present study investigates some of the psychometric properties of a new quality-of-life assessment, which may be of use in British health care—the UK WHOQOL-100. This instrument has been designed through collaborative work with the WHOQOL Group, originating from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Geneva, and is currently available in more than 40 languages worldwide (WHOQOL Group, 1995, 1998). It will be most useful in multinational clinical trials for the evaluation of quality-of-life outcomes during all types of health care interventions; for instance, surgery, counseling, and medication. The measurement of quality of life is especially salient to the care of those with serious and chronic diseases, where recovery may be partial, remission rates high, and care often palliative. It will also be useful for making cross-cultural comparisons about perceived quality of life relating to health and, at a one-to-one level, in improving communications between doctors and their patients in the consulting room.


There is considerable debate about the definition of quality of life. It is frequently confused with standard of living; square feet of living space in Tokyo and Los Angeles provide a comparative illustration of why such indicators have not succeeded in measuring quality of life cross-culturally. It is the meaning of these resources or conditions that tell us about quality of life and, inevitably, these meanings will be grounded in cultural values. Indeed, many items are claimed to be quality-of-life indicators, although these claims are equivocal. For instance, in a review of recent clinical trials, Hunt [2] noted that the measurement of quality of life has been variously confused with the incidence of psychiatric morbidity, number and severity of symptoms, cognitive ability, social contact, the ability to work, physical capacity, and the frequency of diarrhea.

Quality of life cannot be measured with objective indicators because it is a subjective experience. Hence, the best person to assess quality of life is arguably the individual themselves. For instance, a clinician who wants to know about how sleep affects quality of life might ask questions about length of sleep time, early waking, interruptions to sleep, use of sleeping pills, and so on. But answers to these questions do not provide a direct insight into that person's quality of life because they require interpretation. Any such interpretations necessarily bring to bear the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of the judge and must be based on limited (usually observable) information. Therefore, the conclusion reached by a judge about that person's quality of life may be far from accurate, and inaccuracy is a prime reason why clinician ratings of quality of life have shown only limited clinical success in the history of the subject. We may question the quality of life of a person who sleeps 3 hours a night. The important issue in quality-of-life assessment is not how many hours a person sleeps but whether, when waking, their sleep has been refreshing. Questions about how satisfied or bothered people are about important aspects of life provide not only an individual profile about how that person perceives their condition but also could be used as a primer for clinical action in areas deemed to be problematic. The best way to find out about a person's quality of life is therefore to ask them, and then to supplement this assessment with the usual clinical observational information.

Last, where subjective qualities of life have been evaluated in health care, they have often been restricted to a relatively small number of dimensions. Among published scales, the most popular of these dimensions has been functional status for physical illness (covering mobility and activities of daily living) and negative mood for psychological disorders. Although these are undoubtedly important aspects of life, many other properties may also be important and, to date, these remain largely unevaluated. This is due to restricted consensus about what dimensions are essential to a comprehensive assessment of quality of life. It is also due to clinical pressure about providing short scales to ease the clinical burden. Some quality-of-life instruments have compiled the "best" items available and, although this is laudable from a measurement viewpoint, it has resulted in a tendency to lose sight of the entirety of the concept of quality of life, conceptual poverty in the field, and increasing similarity among instruments. But, in 1991, the WHOQOL Group took a fresh look at the comprehensiveness of the concept of quality of life and carried out this work internationally in an attempt to establish its most important global dimensions.


The WHO's definition of health is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" [3]. In the spirit of this statement, quality of life was defined by the WHOQOL Group as "an individual's perceptions of their position in life, in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live, and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept, affected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment" [4]. A sixth domain, addressing spirituality, religion, and personal beliefs, was subsequently added to the list in this definition following recommendations by focus groups. In psychosomatic research, it is necessary to give equivalent weight to the assessment of both the physical and psychological aspects of a disorder and this Cartesian dualism underpins the WHOQOL concept. The WHOQOL is intended for use by those with chronic diseases, well people, informal caregivers, and people living in highly stressful situations, such as refugees and migrants. It is a subjective assessment for adults with a reading age of 8 years and above, but can also be completed with interviewer assistance.

To develop this multidimensional, multilingual, generic profile, a manual defining 33 aspects or facets of quality of life was constructed to provide instructions that could assist focus groups in the task of composing questions or items that would later be included in the WHOQOL instrument [5]. Labels attached to five-point Likert interval rating scales were also developed by each center [6]. From a pool of over 2000 questions generated by focus groups of patients, health professionals, and community members carried out in 15 centers, a pilot version of 276 items was selected to form the international core questions [7]. National items specific to the language and culture of a particular center were allowed be appended to the core where focus groups showed that those concepts were not fully addressed in that culture (e.g., skin color in India). Four national items representing specific concerns in Britain were included (e.g., feeling "fed up"). Results showed that 29 aspects of quality of life were important international features of quality of life (Table I). General questions on overall quality of life and health were added. For each facet, questions about its importance to quality of life were included.

The content and organization of items, facets, and domains has undergone several revisions throughout the dual and reflexive processes of establishing the conceptual structure and reducing the item pool, first using qualitative, then quantitative, international consensus. The method allows for the inclusion of important semantic and conceptual features pertaining to the main aspects of quality of life in that population, and hence equivalence between versions could be achieved [4]. This common, centrally directed, "spoke-wheel" procedure enables standards to be maintained across centers, and for a number of different language versions to be developed simultaneously. Hence, the WHOQOL differs in its method of develop-

ment from that of previous instruments where, in a sequential process, a scale designed in one language showed only limited semantic and conceptual equivalence when translated into subsequent versions. The WHOQOL is genuinely cross-cultural in the manner in which it was created [8] and this method of simultaneously developing versions in many cultures represents a "fast track" to international use [9]. Furthermore, the manual designed for focus group use provides a common central tool and a blueprint for the creation of potentially hundreds of different language versions (Table I).

Some psychometric properties of the WHOQOL have been examined in a global sample obtained from 15 centers  $(\mathrm{N} = 4802)$  [10]. The UK instrument performed at a very high level and was largely consistent with the international model. An examination of results across global centers enabled weak items to be deleted and changes to the conceptual structure to be made, hence facets on sensory functioning, dependence on nonmedicinal substances, communication capacity, activities as provider/ supporter, and work satisfaction were deleted (see Table I). Mapped global intercorrelations showed that sexual activity should be moved from the physical to the social domain. Four psychometrically superior items from each of the remaining 25 facets (hierarchically grouped within six domains) were selected for the WHO-QOL-100 and 32 importance items were retained as an appendix to this international core [10].


Thirty-one items contributed by UK focus groups were included in the 276-item pilot version of the WHOQOL. Of the 176 items discarded during the selection of the WHOQOL-100, 18 were UK items, and these were now reassessed as potential national items. Internal consistency reliability was good for all these national items (Cronbach's  $\alpha$  ranged from 0.68 to 0.77). However, 15 were deleted where there was semantic overlap and/or high correlations with international core items (five items), where scores did not significantly distinguish between sick and well samples (seven items) and where there were consistent patterns of missing data (three items). Consequently, the remaining three items were added to the original four national items and these were assessed and compared with the performance of the international items in the WHOQOL-100. This article reports the preliminary psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-100 for a British sample. The purpose of this study was to examine internal consistency reliability, construct validity, and discriminant power for the instrument using a heterogeneous cross-section of sick and well people. A secondary aim was to examine any effect on these results when the UK national items were included.

# METHOD

The 281-item UK WHOQOL pilot version was administered to 320 people in Britain during the first 6 months of 1994. The international protocol required a minimum of 300 respondents, to include 250 patients and 50 well people, with  $50\%$  of each gender and the two age ranges (16-44 and  $45+$  years) in a  $2 \times 2$  design. These figures were based on the number of pooled subjects per cell required for the proposed analyses (200 is a minimum prerequisite for reliability studies [12]) and this sample size resulted in a  $95\%$  confidence interval of 0.15 [13]. The sample obtained consisted of  $49\%$  men and  $51\%$  women;  $51\%$  were under 45 years of age.

A national protocol designed in the UK WHOQOL Center used patient morbidity statistics, where patient incidence in 18 ICD categories was displayed by age and gender [14] to identify a representative sample of illness groups. As most secondary and tertiary referrals are monitored by GPs in Britain, the majority of reported conditions are sampled by these statistics. The sampling frame for each ICD category was obtained by dividing the rounded patient total for each of the 18 categories by 1000, then summing all categories. The resulting sum of 252 was, coincidentally, the exact number of patients we had planned to obtain  $(\mathrm{N} = 63$  per age  $\times$  gender cell). So, for ICD 1,  $18,000+$  patients reported with infectious or parasitic diseases, indicating the need to obtain 18 patients with herpes, infectious intestinal diseases, viral or venereal warts, streptococcal throat, etc. These stratification figures were used to monitor targeting of patients during data collection together with estimates of severity [14], site (in-patient/out-patient /GP patient), sociodemographic characteristics, ethnicity, and urban/rural location. There is one patient in the UK reporting severe illness for every three with intermediate seriousness and four with trivial complaints. As a result, these three severity groups were obtained in roughly equal numbers so as to increase the proportion of serious cases—because the ability to measure the quality of life of seriously ill patients is an important requirement of this instrument. The sample was composed of 61 well people, 57 in-patients, 136 out-patients, and 66 GP patients.

Patients  $(\mathrm{N} = 259)$  were obtained from a range of urban, suburban, and rural locations in England and Scotland and from 16 of the 18 ICD categories. (None in the perinatal period [XV] and complications of pregnancy/puerperium [XI] were obtained.) The number of patients recruited was within  $2\%$  of the target in 10 of 16 ICD categories with an  $8\%$  overrecruitment of circulatory problems. Patients were obtained from three medical school teaching hospitals, two specialist national referral centers, and the in-patient and out-patient departments of two district general hospitals. Data were collected in general surgery and general medical wards and from patients in neurology, cardiology, psychiatry, endocrinology, rheumatology, oncology, ENT, respiratory physiology, gynecology/obstetrics, accident and emergency, and urology departments also from a rehabilitation medicine unit, clinics for antenatal and chronic pain, and from four general practices. Guidelines and telephone support were provided to administrators at distant sites and checking procedures ensured quality control. Most sites also contributed data from well people (target  $N = 52$ ) who were screened for illness, then sampled for age and gender ( $N = 13$  per cell). Forty-nine percent of well men were recruited and  $52\%$  of well people were in the younger age group. To be included in the well sample respondents were required to describe themselves as "well," to be without medication, and not to have consulted a doctor within the 2 weeks prior to the assessment (its time frame). They were similarly stratified for socioeconomic, ethnic, and location factors. Although modest by survey standards, this sample ( $N = 61$ ) provided a baseline of health from which quality-of-life comparisons with the sick could be made. By enabling the scores of sick people to be interpreted in relation to behaviors and characteristics reported by those who are well, this provides the means to create a criterion-referenced test. Information was provided about the project and its voluntary and confidential nature and a consent form was signed. The 281-item pilot version of the WHOQOL was self-completed in 20 minutes by well people, but severely ill patients took 1.5 hours. Only three participants required interviewer assistance. This procedure is summarized elsewhere [15].


# RESULTS

Following the recoding of negative items and data cleaning, SPSS for Windows was used to analyze the items of the UK WHOQOL-100. Tests were completed to examine the distribution of scores across items, facets, and domains, and acceptable normality was established in all areas with the exception of minor, unproblematic skew for facets on working capacity and sexual activity. Most missing data were in sexual activity (6%), working capacity (5%), and the importance of sex life (4%). It is worth noting that around 95% of respondents readily responded to questions about sex, and thus valuable, relatively complete data were obtained about an area that is difficult to broach.

# Quality of life and disease classification

Quality of life was compared for patients in 16 ICD categories and well people. It was predicted that well people would report good quality of life, but no a priori judgments were made about the rankings of the disease groups. One-way analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) of mean total quality-of-life scores for the full sample indicated significant differences between categories [corrected  $\chi = 63.39(16)$ ,  $p = 0.00001$ ]. The mean rankings of groups in the top and bottom  $25\%$  of the range showed the poorest quality of life for the one patient with blood diseases, then mental disorders  $(n = 13)$ , diseases of the nervous system and sense organs  $(n = 26)$ , and a congenital abnormality. Because of very small numbers in two categories, caution is required in the interpretation of these results. The best quality of life was found for well people  $(n = 61)$ , then those with neoplasms  $(n = 7)$ , circulatory diseases  $(n = 35)$ , and "supplementary conditions" (e.g., attending for family planning:  $n = 14$ ). Patients with neoplasms ranked their quality of life in the top quartile across every domain. This finding was unexpected, but as the WHOQOL-100 measures subjective perceptions, the result should be taken at face value as it may reflect excellent care, relief from anxiety following treatment, or unrealistic optimism.

When the domains of quality of life were examined for disease categories, the results were highly significant ( $p = 0.00001$ ) for domains I to IV, showing a difference between 16 disease groups. This effect was weaker for the environment domain ( $p = 0.032$ ), and spirituality, religion, and personal beliefs ( $p = 0.057$ ) did not distinguish between disease groups. Together, these findings provided initial evidence of the discriminatory power of scores for the WHOQOL-100. Last, some disease groups showed a mixed domain profile. For example, patients with musculoskeletal diseases perceived quality of life to be poorer than many other groups, being in the bottom quartile on the physical, independence, and environment domains, but they were in the top quartile for spirituality. This example serves to demonstrate the value of using a multidimensional profile like the WHOQOL-100 to assess quality of life over measures that produce a single index.


# Discriminatory power

It was important to find out whether scores of quality of life reflect differences in health status. To be acceptable, the scale should show that scores are high—indicating good quality of life—when people are well, and low when they are ill. To examine this feature, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated on the mean total quality-of-life scores for the four subgroups. It was predicted, a priori, that sick patients would have scores reflecting poorer quality of life than those who were well, and that in-patients would have the poorest quality of life of the three patient groups. This was confirmed using multiple-range tests (with Bonferroni adjustment at 0.05). In-patients had poorer quality of life than those in other groups (means [standard deviations], respectively: in-patients,  $= 3.4$  [0.52]; outpatients,  $= 3.6$  [0.40];  $\mathrm{GP} = 3.7$  [0.37]; well  $= 3.9$  [0.38])  $[F(3,319) = 16.60$ ,  $p = 0.00001]$ . When replicated, using mean facet scores of general (g) quality of life, the same pattern of significant comparisons was confirmed  $[F(3,319) = 17.35$ ,  $p = 0.00001]$ .

Quality-of-life scores were then directly evaluated in relation to an independent measure of overall health to determine whether health improved as scores increased. An item reading "How do you rate your health" had been part of the original pilot version of the WHOQOL but had not been subsequently included in the WHOQOL-100. ANOVA was used to examine quality of life using five groups, composed of respondents contributing to each of the five points on this rating scale: very poor health (1) to very good health (5) (recoded). The results showed a sequential, stepwise increase in means across the five points of the scale  $(p = 0.00001)$  for five of the six domains, confirming the prediction that quality-of-life scores would be higher where health was rated most positively. The best results, and therefore greatest discriminatory power, was in the independence domain, where main effects and all comparisons were significant  $[F(4,315) = 93.89, p = 0.00001]$ . For spirituality, religion, and personal beliefs, there were no significant findings  $(p = 0.09)$ . So the UK WHOQOL-100 showed good overall discriminatory power as judged on most indices (except spirituality). Here, scores on quality of life sensitively reflect distinctive categories of health. Such findings are good news for clinicians, who need to know that changes in these quality-of-life scores correspond with "real" differences in health status.

# Validity

It was important to examine whether sociodemographic characteristics affect the ways in which people perform on the WHOQOL-100. To investigate the influence of age and gender on scores, independent two-tailed  $t$ -tests for unequal cells were carried out. Results from the psychological domain showed that men reported better quality of life than women  $[t = 2.75(314.6), p = 0.0006]$ , but there were no differ ences in other domains. Using a binomial conversion of the age range into younger (16-44 years) and older (45-65 years) groups, it was found that older people reported significantly better psychological  $[t = 2.21(300.8), p = 0.028]$ , social  $[t = 1.89(309.5), p = 0.05]$ , and environmental  $[t = 3.73(317.6), p = 0.0001]$  health relating to quality of life. Younger people see themselves as more independent than older people  $[t = 2.43(316.9), p = 0.016]$ , so age is associated with the way people report several aspects of their quality of life.


It was important to investigate the predictive validity of the WHOQOL-100. Which aspect(s) of quality of life are the most important? To do this, hierarchical multiple regression was performed using the 24 facets from the WHOQOL-100 as independent variables and mean general (g) quality of life as the dependent variable. Sociodemographic variables of age and gender were entered at the first stage, as covariates. The results showed that knowing a person's age and gender does not improve predictions about their quality of life. When the 24 facet means were subsequently entered together, 8 facets were found to explain  $70\%$  of general quality of life and health. Positive feelings was the best predictor (adjusted  $R^2 = 50\%$ ), as it explained half the variance in overall quality of life. Ratings of energy and fatigue explained a further  $11\%$ , with minor contributions from recreation and leisure ( $3\%$ ) and mobility ( $2\%$ ). (The remaining significant facets contributed under  $1\%$ .) When the analysis was replicated with the national items, seven facets explained overall quality of life and health. Again, positive feelings was most important ( $60\%$ ) with two national items added. This  $10\%$  gain in explanation, resulting from the inclusion of two extra national items in positive feelings, substantially improves the assessment of quality of life in Britain. Mobility ( $8\%$ ) and energy ( $2\%$ ) again improved prediction about overall quality of life, with other facets (including recreation) contributing less than  $1\%$ . Therefore, the presence of positive feelings is by far the most important feature of quality of life in the way British people conceptualize it. If we know whether positive feelings are present or absent then we can make a good prediction about whether people will rate their quality of life as good or poor. Adding questions about mobility and energy and fatigue provides the fine tuning needed for this prediction.

Similar analyses confirmed that all the six domains were significant to quality of life and together those results explained a total  $67\%$  of the variance. But, the psychological domain was by far the most important  $(52\%)$ , followed by levels of independence  $(8\%)$  and social  $(3\%)$  and environmental  $(2\%)$  quality of life. Physical health and spiritual health contributed less than  $1\%$ . When national items were added, then the total variance explained and domain entry order remained the same  $(67\%)$ , but the explanatory power of psychological health increased to  $54\%$ . Many scales on quality of life have given priority to physical health as its most important quality, but here we see that subjective perceptions of the users themselves do not concur with this. For the people who answered this questionnaire, psychological health and independence played major roles in explaining people's quality of life. In view of the collective findings in this section, the psychological domain could be of particular value in assessment.

# Structure of the UK WHOQOL-100

Correlations between mean facet and domain scores were used to examine the conceptual structure of the instrument. To confirm the national construct validity of the WHOQOL-100 (Table I) all domains should be highly correlated. Furthermore, associations between facets within a particular domain should be significant and more strongly associated (convergent validity) than with facets outside the domain (divergent validity). Many significant intercorrelations in the matrix confirmed the proposed structure, and the findings are summarized in what follows. Within domains, facet correlations were good, mainly exceeding the criterion of  $r = 0.4$ . Exceptions to this were found in the environment domain where two thirds of the correlations were below the criterion. There were also weak but significant correlations between body image with cognitions ( $r = 0.29$ ) and with negative feelings ( $r = 0.26$ ). Although body image is not strongly associated with other facets in the psychological domain, the results indicate that the psychological domain is most appropriate for this facet.


Correlations with facets outside the nonparent domain confirmed that, in most cases, they were more highly associated with facets outside their domain than within, supporting divergent validity. However, some exceptions deserve comment; first, physical domain facets of pain and energy both correlated strongly  $(r = 0.5 - 0.7)$  with independence domain facets of activities of daily living, mobility, and working capacity, indicating that these facets might be moved from the physical to the independence domain. But, an alternative view is that the two domains might be better combined into a single domain reflecting physical health and independence and this reorganization has taken place in a recent revision of the WHOQOL following structural equation modeling of the international data [15]. Second, positive feelings were highly correlated with personal relationships  $(r = 0.6)$ , indicating the primacy that is given to personal relationships in sustaining positive mood (or vice versa). Last, strong correlations were found between each facet and general quality of life and health (g), but the weakest of these were for body image and the availability and quality of health and social care, suggesting that these features are least salient to quality of life in UK. The strongest correlation was with positive feelings, supporting the aforementioned regression findings, as well as earlier research which points to the fact that happiness and contentment is central to the conceptualization of quality of life in Britain. Indeed, some people see them as being synonymous [4].

# Reliability

Cronbach's  $\alpha$  (standardized) was calculated for all of the items in the instrument and for the total sample. The results showed that the UK WHOQOL-100 has excellent internal consistency reliability  $(\alpha = 0.967)$ . When the seven national items were added there was negligible improvement  $(\alpha = 0.969)$ . The  $\alpha$  was calculated for all domains except spirituality (insufficient items) and showed excellent results, ranging from 0.95 for independence to 0.87 for the social domain. For the psychological domain (0.92), reliability improved with the inclusion of national items (0.94). The internal consistency of the importance items was also very good (0.91). Assessing the four subgroups, Cronbach's  $\alpha$  for in-patients was 0.97 and excellent results for outpatients, primary care, and well samples were also found (0.96). These results show that domain scores can be reliably used with all major groups of patients and well people. The UK WHOQOL-100 is reliable for use with individual patients.

# DISCUSSION

The UK WHOQOL-100 shows a high level of internal consistency reliability as a total scale and across all domains and subgroups and the measure is acceptable for reliable use with individual patients, not just groups. The conceptual structure proposed for the WHOQOL-100 has been largely confirmed in UK and the data indicate that physical and independence domains might be fruitfully combined into one. Priority is given by our respondents to psychological features as the most important aspect of quality of life in Britain, and the way people respond to questions in this domain differ for the genders and two age ranges. Within this domain, the most important facet is positive feelings, as it shows the strongest association with general quality of life, and this persists when two national items are added. Positive feelings are the best national predictor of overall quality of life, with mobility and energy and fatigue making minor contributions. Whereas well people have the best quality of life in most domains, it is worth noting that they do not consistently rate their quality of life higher than some disease groups, especially in the psychological and spiritual domains. This raises interesting questions about what it means to be completely healthy in contemporary Britain. The finding also brings into relief the WHO definition of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing.” Research by the WHOQOL Group suggests that the definition falls short on three important dimensions, namely levels of independence, environmental health and spirituality, and religion and personal beliefs. The findings about well people also suggest that, within the definition, the word substantial might be more appropriately substituted for complete. The WHOQOL domain scores show good discrimination between different categories of disease. In addition, quality-of-life scores discriminate between the different subgroups with in-patients predictably rating their quality of life as poorest and well people the best. Graded health ratings are commensurate with appropriate differences in quality-of-life scores, confirming that good health accompanies a better quality of life, as expected. The WHOQOL-100 is particularly good at making such discriminations at the healthy end of the spectrum and the best discriminatory power is for the physical and independence domains. The next stage in the development of the UK WHOQOL-100 will be to examine the remaining psychometric features of the instrument, to generate UK norms, and to further test the properties of a reduced number of UK national items.
