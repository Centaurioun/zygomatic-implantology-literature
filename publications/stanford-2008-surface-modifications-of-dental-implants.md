# ABSTRACT

Dental implant surface technologies have been evolving rapidly to enhance a more rapid bone formation on their surface and hold a potential to increase the predictability of expedited implant therapy. While implant outcomes have become highly predictable, there are sites and conditions that result in elevated implant loss. This paper reviews the impact of macroretentive features which includes approaches to surface oxide modification, thread design, press-fit and sintered-bead technologies to increase predictability of outcomes. Implant designs that lead to controlled lateral compression of the bone can improve primary stability as long as the stress does not exceed the localized yield strength of the cortical bone. Some implant designs have reduced crestal bone loss by use of multiple cutting threads that are closely spaced, smoothed on the tip but designed to create a hoop-stress stability of the implant as it is completely seated in the osteotomy. Following the placement of the implant, there is a predictable sequence of bone turnover and replacement at the interface that allows the newly formed bone to adapt to microscopic roughness on the implant surface, and on some surfaces, a nanotopography  $(<10^{-9}\mathrm{m}$  scale) that has been shown to preferably influence the formation of bone. Newly emerging studies show that bone cells are exquisitely sensitive to these topographical features and will upregulate the expression of bone related genes for new bone formation when grown on these surfaces. We live in an exciting time of rapid changes in the modalities we can offer patients for tooth replacement therapy. Given this, it is our responsibility to be critical when claims are made, incorporate into our practice what is proven and worthwhile, and to continue to support and provide the best patient care possible.

Key words: Implants, topography, nanostructures, interface, bone.

# INTRODUCTION

Since the early 1980s, the use of endosseous dental implants for the support of dental restorations has created a revolution in the routine approach to dental care. The high success rates for this procedure occur through initial anatomic stability provided by the amount, quality and distribution of bone within the proposed implant site. Typically, integration of an implant is characterized by a series of crude clinical rules which attempt to assess the impact of the implant design and implant surface technologies. These relatively crude clinical parameters involve a lack of signs and symptoms of pathology, a lack of mobility and a radiographic assessment of the interface. While high success rates hold for certain anatomic regions, the bony response within the thin cortical plates and diminished cancellous bone characterizing the Lekhom and Zarb type IV bone is considerably less successful with conventional machined surfaced implants (e.g., 65-85 per cent). In a meta-analysis, Lindh et al. observed that implant success in the posterior maxillae was less than other regions of the mouth and is highly dependent on adequate bone volume in the area. These results may relate to both the minimally rough implant surfaces being used at the time of Lindh's study and the patient population assessed. The response of trabecular bone to the mechanical environment is a critical factor, especially in regions of the jaw such as the edentulous posterior maxillae where the cortical thickness and/or local material properties are insufficient to withstand occlusal forces. Strategies to increase both the local quantity and quality of osseous tissue at the interface are therefore an important means to provide predictable implant therapy for patients with poor bone quality, immediate loading protocols and implant design strategies that potentially decreases the need for a large number of endosseous-style implants for the rehabilitation of a patient.


The long-term success of implant therapy is not just dependent on enhanced osseous stability. More recently, there is greater attention being addressed to the transmucosal implant or implant abutment interface. The mechanical and biological stability derived from the design and surfaces in this connective tissue and junctional epithelial environment are critical to maintaining a sufficient volume of connective tissue that has minimal inflammatory infiltrate. Chronic inflammation in this transmucosal region, be it from the designs, materials or surface roughness, can lead to long-term tissue recession and even peri-implantitis years after the completion of tooth replacement therapy.[7-14] In order to increase the predictability of implant therapy, significant efforts have gone into development of implant biomaterials that hold the promise of improving clinical success. These technologies have evolved from simply a modification of the oxide surface to precise nano-scale modification technologies that involve the formation of a uniform and consistent technology that leads to altered cellular response. Further, there are developing technologies to utilize changes in surface chemistry or even potentially biologics being added to the oxide surface to assist in stability of both the osseous and transmucosal environment.


The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework and background for the clinician to understand the relative merits of various "innovations" (in development or already marketed) to the surface topography of titanium endosseous-screw type implants.

# Implant macro-retentive features

Implants used in the oral environment have one of three major types of macro-retentive features: screw threads (tapped or self tapping), solid body press-fit designs and/or sintered bead technologies. Each of these approaches is designed to achieve initial implant stability and/or create large volumetric spaces for bone in-growth. An important biological principal of bone is that it favourably responds to compressive loading (without the presence of a PDL) but not to shear forces.[15] Therefore, screw thread designs have been adapted to achieve a compressive loading of the surrounding cortical or cancellous bone. For instance, certain implant designs (ITI/Straumann, Institut Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) use a specific thread profile ( $15^{\circ}$  cutting thread), to create primarily compressive stresses at the transcortical bone interface. This thread profile has a rounded tip (reducing shear forces at the tip of the thread) which appears to maintain bone in the compressive zone beneath the thread profile.[16-18] With a desire to improve initial bone stability, various implant designs have incorporated dual (or more) cutting thread profiles (with or without a screw-based press-fit) where two sets of threads cut at different relative locations in the osteotomy upon placement as a means to reduce initial stripping (e.g., upon overseating) and thus loss of primary stability (SpeedyTM, Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden). Still other thread designs (OsseoSpeed MicrothreadTM Astra Tech AB, Mölndal, Sweden) have focused on reducing the surrounding shear forces by reducing the height of the thread profile (reducing the contribution of any one thread) with an increase in the number of threads per unit area of the implant surface.19 This has the additional benefit of increasing the strength of the implant body by increasing the amount of remaining wall thickness of the implant body.20 Finally, orthopaedic prosthesis (e.g., femoral stems, pelvic acetabular caps, knee prosthesis, etc.) have used various sintering technologies to create mesh or sintered beads as a surface for bone to grow into. The application of this technology to dental implants has involved attempts to improve the success rate of short implants (<10 mm in length).6 At the University of Toronto, sintered bead technology lead to the development of one commercially available implant system (EndoporeTM Innova Corp., Toronto, Canada) which shows favourable clinical results (93-100 per cent relative success at 3-5 years) with very short implants (7.7 mm) even in the posterior maxilla.21-29


# Implant micro-retentive features

Upon the placement of an implant into a surgical site, there is a cascade of molecular and cellular processes that provides for new bone growth and differentiation along the biomaterial surface. The goal of a number of current strategies is to provide an enhanced osseous stability through micro-surface mediated events. These strategies can be divided into those that attempt to enhance the in-migration of new bone (e.g., osteoconduction) through changes in surface topography (e.g., surface "roughness"), biological means to manipulate the type of cells that grow onto the surface and strategies to utilize the implant as a vehicle for local delivery of a bioactive coating (adhesion matrix or growth factor such as BMP) that may achieve osteoinduction of new bone differentiation along the implant surface.

One means to improve implant success is through methods to increase the amount of bone contact along the body of the implant. While it may seem obvious that increased surface roughness of implants leads to greater success it is not clear that just any "roughness" is advantageous. The term "roughness" itself can even be ambiguous.[30] In implant design, it is usually assumed that a greater surface area (per unit of bulk metal surface) is an objective by various means to enhance the surface roughness of the implant surface. This enhanced surface area then allows a greater area for load transfer of bone against the implant surface.[31-34] It should be clarified that surface roughness is often a poorly described characteristic of implant surfaces making comparisons between implant systems difficult. $^{35}$  In evaluating an implant surface there are both macroscopic and microscopic features which combined are used to describe the surface "topography". For instance, various screw thread profiles are used as macroscopic features (pitch, number, sharpness, etc.) combined with microscopic features (surface pits created by grit blasting) that may or may not be coupled with acid etching of the roughened surface. These micromechanical features influence the process of secondary integration (bone growth, turnover and remodeling). $^{2}$  One advantage of acid etching is to increase the roughness of the already grit blasted surface creating a nanometer-scale topography that allows bone to grow into and maintain the implant surface under elevated shear forces. $^{36,37}$  Implant design features conventionally were thought to need surface pores or "pits" of  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  or greater in diameter for in-growth of bone although clinically relevant surface roughness may actually be much finer (on the nanoscale level). $^{38}$


# Implant wound healing and the potential role of surface modification

Wound healing around a dental implant placed into a prepared osteotomy follows three stages of repair. Initial formation of a blood clot occurs through a biochemical activation followed by a cellular activation and finally a cellular response. These initial rapid changes during the surgical phase of implant therapy leads to activation of key biochemical pathways: the clotting system (fibrinogen to fibrin), complement activation, Kinin cascade activation (vascular dilation) and finally, plasmingen activation of plasmin. The adhesion of platelets to the assembled fibrin scaffold as well as adhesion to the surface topography of an implant surface leads to a process of platelet activation. Platelets are a rich source of locally released growth factors (PDGF, TGF-Beta, PDEGF, IGF-1, etc.) that can accelerate the wound healing process though recruitment and differentiation of mesenchymal cells critical to establishing an osseous interface at the implant surface.[39] It is the interaction with the surface and serum proteins which appear to create the primary effect of implant surface topography.[40]

The subsequent formation of a mineralized matrix during osteogenesis and bone remodeling or during osseointegration of dental implants involves the recruitment of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells and the progressive differentiation of these cells into osteoblasts. Osteoblast differentiation and skeletal formation during embryonic development is mediated by an essential transcription factor protein called core binding-factor-  $\alpha 1$  (Cbfa1) or RUNX-2.  $^{42}$  Cbfa1 belongs to the Runt family of transcription factors, and regulates osteoblast differentiation and expression of bone extracellular matrix protein genes that encode for bone sialoprotein (BSP), Osteocalcin and Type I Collagen. $^{44,45}$  RUNX-2/Cbfa1 plays an essential role in osteogenesis, osteoblast matrix formation, chondrocyte differentiation, and bone resorption by osteoclasts $^{46}$  and could therefore be a downstream target of cellular events such as extracellular matrix adhesion-mediated signaling, changes in cell shape and responses to local parcrine environments. A second transcription factor, Osterix, has been described and has been suggested to play a key role downstream of RUNX-2 in which its expression is necessary for the ongoing differentiation within the osteogenic pathway (versus sifting to a chondrogenic pathway). $^{47}$


The promotion of osteoblast attachment and differentiation has been evaluated on various implant surfaces using a variety of cell culture and animal models.[2,48,49] For instance, the expression of matrix related proteins such as Alkaline Phosphatase and Type I Collagen were enhanced on large grit, acid etched cpTi (SLA) surfaces.[50] The mechanism by which topography influences osteoblast differentiation appears to be mediated by the protein kinase A and PL A2 pathway,[51] and by integrin mediated signaling pathways.[48] The topography also influences subsequent expression of osteoblast-mediated cytokines and growth factors. Osteosarcoma cells (MG-63) grown on roughened surfaces had increased TGF- $\beta$  and IL $_{1}\beta^{52}$  in which a prostaglandin mediated response was described leading to decreased proliferation on characterized rougher surfaces with an increase in cellular phenotypic markers of differentiation (ALP activity, Osteocalcin). While these observations demonstrate cellular responses of osteoblasts to the matrix absorbed onto the surface of an implant, they do not provide information on the role of the surface (and the resultant matrix topography) on initial platelet adhesion/activation events and subsequent alterations of osteoblast cell shape and differentiation. These events are critical to the in-growth of new cells and the subsequent process of contact osteogenesis along the implant surface. It may also be possible that the implant topography may lead to enhanced differentiation of osteoblasts through alterations in transcriptional regulation or gene expression of key osteogenic factors as a result of changes in cell shape due to interaction with the implant surface microtopography.

# Implant micro-retentive features: surface roughness by blasting/etching

Various studies have also addressed the issue of surface roughness through various means of grit blasting followed by a surface etching or coating procedure. This has included titanium plasma spray (TPS),[34] abrasion  $(\mathrm{TiO}_2$  blasting or use of soluble abrasives), combinations of blasting and etching (e.g.,  $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  with  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{SO}_4/\mathrm{HCL})$ ,[34] thin apatite coating[53] or sintered beads.[54] Commercially available roughened surfaces using the large grit blasted and acid etched surface (ITI/Straumann's SLA surface) have shown both laboratory and clinical evidence of elevated success rates in areas of the posterior maxilla.[55-59] The SLA surface is one example of a commercially available surface technology that is derived from original animal studies. In these studies, an electropolished highly smooth cpTi was compared to a range of roughened surfaces (some with etching) and a calcium phosphate coated surface (HA). This study documented that the SLA surface achieved equivalent bone contact (50-60 per cent) as the HA surface but was able to achieve this without the need for a soluble coating.[34] Wong et al. evaluated press-fit implants in trabecular bone sites in the mini-pig model over 12 weeks and characterized a near linear increase in mechanical strength of the interface as a function of increasing roughness.[60] The role of the roughened surface is complex since the actual strength of bone contact against the titanium oxide surface is quite low (4 MPa or less); weak enough that without the surface topography (e.g., electropolished surfaces) little bone contact occurs.[36] Clinically, the combination of large grit blasted and etched surfaces (ITI/Straumann SLA surface) in a one-stage surgical procedure has documented greater than 10-year cumulative survival rates of 96.2 per cent (30.5 per cent being in the maxilla).[61] A further modification of the SLA grit blasted and dual acid etched surface has recently been described.[62] In this procedure, the same surface roughening process occurs but there is a nitrogen atmosphere used to control the rate and formation of the oxide surface by attempting to reduce hydrocarbon contamination of the implant surface. In a laboratory study, Misaski et al. showed that human mesenchymal stems cells grown on this surface increased expression of type I collagen and specifically increased the expression of alkaline phosphatase, a key enzyme involved in the control of biomineralization at the implant surface.[63]


An alternative commercially surface etched implant design uses a combination of  $\mathrm{HCL / H_2SO_4}$  to create a surface topography (OsseotiteTM, 3i Implant innovations/BioMet Company, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, USA). This alternative roughened surface appears to have enhanced biomechanical strength in animal studies.64 This surface technology has recently been modified with the addition of a thin layer of a calcium phosphate "solution-based" precipitation that is purported to accelerate bone healing. The coating has a high crystalline content which may affect the ability of the surface to biologically interact with the wound healing stages. As of this review, there was little published information on this surface or its biological properties.


Various titanium surfaces have utilized surface roughness created either through a grit blasting and etching procedure or blasting of the surface alone by using tightly controlled conditions in order to obtain a predefined optimal surface topography. One such optimization criteria has been proposed.[65,66] This criteria suggests that an implant surface has an optimal balance between pore size on the surface (pore sizes of  $1 - 5\mu \mathrm{m}$  diameter and  $1 - 5\mu \mathrm{m}$  in depth) which optimizes the shear strength of the individual bone ingrowth into anyone pit with the need to have as many "pits" on the surface as possible.[19,33] This theoretical model relates the relative shear strength of bone ( $\tau_{\mathrm{s}}$ ) with a topography of interfacial load carrying capacity for a surface topographic feature ("pit effectivity factor") combined with a value for the optimal number of pit per unit area of the surface ("pit density factor").[19] Using this optimization scheme a theoretically optimal surface was used to help design a commercial implant system (Astra Tech AB TiO blastTM).[67] These topographic features are then combined with macroscopic implant thread profiles (pitch, angle and position) to provide a high compressive loading (low shear) implant interface.[19]

Since the grit blasted moderately rough surface was developed, a further modification of the titanium dioxide grit blasted surface was performed. In this modification, following grit blasting, the surface is then exposed to a mild hydrofluoric acid etching process with the goal of creating a surface pitting on the blasted surface. In effect, this process is attempting to maintain the macroroughness created by the blasting process for primary implant stability followed by the surface etching to influence the secondary osseointegration process (the process of wound healing following implant placement). Masaki et al. and Isa et al. used a human mesenchymal cell culture model and demonstrated that there was a rapid increase in expression of key genes involved in the differentiation of bone that was unique to the fluoride modified and etched titanium surface that was not evident on blasted surface alone or a comparison group of large grit and dual acid etched surfaces.[63,68] Using the same surfaces, Cooper et al. demonstrated that the fluoride modified titanium surfaces not only up-regulates bone cell differentiation but also increases expression of bone adhesion and biomineralization related protein expression by measuring increased expression of bone sialoprotein, osteopontin and other bone-specific proteins critical to an accelerated bone adaptation to the implant surface.[69] This moderately rough implant surface is currently marketed (OsseoSpeed™, Astra Tech AB, Mondal, Sweden). Clinical trials to date have indicated that it can be safely used in early or immediate loading protocols even in sinus lifted maxillary posterior jaw sites.[70-72]


Given the discussion on current implant surfaces where are current research efforts aimed? Currently there are two main, but inter-related approaches being evaluated. The goal with both is to improve the adaptation of bone in sites primarily composed of trabecular bone. These sites are commonly in the posterior maxilla but also found in many other regions of the body and thus the technologies are of interest for orthopaedic applications. The two approaches involve either the addition of biological mediators to the implant surface (e.g., cell adhesion or bioactive peptides, growth factors, etc.) or creation of reproducible nanoscale surface features.

The area of addition of bioactive peptides has a long and rich history with strategies to covalently add either cell adhesion peptides or growth factors to the implant surface and thus use the implant as a local drug delivery device. The manner in which the fibrin scaffold is manipulated is one key to the future of implant surface technology. Approaches to modifying the titanium oxide surface utilize placement of various configurations of the commonly known recognition peptide sequences for integrins cell membrane associated matrix binding receptors (a tripeptide sequence of Arg-Gly-Asp or "RGD") on the surface of an implant surface. This RGD sequence mediates cell adhesion and is present in a number of extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., fibrin, collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein). Obviously, many mesenchymal cells possess integrin receptors and thus the adhesion to an RGD-coated surface may be rather non-specific but a number of groups are attempting to regulate the type of cell adhesion that occurs by modulating the sequence of proteins in the linker region (the region of protein attaching the RGD sequence to the metal substrate), as well as exploring various means to attach adhesion sequences (e.g., repeated regions of RGD sequence) through covalent attachment to the surface of the implant.[73-86] Work has focused on determining the optimal density of RGD adhesion peptides on an experimental implant surface to elicit osteoblast growth and differentiation.[78]

Osteoblastic cells interact both with the matrix, through the RGD dependent pathways, but also to the surface contours of the surface. This property of "contact guidance" is an important part of understanding the behaviour of how pre-osteoblasts interact with the complex fibrin/platelet scaffold. There are a number of elegant in vitro and in vivo studies which document the importance of not just the roughness of an implant surface but the effect of the direction of the pattern (or epitaxis).[87-90] These studies demonstrate that fibroblasts and osteoblasts are capable of recognizing repeated surface features (e.g., lines, grooves and other repeated defects created in milling). Cells appear to align and grow in a directional pattern directed by the surface features of the substratum.[91] Highly repeated, nanoscale surface features are capable of being formed with inexpensive photolithographic approaches. These repeating surface features are capable of combining properties of surface chemistry (e.g., surface energy) with biological attachment of adhesion/matrix peptides.[91,92] Similar photolithographic approaches have been used to create repeated patterns to generate controlled alternating domains of N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (EDS) and dimethyldichlorosilane (DMS) as a means to control the adsorption of naturally occurring RGD adhesive proteins in serum (especially vitronectin).[80,82] In this way, a bioactive surface may be generated that uses the natural adhesive proteins in the blood plasma at the time of implant placement. Obviously, there are still multiple issues of bioavailability and biological stability of these peptides that are being worked out but promise holds with such techniques.


The other direction for manipulating biological responses is to create topographical surface features at the nanoscale level on the titanium oxide surface. Relevant nanometer  $(10^{-9}\mathrm{m})$  scale features typically means in the range of  $1 - 100\mathrm{nm}$  in dimension. The interest in this area of research is that the conventional Newtonian properties of materials are very different for a nanomaterial (e.g., increased number of atoms at the surface, surface grain boundaries, enhanced surface energy and surface area, electron delocalization, etc.).[93] The implications of these features are immense. At the nanoscale level molecular interactions with the surface can be targeted to create specific cell level responses. For instance, work done with nanophase ceramics demonstrated a very tight and specific increase in osteoblast cell adhesion, differentiation and matrix expression when the surface had a reproducible  $60~\mathrm{nm}$  grain size or less.[94] If the grain size is  $70~\mathrm{nm}$  or greater the specific biological effects were lost. Further studies suggested this effect may be related to protein orientation to the nanophase structures and specifically the mode of orientation of adhesion proteins such as vitronectin to the grain boundaries which in turn alters osteoblast adhesion and shape; both critical to formation of bone.[40,93,95-98] It is interesting to note that the surface pitting on the dental implant surface that was blasted and mildly etched with hydrofluoric acid (OsseoSpeedTM, Astra Tech AB) demonstrated similar nanopots of average dimension of  $60~\mathrm{nm}$  described by Masaki et al. and Isa et al. This may be one reason for the observed enhanced osteoblastic cell differentiation on these surfaces.[63,68]

# CONCLUSIONS

Tooth replacement therapy using dental implant technology has made rapid progressions over the past 25 years. We have gone from a minimally rough, turned titanium surface to a range of currently available moderately roughened surfaces that provide a predictable mode of therapy. Ongoing developments in the area of surface technology are aimed to enhance tissue/surface interactions which may allow the development of smaller or custom devices that can provide anchorage and support for a variety of applications such as surgical microplates, very short implants  $(< 5\mathrm{mm}$  length) or enhanced orthopaedic devices. All of these ongoing developments have a central goal of enhancing patient care.

Patients come to us with a complex array of wants, needs and desires. The ability to provide a predictable life-restoring service, such as dental implant therapy is an enormous advancement for dentistry, an advancement that has really only been accepted in our generation. The work of health care pioneers such as Professors' Branemark, Steinmann and Albrektsson and others has led to the ability to offer a form of tooth replacement therapy that is minimally invasive and rather predictable. This only occurred through insightful assessment, demand and rigorous clinical assessment of outcomes before marketing to the dental community. This is an enormous legacy and responsibility for the current and future generation of clinicians and dental educators. As our implant therapy continues to evolve we must continue to demand that the innovations are grounded in science, rigorously tested and clinically evaluated before being marketed. At the end of the day, we owe it to our patients and the reputation of our profession to demand from manufacturer's reliability, stability and predictability in providing tooth replacement therapy for our patients.
