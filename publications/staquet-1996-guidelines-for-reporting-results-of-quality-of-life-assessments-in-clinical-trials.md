Clinical trials involving quality of life measurement published in the literature suffer from important weaknesses due to the lack of information on numerous topics. The psychometric properties of the instruments are often lacking as well as data on the number of patients treated and analyzed. The handling of missing data is rarely documented. In order to facilitate the reporting of trials and the evaluation of published results, this article proposes a set of general guidelines for the reporting of clinical trials which include a quality of life assessment. A checklist designed to assist authors is appended.

Key words: Clinical trials; guidelines; health-related quality of life; quality of life; reporting.

# Introduction

In recent years, the number of clinical trials incorporating measurement of health-related quality of life has substantially increased. However, due to the unfamiliarity of clinical researchers, editors of medical journals and regulatory agencies with a field which has been until recently concentrated in the social sciences, several aspects of publications relating to quality of life assessment in clinical trials need to be improved.

Important methodological issues related to the conduct and reporting of quality of life (QOL) studies have been published. These papers show that weaknesses of the published reports of QOL clinical trials have been the lack of information on specific items such as the psychometric properties of the instruments and the handling of missing data—especially through patient attrition. Some of these deficiencies could have been corrected by more rigorous reporting.


The purpose of this article is to suggest general guidelines for the reporting of clinical trials which include a quality of life measurement. These proposals are intended for researchers reporting a new study as well as for those who are asked to critically evaluate the published reports. The guidelines are general in nature and, therefore, constitute a minimal set. More specific details may need to be added for particular diseases and types of treatments.

The authors realise that these guidelines are unlikely to be perfect or comprehensive and recognize that they may be improved upon with greater experience. Readers are invited to direct correspondence to any of the authors so that better guidelines will evolve over time.

A QOL specific checklist designed to assist authors is provided as an appendix. In addition, more general checklists $^{10-13}$  which are applicable to various types of clinical trials could be relevant.

# Title and authors

The title must be concise and informative. Authors and their current primary affiliations should be referenced in conformity with the journal style. Appropriate keywords (such as the ones listed in the Index Medicus or in the Psychological Abstracts) should be given for indexing purpose. The sponsor(s) of the research, if any, are to be disclosed as a footnote either here or at the end of the article.

# Abstract

The abstract should present the purpose of the trial, the methods, the instruments used, the key results and the essential conclusions.

# Introduction

The objective of the trial needs to be stated in detail and its rationale must be supported with a comprehensive review of the literature relevant to the disease or the treatment of interest. Selective references supporting each statement should be provided.

The natural history of the disease and its treatment should be succinctly described so that it is clear why QOL is being assessed.

The pre-trial hypotheses for QOL assessment must be briefly stated including which domains or scales were expected to show a difference between treatment arms. It must be disclosed here if the QOL trial reported is part of other research (e.g. a pilot study or a therapeutic trial).

# Materials and methods

Population and sample. A description of the patient population, including the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, is mandatory.

The population sample must be described with appropriate demographic data for example age, gender, ethnicity depending on the context. Other variables, such as the clinical and mental status, if they are likely to alter the ability of the patient to answer a questionnaire, should also be included.

It is important to indicate how and from where the patients were recruited to the trial. For instance: indicate if the sample was random or one of convenience, the number of centres involved and whether informed consent was obtained. If a subset of the total sample size is deemed to be sufficient for the QOL part of the trial, the method used to select the patients in the subset must be explained.

QOL instrument selection. The justification for the selection of a health profile (descriptive) or a patient preference (utility) approach for the QOL assessment as well as of a particular questionnaire should be given.

If the QOL instrument(s) is not well known or new, it must be described in detail and the psychometric properties (floor effects, ceiling effects, reliability, validity and responsiveness to change) should be summarized with references. The rationale for creating a new instrument and the method by which the items were created is indispensable.


For specific instruments, an indication as to whether or not the psychometric properties were established in the same type of population as the trial subjects is essential.

The time frame over which the subject has to assess their responses to the items of the questionnaire (e.g. yesterday, past week or during the previous cycle of chemotherapy) needs to be indicated. If this varies from question to question, the details must be provided.

The method by which the instrument was administered (self-report, face-to-face interview, interviewer-supervised, telephone, proxy, other) must be supplied. It is important to give details of how the responses are scored, preferably by reference to a published scoring manual or other available source document. Any departure from such procedure should be detailed and justified. Information on how to interpret the scores is necessary (e.g. do higher scores indicate better or worse functioning or symptoms).

If appropriate, information on the process by which the measure was adapted for cross-cultural administration is to be given. Sources relevant to the development and format of the QOL instrument(s) chosen should be included in the references.

When an instrument (or item or scale) is being used in a new population or disease from that in which it was originally developed, the psychometric properties of the instrument in the new context must be reported.

Trial size. If a comparative trial is reported, the effect size planned to detect a difference between the arms of the trial is to be stated. An estimate of the required sample size for each arm calculated on the basis of the endpoints of the trial should be provided. The alpha error (test size) and power are to be given. Specifically, the use of a one-sided test needs to be justified.

Endpoints. The dimension(s) or the item(s) of the instrument which were selected as endpoint(s) before subject accrual need to be stated. Endpoints not chosen before the start of the trial are to be avoided. When QOL is not the primary endpoint, the major endpoints of the trial should be provided.

Timing of study assessment. The timing (schedule) of the QOL assessment in relation to trial onset and the treatments including the scheduled times of instru

# M. Staquet et al.

ment completion (e.g. every day, every month) must be given. The timing of the follow-up assessment should be specified: for instance, at the completion of treatment or discontinuation of treatment, every 3 months, at the end of the trial.

Data. The means by which the data will be collected and the procedure for evaluating their quality should be described. The criteria for what is to be considered adequate/inadequate data must be specified a priori. Definitions of the missing data are to be given (see below).

Method of analysis. Ideally, only the QOL endpoints defined before the trial commences should be used for the formal analysis. For these alone, confidence intervals and  $p$ -values must be quoted. Other variables should be utilized for descriptive purpose only and can be used for generating hypothesis for testing in later studies.

The method(s) by which missing data were defined and analyzed must be clearly stated. It is important to specify how the patients who died before reaching the endpoint were dealt with in the analysis.

The statistical methods of analysis must be described in sufficient detail so that other researchers could repeat the analysis if the full data were made available. When appropriate, the assumptions about the distribution of the data should be indicated. One must also indicate whether the analysis is by 'intention to treat' or otherwise. In case of multiple comparisons, attention must be paid to the total number of comparisons, to the adjustment, if any, of the significance level and to the interpretation of the results. If applicable, the definition of a clinically important difference is to be given.

The authors should indicate if they are willing to make their data available to other researchers for the purpose of re-analysis or meta-analysis (give address, phone, fax and email of the author responsible for providing the data).

# Results

Presentation of data. The results of planned primary and secondary analyses should be presented along with the results of appropriate tests of clinical and statistical significance, e.g.  $p$ -value, effect size and other relevant parameters.

The authors must report on all scales from all the instruments that were used in the study. In particular, authors should not pick and chose which scales to report from an instrument post hoc without indicating very clearly why this has been done. QOL data should include all time periods during which data were collected, as well as adequate information characterizing the distribution of data using typical statistics such as means, medians, standard deviations and ranges.


When appropriate, a description of the distribution of enrolment time and the median follow-up time is helpful.

Patient data. All patients entered in the trial must be accounted for and their characteristics presented, e.g. how many centres were involved, how many eligible patients were approached, how many were accrued, how many refused to participate, how many were unable to complete the questionnaires.

By and large, number of patients are needed separately in each arm of the trial for the patients in the following categories:

- eligible and entered  
excluded from the analysis with inadequate data with missing data adequately followed lost to follow-up  
- died during the trial  
adequately treated according to protocol  
- failed to complete the treatment according to protocol  
received treatments not specified in the protocol

Scheduling of instrument administration. Descriptive information that contributes to an understanding of treatment schedules, patient compliance, time windows, median follow-up times and other practical aspects of QOL data collection and follow-up are required. A table to provide the information by treatment group is desirable (see Table 1 for example).

# Missing data and compliance.

It is imperative to document the causes of all missing data. Several types of missing data are possible and should be identified and documented separately in the publication: (1) missing data due to non-completion of the questionnaire resulting from the death of the patient; (2) missing data due to non-completion of the questionnaire for reasons other than death; and (3) missing data due to non-response to items

in the questionnaire.

It should be specified what missing data are due to informative (non-random) censoring (i.e. missing data due to the patient's health state or to his particular treatment) or to non-informative (random) censoring.

Compliance with completion of the questionnaires can be defined as the percentage of completed forms received by the investigator from the number anticipated by the study design, taking due account of factors which would make completion impossible such as the death of the patient.

A comparison between the percentages of missing data by item in the questionnaire (focusing on the major endpoints as specified in the protocol) and by treatment group should be made and commented upon.

# Statistical analysis

The main analysis should address the hypothesis identified in the introduction. Although it is recognized that there are often large numbers of items on a QOL questionnaire, the particular, and few, dimensions which were selected as design endpoint(s) are to be the most relevant part of the report. Analysis of other variables as well as any subgroup analysis not pre-specified must be reported only as 'exploratory' or tentative.

If appropriate, the reasons for not adhering to the pre-trial sample size must be discussed. In the case of a graphic presentation, it is important to specify the number at risk by treatment group beneath the time axis in the plot.

When 'survival' techniques are used for QOL data summary, the censoring mechanisms should be carefully documented. The number of interim analyses (planned or unplanned) and their results ought to be briefly summarized.


# Discussion and conclusions

These topics can be separated under different headings or combined. The interpretation of the results including any generalization must be discussed in detail. The findings should be discussed in the context of results of previous studies and research. Some particular issues in the interpretation of QOL data should be addressed here: (1) score improvement or deterioration irrespective of treatment; (2) the relative importance of the observed changes; (3) clinical meaning of the observed changes; and (4) how the results increase knowledge in the field.

A summary of the therapeutic results should be reported alongside the QOL results so that a balanced interpretation of the trial results can be made.

# References and bibliography

References should be given for all background material, the rationale and the discussion. The format of the references should conform to the journal style to which the manuscript is submitted.

The title of journals must be abbreviated according to the List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus published annually. Personal communications and unpublished data are to be avoided whenever possible.
