# INTRODUCTION

Zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures account for approximately  $25\%$  of all facial fractures and are commonly the result of industrial accidents, sports injuries, and interpersonal alterations. These injuries can result in both functional (trismus, diplopia, and paresthesias) and aesthetic deformities (malar flattening, midfacial widening, and globe malposition). Although there is a significant body of literature studying ZMC fractures, there remains no clear consensus on surgical approaches or the type and location of hardware application. This article reviews pertinent anatomy, diagnostic modalities, principles of surgical repair (including indications, surgical approaches, fixation techniques, and computer-aided applications to optimize surgical management) and presents a treatment algorithm for surgical decision making.

# ANATOMY

The ZMC occupies a prominent position in the facial skeleton. It provides height, width, and projection to the lateral face (Fig. 1). The ZMC has 4 attachments to the skull base: zygomaticofrontal, zygomaticosphenoidal, zygomaticomaxillary, and zygomaticotemporal (Fig. 2). For the purposes of discussion, the zygomaticomaxillary buttress is divided into 2 subregions: the inferior maxillary buttress and the superior orbital rim.

# FRACTURE PATTERNS

ZMC fractures typically involve all 4 buttresses; passing through the suture lines and the infraorbital foramen (Fig. 3). Multiple fracture classification schemes have been developed. $^{7-9}$  One of the more commonly used systems was described by
Fig. 1. (A) Horizontal buttresses of the facial skeleton; (B) vertical buttresses of the facial skeleton.

Zingg and colleagues $^{7}$  in 1992 (Fig. 4). Injuries were divided into 3 groups: type A — isolated injuries, type B — single-segment fractures, and type C — comminuted fractures. Unfortunately, classification systems are rarely applied in the clinical setting, because a physical description of the fracture is often more accurate and clinically relevant. They can, however, be useful for education and research applications.

# DIAGNOSIS

The initial assessment of facial trauma patients should include evaluation of critical structures: airway, hemodynamic stability, and cervical spine. Patients should receive a thorough history and physical examination.

# History

The history should include documentation of

- Level of consciousness: can the patient give an accurate account of the traumatic event?
- Injury type (high velocity vs low velocity): high-velocity injuries are much more likely to result in complex fracture patterns involving multiple areas of the facial skeleton.
- Mechanism of injury (blunt or penetrating): blunt injuries are often localized, whereas penetrating trauma is more likely to involve deeper neurovascular structures. These can be less apparent on physical examination.
- Past medical history: this includes previous facial injuries.

# Physical Examination

A complete head and neck examination should be performed with special attention given to

- Ophthalmologic examination: injury to the globe can result in profound long term morbidity. The eye examination should include visual acuity, pupillary response, extraocular muscle function, gross examination of

Classification and treatment of zygomatic fractures: a review of 1025 cases. J Oral Maxillofac Surg 1992;50(8):779; with permission.) the sclera and cornea, periorbital edema, and globe position. Ophthalmologic consultation should be considered for abnormal findings or high-velocity/penetrating injuries.


- Skeletal examination: complete examination and palpation of the facial skeleton should be performed with documentation of palpable step offs or malar flattening. This examination becomes more difficult with significant facial swelling. Associated fractures occur in approximately  $25\%$  of patients with ZMC fractures.[2]
- Dentoalveolar examination: although dentoalveolar injuries are not typical, the dentition and occlusion should be evaluated. Trismus secondary to impingement of the zygomatic arch onto the coronoid process can occur.
- Neurologic examination: ZMC fractures commonly involve the infraorbital foramina. Both infraorbital and facial nerve function should be documented.
- Soft tissue: abrasions/lacerations (particularly of the periorbital soft tissues) should be documented. Lateral canthal dystopia can be indicative of significant ZMC fractures.

# Radiography

- CT: CT is the gold standard for diagnosis of facial fractures. The sensitivity, specificity, and resolution are far superior to either plain or panorex radiographs.[10-12] Thin-cut (0.625-1.0 mm) axial CT with coronal, sagittal, and 3-D reconstructions should be obtained. Axial images are preferred for evaluation of the zygomaticosphenoidal, zygomaticotemporal, zygomaticomaxillary buttresses as well as the overall malar projection (Fig. 5); sagittal images demonstrate orbital floor fractures (Fig. 6); and coronal images show the zygomaticofrontal buttress and orbital components of the injury (Fig. 7). 3-D reconstructions can provide an overall perspective on the injury that can be difficult to conceptualize using 2-D views alone. They can also delineate the number and location of comminuted bone fragments, potentially reducing the extent of surgical dissection. The 3-D images are also extremely helpful for patient education (Fig. 8).
- Fracture patterns: The authors find it helpful to group these injuries into 2 major groups

- low-velocity injuries and high-velocity injuries.
Low-velocity injuries: low-velocity fractures are typically rotated clockwise or counterclockwise when viewed on axial CT. An anterior force results in clockwise rotation (Fig. 9), whereas a lateral force results in a counterclockwise rotation (Fig. 10). The key feature of low-velocity injuries is that there is generally a single bone fragment with minimal soft tissue disruption, requiring a less aggressive surgical approach.
High-velocity injuries: high-velocity injuries result in complex fracture patterns with more extensive soft tissue injury, often requiring multiple surgical approaches.

Radiologic findings that are suggestive of high-velocity injuries include

Comminution of the ZMC - particularly through the central body (see Fig. 4C; Fig. 11)
Significant disruption and collapse of the zygomaticosphenoidal buttress (Fig. 12)
Lateral displacement of the zygomatic arch (Fig. 13)

# PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL REPAIR Indications

There are 2 primary indications for surgical repair of ZMC fractures - aesthetic deformity and functional impairment.

# Aesthetic deformity

Nondisplaced fractures are usually stable and do not require surgical repair. Displaced fractures often require surgical repair to avoid an aesthetic deformity. Factors that may influence this decision include degree of fracture displacement and thickness of soft tissue envelope as well as patient age and underlying health. A young patient, in good health, with thin skin may desire surgery for even a mildly displaced fracture

whereas an elderly patient, in poor health, with thick skin, may decide against any intervention for even a moderately displaced injury. The decision for surgery must be made on an individual basis, combining the surgeon's assessment of risk for deformity and the patient's level of the concern about the risk of long-term facial asymmetry.

# Functional impairment

Depression of the zygomatic arch can result in impingement on the coronoid process and trismus. Orbital involvement can result in diplopia and globe malposition. Management of orbital injuries is addressed in Scott E Bevans and Kris. S. Moe's article, "Advances in the Reconstruction of Orbital Fractures," in this issue.

# Computer-Aided Applications

# Presurgical planning

Despite advances in surgical technique, surgeons still struggle with accurate fracture reduction, particularly in complex ZMC injuries. Computer-aided design and manufacturing software can assist surgeons with virtual presurgical planning and visualization. Common planning techniques include segmentation of bone from soft tissue, isolation of specific bone segments from the facial skeleton, mirroring of uninjured skeletal segments to the contralateral side of injury for virtual surgical repair, and insertion of normative CT data to assist with a virtual repair of bilateral injuries.[13,14]

# Intraoperative navigation

Facial incisions used in maxillofacial reconstruction are often far from the site of injury, limiting the surgeon's 3-D perspective on the anatomy. Although surgical navigation systems were developed to assist with delineation of anatomic landmarks during neurosurgical and rhinologic procedures, the technique is equally effective for use in maxillofacial reconstruction. Navigation allows the surgeon to confirm pertinent anatomic landmarks without clear visualization, improving the accuracy of reduction.[13-15]

# Intraoperative imaging

Visualization of the entire ZMC is not possible using a single surgical approach. Consequently,
Fig. 12. High-velocity right ZMC fracture showing comminution and depression of the zygomaticosphe-noidal buttress (arrow).

ZMC fracture reduction must be inferred from looking at individual buttresses, without complete visualization. Although intraoperative imaging is used primarily in orthopedic surgery, it is equally effective in maxillofacial reconstruction. It provides a real-time assessment of fracture reduction that is not possible with direct visualization, thus allowing for intraoperative correction of bony malreduction or implant malpositioning. $^{16-20}$  Average intraoperative revision rates for maxillofacial reconstructive procedures with the use of intraoperative imaging is approximately  $22\%$  (range  $14\%-28\%$ ). $^{18-21}$  Disadvantages of intraoperative imaging include cost, radiation exposure, and increased operative times. Although technical advances continue to minimize these issues, they still limit access and utility in maxillofacial reconstruction.

- Cost: at the time of publication, intraoperative imaging devices range from approximately $250,000 to $900,000.
- Operative time: historically intraoperative CT scanners were cumbersome and time consuming to use. Current portable imaging devices are much more efficient, with 1-minute to 2-minute scan times and rapid

processing algorithms. Intraoperative imaging has been shown to add approximately 15 minutes per case.[19] In the authors' experience, factors that have the greatest influence on operative time include surgeon planning (bed, room, instrumentation set-up, and so forth) and support staff experience (ie, expertise using the imaging device).

- Radiation: there is a growing body of literature evaluating the potential risk of medical radiation exposure.[22] Although the literature is not clear on increase in lifetime risk for adults, a more conservative approach is likely indicated in children.[23,24] Current portable imaging devices offer a significant reduction in radiation exposure, while continuing to provide good image quality (Fig. 14). These devices can be divided into 2 different modalities: traditional axial CT (fan beam CT) and digital volume tomography (cone beam CT).[16]

O Axial CT (fan beam CT): these devices use a collimator to generate a fan-shaped beam, passing through the patient, and recorded as axial slices on image detectors (ie, 32-slice, 64-slice, and 128-slice scanners) (Fig. 15). These 2-D slices can be viewed individually or reformatted to generate sagittal, coronal, and 3-D reconstructions.

- Digital volume tomography (cone beam CT): these devices emit a cone-shaped x-ray beam that is recorded as a 3-D volume on an image intensifier (Fig. 16). This volume can then be sliced into 2-D images in virtually any plane.

A comparison of the 2 modalities reveals that fan beam CT provides the greatest image resolution (ie, good visualization of both soft tissue and bone), whereas cone beam CT offers a significant reduction in radiation exposure but has poor soft tissue resolution. In summary, presurgical planning software, intraoperative navigation, and intraoperative imaging are powerful resources for maxillofacial reconstruction. Presurgical planning allows surgeons to plan the procedure in a virtual environment, intraoperative navigation confirms execution of the plan, and intraoperative imaging verifies that the plan has been achieved (Fig. 17).


# Closed Versus Open Reduction

Fracture reduction can be achieved through both closed and open surgical approaches.

Lower-velocity injuries may be amenable to closed reduction (without fixation) via limited incisions. Intraoperative imaging has expanded the indications for closed repair by confirming the accuracy of reduction without the need for direct visualization. In this scenario, there is an initial attempt at closed reduction followed by confirmation with intraoperative imaging. Open reduction is only required when a closed reduction cannot be achieved or is unstable. High-velocity injuries are more likely to require open reduction and internal fixation. Computer-aided applications, including presurgical planning, intraoperative navigation, and intraoperative imaging, can be helpful to optimize the surgical repair.

# Buttress-Based Approach

Historically, surgeons have focused the number and location of buttresses that should be repaired for optimal ZMC fracture stability.[25-31] Although hardware can be applied to the zygomaticosphenoidal suture line, the remaining 3 ZMC buttresses are most commonly used for fracture stabilization (Fig. 18). The need for 1-point, 2-point, 3-point, or 4-point fixation should be based on fracture stability; applying the minimum amount of hardware to maintain fracture reduction throughout the process of healing. This approach has been termed, functionally stable fixation.

# Incision-Based Approach

More recent thinking emphasizes an incision based approach for management of ZMC fractures.32 The surgeon selects the minimum number incisions with the least iatrogenic morbidity, while still offering adequate access for optimal reduction and fixation. Of the 4 facial incisions commonly used for treatment of ZMC fractures, the least morbid is the sublabial, followed by the lateral blepharoplasty, lower eyelid, and finally the coronal incision (Fig. 19). With this approach, the surgeon often starts with the sublabial incision and adds additional incisions only when required for fracture reduction or stabilization.
Fig. 19. Illustration of typical incisions used for access to ZMC fractures. An incision based approach uses the least morbid incision first; moving up to more invasive approaches as necessary. Incision morbidity: sublabial (green)  $<$  lateral blepharoplasty (yellow)  $<$  lower eyelid (blue)  $<$  coronal (red).

# Closed Repair

Patients with simple, low-velocity injuries are good candidates for closed reduction. Fracture types include zygomatic arch and single-piece ZMC fractures (see Fig. 4, type A1 and type B). After closed reduction, intraoperative imaging can be used to confirm the accuracy of repair. Surgical approaches to these injuries include

- Temporal: a 2-cm incision is placed in the scalp of the temporal region approximately 4 cm above the zygomatic arch. The temporalis muscle fascia is exposed (Fig. 20). A Boise or Rowe elevator is used to dissect in a subfascial plane beneath the arch (Fig. 21). Lateral force is applied to and reduce the fracture. No pressure should be applied to the skull.

- Sublabial: a 2-cm sublabial incision is placed just above the mucogingival junction, eliminating the risk of alopecia, which can occur with the temporal approach. A subperiosteal dissection is performed, elevating deep to the zygomatic arch. A Boise or Rowe elevator is inserted under the arch to reduce the fracture, as described previously (see temporal approach) (Fig. 22).

- Percutaneous: a stab incision is placed in the cheek skin. A bone hook can be placed beneath the malar prominence, $^{33-35}$  or Carroll-Girard screw (Fig. 23) inserted directly into the zygoma. $^{3,36}$  The mobile bone segment is then reduced

# Open Repair

# Zygomaticomaxillary buttress

- Sublabial incision (inferior maxillary buttress): a 4-cm to 5-cm incision is placed just above the mucogingival junction, extending from approximately the lateral incisor to first molar, avoiding injury to the parotid duct (see Figs. 2 and 19). The dissection continues in a subperiosteal plane exposing the face of the maxilla. Superior dissection delineates the infraorbital nerve and often provides visualization of the inferior orbital rim. This incision is well hidden, provides excellent visualization, has minimal

morbidity, and provides access the buttress with the greatest biomechanical advantage for maintenance of reduction.3,25,27,37 Therefore, the sublabial incision is often the first choice for surgical exposure. Although comminution can occur at this buttress, accurate alignment can generally be achieved with a single miniplate (Fig. 24). Microplate application along the inferior orbital rim is possible in some patients depending on individual anatomy.

- Eyelid incision: there are 4 common surgical approaches to the inferior orbital rim: (1) transcutaneous subciliary, (2) transcutaneous subtarsal, (3) transconjunctival preseptal, and (4) transconjunctival postseptal. These approaches are described in greater detail in Scott E Bevans and Kris. S. Moe's article, "Advances in the Reconstruction of Orbital Fractures," in this issue. Fractures of the orbital rim are often comminuted. Careful reduction and application of a microplate will restore facial width and help with orbital floor alignment (Fig. 25). The orbital rim, however, provides only mild structural integrity.

# Zygomaticofrontal buttress

- Lateral upper-lid blepharoplasty incision: the lateral upper-lid blepharoplasty incision is the best choice for access to the zygomatico-frontal buttress (see Figs. 2 and 19). Unlike the eyebrow incision, which can result in alopecia and a prominent scar, this incision provides good exposure with minimal scarring risk. An approximately 2-cm skin incision is placed along a natural skin crease on the outer third of the upper eyelid, at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  to  $12\mathrm{mm}$  above the lid margin. The incision is carried

Traction on the forehead skin then elevates the upper lid until the skin incision lies over the zygomaticofrontal buttress. A needle-point electrocautery on a low setting is then used to dissect through the underlying soft tissue and periosteum. For more complex injuries where a coronal incision is required, this buttress can be accessed via the coronal approach (see coronal incision, discussed later). The zygomaticofrontal buttress is a primary landmark for ZMC reduction. Comminution rarely occurs at this location. Because this is a narrow buttress, fracture reduction restores ZMC width and height but gives little information about fracture rotation. The overlying skin is relatively thick and a 4-hole to 5-hole miniplate can be used for fracture fixation. The initial screw is partially inserted into the frontal process of the zygoma (inferior to the fracture on the mobile bone segment). Upward force is then applied to reduce the fracture while the superior screw is inserted on stable bone at the skull base (Fig. 26). The initial screw insertion is then completed. This

2-screw configuration allows for some mobility while reducing and fixating the other buttresses. After the other buttresses have been plated, the final 2 screws are placed at the periphery of the frontozygomatic buttress plate.

# Zygomaticosphenoidal buttress

- Lateral upper-lid blepharoplasty incision: The primary access to the zygomaticosphenoidal buttress is via the lateral upper-lid blepharoplasty incision (see zygomaticofrontal buttress discussed previously) (see Figs. 2 and 19). Once the lateral orbital rim is exposed, a periosteal elevator can be used to expose lateral orbital wall and zygomaticosphenoidal buttress. The zygomaticosphenoidal buttress is extremely stable; however, comminution can occur with high-velocity injuries. Reduction at this site restores ZMC projection, width, and rotation, making it one of the most reliable indicators of accurate fracture reduction (Figs. 27 and 28).[31,38,39] Internal fixation is challenging; however, placement of a 3-hole miniplate is possible with more aggressive surgical exposure. Plate

application at this site is more easily achieved through a coronal incision (see coronal incision, discussed later).

# Zygomaticotemporal buttress

- Coronal incision: The primary access for the zygomaticotemporal buttress is through coronal incision (see Figs. 2 and 19). It does, however, carry a greater risk of iatrogenic sequelae, such as alopecia, paresthesias, and facial nerve injury. Therefore, this approach is usually reserved for complex fractures requiring 4-point fixation. A coronal incision is marked out at least  $4\mathrm{cm}$  to  $6\mathrm{cm}$  behind the hairline. The hair can be banded and need not be shaved. The incision may be straight line or zig-zag. The zig-zag incision can assist with scar camouflage, taking advantage of inferior hair follicle alignment to cover the transverse arms of the scar. An intimate knowledge of the temporal anatomy is required to preserve the temporal branch of the facial nerve, minimize alopecia, and reduce the risk of temporal hollowing (Fig. 29). The lateral dissection continues

(A) The incision should be  $6\mathrm{cm}$  behind the hairline and expose the temporalis muscle facia, protecting the temporal branch of the facial nerve. (B) A transverse incision is placed through the temporalis muscle fascia,  $2\mathrm{cm}$  above the arch and the dissection is continued in a plane superficial to the temporal fat pad.

below the temporal line, leaving the temporalis muscle fascia intact to a level approximately 2 cm above the zygomatic arch. The fascia is then incised and the dissection continues toward the arch, just superficial to the temporal fat pad. This is a dense dissection plane that does not elevate easily. Once the zygomatic arch is exposed, the periosteum is incised on the superior border to protect the temporal branch of the facial nerve. The periosteum is carefully elevated to expose the zygomaticotemporal buttress. The buttress is thin and comminution is relatively common. Fracture reduction with a miniplate restores malar projection but gives little information about width or rotation. Miniplates can be used along the arch, and a single fixation screw can be placed to stabilize buttress fractures at the skull base (Fig. 30). After fracture repair, the closure is performed in layers, resuspending the temporal scalp to prevent long-term ptosis.

# Timing of Repair

Early repair of ZMC fractures offers the greatest opportunity for an accurate reduction. Scar tissue has not formed and bony fracture contours are readily visible. Unfortunately, facial edema often makes surgical visualization extremely difficult. In such cases, repair should be performed at 7-10 days after much of the edema has resolved but before significant bone healing has occurred. Fractures reduction in the subacute timeframe (2-6 weeks) can still be achieved, but anatomic landmarks are significantly less clear. Secondary fracture repair  $(>6$  weeks) can be extremely challenging with marked distortion of normal anatomic landmarks. The use of presurgical planning, intraoperative navigation, and intraoperative imaging is highly recommended.
