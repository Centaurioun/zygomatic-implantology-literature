SUMMARY Immediate loading of oral implants has become popular because of the increasing demands of a shortened treatment time. This literature review evaluates the prognosis of immediately loaded implants and their restorations with immediate or delayed implant placement. Special attention was given to the impact of type of jaw, bone quality, implant length, time of implant placement and type of restoration. An electronic (PubMed) and a manual search in relevant journals were conducted until February 2012. Only publications in English, in peer-reviewed journals, were considered. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria: five studies dealt with fixed restorations, two studies with removable rehabilitation of edentulous jaws and two studies dealt with partially edentulous patients. Implant survival rates ranged from  $95\cdot 8\%$  to  $100\%$ , implant success rates in the treatment for the mandible from  $79\%$  to  $100\%$  and restoration survival rates for both jaws from  $96\cdot 4\%$  to  $100\%$ . Within the limits of this review, appropriate patient selection, primary implant stability, splinting of implants and the expertise of surgeons seem to be important for the prognosis of immediately loaded implants and their restorations. Good bone quality and use of long implants appear to play a role. However, careful interpretation is required because conclusions are based on articles with low level of evidence. While immediate loading of oral implants in the mandible shows encouraging and predictable results, further multicenter randomised controlled clinical trials with sufficient statistical power are needed to examine (i) the outcome of immediately loaded implants in the maxilla and (ii) the outcome of immediate loading of immediately placed implants.

# Introduction

In prosthodontic rehabilitation of partially or totally edentulous patients with endosseous implants, the immediate implant placement and immediate loading protocol have become more and more popular because of the increasing demands of a shortened treatment time (1-6).

According to several consensus papers and articles, one can distinguish between immediate, early, delayed/conventional implant placement (7) and several definitions for the timing of implant loading (8-12).

Immediate implant placement is defined as the placement of an implant directly after tooth extraction as part of the same surgical procedure (7). Apart from the reduced number of surgical interventions and the shortened treatment time (13-15) as further advantages are considered to be the ideal positioning of implants in extraction sockets (15, 16), conservation of bony structures (17-19) and soft tissue aesthetics (15), and simplification of the prosthetic phase. This implicates a higher patient comfort and satisfaction (20) and thus a lessening of patients' reservations and increasing of their acceptance towards implant therapy (21-24). On the other hand, (present) socket infections (20, 25, 26), lack of bone apical to the socket (27), gaps between implant surface and socket walls (2), insufficient closure of the wound (2) and dimensional ridge alterations following tooth extraction (28) may adversely influence the outcome of immediate implant placement, therefore requiring careful patient selection (1).


Early implant placement is defined as implant placement after complete soft tissue coverage of the socket 4-8 weeks after extraction (7). While soft tissue coverage of the socket is considered advantageous, the increase in treatment time, advanced bone resorption and the necessity of adjunctive surgical procedures may be disadvantages of this approach (7).

The delayed/conventional implant placement protocol involves implant placement at least 3-4 months after extraction (7). Substantial bone fill of the socket or a clinically healed ridge and a healed soft tissue situation may facilitate the implant placement (7). However, patients are frequently faced with several surgical interventions (7) for bone or soft tissue augmentation, a significant long and uncomfortable healing time with suboptimal and inconvenient provisional prostheses before the placement of the definite restoration is possible (4, 10, 29-33).

The delivery of a prosthesis to the implants after an unloaded healing period of at least 3 months in the mandible and 6 months in the maxilla was defined as conventional loading (10). Immediate loading was defined as the placement of a restoration in occlusion within the first  $72\mathrm{h}$  following surgical implant placement at the Consensus Conference of the European Association for Osseointegration (EAO) (10). In contrast, the fixation of prostheses to implants within the first  $72\mathrm{h}$  without full occlusal contacts was defined as non-functional immediate or immediate restoration. In both cases, the risk of implant failure seems to be increased (34) because even minimal occlusal forces may cause micromovement of the implants during healing time (35), lead to soft tissue encapsulation around the implant and thus disturb the osseointegration process (4).

Immediately placed implants can be immediately loaded by means of fixed restorations, including single crowns, splinted crowns, fixed partial dentures or removable restorations, including overdentures retained with splinted anchoring attachment modalities such as bars.

Although immediate placement and/or loading of oral implants are frequently used procedures (3, 4, 7,

10, 36), qualitatively satisfying and sufficient long-term clinical evidence provided from randomised controlled clinical trials is lacking (2-4, 9-11, 33). In particular, the clinical outcome of the implant-supported restorations on immediately placed and/or loaded implants, which is the major concern of the patient, has not been extensively examined so far.

Therefore, the aim of this literature review was to evaluate the prognosis of immediately placed and/or loaded implants and their restorations and to find out whether there is a difference between immediate loading of immediately placed implants and delayed placed implants. Furthermore, success and survival rates of implants and restorations should be examined related to the aspects type of jaw, bone quality, implant length, time of implant placement and type of restoration.

# Materials and methods

# Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search through the online database PubMed (MEDLINE) including studies in the dental literature published from 1970 to February 2012 was executed. Only publications in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Following keywords and their combinations were used: dental implant, oral implant, endosseous implant, immediate implant placement, immediate placement, delayed implant placement, immediate loading, prosthetic rehabilitation, crown, fixed partial denture, overdenture, survival or success rate of implants or restorations. In addition, a supplementary manual search was carried out on high-yield journals. Subsequently, the reference lists of articles selected for inclusion in this review were screened.

# Inclusion criteria

Eligible for this review were clinical studies on humans with a minimum number of eight patients, a minimum number of 20 immediately/delayed placed and immediately loaded implants and a minimum observation period of 6 months and involving the following reconstructions: implant-retained or -supported prostheses in edentulous jaws and fixed partial dentures or crowns on implants in partially edentulous patients. Either prospective studies, retrospective studies, randomised controlled studies, controlled clinical trials as well as comparative studies reporting on success and survival rates of immediately or delayed placed and immediately loaded implants were included.


# Exclusion criteria

Excluded studies were in vitro studies, animal studies and case reports. In addition, studies reporting on implants other than screw- or cylindrical type, on early implant placement, early loading, conventional (late) loading and immediate restoration were not considered. Studies reporting on implants loaded and restored after an interval of 3 days  $(72\mathrm{h})$  were excluded (10).

# Study selection and data extraction

The obtained titles and abstracts of the electronic and manual search were screened and evaluated for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded from further evaluation. Upon identification of abstracts for possible inclusion, the full reports were obtained and assessed independently. Disagreements were resolved by an interreviewer discussion. At the same stage, the search was narrowed by excluding studies with inadequate data on the number of patients in the 'immediate loading group' and data reporting on combined survival rates of different prosthetic treatment options on implants. Inadequate data concerning the survival and/or success rates of the restorations, the number of implants inserted in extraction sockets or in healed areas, the implant length, bone quality and bone quality classification other than Lekholm and Zarb classification (37) were further criteria for exclusion. The Lekholm and Zarb classification divides bone quality into four types, expressed as type I, II, III and IV. Type I bone consists almost exclusively of homogeneous compact 'hard' bone. Type II bone is described as thick compact bone surrounding a highly trabecular core. Type III bone is composed of a thin cortical bone surrounding a highly trabecular core and type IV bone is considered a thin cortical bone surrounding a loose and spongy core (37).

Reports considered to fulfil all inclusion criteria were analysed and obtained data were included in a specially designed data extraction form (Table 2). Recorded variables were the author names, the year of publication, the study design, the number of patients, the type of jaw, the bone quality, the number of inserted implants, the length of the implants, the time of implant placement, the type of restoration (crows, fixed partial dentures, fixed dental prostheses and overdentures), the observation time of loaded implants and the survival and success rates of implants and their restorations.


For further evaluation of the results of the identified studies, success and survival rates of implants and restorations were examined in relation to the type of jaw, bone quality, implant length, time of implant placement and type of restoration.

# Results

The initial electronic and manual search resulted in 363 titles. In the following assessment of the titles and abstracts, 88 articles were selected for full-text analysis. Out of these, 79 studies were excluded for the following reasons:

1 No immediate occlusal loading (34, 38-53).  
2 Loading after more than 3 days (54-63).  
3 Less than 20 implants/immediate loading (44, 64, 65).  
4 Number of patients missing in the immediate loading group (66).  
5 No or inadequate information in terms of implant lengths (31, 67).  
6 No or inadequate information in terms of bone quality (64, 65, 68-78).  
7 No or inadequate information in terms of immediate or delayed implant placement (57, 79, 80).  
8 No or inadequate information in terms of success or survival rate of prosthetic restoration (22, 71, 73, 76, 81-109).  
9 Data in tables did not coincide with data reported in the text (21, 110, 111).

Finally, a total of nine publications (23, 24, 29, 30, 32, 112-115) fulfilled the inclusion criteria, comprising one randomised clinical trial (29), one prospective comparative study (32), six prospective (23, 24, 112-115) and one retrospective (30) study. The characteristics of the included studies are summarised in Tables 1 and 2.

# Time of implant placement

Main focus of seven articles (23, 24, 29, 32, 112, 113, 115) was to evaluate the clinical outcome of immediately loaded implants with delayed implant placement,

NR, not reported.

whereas two other articles (30, 114) reported on the clinical outcome of both immediately loaded implants with delayed and with immediate implant placement. Additionally, several studies dealt with the radiologic evaluation of the marginal bone stability around implants (23, 24, 30, 32, 113, 115) either by panoramic (32) or periapical radiographs (23, 24, 112-115) and/or the implant mobility (30, 114).

# Type of restoration

Apart from the implant outcome, all studies provided information on the performance of the implant-supported restorations. Five studies reported on restorations with full arch dental prostheses either in the edentulous mandible (23, 24, 113, 114) or in the edentulous maxilla (112), two studies evaluated the outcome of bar-retained removable overdentures in the edentulous mandible (30, 32) and the remaining articles reported on fixed partial dentures in the partially edentate mandible (115) or on single crowns on immediately loaded and flapless inserted implants in both jaws (29).

Apart from the variability of restoration types, all studies showed a noticeable variability in the reported bone quality, implant length and in their handling and data report.

# Type of jaw and bone quality

In five studies, implants were immediately loaded in the interforaminal area of the mandible (23, 30, 32, 113, 114). Three of these reported a type I, II or III bone quality (23, 30, 114), while another study only included patients with type I, II or III bone (32). In one study of this group – reporting bone quality on patient level – no difference between patients with type III and IV and patients with good bone quality (I and II) could be observed in clinical and radiological outcome (113). One study, reporting on 301 interforaminal implants in a type I, II or III bone and 24 implants distal to the mental foramen in a type IV bone, recorded the loss of altogether two implants, but without providing any information about circumjacent bone quality (24). In another study investigating fixed partial dentures in the mandible, four implants were lost, but not in type IV bone (115). In a further study on maxillary and mandibular single implants, patients with type IV bone were excluded (29). For implants placed in unfavourable bone quality, underpreparation of the sites was performed to achieve optimal primary stability with a minimum insertion torque of 30-40 (113, 115) or  $40 - 50\mathrm{Ncm}$  (29, 114). Otherwise, patients were treated conventionally (29). In the article conducting immediate loading in the maxilla, implants were placed  $1 - 2\mathrm{mm}$  below the level of the alveolar crest when poor bone quality was present (112). One of altogether three failed implants was lost in a type III bone, while two were lost in one patient with type IV. The latter being ascribed to heavy bruxing habits instead of bone quality (112).


# Implant length

The present review classified implant lengths in short  $(< 10\mathrm{mm})$  or long  $(\geq 10\mathrm{mm})$ . In most of the studies, implants longer or equal to  $10\mathrm{mm}$  (23, 24, 29, 30, 32, 114) were inserted. In two studies, a length of at least  $10\mathrm{mm}$  (112, 114) and in another two a length of at least  $13\mathrm{mm}$  were considered to be a criterion for immediate loading (32, 113). Interestingly, certain author groups placed implants as long as possible (10-20 mm) to achieve bicortical anchorage of the implants (29, 30, 32, 114). In only one study,  $7 - 8\cdot 5\mathrm{mm}$  short implants were utilised but no impact of the length on the clinical outcome was reported (115).

# Data report

Further variation between the studies concerning the report of implant/restoration success/survival could be found among the studies. Six articles employed life table analysis to demonstrate cumulative survival or success rates of the implants (23, 24, 30, 32, 112, 115). In several studies, restorations' survivals were reported very briefly (23, 30, 114) or just indirectly (24, 32, 113, 115). While all studies reported on survival rates of restorations, there was only one article (30) additionally providing success rates of prosthetic treatment. Moreover, only one study considered the patient as the statistical unit of its survival and success analyses (29).

Considering the implant survival rates of all studies together, the lowest survival rate of implants was  $95\cdot 8\%$  after 32 months (112) and the highest rate was  $100\%$  after 6-43 months (114). In one study, implant and restoration survival rates had to be recalculated (23) because only 28 of 50 patient cases were immediately loaded within the first  $72\mathrm{h}$  (Table 1). Five studies presented success rates of implants in the mandible (24, 30, 32, 113, 115) out of which the lowest rate was  $79\%$  after 36 months (113) and the highest rate was  $99\cdot 4\%$  after 12-60 months (24). In the identified literature, there was no data available regarding success rates of implants placed in the maxilla. Regarding the survival rates of prosthetic restorations, a  $96\cdot 4\%$  survival rate was reported in the recalculated study after a follow-up of 6 months (23), while seven other studies demonstrated higher rates up to  $100\%$  (23, 24, 29, 30, 32, 112-115) after various follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 156 months. The only study reporting on the success rates of prosthetic treatment recorded  $95\cdot 4\%$  success because three from nine bars had to be removed and six had to be modified, the overdenture still being in place (30). In two other articles, porcelain fractures of implant crowns, abutment loosening (29) or other prosthetic complications (29) such as fractures of acrylic denture teeth, fracture of an implant abutment or loosening of occlusal screws (112) were observed but success rates (29, 112) or even criteria for success (29) were not provided.


Between the designs of the included studies, further considerable differences could be detected in patient numbers, follow-up times, the type of used implant systems (form and surfaces), implant diameters, the number of placed implants, the areas of implant insertion, surgical treatment, patient selection (smokers/non-smokers; healing times after extraction, accepted bone quantity for immediate loading, opposing dentitions), the pre- and post-operative medication, prescription of post-operative diet and in occlusion concepts. Owing to such heterogeneity of the included studies, a statistical analysis of data could not be performed.

# Discussion

Several reviews have evaluated the practicability and outcome of immediate placement or immediate loading of oral implants (3, 6-9, 11, 33, 36, 116). However, the clinical outcome of the implant-supported restorations on immediately placed and/or loaded implants, which is the major concern of the patient, still is poorly documented. Therefore, the objective of this literature review was to investigate the prognosis of immediately loaded implants and their restorations with or without immediate implant placement. Furthermore, the influence of the type of jaw, the bone quality, the implant length, the time of implant placement and the type of restoration on the success and survival rates has been critically evaluated.


As far as the clinical outcome of the included studies of the present review is concerned, high implant survival rates (95·8–100%), high restoration survival rates (96·4–100%) and quite high implant success rates in the treatment for the lower jaw (79–100%) were generally observed, although the anatomic conditions, the implant lengths and the type of restorations, their timing and manufacturing techniques varied considerably. The comparable (23, 24, 30, 32, 112) or even slightly better (113) outcome of immediately loaded implants than conventional loaded implants indicate apparently that immediate loading of implants can be a viable alternative treatment to the delayed procedure (24, 112, 115) with the advantage of a significant decrease in treatment time and patient discomfort (29, 30, 32).

Even so, generalising such results to the daily work of a routine private practice should be performed with caution because all treatments have been conducted in institutional environments like universities or specialists' clinics (117). Another possible explanation for such positive results may be publication bias (118) meaning that studies with positive results are published in the literature while negative results are being retained.

The high implant and restoration survival rates in all included studies may also give the initial impression that outcome of immediate placement and loading procedures being independent from the type of jaw, bone quality, implant length and the treatment with different types of restorations. However, a more differentiated analysis revealed that immediate implant placement and loading indeed seem to be very individual treatment modalities, whose feasibility and outcome can be dependent on a variety of factors. Of these factors, an adequate primary implant stability (24, 29, 30, 32, 112-115) and/or the elimination of uncontrolled forces, respectively, the reduction or avoidance of micromotion at the implant-bone interface (23, 29, 30, 32, 112, 114, 115) were judged to be fundamental prerequisites to achieve and maintain implant osseointegration over time (34, 119).

# Type of jaw and bone quality

According to the included studies, primary stability itself is again depending on various biomechanical factors (113) determined by implant design (23, 24,

112-115), surgical technique (24, 29, 113-115) and bone properties such as bone quality (24, 29, 30, 32, 112-115) and/or bone quantity (113). For instance, the interforaminal region of the lower jaw was stressed to provide superior bone quality and therefore predictable results in correlation with immediate loading procedures (30, 32), whereas a frequently lower bone density in the maxilla was emphasised to be associated with higher implant failure rates (30). This also might be a reason why the majority of the included studies was found to be presenting data on the treatment for the mandible (23, 24, 30, 32, 113-115), especially of the interforaminal region (23, 30, 32, 113, 114). Only two studies could be included in this review performing immediate loading either in both jaws (29) or in the upper jaw alone (112). According to the latter study, immediate loading is potentially more hazardous in the maxilla than in the mandible and documentation and long-term follow-ups in the maxilla are lacking (112). However, in both studies, similar high survival rates for implants (98.2-100%) and restorations (100%) could be recorded (29). In the majority of the included studies, the general positive outcome was ascribed to various measures such as modified drilling protocols enhancing the local bone quality (24, 29, 113-115) and/or to primary stability-based patient inclusion criteria (29, 32) and others (Table 3). Bone quality was even considered to be an overestimated factor and the outcome of immediate loading as a matter of expertise of the surgeon (113).

Apparently, the factors type of jaw or bone quality can be overcome by modifying surgical procedures (Table 3) but even with experienced surgeons, there seems to be limits in achieving optimal bone conditions for immediate implant placement or loading. Hence, immediate loading was identified as high-risk treatment requiring experienced surgeons who should be able to identify questionable conditions and either exclude the patient from this treatment option (patient selection) (29, 32) or cautiously adapt this technique-sensitive treatment procedure according to the found circumstances (24, 113). This point of view was in accordance with other reviews (4, 5, 9, 11). For instance, in a Cochrane review, it was concluded that immediate loading could prove to be successful only in selected patients and not in every surgeon's hands (4). In addition, primary implant stability was described as one of the most important prerequisites for success (4-6, 9, 11, 116, 120). However, another review underscored

# Implant length

Regarding the aspect length of implants in two studies, long implants of  $13 - 15\mathrm{mm}$  were considered a decisive factor for immediate loading procedures (32, 113) and in several articles, bicortical anchorage of the implants was attempted whenever possible (29, 30, 32, 114). Unfortunately, no controlled studies were found using split mouth designs to compare the outcomes of different implant lengths and only one study provided any information reporting that no correlation could be found between implant dimensions and success rate, provided that bicortical stabilisation of the implants had been obtained (30). It was argued that four of 15 failed implants were  $11\mathrm{mm}$  long and did not engage lower mandibular cortex. However, these four failures occurred only in one patient and the authors concluded a further need of investigation of the critical length and diameter of immediately loaded implants (30). Moreover, four different implant systems were used in that study, but no relationship between failure rate and implant type could be found. Though, authors assessed this outcome to be of limited clinical significance because the implant systems used were not randomised, but implants generally chosen by the clinician's experience. In addition, the need of a further investigation of the correlation between implant surface design and success rates in the case of immediate loading was discussed (30). Other studies considered rough implant surfaces to provide better prognosis in comparison with turned or machined implant surfaces (113). On the other hand, they did not find a difference between tapered and cylindrical screw designs in clinical and radiological outcomes in soft bone (113). However, in one study, no statistically significant differences between turned and oxidised implants could be shown (115). Unfortunately, missing randomisation and the potential influence of various parameters (implant length, diameter, form and surface) in most of the articles and the matter of bicortical anchorage made it impossible to clearly compare and evaluate the outcome. This was in agreement with other reviews (10, 120, 121).


# Time of implant placement

With respect to the question, if there was a difference between immediate and delayed implant placement in extraction sockets in combination with immediate loading, two studies could be identified reporting on patient groups that were treated with and without immediate implant placement (30, 114). Unfortunately, the authors did not differentiate between implants being immediately placed or with delay after tooth extraction when presenting the treatment outcome, so that this aspect could not be evaluated in this review. However, in another review, immediate loading of immediately placed implants was shown to have higher failure rate, especially when minimally rough-surfaced implants were used (33).


# Type of restoration

Despite the use of different types of restorations, all studies reported highly positive results. Apart from achieving primary implant stability, its maintenance by splinting the inserted implants whenever possible and independent from the type of restoration was a general aim in most of the included studies (23, 29, 30, 32, 112, 114, 115). Even in the study with single implants, crowns of adjacent implants were splinted to avoid or reduce micromovements (29). Accordingly, splinting of implants may probably be considered the most important prosthetic measure to maintain primary stability (23, 29, 30, 32, 112, 114, 115). For example, in one study applying the 'all-on-four concept' (60) with immediate splinting of two axial and two tilted implants in the interforaminal area, all four implants were immediately loaded with a fixed full arch dental prosthesis even if one of the tilted implants did not achieve the required primary stability (114).

The evaluation of the influence of the type of restoration on treatment outcome was difficult because the baseline of starting to record the restoration outcome after implant insertion varied enormously because of unequal delivery dates of the definite prostheses. In three studies, patients were treated immediately with definite prostheses (23, 30, 32) whereupon in several others, a provisional prosthesis usually was the immediate denture for duration of 1-3 (29, 113, 115), 4-6 (24, 114) or 8-22 months (112) after implant placement. These provisionals were mainly screw-retained provisional fixed partial dentures with (113, 115) or without cantilevers (112), either with metal (24), glass fibre (113) or without any reinforcement (112, 114). In some studies, even fractures of the provisionals and/or of occlusal screws (112) or loosening of prosthetic screws (115) were reported. The question of baseline setting may also play a role in the radiographic evaluation of peri-implant bone level measurement. The study with the worst implant success rate  $(79\%)$  because of high loss of the marginal bone level indicated that measurements before and after initial bone remodelling after implant placement can differ enormously and influence the outcome (113).


# Potential impact of other criteria

A further conspicuous observation in all studies reporting implant loss was the high amount of implant failures occurring in the first months up to 1 year after implant placement and immediate loading (23, 24, 30, 32, 112, 115). Bruxism (112, 115), overtightening of implants in the alveolar bone (115) and excessive heat generation during drilling the implant site (23) were discussed to be possible reasons. Because of the everlasting risk of implant failures, it was suggested to use more than three implants (23) to guarantee the salvaging of the prosthesis in case of a failure of one implant (24), being in good accordance with one review (121).

# Comparison and level of evidence

Comparing the outcomes of the present review with other reviews that have been published relating to outcome of immediately loaded implants, similar good findings in implant survival (80-100%) (1, 5, 10, 121) were reported. However, the focus on the restoration outcome of immediately loaded implants made this review different from other review articles.

In agreement with previously published review articles, low level of evidence in the majority of included articles was a general observation in the present review (1, 3, 9). For instance, the conclusions of one study suffered from a small sample size of patients (32). Some author groups defined their own success and survival rates (29, 112, 114) leading to misunderstandings and impossible comparison of survival and success. Unfortunately, there was only one randomised control study within the included studies (29). Data about restoration outcome were poor and lacking especially regarding success data. Some treatment concepts were empirically based and not experimentally ascertained (30, 32). However, even in the consensus statement of the Third ITI Consensus Conference, authors underlined that the experience of the authors was playing a role in formulating the recommendations owing to the lack of strong evidence in the literature (9).

All in all, a comparison of the retrieved results was difficult owing to considerable variation of parameters in the study designs. Following variables playing a role in the outcome of immediately placed and loaded implants and their restorations should be kept in mind for future studies: patient selection (gender, age, health conditions, habits, healing time after tooth extraction, opposing dentitions), type of jaw, bone quality/quantity, follow-up times, the type of used implant systems (form and surfaces), implant diameters, the number of placed implants, the areas of implant insertion, surgical treatment, type and time of restoration delivery, pre- and post-operative medication, prescription of postoperative diet and occlusion concepts. Multicenter randomised controlled clinical trials with sufficient statistical power concentrating on few factors with homogenous groups are needed to reach sound conclusions.


# Conclusions

Within the limits of this review, appropriate patient selection, primary implant stability, splinting of implants and the expertise of surgeons seem to be important for the prognosis of immediately loaded implants and their restorations. Good bone quality and the use of long implants  $(\geq 10\mathrm{mm})$  appear to have a positive effect on the outcome. Immediate loading of oral implants in the mandible shows encouraging and predictable results but further multicenter randomised controlled clinical trials with sufficient statistical power are needed to examine (i) the outcome of immediately loaded implants and their restorations in the maxilla and (ii) the outcome of immediate loading of immediately placed implants.
