# INTRODUCTION

The rehabilitation of atrophic maxillae poses significant challenges due to compromised bone volume and density, limiting conventional implant placement options. Graftless solutions, such as zygomatic and subperiosteal implants, have emerged as alternatives to traditional bone augmentation, offering reduced treatment times and morbidity.[1-3] Zygomatic implants, introduced by Branemark in the late 1980s, anchor in the zygomatic bone, bypassing extensive grafting. Variations like extramaxillary approaches enhance versatility, with long-term success rates supported by systematic reviews and meta-analyses.[4-8] Subperiosteal implants, refined by CAD/CAM technologies, are custom-fitted to the patient's anatomy, ensuring precision and reducing complications.[9-12]

The choice depends on anatomical considerations, patient-specific needs, and surgical expertise. Zygomatic implants, while highly successful in atrophic cases, are linked to complications such as sinusitis and soft tissue

irritation, requiring surgical precision.[13,14] Subperiosteal implants face challenges like soft tissue dehiscence but benefit from enhanced customization through advanced technologies.[15,16] Studies show both types improve function and quality of life, with zygomatic implants offering immediacy and subperiosteal implants excelling in tailored solutions.[17-20]

Despite advancements, evidence comparing their long-term efficacy is limited, with studies often focusing on isolated parameters like survival rates and complications.[21,22] This review analyzes clinical outcomes, complications, and patient satisfaction to address this gap, providing insights into graftless solutions for managing severe maxillary atrophy.

# RESULTS

Table 1: Study Characteristics [Table 1]

The reviewed studies included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case reports, highlighting diverse approaches to evaluating zygomatic and subperiosteal implants. A total of eight studies were analyzed, involving 623 patients for zygomatic implants and 257 for subperiosteal implants. Follow-up durations ranged from 12 months to over 6 years, with study locations spanning Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Zygomatic implants consistently showed high survival rates (96.1%) and were particularly effective in addressing severe atrophic maxillae, though complications such as sinusitis were noted. Subperiosteal implants, primarily evaluated through shorter follow-ups, demonstrated a survival rate of  $97.8\%$  with minimal complications when CAD/CAM technology was utilized, enhancing precision and reducing surgical complexity.

Table 2: Clinical Outcomes [Table 2]

The included studies presented a wide variety of designs and approaches, analyzing 623 zygomatic implant patients and 257 subperiosteal implant patients. Zygomatic implants showed robust long-term success with a  $96.1\%$  survival rate over 5 years, benefiting from immediate loading protocols  $(98.1\%)$ . However, sinusitis and soft tissue irritation were common complications. Subperiosteal implants, evaluated mainly in shorter follow-up periods, achieved a  $97.8\%$  survival rate, with CAD/CAM technology enhancing precision and reducing complications such as surgical complexity. Despite a higher incidence of soft tissue dehiscence  $(25.6\%)$ , these implants showed promise, particularly in anatomically challenging cases. Both implant types achieved high patient satisfaction, with zygomatic implants excelling in immediacy and long-term outcomes, while subperiosteal implants offered tailored solutions through advanced digital technologies.

# Complications

Zygomatic implants are often associated with sinus-related complications, including sinusitis  $(14.2\%)$ [2] These issues require meticulous planning for intra-sinus approaches. Subperiosteal implants are more prone to soft tissue complications, such as dehiscence  $(25.6\%)$ .[4,8] Advances in 3D printing and digital workflows have mitigated these risks, improving implant design and positioning.[5,8]

# Patient outcomes

Zygomatic implants enhance quality of life by minimizing treatment time and morbidity, making them a preferred option for many patients.[2,3] Subperiosteal implants provide customized solutions for anatomically complex cases, improving esthetics and functionality.[5]

# Technological advancements

CAD/CAM technology significantly improves subperiosteal implant precision, reducing complications and surgical time.[4,8] Zygomatic implants, while benefiting from enhanced techniques, primarily depend on clinician expertise.[1,6]

# Limitations and future directions

Heterogeneity in study designs and metrics limits comparisons. Long-term data for subperiosteal implants are sparse, necessitating robust multicenter trials. Future research should focus on standardizing success metrics and incorporating emerging technologies like AI and robotics to enhance surgical outcomes.

# CONCLUSION

Zygomatic and subperiosteal implants represent transformative solutions for the rehabilitation of severely atrophic maxillae. While zygomatic implants are well established with high survival rates and patient satisfaction, subperiosteal implants, bolstered by technological advancements, offer a promising alternative for complex cases. The choice between these approaches should be guided by patient-specific factors, clinical expertise, and procedural goals. Continued research and technological innovation will further refine these graftless solutions, optimizing outcomes for patients with atrophic maxillae.
