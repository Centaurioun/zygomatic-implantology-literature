# Indications

1. Extraction of a tooth with the intent to replace immediately with a dental implant

# Contraindications

1. Acute periradicular inflammation including purulent drainage
2. Systemic healing concerns (previous radiation therapy, intravenous bisphosphonates, and chronic immunosuppression)
3. Lack of bone with inability to achieve adequate primary stability

# Anatomic Considerations

Preoperative assessment utilizing three-dimensional (3-D) imaging is necessary for the evaluation of periradicular bone defects, buccal and palatal/lingual plate thickness, buccal or palatal/lingual undercuts, sinus septa, and key anatomic structures (mental nerve, inferior alveolar nerve, etc.).

# Technique

1. Preoperative examination and 3-D imaging are paramount to determine if immediate implant placement is feasible.
2. Single preoperative loading dose of oral or intravenous antibiotics and preoperative chlorohexidine rinse are administered prior to surgery.
3. Failing tooth (teeth) is extracted in an atraumatic fashion utilizing forceps, luxators, and piezoelectric devices to minimize trauma to the dentoalveolar bone and to preserve the walls of the extraction site and interradicular bone.
4. The extraction socket is thoroughly debrided and irrigated with sterile normal saline and betadine.
5. The extraction site is assessed for bone defects and to ensure all soft tissue is eliminated (see Figure 8.5 in Case Report 8.1 and Figure 8.19 in Case Report 8.2).
6. An implant osteotomy is initiated either free hand or using a navigation system utilizing data exported from a CBCT scanner. The osteotomy is enlarged to accommodate the pre-planned implant following the

implant manufacturers guidelines. The final implant osteotomy is designed to achieve primary implant stability (see Figure 8.8 in Case Report 8.1). Stability may be achieved at any point along the implant osteotomy (apical, mid-body, or crestal) based on the length, diameter, and shape of the implant.

7. The implant is placed in an ideal restorative position and platform height. Care is taken to achieve adequate primary stability as measured with initial torque values of at least  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$ . If primary stability cannot be achieved with the initial osteotomy design, provided the extraction site allows, a longer implant may be placed to engage additional apical bone or a larger diameter implant may be placed to engage additional bone along the mid-body or crestal aspect of the osteotomy site. Tissue flaps are closed using 4-0 Glycolon (absorbable) sutures.
8. Bone grafting may be necessary around exposed implant threads (see Figure 8.11 in Case Report 8.1 and Figure 8.27 in Case Report 8.2). The author prefers to graft horizontal defects greater than  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  between the buccal and lingual plate with particulate xenograft. If vertical defects are present, the implant may be counter sunk slightly and/or grafted with xenograft utilizing a resorbable membrane.
9. Consider subepithelial connective tissue (CT) grafting (see Figures 8.34 through 8.38 in Case Report 8.3) of anterior maxillary implants and in cases with thin biotypes to improve tissue thickness, increase keratinized gingiva, and overall aesthetics.
10. Immediately after implant placement, either an anatomical healing abutment is placed (see Figures 8.12 in Case Report 8.1 and Figure 8.29 in Case Report 8.2) or an intraoral scan is obtained to design a laboratory-fabricated temporary crown/prosthesis. After intraoral scanning, a stock healing abutment is placed. If a custom temporary crown/prosthesis is fabricated, it is inserted 24-48 hours after immediate implant placement. The anatomical healing abutment or custom temporary crown significantly improves the soft tissue architecture and contours prior to placement of the definitive restoration.

# Postoperative Management

1. Postoperative pain is managed with the use of Exparel (Pacira Biosciences, Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Narcotics are not necessary with this protocol.
2. Oral antibiotics are used for 7 days postoperatively.
3. Patients are instructed to begin saltwater rinses the day after surgery and lasting for 2 weeks. After 7 days postoperative, brushing of the prosthesis is begun with a soft toothbrush. Patients are scheduled for a 2-week postoperative check to assess healing, anatomical healing abutment/prosthesis cleanliness and stability and to remove sutures.
4. Periapical films are taken at the time of immediate implant placement, 6 weeks and 4 months postoperative. After 4 months of integration, the implant is ready for final permanent restoration. An intraoral scan is obtained by the surgeon to generate an STL file for the referring dentist's laboratory on request.
5. Surgeon recommends that the referring restorative dentist evaluates the implant crowns occlusion every 6 months, fabricates a custom occlusal guard, and obtains periapical films every 6 months for the first 18 months to assess for crestal implant bone loss, abutment loosening, and implant pathology.

# Complications

1. Inability to achieve primary stability: Initial primary stability of an immediate implant is ideally at least  $35\mathrm{Ncm}$ . If primary stability cannot be achieved via using a longer implant or a wider diameter implant, then implant removal and grafting is necessary. An open-ended discussion (informed consent) is necessary prior to initiating the procedure to discuss with the patient that if circumstances arise that prevent immediate implant placement (poor bone quality, poor bone density, or inability to place implant in an ideal prosthetic position), that grafting and future implant placement may be necessary.
2. Crestal bone loss: A certain amount of crestal bone loss is expected after implant placement. Significant crestal bone loss after immediate implant placement is addressed by removing the anatomical healing abutment or temporary crown and placing a cover screw to allow for 3-4 weeks of gingival collapse prior to debridement and grafting. After 3-4 weeks of healing, sufficient soft tissue is typically present to allow for primary or near primary closure over the grafted site. If primary closure is not possible, membrane placement is warranted.
3. Failure of osseointegration: Implant failure is addressed with implant removal, aggressive debridement of the site to remove any evidence of infection,

bone sequestrums, or fibrous capsule. The implant extraction site is grafted and subsequent implant placement is placed after 4 months of healing.

4. Poor prosthetic positioning: Immediate implant placement should be aborted if prosthetic ideals are compromised. The site should be grafted and delayed implant placement should be placed after 4-5 months of healing.
5. Labial bone defect at time of implant placement: Labial bone defects less than half the vertical height of the extraction socket are reconstructed with a pericardial membrane and particulate xenograft using a pocket dissection. If the labial bone defect is larger than half of the extraction socket vertical height, a full-thickness flap is elevated, the defect is grafted with particulate xenograft, and non-resorbable membranes (PTFE or titanium mesh) are utilized.

# Key Points: General Considerations

1. Not all extraction sites are candidates for immediate implant placement. A thorough clinical examination combined with 3-D imaging are utilized to assess soft tissue thickness, vertical and horizontal bone levels, bone defects, buccal and lingual/palatal plate undercuts, adjacent root angulation, pathology, and adjacent anatomical structures (maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, incisive canal, mandibular canal, and mental foramen).
2. Atraumatic extractions are paramount for immediate implant success. Flapless extractions are preferred in order to maintain ideal soft tissue architecture. Dental forceps, sectioning of multirooted teeth, luxators, and piezoelectric devices are used to preserve the bony walls and interseptal bone within the extraction site.
3. The direct placement of an immediate implant into an existing socket (i.e., single root extraction or palatal root) will increase insertion torque at the expense of a poor emergence profile and an unideal final prosthetic outcome.
4. If dense bone is encountered, the use of side cutting burs (Lindeman bur) may be necessary to initiate the implant osteotomy in the appropriate angulation. If low density bone is encountered, the use of reverse drilling (Versah, Jackson, MI, USA) may be utilized to increase the density of the bone prior to immediate implant placement.
5. Implant osteotomy sites may be underprepared to gain higher insertional torque values.
6. Ensure that all graft materials are removed from the internal aspect/connection of the implant body prior to placing healing abutment or temporary crown to ensure complete seating of prosthesis.

7. Xenograft is the preferred grafting medium due to its ability to maintain graft volume over time stemming from its slower resorption rate compared to alloplastic grafting materials.
8. Connective tissue (CT) grafts are frequently necessary to maintain soft tissue profiles (papilla heights and facial cervical margins). Tissue grafts are mandatory if soft tissue thickness is less than  $1.5\mathrm{mm}$  or if a soft tissue void is present at the time of temporary prosthesis placement (CT grafting eliminates the need for labial advancement flap).
9. All prostheses (anatomical healing abutment, custom healing abutment, or temporary crown) should be screw retained in order to eliminate extrusion of excessive cement into the sulcular tissue. Excessive cement stimulating a foreign body reaction is the number one cause of peri-implantitis.
10. When placing a posterior prosthesis, placement can be aided with the use of a contra-angle torque wrench (see Figure 8.1).
11. Digital planning (Virtual Surgical Planning) utilizing CBCT and intraoral scanning allows for the design of digital wax-ups to improve implant placement based on the ideal position of the final restorative device, assists in communication with both the patient and with the restorative dentist, and aids in patient understanding of the implant placement and restorative process. Exporting of digital planning using X-Guide allows for same day navigation surgery.

# Key Points: Immediate Implants in the Aesthetic Zone (Anterior Implants)

1. The facial plate of bone should be preserved if possible. If ideal implant placement will compromise the facial plate of bone, small angulation changes of less than  $15^{\circ}$  are acceptable. Ridge augmentation in conjunction with immediate implant placement may be necessary to achieve ideal prosthetics. Additionally, angulated screw channel abutments may be used to correct angulation up to  $25^{\circ}$ .
2. Anterior maxillary implants should be placed  $2 - 3\mathrm{mm}$  below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the adjacent teeth. Anterior implants should maintain at least

$2\mathrm{mm}$  of facial bone thickness (see Figure 8.34 in Case Report 8.3).

3. CT grafting is required in the majority of anterior aesthetic cases.
4. Temporary prostheses are placed immediately or within 72 hours of immediate implant placement.
5. The design of the temporary prosthesis (anatomical healing abutment, custom healing abutment, or temporary crown) dimensions are critical for final tissue aesthetics. Initial subgingival temporary prosthesis contours should be as concave and smooth as possible to avoid acting as a plaque trap and causing tissue inflammation and erythema. Supragingival prosthesis contours should mimic the original tooth size at the papilla and interproximal spaces and should be reduced by  $1\mathrm{mm}$  facially.
6. Socket shielding may be utilized if the extraction of an ankylosed tooth will result in complete loss of the facial plate of bone. Socket shielding involves intentionally leaving a thin remnant of a facial root and grafting or placing the implant behind the retained root shield.

# Key Points: Immediate Molar Implants

1. Central or slight lingual implant placement position allows for stock abutment placement and axial loading of the implant to increase longevity. Placing the implant in the central position can be difficult due to the position of the interseptal bone. Prior to using the pilot drill, level the interseptal bone with a bur to create a solid platform to allow easier drilling with more controlled positioning. Avoid implant placement toward the mesial or distal root by maintaining central drill position. To combat unwanted drill deflection, care must be taken when advancing drill widths. Using high drill speeds with slow apical advancement reduces drills catching (chattering) and displacement.
2. Implant stability can be achieved by placing the immediate implant  $3 - 4\mathrm{mm}$  apical to the extraction site (if possible) and by using a large diameter implant to engage crestal bone.
3. For mandibular implants, a minimum safe distance of  $2.5\mathrm{mm}$  must be maintained from the mandibular canal and the mental foramen.
4. For maxillary implants, simultaneous vertical augmentation of the sinus is frequently necessary to place  $8 - 10\mathrm{mm}$  length implants. Depending on the amount of vertical augmentation required, techniques to increase the vertical height of bone include an indirect sinus lift with either angled osteotomes or Versah (osseodensification) drills or a direct sinus lift via a lateral sinus widow approach.
