# The continuing reduction of the residual alveolar ridges in complete denture wearers: A mixed-longitudinal study covering 25 years

The effect of the wearing of complete dentures on facial morphology has been the object of a series of longitudinal studies by the present author. The resorption of the residual alveolar ridges during a seven-year period of denture wear was found to have caused a pronounced reduction of the pre-extraction morphologic face height and an accompanying although less marked reduction in the rest face height. In subjects provided with complete upper and partial lower free-end dentures, the decrease in facial height was, on the average, only half that noted in the complete denture group. The adaptive changes in the rest face height to the alterations in the morphologic face height have been confirmed in several other studies.

A study of the morphologic changes in the facial skeleton during seven years of complete denture wear<sup>3</sup> revealed that the decrease in facial height was mainly due to a pronounced reduction of the mandibular ridge and a consequent forward-upward rotation of the mandible. The change in mandibular position was accompanied by a marked increase in mandibular prognathism, i.e., a forward positioning of the chin in relation to the upper part of the face. The reduction of the residual alveolar ridges was most rapid during the first year of denture wear.<sup>4</sup> This is in accordance with findings by other authors for various categories of denture wearers.<sup>11-15</sup> Despite the marked alveolar bone loss and resultant alterations in jaw relationship, no dimensional changes were found in the cranial base, the upper part of the face, or the basal parts of the mandible. Nor was there any evidence of remodelling changes in the gonial process.<sup>3</sup>

A study of the positional changes of the complete dentures due to the alveolar resorption<sup>4</sup> revealed particularly marked changes of the lower denture. In addition to a pronounced settling on the basal seat, the lower denture displayed also a forward slide on the residual ridge. The upward rotation of the mandible and the forward slide of the lower denture led to a reduction in the horizontal overlap, and in some patients, even to a horizontal overlap of the lower teeth over the upper ones.


The resorption of the residual ridges and the changes in jaw and occlusal relationships showed great individual variation. Analysis of the relationship between morphologic characteristics of the facial skeleton and the anterior bone loss during seven years of denture wear<sup>16</sup> revealed a marked association between the mandibular shape and the resorption, especially of the lower ridge.

In order to investigate the continuing reduction of the residual ridges during protracted wearing of dentures, a cephalometric radiographic follow-up study was made of two groups of complete denture wearers—those with 15 and those with 25 years' experience with denture wear. Furthermore, the individual variations in mandibular bone loss were subjected to closer analysis.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS Samples studied

The two groups studied consisted of subjects who had been provided with complete maxillary and mandibular dentures at the Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki. The first sample (Group A) comprised nine subjects from a sample of 11 complete denture wearers, previously followed during seven years of denture wear.[2,3] The nine subjects (seven women and two men) were examined after a total of 13.5 years of denture wear, and six of these also after a total of 15 years of denture wear. The mean age of the nine subjects who were examined after 13.5 years was 63.7 years (range 33 to 76 years). The reductions of the sample were in two instances due to death, one subject had moved to another area of the country and was not able to attend, and two subjects did not respond to repeated attempts at follow-up.

The second sample (Group C) consisted of 20 subjects from a previous sample of 45 subjects, who at the initial examination<sup>1</sup> had been wearing complete dentures for ten years. These 20 subjects, all women, were re-examined 15 years after the first examination, that is, after a total of 25 years of denture wear. The mean age of the subjects at the 25 year stage was 72.1 years (range 59 to 88 years). The reduction of the initial sample was in 11 instances due to death, four subjects could not be traced, six subjects did not respond to repeated attempts at follow-up, and four subjects were unable to attend due to illness or old age.


# Prosthetic treatment

Details regarding the prosthetic treatment have been given in a previous publication. In both groups, the treatment undertaken was of the conventional type, the dentures being constructed two to four months after extraction. In Group C, all dentures were made of vulcanite; in Group A, the dentures were made of acrylic resin. In both groups the dentures were provided with porcelain teeth (cusp angulation about 15 degrees).

For the subjects in Group A no rebasing of the dentures had been done during the first seven years of denture wearing. For subjects Nos. 17, 31, 32 and 53 (see Fig. 6), the dentures were remade or rebased between the seven-year and the 13.5 year controls, and for subject No. 2, the dentures were rebased after the 13.5 year control.

In Group C, seven of the 20 subjects (Nos. 4, 7, 12, 19, 29, 43, and 45—see Fig. 7) were still using their 25-year-old vulcanite dentures without any corrections of the dentures having been made. For the remaining 13 subjects, new dentures of acrylic resin had been made during the period between the two radiographic examinations.

# Radiographic procedure

The standardized radiographic cephalometric procedure for obtaining the profile head films has been accounted for in previous publications. The film series of each subject obtained in the present follow-up study consisted of two or three radiographs made in the rest position of the mandible and one radiograph made with the teeth in occlusion. The rest position exposures were made both with and without the dentures in the mouth.

The enlargement of the structures in the median plane was the same as in previous recordings (6.6 per cent). No corrections have been made for this enlargement.

# Measurements

The variables studied were the reduction in anterior height of the bony alveolar ridges and the anterior resorption areas (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the shape of the mandible was measured in terms of the  $\beta$ -angle (Lindgaard) and the gonial angle, RL-ML (Fig. 2). For details regarding measurements and method errors the reader is referred to a previous article. A brief survey of methods of measurement is given below.

All measurements were obtained from the rest position films without dentures, the other films from the same series being used as an additional check of bony contours and of measuring points. The linear and angular measurements were made directly on the films according to the method of Björk and Solow.[18] The measurements of the resorption areas (Fig. 1) were made on contour tracings by planimeter, the mean of three registrations of each area being used in the subsequent analysis.

The statistical methods used in the present study have been reported elsewhere. [3, 16] Examination of the relationship between pairs of variables was performed graphically and by calculation of correlation coefficients. The 5 and 1 per cent significance limits for the correlation coefficients for the sample size of 20 are 0.44 and 0.56. All calculations were carried out at NEUCC, the Northern Europe University Computing Centre in Copenhagen.

Regarding the previously reported reduction of the alveolar ridges in Group A during seven years of denture wear, it should be noted that during the preinsertion period no significant difference between the maxillary and mandibular reduction was found. Owing to a marked reduction of the lower ridge but only slight reduction of the upper ridge during the subsequent years of denture wear, the relationship between the mandibular and maxillary reduction gradually increased to approximately 4:1 at the seven-year stage.[4]

Fig. 5. See legend for Fig. 4.

The present follow-up study revealed a continuing reduction of the residual ridges. In Group A the mean decrease in anterior height of the lower ridge between the seven-year and 13.5 year controls was  $1.4\mathrm{mm}$  and that of the upper ridge was  $0.4\mathrm{mm}$ . In three of the nine subjects no further reduction of the upper ridge was observed during this period, while the lower ridge was reduced in all subjects. The mean decrease in mandibular height during the total period of 13.5 years was  $7.7\mathrm{mm}$  and the maxillary reduction was  $2.2\mathrm{mm}$ . Of the six subjects examined at the 15 year stage of denture wear, four subjects showed a further reduction of the lower ridge, while only one subject displayed reduction of the upper ridge.


In Group C the mean reduction in anterior height of the lower residual ridge between the 10 year and 25 year stages of denture wear was  $3\mathrm{mm}$  and that of the upper ridge was  $0.8\mathrm{mm}$ . Regarding the individual results, all subjects displayed reduction of the lower ridge, while in three subjects no reduction of the upper ridge was found.

The mean rates of reduction for the upper and for the lower ridge during the follow-up periods were of the same magnitude in the two samples (Table I, Figs. 4 and

5). As also seen in Fig. 3, the mean curves for the respective maxillary and mandibular reduction run parallel. Judging from the mean alveolar reduction in the two samples studied, the average reduction in anterior height of the lower ridge during a 25 year period of complete denture wear would amount to some 9 to  $10\mathrm{mm}$  and the reduction of the upper ridge to some 2.5 to  $3\mathrm{mm}$ .

# Individual variation in alveolar bone loss

The magnitude of alveolar resorption showed great individual variation in both samples of denture wearers. The means and variabilities for the resorbed areas in the anterior region of the residual ridges are given in Table II.

The anterior bone loss of the lower ridge in the nine subjects of Group A is shown in Fig. 6. The tracings show the bony contour of the residual ridge at the stage of insertion of the dentures, at the one-year, the seven-year, and the 13.5 year stages of denture wearing. The marked alveolar bone loss during the first year of denture wearing and the gradual decrease in the rate of resorption is clearly noticeable.

Regarding the shape of the individual resorption areas, each subject displayed more or less the same resorption pattern throughout the period of denture wear. In some subjects a "flat" pattern with mainly vertical bone loss was noted, while other subjects displayed a more "sharp" pattern with marked horizontal bone loss.

The anterior mandibular bone loss in the 20 subjects of Group C between the 10 and 25 year stages of denture wear is shown in Fig. 7. Like the findings in Group A, the magnitude and pattern of resorption showed great individual variation. Analysis of the relationship between the anterior mandibular bone loss and the shape of the mandible (Figs. 8 and 9) revealed a marked positive correlation with the  $\beta$ -angle  $(r = 0.75^{**})$  and a marked negative correlation  $(-0.63^{**})$  with the gonial angle (RL-ML). A pronounced mandibular bone loss thus was seen in subjects with a marked mandibular base bend (a large  $\beta$ -angle and a small gonial angle), while a less marked resorption was seen in subjects with a flattened mandibular base (a small  $\beta$ -angle and a large gonial angle). No association was observed between the mandibular bone loss and the height of the lower ridge at the 10 year stage  $(r = -0.01)$ .

The relationship observed between the mandibular resorption and the shape of the mandible is further illustrated by the tracings (Fig. 10) of two subjects with a small mandibular resorption and of two sub

The marked difference between the mandibular and maxillary resorption is also seen.


# DISCUSSION

The present follow-up study of two groups of complete denture wearers to the 15 year and 25 year stages of denture wear revealed a continuing reduction of the residual ridges, particularly marked on the lower ridge. In both samples, the mean reduction in anterior height of the lower ridge during the follow-up periods was about four times greater than that of the upper. The same relationship between the mandibular and maxillary reduction was previously observed at the seven-year stage of denture wear.[3, 4]

The difference between the jaws in alveolar reduction increased gradually during the first years of denture wear. This would seem to indicate that the lower ridge is more likely to respond to the various functional forces transmitted through the dentures than the upper ridge. The most likely reason for this is in the smaller area and less advantageous shape of the lower basal seat. In regard to the less marked resorption of the upper ridge, the resistance offered by the hard palate to the influence of the dentures on the alveolar ridge may play an important part.


The reduction of the residual ridges during the protracted wearing of dentures was slight as compared to the rapid reduction during the first year of denture wear. Thus, the mean rate of reduction for both the upper and lower ridge during the follow-up periods was less than one tenth of that observed during the initial year. Moreover, the rates for the maxillary and for the mandibular reduction were found to be of the same magnitude in the two samples. These findings seem to indicate that during extended wearing of complete dentures, the rate of anterior reduction for the residual ridges and the relationship between the maxillary and mandibular reduction, on the average, remains fairly constant.

Regarding the variability in resorption, a few subjects in both samples displayed no further reduction of the upper ridge after the respective seven-year and ten-year stages of observation, whereas the lower ridge showed a continued reduction in all subjects. The magnitude of alveolar bone loss, however, showed great individual variation.


The marked correlations observed in the present follow-up study between the shape of the mandible and the anterior bone loss of the lower ridge confirmed previous findings from a seven-year study.[16] A pronounced mandibular bone loss was observed in subjects with a marked mandibular base bend and a less marked resorption in subjects with a flattened mandibular base.

A pronounced resorption of the residual ridges related to the shape of the mandible may be due to an interaction of various factors—anatomic, functional and prosthetic. In regard to the load transmitted to the tissues underlying the dentures, one factor especially to be considered is the muscular force. Attention is drawn to electromyographic findings, in young individuals with natural teeth, of a relationship between the mandibular shape and jaw muscular activity. In subjects with a marked mandibular base bend and a small gonial angle MÖller<sup>19</sup> observed strong activity of the masseter and the anterior temporal muscles in the forced closure. A similar relationship between the size of the gonial angle and the mesenter activity during chewing was observed by Witt<sup>20</sup> and Ahlgren.<sup>21</sup> A marked response of the lower lip and mentalis muscles, observed electromyographically<sup>22</sup> in long-term complete denture wearers with impaired retention and stability of the lower denture, may be considered a contributing factor with regard to the anterior mandibular resorption.

As pointed out by Atwood,[23] the various prosthetic factors are difficult to evaluate due to the great number of variables included. This is especially true in a long-term investigation like the present one. However, the findings in a previous seven-year study[16] of a pronounced mandibular bone loss in subjects with a more lingual placement of the artificial lower incisors than that of the natural teeth should be considered. Regarding rebasing or remaking of the dentures, an interesting observation in the present study was that of the seven subjects in Group C, who had been using their original dentures during 25 years without any corrections, four subjects were among the five who showed the smallest mandibular resorption in the whole group.

With regard to the shape of the resorbed mandibular areas great variability was observed. The individual resorption pattern, on the other hand, seemed to be fairly consistent throughout the period of denture wear.

# SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This mixed-longitudinal study of edentulous individuals covering 25 years of complete denture wearing revealed a continued reduction of the residual ridges throughout the observation period.

The reduction of the lower ridge was particularly marked, the mean reduction in anterior ridge height being approximately four times as great as that of the upper ridge.


The magnitude and pattern of alveolar bone loss showed great individual variation.

Correlations between the shape of the mandible and the anterior mandibular bone loss indicated a pronounced resorption in subjects with a marked mandibular base bend, and a less marked resorption in subjects with a flattened mandibular base. These findings suggest that careful examination of the mandibular shape can provide valuable information on the response of the residual ridges to the wearing of dentures.

Regarding the clinical consequences of the alveolar bone loss it should be emphasized that by regular control and prosthetic measures marked instability of the dentures and undesirable changes in jaw and occlusal relationships can be prevented. As the rate of resorption is most rapid during the first year of denture wear, regular control during the first year and thereafter at least once a year is advisable.

However, with the continuing resorption over years, the prosthetic replacement of the lost tissues will give rise to increasing treatment problems and may cause the patient extreme difficulties in management of the dentures.

The continuing resorption, especially of the lower ridge, therefore, constitutes a serious prosthodontic problem.
