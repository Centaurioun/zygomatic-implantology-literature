# Abstract

Background Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) is a term that encompasses conditions such as oral health status, living conditions, and function. OHQoL can change with the varying health conditions of the same individual. Many patients cannot afford implants or have anatomical limitations and therefore use traditional removable dentures. There are comparatively few studies investigating OHRQoL and denture satisfaction that include the patients' sociodemographic data, denture satisfaction and related questions.

Aim This study aimed to investigate OHRQoL and patients' satisfaction with three types of dentures: upper and lower complete dentures, upper and lower partial dentures, and upper complete lower partial dentures.

Methods The study was conducted between January 2022 and June 2023, with 150 patients using removable dentures. Patients' age, gender, education level, place of residence, smoking status, reasons for tooth loss and visiting the clinic, type of denture and the duration of denture use were recorded. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and patient satisfaction with dentures as measured on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were used to assess patients' satisfactions with OHRQoL and dentures respectively. Descriptive statistics, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the MannWhitney non-parametric test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used.

Results Statistically significant differences were found between gender, prosthetic type, usage duration and OHIP and VAS scores  $(p < 0.05)$ . Women's OHIP scores were higher than men's, patients using complete dentures had higher scores than those using partial dentures in both jaws, those using dentures for less than 1 year had higher scores than those that had used them for more than 1 year. The analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in OHIP and VAS scores based on age, education level, and place of residence  $(p > 0.05)$ .

Conclusions Patients may find it easier to adapt to removable partial dentures compared to complete dentures. Therefore, in prosthetic planning, dentists should prioritize preserving existing teeth. Regardless of the type of prosthesis, patients adapt to their prostheses over time, leading to increased satisfaction with prolonged use. Since

# Background

Edentulism, which is common in old age, is a multifaceted problem that often causes a decrease in the quality of life by negatively affecting the psychological, aesthetic and social lives of individuals [1, 2]. Old age affects the person's eating habits and also impairs the chewing function [3]. Prosthetic treatment options for completely edentulous patients vary today; many patients cannot afford implants or have anatomical limitations and therefore are limited to using traditional removable dentures. The goal of all these prosthetic treatments is to restore the patient's lost aesthetics, appearance, phonation, and function [4]. In this context, the provision of dentures not only affects these functional aspects, but also the patient's Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). The latter term encompasses conditions such as oral health status, living conditions, and function. OHRQoL can vary from person to person and can also change with the varying health conditions of the same individual [5]. The impact of prosthetic treatments on OHRQoL has been the subject of many studies [6, 7]. Various scales are used to measure oral health-related quality of life. One of these scales is the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), developed by Slade et al. [5], consisting of 14 questions.

The other important aspect is patient satisfaction with dentures. This can be measured on the visual analog scale (VAS), which is used to evaluate participants' pain levels, satisfaction with treatment outcomes, and overall comfort [8-10]. This test is widely accepted in the world literature, reliable, and easy to apply [11]. The purpose of this study is to determine how sociodemographic data of patients with removable dentures, their reasons for visiting the clinic, and their VAS of their current dentures affect their OHRQoL.

# Methods

# Participants and settings

This cross-sectional study was conducted at Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Faculty of Dentistry in Turkey between January 2022 and June 2023, Before the study, detailed information about the research was given to the patients, and written informed consent was obtained voluntarily from each patient. The study was initiated with the approval of the ethics committee at Abant Izzet Baysal University and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration (Decision No: 2023/97).

The selection criteria for the patients were as follows: Medically healthy male or female, over 18 years of age, able to sign the informed consent form, with no temporomandibular joint problems, and who had one of three types of dentures: complete dentures in both upper and lower jaws (ULCD), partial dentures in both upper and lower jaws (ULPD), or complete dentures in the upper jaw and partial dentures in the lower jaw (UCLPD). The patients with partial dentures in the upper jaw, complete dentures in the lower jaw due to the small number of patients, and patients with life threatening conditions, physical and psychological ailments were excluded from the study.


In this study, the "G. Power-3.1.9.2" program was used with a  $95\%$  confidence level  $(\alpha = 0.05)$ , and the standardized effect size calculated as 0.2527 from a similar study [12], and the minimum sample size required for each group was determined to be 69 with a theoretical power of 0.95. In this regard, the present study was planned with a sample size of 75 for each group.

# Data collection tools and procedures

In the first part of the study, responses to questions about the patients' age, gender, education level, place of residence, reasons for tooth loss, smoking status, and reasons for visiting the clinic, were recorded. Smoking status was classified into three groups based on Shurman et al's study: 0, 1-15 cigarettes per day, and more than 15 cigarettes per day [13]. The second part included questions about the type of denture and the duration of denture use. The type of denture was classified into three groups: upper and lower complete dentures, upper and lower partial dentures, and upper total and lower partial dentures. The duration of denture use was categorized into three groups, as in the study by Cankaya et al.; less than 1 year, between 1 and 5 years (1-5 years), and equal to or greater than 5 years  $(\geq 5$  years) [14].

In the final part of the study, participants were asked to complete forms containing OHIP-14 questions. OHIP evaluates seven domains, each containing two questions. In total, there are 14 questions, divided into the domains of functional limitation, physical pain, physical disability, psychological discomfort, psychological disability, social disability, and handicap. Each item is scored on a five-point scale: Never (0), Hardly Ever (1), Occasionally (2), Fairly Often (3), and Very Often (4). The total scores obtainable from OHIP-14 range from 0 to 56; an increase in the total score indicates a decrease in quality of life [5].

Additionally, the patients were asked "How satisfied are you with your denture?" Their responses were marked on a  $100\mathrm{mm}$  visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0

# Statistical analysis

The descriptive statistics (number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) provided in this study were presented. The assumption of normal distribution was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In cases where the normality assumption was not met, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing two independent groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing three or more independent groups. Post Hoc Bonferroni correction tests were used to

OHIP: Oral Health Impact Profile; VAS: Visual Analog Scale. Different lowercase letters denote significant differences between groups (Kruskal-Wallis test for difference between 3 groups,  $p < 0.05$ ) the mean VAS score on patient satisfaction with dentures was 77.3.


Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to compare OHIP and VAS scores based on individuals' demographic characteristics. The analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in OHIP and VAS scores based on age, education level, and place of residence  $(p > 0.05)$ .

Gender differences on OHIP-14 domains and VAS scores are shown in Table 3. Females scored significantly higher than males on of physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, as well as in OHIP total score. Males had significantly higher VAS scores compared to females. There were no statistically significant differences between gender and scores for functional limitation and handicap  $(p > 0.05)$ .

Differences between the prosthetic types are shown in Table 4. Domain scores for physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, and overall OHIP score were significantly higher in ULCD users compared to ULPD and UTLPD users. VAS scores were significantly lower in ULCD users compared to ULPD and UCLPD users. Significant differences were found only between ULCD and ULPD groups in terms of functional limitation, social disability, and handicap scores. Functional limitation, social disability, and handicap scores were higher in ULCD users compared to ULPD users.

Differences between durations of denture use is shown in Table 5. Significant differences were found in terms of physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, and OHIP scores among individuals using prosthetics for less than 1 year, 1-5 years, and more than 5 years  $(p < 0.05)$ . Scores for those using prosthetics for less than 1 year were higher compared to those using them for 1-5 years and more than 5 years. Regarding social disability scores, a statistically significant difference was observed between individuals using prosthetics for less than 1 year and those using them for more than 5 years  $(p < 0.01)$ , with scores being higher in those using prosthetics for less than 1 year.


In terms of VAS scores, a statistically significant difference was found between individuals using prosthetics for less than 1 year and those using them for 1-5 years  $(p < 0.01)$ , with VAS scores being higher in the 1-5 years group compared to the less than 1 year group. However, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of functional limitation and handicap scores based on prosthetic usage duration  $(p > 0.05)$ .

Differences between participants' gender and smoking habits with the cause of tooth loss is shown in Table 6. The analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between gender and the cause of tooth loss  $(p > 0.05)$ . However, a statistically significant relationship was found between smoking habits and the cause of tooth loss  $(p < 0.01)$ . It was observed that non-smokers mostly experienced tooth decay, whereas as smoking increased, instances of trauma and gum disease also increased.

# Discussion

This study aims to investigate how various types of prostheses used by patients with removable dentures affect oral health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the study examines the effects of factors such as gender, education level, place of residence, and duration of prosthesis use on quality of life. Reasons for clinical visits and causes of tooth loss have also been analyzed.

When comparing gender with prosthetic satisfaction, it has been observed that satisfaction levels are lower among female patients. Studies by Panek et al. and Santos et al., which examined patient satisfaction, similarly reported that men adapt better to their prostheses compared to women, and women tend to have higher aesthetic expectations [16, 17]. Women may find it challenging to adapt to prostheses during menopause due to emotional and physical changes. In Turkey, the average age of menopause for women is between 47 and 49 years [18], and in the study cited, the average age for women was 53.3 years. This age difference between genders may be a contributing factor. Additionally, advancing age can negatively affect prosthesis adaptation for both genders [19].


When examining the reasons for tooth loss, it has been observed that the majority of patients lose their teeth due to decay. In pairwise comparisons, statistically significant differences have been found between smoking and tooth loss due to gum disease/loose teeth. As cigarette consumption increases, the incidence of tooth loss due to gum disease/loose teeth also increases. Studies have reported that smokers are 3-4 times more likely to have periodontal disease compared to non-smokers, and that the extent of alveolar bone loss increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. These findings support the results of the current study [20, 21].

In the current study, individuals who use both upper and lower complete dentures have the lowest Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL), while individuals using both upper and lower partial dentures have the highest OHRQoL. Similarly, a cross-sectional study conducted in Canada reported that in edentulous subjects, scores in the seven domains of OHIP-14 were significantly higher compared to dentate subjects [22]. It has been concluded that as the number of existing teeth increases, oral health-related quality of life improves, a finding supported by many studies [23-25].

In this study, individuals who have been using dentures for 1-5 years reported higher VAS scores compared to those who have been using dentures for less than 1 year. There was a statistically significant relationship found between duration of denture use and physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, and social disability. Based on the findings, it can be said that denture experience positively impacts quality of life in these areas. Previous studies also support

Different lowercase letters denote significant differences between groups (Mann-Whitney U test for differences between female and male groups, Kruskal-Wallis test for difference between 3 groups,  $p < 0.05$ ) this conclusion, suggesting that longer denture use facilitates the adaptation process for patients [26-28]. In the current study, it was observed that patient satisfaction decreases when denture usage exceeds 5 years. This result suggests that over time, changes in soft and hard tissues may lead to retention and aesthetic losses.


In a study conducted by Butt et al. [29], it was reported that conventional complete dentures have disadvantages such as pain, difficulty in accepting the prosthesis, and failure to meet expectations. Therefore, individuals may find it challenging to use their dentures. In the study by Hilal et al. [30], it was found that physical pain scores were high, suggesting that physical pain was the most significant factor negatively impacting patients' quality of life. Similarly, in the current study, it was found that the highest scores in the seven domains of OHIP-14 were related to psychological discomfort, followed by physical pain. In a study conducted by Shaghaghian et al. [20] which investigated the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of a group of patients using removable partial dentures in Iran, participants reported the most difficulty in terms of physical disability and physical pain. They experienced very few issues related to disability and social disability. In the current study, the lowest scores were obtained in the categories of functional limitation and disability.

Seenivasan et al. [31], evaluated the effects of complete dentures on the quality of life of patients based on their education levels in a study. Although individuals who graduated from secondary education and those working in low socioeconomic levels had better denture satisfaction compared to other categories, this difference was not found to be statistically significant. Similarly, in the present study, no statistically significant difference was observed in all OHIP and VAS scores based on education level. In contrast, in a study by Celebic et al. [26], it was reported that patients with lower education levels were generally more satisfied with their dentures compared to those with higher education levels. In the present study, the proportion of patients with a high education level was  $33.6\%$ , whereas in Celebic and colleagues' study, the proportion of patients with a low education level was higher and the proportion of patients with a high education level was lower  $(15\%)$ . It was thought that this discrepancy might have caused the differences in findings.

In elderly patients, as metabolism slows down, atrophy can be observed in the mucosa, bone, and muscle tissues over time. As this atrophy progresses, it can lead to chewing and speech disorders. Additionally, changes in the soft tissues can result in a loss of retention and stability in existing dentures [32]. Since soft liner materials have a high surface friction coefficient, they can increase retention between the denture and the tissue. This friction between the denture and oral tissues prevents excessive movement of the denture [33]. In the present study, the most common reason for patients visiting the clinic was the need for relining/lining.


For the early diagnosis of diseases and thus the initiation of appropriate early treatment, it is critical to visit the dentist regularly. When asked how frequently they visit the dentist, it was observed, as in many studies, that patients do not adhere to periodic dental visits [34, 35], and do not go to the dentist for check-ups unless they have a complaint [36]. In this study, the reason with the lowest proportion for patients visiting the clinic was for check-ups  $(4.7\%)$ . It is thought that the reasons patients have not developed the habit of visiting the dentist include the cost of dental services and the widespread fear of dentistry in the community. Dental fear is a problem that affects a large population and can be seen in almost every individual [37]. This problem can cause patients to postpone their dental treatment appointments, attend check-up examinations irregularly, or not go at all [38].

The limitation of this study includes obtaining data from a single center and the prosthetic treatments being performed by different dentists. Another limitation could be the presence of fixed prostheses as the opposing arch, or the potential different effects of various types of fixed and removable prostheses on oral health-related quality of life.

# Conclusion

The results of the current study have shown that gender, type of prosthesis, and duration of prosthesis significantly influence OHIP total scores, OHIP subscale scores and patient satisfaction, underscoring their importance in individuals' quality of life. Female patients tend to have lower satisfaction levels, whereas male patients exhibit higher satisfaction levels. Patients may find it easier to adapt to removable partial dentures compared to full dentures in both arches. Therefore, in prosthetic planning, dentists should prioritize preserving existing teeth in the mouth and consider partial dentures as the initial alternative.
