# Abstract

We have evaluated the survival of dental implants in extremely atrophic edentulous maxillas after autogenous bone grafting. We compared two techniques: the Le Fort I down-grafting procedure and conventional raising of the sinus floor with onlay bone grafting.

Twenty-seven consecutive patients had their atrophic maxillas reconstructed, 10 of whom were treated with a Le Fort I osteotomy with down-grafting and interpositioning of bone, and 17 by raising the sinus floor and onlay grafts. All implants were placed 5-6 months after grafting. There was no difference in the survival of implants between the two groups. The choice of grafting technique will therefore be based primarily on the interarch relations and the need for soft tissue support.

# Introduction

Adequate reconstruction of an extremely atrophic edentulous maxilla has always been a challenge. There are two different conditions, or patterns of resorption, the first of which presents with a thin alveolar process but, however, considerable height (Cawood IV-V). The lack of bony volume in these patients is often treated by a sinus lift combined with onlay bone grafting which, for many surgeons, is a reliable and predictable technique.

In other patients, particularly those with remaining teeth in the front of the mandible, the resorption occurs primarily in the front of the maxilla (Cawood VI and Kelly syndrome). These patients are often diagnosed as having a reversed maxillary-mandibular relation, an increased vertical intermaxillary distance, and a collapsed facial appearance.2 The effect of these alterations, combined with ageing, results in a change in facial morphology. In this group correction of bone volume alone is not enough to create a favourable site for implant and, therefore, the alveolar bone should be augmented at the same time as the maxillary-mandibular relation and the vertical dimension is restored to provide support for the collapsed facial muscles. Interpositional bone grafting and Le Fort I osteotomy may achieve these goals.3 In this paper we describe the results of the insertion of dental implants into severely atrophic maxillas that were reconstructed either by Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafting or by a sinus lift combined with onlay bone grafting.


# Patients and methods

Between 2004 and 2007, 27 healthy patients had their severely or extremely atrophic maxillas reconstructed. The maxillas had been edentulous for a mean of 17.5 years (12-22 years). Two different techniques of bone grafting were used, depending on the resorption pattern. In the first group, 10 patients were treated by Le Fort I osteotomy, and interpositioning and repositioning of the maxilla forwards and downwards. There were 5 men and 5 women (mean (SD) age 53 (8) years). In the second group 2 men and 15 women (mean (SD) age 53 (7) years) were treated by raising the sinus floor and onlay bone grafting. There was one tobacco smoker in each group.

All patients were operated on under general anaesthesia with nasal endotracheal intubation. Autogenous corticocancellous block grafts and autogenous particulate bone grafts were harvested from the posterior iliac crest for the Le Fort I group because of the larger volume of cancellous bone that was available, while for the onlay group the anterior iliac crest was used. The autogenous particulate bone grafts were mixed in a 4:1 ratio with Bio-oss®.

In the first group a standard Le Fort I approach was used. If possible the sinus membrane was preserved, but some tears were inevitable. After the nasal mucosa had been raised and the septum released, the maxilla was down-fractured using Sailer's technique. The maxillary sinus was closed with a cortical piece of bone shaped to fit the sinus as an inlay graft. The graft was fixed with three polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) sutures to the lateral sinus wall. This differs from fixation with two microplates as described by Cawood et al. and Stoelinga et al. The maxilla was positioned downwards and forwards, the mean forward movement being  $5\mathrm{mm}$  (vary from 2 to  $8\mathrm{mm}$ , SD 1.9). Rigid fixation with two L-shaped miniplates (1.5 system Synthes) in the frontal region stabilised the maxilla and the interpositional bone graft in the desired position (Figs. 1 and 2).

The maxillary sinus floor was raised as in the classic lateral antrostomy pioneered by Tatum combined with onlay bone grafting. The space created after the sinus membrane had been raised by the intruded trapdoor was filled with a mixture of autogenous bone and Bio-oss (Fig. 3). The onlay grafts were shaped so that they closely adapted to the recipient bed and were fixed with two screws (Fig. 4). Care was taken to achieve a tension-free closure of the soft tissue. In both groups antibiotic prophylaxis was continued orally for 7 days postoperatively with amoxycillin  $500\mathrm{mg}$  three times daily. Non-steroidal analgesics were given postoperatively. Patients were requested not to wear their dentures for 2 weeks. After 2–3 weeks a new pair of dentures was made for use during the healing period until the suprastructures were completed and a

Further instructions included soft diet for 3 months and the use of  $0.12\%$  chlorhexidine mouth rinse. Endosseous implants were placed 5-6 months postoperatively. A guidance template was used to ensure the correct position and alignment of the implants.


Details of the implants are shown in Table 1. After a 6-month healing period the implants were uncovered and the suprastructure was introduced.

The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version16, SPSS, Chicago) was used to aid analysis. Pearson's chi² test was used to assess the significance of differences between the number of failures of implants in the both groups. Probabilities of less than 0.05 were accepted as significant.

# Results

All patients were discharged from hospital within 2 days, and the initial healing in all 27 patients was uneventful. During the Le Fort I osteotomy there was one unexpected fracture of the palate, but the maxilla could still be advanced. In the Le Fort I group there were no dehiscences of the soft tissue and no loss of bone grafts. In this group 54 implants were inserted (42 Straumann standard and12 Nobel replace select; Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland, and Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden). In one patient, one of the four implants did not integrate, which was discovered when the implant was exposed. This implant was removed. In another patient in whom seven implants were inserted, two failed after 7 months. In total, 3 of the 54 implants were lost in this group, resulting in  $6\%$  failure.


In the onlay group 86 implants were inserted (54 Straumann standard, 26 Nobel replace select, and 6 Astra) (Astra Tech AB, Molndal, Sweden). In two patients the soft tissue dehisced, and the corticocancellous bone blocks partly sequestrated. A mixture of autogenous bone, Bio-oss® and Bio-gide was used during the second stage operation. Two other patients had a partial loss of bone around an implant, but the implants osseointegrated and functioned normally. In one patient, one of the six implants failed after 5 months, and was subsequently removed when the abutments were inserted. A new implant in the same position was also lost because of lack of bone. In another patient, one of the six implants was lost after 10 months.

Overall, in the onlay group, 2 implants of a total of 86 were lost, resulting in  $2\%$  failure. There was no difference in failure of implants between the groups  $(p = 0.3)$  (Table 2). Some patients experienced disturbances of gait postoperatively, but were free of complaints from the donor site after 3 weeks. Two had temporary sensory disturbances, and two complained of mild pain over the wound after harvesting. Both disturbances and pain resolved after 3 months. One patient had residual pain that lasted longer than 6 months after an anterior harvest, but no patient had temporary or residual pain after a posterior procedure.

In neither group were further implants lost during the 17 (range 7-36) months' follow-up.

# Discussion

Clementschisch is thought to be the first clinician to have used free rib grafts to augment the resorbed mandible by an intraoral route.7 The method was popularised by Davis et al.,8 and also used for the maxilla by Terry et al.9 These grafts were fixed with wire osteosynthesis, but new techniques considerably improved the results of bony augmentation.10 Bell et al. were the first to describe Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafts in edentulous patients to improve the position of the maxilla and restore the intermaxillary relation.11

In patients with a class III relation, creating an implant site merely by enlarging the bony volume will lead to unfavourable loading of the dentures and impaired aesthetic and functional results.[12] In these cases a Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositioning of bone is indicated. This procedure was first described by Sailer as a one-stage operation,[3] and later modified by Cawood et al. as a two-stage one.[4] The insertion of the endosseous implants was delayed until the bone grafts had been revascularised. The delayed placement of implants resulted in less risk of their loss and made the use of a template possible.[4]

In the present study, the technique was slightly modified in that we used fewer osteosynthesis plates, which made it easier to plan and place the implants as only two miniplates were being used to stabilise the maxilla instead of four. The microplates that had been used to fix the cortical bone that formed the new floor of the sinus were not used because they cannot be removed later. By then they are completely covered by bone and can compromise the positioning of the implants. The cortical bone was fixed with 4/0 polyglactin 910 sutures (Vicryl) instead. The stability of the procedure was not compromised by using fewer plates.

A Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional grafts provides an increase in bony volume and a correction in the relation of the jaw to ensure optimal support and functional loading of the implants. It also makes it possible to place the implants through keratinised mucosa. Some authors have claimed that keratinised mucosa surrounding the abutments is a prerequisite for peri-implant health.[13,14]

Results from earlier studies and from the present study show good success rates for implants in both groups.[15-18] The implants used in this study were from different companies and manufacturers and  $12 - 13\mathrm{mm}$  long, randomly used in both groups, so the source does not seem to influence the survival between the groups.

Maxillary reconstruction with a Le Fort I osteotomy, bony interposition, and insertion of implants in a second stage seems a predictable way to ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes for a group of patients with a reversed maxillomandibular relation.

There were no dehiscences of soft tissue in the Le Fort I group, and vertical relapse of the down-grafted maxilla and bony resorption were of no clinical relevance at the time the implants were placed 5-6 months later.

We did the buccal osteotomy in the Le Fort I group with a round burr instead of a reciprocal saw, after which we raised the sinus membrane carefully. In doing so we were unable to prevent little tears, but in no patient did we see entrapment cysts of the sinus epithelium as have been described by others.[5] Complications such as sinusitis tend to occur in previously unhealthy sinuses.[19]

Major complications have been documented, however.[20-23] Massive haemorrhage is possible during interpositional grafting and Le Fort I osteotomy. These relatively invasive operations can also give rise to haemorrhage as a result of accidental laceration of the major palatine artery or other branches of the maxillary artery.[24] Occasionally a difficult osteotomy or down-fracture, or both, may be encountered. This is likely to be related to atypical maxillary morphology. Comprehensive preoperative cone beam imaging is probably helpful in dealing with this and therefore reduces the likelihood of complications.

The possibilities of three-dimensional imaging also encourage the use of alternatives to bone grafting. In patients with no appreciable interarch discrepancy, the use of a zygomatic fixture is an alternative that can be considered if the maxilla is extremely atrophic.[25]

In conclusion, the results of this study together with published evidence show that patients with atrophic maxillas can be predictably and successfully rehabilitated with bone grafts and a two-stage implant procedure. The use of fewer osteosynthesis plates in the Le Fort I group made it easier to plan and place the implants and did not seem to compromise the stability of the procedure. The choice between a Le Fort I osteotomy or a sinus lifting procedure with onlay grafting should depend on the interarch relations and the need for soft tissue support. Only a considerable interarch discrepancy outweighs the potential risks of a more invasive Le Fort I osteotomy.
