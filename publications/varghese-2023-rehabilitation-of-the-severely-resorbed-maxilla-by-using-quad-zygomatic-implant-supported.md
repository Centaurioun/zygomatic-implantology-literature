# ABSTRACT

Statement of problem. Quad zygomatic implants have been used as a treatment option for patients with a severely resorbed maxilla. However, data on the average rate of success of the prosthesis, survival of the zygomatic implants, and associated complications are sparse.

Purpose. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess prosthetic and zygomatic implant success of treating severe maxillary resorption with prostheses supported by 4 zygomatic implants, with an additional review on potential complications.

Material and methods. A comprehensive search of studies published in English between January 2001 and December 2020 was performed in the PubMed, OVID, EBSCO, and EMBASE databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021219468). The population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) question was "What is the effectiveness of oral rehabilitations using only 4 zygomatic implants placed in severely resorbed maxillae?" The search results were subjected to a systematic review for articles reporting prosthetic success and zygomatic implant survival. Prosthetic success was analyzed by using a fixed-effects inverse-variance model. The random-effects model was adopted for meta-analysis as moderate heterogeneity was identified among studies that reported implant survival in quad zygoma treatments. The quality of publications was appraised by using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklists.

Results. Of the 82 titles, 7 studies that met the inclusion criteria without an overlap of patient cohorts were quantitatively analyzed for the average rate of prosthetic success and implant survival. All prostheses in the aggregated studies were immediately loaded with acrylic resin interim prostheses replaced by a definitive prosthesis, which consisted of overdentures retained by bar splinting  $(n = 2)$ , metal bar-reinforced prostheses  $(n = 2)$ , fixed screw-retained acrylic resin prostheses  $(n = 34)$ , and screw-retained titanium prostheses with ceramic or acrylic resin teeth  $(n = 75)$ . Technical complications of zygomatic implants included mobility associated with a machined surface and fracture of the abutment screw. The most common prosthetic complications reported were fracture of the definitive prosthesis and loss of the interim prosthesis subsequent to the failure of at least 1 zygomatic implant. The results showed that prostheses supported by quad zygoma implants displayed an overall success of  $100\%$ $(\mathrm{Cl} = 95\%, \mathrm{l}^2 = 0.00\%, P = .850)$ , whereas zygomatic implants showed a survival rate of  $98\%$ $(\mathrm{Cl} = 95\%, \mathrm{l}^2 = 60.48\%, P = .040)$  with minimal implant failures and few complications.

Conclusions. Although the data analysis showed favorable results for rehabilitating severely resorbed maxillae by using quad zygoma with high prosthetic success and high implant survival rate, further long-term clinical studies are required to strengthen the evidence. However, potential implant and prosthetic complications should be considered while planning this treatment approach. (J Prosthet Dent 2023;130:543-52)

# Clinical Implications

A prosthesis supported by 4 zygomatic implants to rehabilitate a severely resorbed maxilla is an effective treatment option in patients where bone augmentation procedures are contraindicated.

Residual ridge resorption subsequent to tooth loss is a chronic, progressive, irreversible, and cumulative condition. $^{1,2}$  Osseointegrated implants have enabled the rehabilitation of completely edentulous patients and are a standard mode of treatment. $^{2,3}$  However, clinicians often augment the ridge with autogenous or alloplastic bone materials when sufficient bone volume is not available, especially in the posterior maxilla. $^{4-8}$

The introduction of zygomatic implants by Brænemark in 1988 has allowed clinicians to find sufficient anchorage in the zygomatic bone for oral rehabilitation.9 Although anatomical studies have validated the excellent quality of zygomatic bone and have stressed the importance of the cortical portion of zygomatic bone for anchoring implants,10-14 2 zygomatic implants are not sufficient to support the fixed prosthesis. As a result, conventional implants in the anterior portion of the maxilla may be necessary but can only be achieved without bone grafting if there is adequate bone in that region.13 An alternative option is to place 2 zygomatic implants in each zygoma, also known as the quad zygoma approach.15

In addition to the original clinical use of zygomatic implants in patients with extensive defects of the maxilla caused by tumor resections, trauma, or congenital defects, the use has been expanded to edentulous patients with severe maxillary resorption, with more patients seeking fixed prostheses irrespective of pre-existing severe ridge resorption.[2,12-16-18] However, the complexity of implant placement with its underlying risks and prosthetic complications should not be underestimated before it is adopted as a standard practice in rehabilitating edentulous patients with fixed prostheses.[18]

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify and synthesize the presently available evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral rehabilitations with only 4 zygomatic implants in the severely resorbed maxilla by analyzing implant survival and prosthetic success. The null hypothesis was that the quad zygomatic approach for treating the severely resorbed maxilla would not be effective in terms of prosthetic success and zygomatic implant survival. The criterion for rejecting the null hypothesis was a confidence interval (CI) percentage of less than 95 ( $\alpha = .05$ ).

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

This systematic review was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.[19] The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (Registration number: CRD42021219468).

An electronic search for literature published between 2001 and 2020 in databases including PubMed, OVID, EBSCO, and EMBASE was carried out by 2 reviewers (K.G.V., N.K.). The search strategy used to search for bibliography on the online databases was (((severe* resorbed maxilla*) OR (severe* atroph* maxilla*)) OR (severe* resorption maxilla*)) AND (((Quad zygoma*)) OR (quad* zygoma)) OR (quad* zygoma* implant*)) OR (four zygoma* implant*)) AND (((maxillary prostheses*)) OR (over denture)) OR (implant supported over denture)), and the filters were humans, English, and from January 2001 to December 2020. Earlier studies were not sought to provide the latest evidence regarding implant and prosthetic success. The types of studies included retrospective, prospective, and randomized controlled trials that studied implant survival and prosthetic success in quad zygoma rehabilitations. Patients with severely resorbed maxillae requiring prosthetic rehabilitation without the need for bone augmentation were included. Studies that evaluated aspects related to more than 4 zygomatic implants and those published in languages other than English were excluded (Table 1).

All studies identified by the search were analyzed based on title, abstract, and full text by 2 of the authors (K.G.V., N.K.), and data were extracted that included the first author, year of study, sample size, number of zygomatic implants placed, number of successful implants, number of prostheses, number of successful prostheses, complications, loading protocol, success criteria defined by individual studies, and follow-up months. Disagreement between the investigators concerning the included studies was resolved with a third reviewer (N.G.) to achieve consensus. The reviewers were not blinded to authors, journals, date of publication, or results. The effectiveness of quad zygoma restorations

was assessed by using outcome measures such as prosthetic success and implant survival.

Risk of bias assessment in individual studies was performed to strengthen the systematic review. Of the 10 included publications, $^{14,20-28}$  8 studies $^{14,20,25,28}$  underwent a quality assessment with the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist for cohort studies $^{29,30}$  (Table 2). The remaining 2 studies $^{26,27}$  were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and were assessed by using the CASP RCT checklist $^{29,30}$  (Table 3). The CASP tool uses a systematic approach based on specific criteria in which each criterion received a response of "Yes," "No," or "cannot tell" and is summarized in Tables 2 and 3. $^{30}$  Each study had a possible maximum score of 12 for cohort studies $^{14,20-28}$  or 13 for RCTs. $^{29,30}$

Statistical analyses were performed by using a statistical software program (STATA v16.0; Stata Corp). Based on the variation in heterogeneity between the zygomatic implant survival and prosthetic success data analysis, a random-effects model and a fixed-effects inverse-variance model were used, respectively.[31]

# RESULTS

The initial database search identified 82 articles, from which 28 duplicate articles were removed. Titles and abstracts of the remaining 54 articles were assessed for potentially relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies that specified rehabilitation with 4 zygomatic implants were included. A total of 18 articles were selected for full-text screening. Of these, 8 articles did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.


Of the 10 remaining articles, Davó et al $^{14,20,22-24}$  reported results of the same study population at different follow-up times. For studies with a similar participant sample, the study with the longest follow-up was selected to avoid overlap of patient cohorts. $^{23,24}$  A total of 7 articles remained for quantitative analysis after the screening and filtering process (Fig. 1), of which 2 were RCTs, $^{26,27}$  2 retrospective studies, $^{21,28}$  and 3 prospective studies. $^{23-25}$  However, all 10 articles were included for systematic qualitative review. The data extracted from the publication were tabulated chronologically and are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

Of the 7 selected studies, a total of 452 zygomatic implants in quad zygoma configuration and 113 prostheses supported by 4 zygomatic implants were evaluated, with an average follow-up period of 45.6 months. The duration of all studies was at least 12 months. The number of successful zygomatic implants was not specified in the study by Miglioranca et al,[21] while the number of successful prostheses could not be determined from the study by Petrungaro et al.[28] As a result, these 2 studies did not provide sufficient information for statistical analysis.

All prostheses in the aggregated studies had been immediately loaded with acrylic resin interim prostheses within 3 hours to 1 week. All participants received

A random-effects model has been considered preferable to a fixed-effects model in the case of substantial heterogeneity.[31] The heterogeneity statistics among the studies that reported the success of zygomatic implants showed that the results were not consistent. Although all of the outcomes were positive, the range of values was

The analysis indicated an overall success of  $98\%$  and a statistically significant difference among the studies regarding the success of zygomatic implants  $(P=.040, I^2=60.48\%)$  (Fig. 2).


The prosthesis success analysis used a fixed-effects inverse-variance model as the heterogeneity statistics showed no variability among the studies  $(\mathrm{I}2 = 0\%)$  (Fig. 3). Under the fixed-effect model, the true effect size for all studies has usually been assumed to be identical and the only reason for variation in any of the studies is random error.[32] Therefore, despite the prosthetic failures reported by Esposito et al[26] and Davó et al,[27] no significant difference was identified among the included studies. The weightage assigned to these studies[26,27] was significantly smaller than that of the remaining studies[21,23-25] that concluded an overall success of  $100\%$ $(P=.850, I^2=0.00\%)$  (Fig. 3). In addition, publication bias was illustrated by using a funnel plot of the studies that reported prosthetic success, demonstrating that the RCTs by Esposito et al[26] and Davó et al[27] straddled the neutral line (Fig. 4). This asymmetry in the funnel plot can be attributed to the lack of negative studies. However, the sensitivity analyses of these studies showed no significant change in the overall result.

# DISCUSSION

The data in this study suggested that the quad zygomatic approach is an effective treatment option for patients with a severely resorbed maxilla. The studies were assessed based on CI percentage, and none of the studies reported a CI less than  $95\%$ $(\alpha = .05)$ , thereby rejecting the null hypothesis. Zygomatic implants have been documented in the literature as an alternative treatment to bone augmentation procedures such as guided bone regeneration or distraction osteogenesis, which aims to obtain adequate bone height and width for proper 3-dimensional implant placement. Although augmentation techniques are reliable and scientifically documented, they are time-consuming, are not cost-effective, and require invasive surgery with possible associated morbidity of the donor site. Additionally, the extended duration of treatment can be uncomfortable for patients who are not allowed to wear a removable prosthesis during the healing time and undergo 2 surgeries. These issues adversely affect the patients' acceptance of implant treatment for oral rehabilitation in resorbed maxilla cases.[33]


When bone augmentation procedures have failed or cannot be used, the 2 main alternative options for rehabilitating patients with a severely resorbed maxilla are short implants and zygomatic implants.[34-36] Although short implants have become more prevalent in dentistry, the long-term predictability of this treatment modality is inconclusive owing to risk factors such as increased crown-to-implant ratio, high bone density in the region, and higher occlusal force, which may increase stress.[37,38] Besides, there is a lack of evidence to explain the pattern of marginal bone loss, which may significantly compromise and further worsen the treatment prognosis.[39,40]

Recently, zygomatic implant-supported rehabilitation has become common in developed countries for edentulous patients with severe maxillary resorption who seek fixed prostheses for rehabilitation.[18,41] Bothur et al[42] suggested the use of multiple zygomatic implants to support prostheses. Despite many studies with positive long-term outcomes, only a few randomized controlled trials compare their clinical effectiveness with alternative means for rehabilitation.[18,43] The use of 4 zygomatic implants was primarily indicated in patients with severely resorbed maxillae, where bone augmentation procedures were required for placement of conventional implants.[12,14,20,22,25-28]

In the present review, a successful zygomatic implant is considered to be one that is stable without any pain or discomfort. According to Petrungaro et al,[28] implant failure is associated with marginal bone loss, which results in additional alveolar atrophy, and when this failure involves implants in an implant-supported prosthesis, it renders the prosthesis nonfunctional.[28] Davó et al[22-24] considered slight lateral mobility or minor bending movement acceptable only for zygomatic implants, while rotating implants were described as failed and were removed. Of the included articles, 2 studies report a  $100\%$  success for all zygomatic implants placed in a quad zygoma configuration.[23,25]

A clinically stable prosthesis that functioned as intended and had not been removed for 2 weeks or more during the study period was considered successful by the authors in this study, which is comparable with the criterion used by Davo et al to define prosthetic success.[22-24] Miglioranza et al[21] measured the prosthetic success based on mechanical complications such as screw loosening. However, prostheses not delivered or prosthetic replacement due to implant failures was considered to be a factor in the success of the prostheses in the study by Esposito et al.[26] Although prosthetic complications were rarely observed in most of the included studies, Davo et al[24] record fracture of a definitive prosthesis, 36 months after surgery. However, after 5 years of function, the study does not report any unsuccessful prostheses, as the fracture was subsequently repaired and the prosthesis was rendered clinically stable. In another study by the same authors, a prosthesis failure was reported after the loss of 3 of the 4 zygomatic implants because of the mobility of implants observed 10 months after loading.[27] Esposito et al[26] also report loss of an interim prosthesis due to failure of both distal zygomatic implants 15 days after placement.[26] Of those included in this review, 4 of 6 studies reported no prosthetic failures (Fig. 3). The success criteria for zygomatic implants and prostheses in individual studies have been tabulated and are listed in the Supplementary table 1 (Available online).


Although various studies have suggested zygomatic implants as an alternative approach for severely resorbed maxillary restoration, $^{12,15,44,45}$  the incidence of complications should not be underestimated as suggested by
Figure 4. Funnel plot calculated for selected studies reporting on success of quad zygoma restorations illustrating publication bias. A, Zygomatic implant success. B, Prosthesis success. CI, confidence interval.

Lan et al.46 It may present multiple risks, such as maxillary sinusitis, oroantral fistula, infraorbital paresthesia, peri-implant diseases, orbital perforations, and technical complications such as machined implant surface (and resultant mobility), fracture of abutment screw, or difficulty in prosthetic adaptation, which may demand a more experienced and skilled surgeon to perform this treatment approach when compared with conventional implants 18,47-49 (Table 6).

Davó et al[20] reported the occurrence of an oroantral fistula that allowed the transit of liquids from the oral cavity to the antrum and nose, followed by sinusitis in 1 patient, which was resolved by antibiotics. In addition, meatotomy was performed to close the oroantral communication.[20] In another study[14] that evaluated the clinical outcome of maxillary prostheses supported by 4 immediately loaded zygomatic implants after 1 year of function, the authors reported no sinusitis or sinus problems; however, 1 patient experienced an infection followed by a fistula in 1 zygomatic implant, which was successfully treated.

Miglioranca et al $^{21}$  observed dehiscence in the cervical portion of 2 zygomatic implants, which was not associated with irritation or inflammation. This type of soft-tissue complication can be attributed to leaving a considerable portion of the implant exposed to the overlying soft tissue. The absence of inflammation in the dehiscence areas could be related to the periodic professional and strictly controlled personal hygiene protocol included in their study.

Despite an overall success of  $100\%$  for zygomatic implants and prostheses, Agliardi et al[25] recorded soft-tissue recession up to the rough surface of zygomatic implants and the development of oroantral communication and sinusitis in 1 of the participants under study. The situation was resolved by removing deposits from the implant surface followed by chlorhexidine rinsing (0.2% for 15 days) and antibiotic therapy.[25]


A recent study by Lan et al[46] reported a  $5\%$  pooled incidence of prosthetic complications and that stress concentration was the main reason for prosthesis fracture and complications, for which a wide distribution of multiple zygomatic implants was recommended to avoid extensive cantilevers. For all the participants in the present review, an immediate loading protocol was followed by a definitive prosthesis 4 to 6 months after surgery. The high zygomatic implant survival rate of  $98\%$  [0.96, 1.00]  $(\mathrm{CI} = 95\%, \mathrm{I}^2 = 60.48\%, P = .040)$  implies that quad zygomatic implants can be used with immediate loading protocols with satisfactory results. This finding was consistent with that of Chrcanovic and Abreu, who reported that immediate occlusal loading in zygomatic implant-supported prostheses was effective with reduced morbidity and time of treatment, thereby increasing patient acceptance.[50]

The total quality score ranged between 8 and 10. The most common shortcoming among the studies was limited sample size (mean  $= 13.2$ , range  $= 2$  to 40) and lack of long-term assessment of treatment prognosis. Three studies by Davó et al in 2013,  $^{23}$  2015,  $^{24}$  and  $2018^{27}$  considered the lack of pretreatment and post-treatment comparative data (for peri-implant marginal bone level evaluation) as a study limitation.

Despite their complications, the results in the present review reveal the use of prostheses supported by quad zygomatic implants to be an effective technique in rehabilitating patients with a severely resorbed maxilla. However, increasing the follow-up time and further long-term randomized controlled clinical studies would have provided more robust evidence regarding the efficacy of prostheses supported by quad zygomatic implants. Another limitation of the present study was the lack of data from unpublished studies and non-peer-reviewed literature which would have avoided the asymmetry in the funnel plot graphs (Fig. 4).


Further systematic studies and analyses on this subject must consider all the limitations to strengthen the evidence. Any future protocol for the clinical incorporation of quad zygomatic implants for prosthetic rehabilitation of participants with a severely atrophied maxilla should consider all the possible complications described in this review.

# CONCLUSIONS

Based on the findings of this systematic review and meta-analyses, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. The quad zygoma approach for restoring severely resorbed maxilla is a successful and effective treatment modality with an average success rate of  $98\%$  [0.96, 1.00]  $(I^2 = 56.38\%, P = .040)$  for zygomatic implants.
2. Prostheses supported by 4 zygomatic implants had an overall success of  $100\%$  [0.99, 1.01]  $(I^2 = 0.00\%, P = .850)$  despite the failures reported in 2 studies included in this review.
3. Potential implant and prosthetic complications must be considered while planning a quad zygoma approach for patients with a severely resorbed maxilla.
