Rehabilitation of a completely edentulous patient can become challenging when associated with severe atrophy of the residual bone. The residual bony architecture of the maxilla and mandible undergoes a life-long catabolic remodeling. The reduction in available bone volume because of alveolar resorption and pneumatization of the maxillary sinus subsequent to tooth loss makes it difficult for the clinician to use the conventional approach with removable prostheses or dental implants, especially in the posterior maxilla. The resulting compromise in masticatory function and speech severely impacts the patient's quality of life.

Although various methods of overcoming this problem

# ABSTRACT

Statement of problem. Stresses applied to zygomatic implants have been determined to be transferred mainly to the zygomatic bone; however, consensus regarding the stress distribution pattern in the bone surrounding zygomatic implants has not yet been reached.

Purpose. The purpose of this 3-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) study was to visually compare the stress distribution pattern in 2 different zygomatic implant treatment modalities and evaluate the effect of masseter musculature involvement.

Material and methods. A 3D FEA craniofacial model was constructed from the computed tomography (CT) data of a selected patient with a severely atrophic edentulous maxilla. Modeled zygomatic and conventional implants were inserted into the craniofacial model supporting a prosthesis superstructure. Two types of treatment were considered in the study: 2 zygomatic implants placed bilaterally or 2 zygomatic implants placed in conjunction with at least 2 conventional implants at the anterior maxilla. The models were loaded with a vertical force of  $150\mathrm{N}$ , a lateral force of  $50\mathrm{N}$ , and a distributed occlusal force of  $300\mathrm{N}$  applied to the insertion area of the masseter muscle. The stresses on and deformations of the bones and implants were then observed and compared with and without the involvement of the musculature component.

Results. The stresses were distributed efficiently along the vertical and horizontal facial buttresses, as in the dentate skull; however, a difference in distribution pattern was observed when the models were loaded without applying the muscle component. The maximum deformation of bones surrounding the implants occurred in the abutment connection of the conventional anterior implant in the model with an additional conventional anterior implant.

Conclusions. The FEA revealed the stresses were distributed efficiently along the vertical and horizontal facial buttresses, as in the dentate skull. However, the stresses in both models were concentrated in the zygomatic bone when incorporating the muscle component. Therefore, incorporating muscular force into FEA studies could affect the analysis result. (J Prosthet Dent 2023;129:597.e1-e8)

# Clinical Implications

The skull bone displays a higher stress and deformation value when muscular forces are incorporated into FEA studies. Clinicians and researchers should consider this while analyzing the stress distribution in skull models.

have been described, $^{4-6}$  when sufficient bone volume is unavailable or bone augmentation procedures have failed or been contraindicated, alternative anatomic structures in the region such as the zygoma or pterygoid bone have been used. The implant design is modified to suit the anatomy of these structures. $^{7-11}$  The introduction of zygomatic implants by Brænemark in 1988 has provided sufficient anchorage in the zygomatic bone for oral rehabilitation. $^{12-14}$  Several anatomic studies have validated the excellent quality of zygomatic bone and have stressed the importance of the cortical portion of zygomatic bone for anchoring implants. $^{15-23}$  However, as 2 zygomatic implants have been considered insufficient to support the fixed prosthesis, $^{24}$  conventional implants in the anterior portion of the maxilla may be necessary; this can only be achieved without bone grafting if there is adequate bone in the anterior part of the maxilla. $^{18}$  The treatments currently used consist of either 2 zygomatic implants placed posteriorly in conjunction with at least 2 conventional implants in the anterior region of the maxilla or 4 zygomatic implants, known as quad zygoma. $^{25}$

The stress distribution and load transfer to the implant-bone interface is a critical issue affecting the success rate of implants.[26] Direct clinical evaluation would be essential to scrutinizing the biomechanical response of an implant to the surrounding bone. Nonetheless, a direct assessment of all components would be nearly impossible because of the complex structures, ethical issues, and prolonged study periods.

Alternative in vitro methods, including experimental, analytical, computational models, digital photoelasticity, strain gauges, and finite element analysis (FEA), have been used to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of dental implants.[26] Each of these methods complements the other with its advantages and limitations, with none presumed to be better than the other.[26] However, FEA is indispensable in analyzing situations involving multiple complex geometries with different implant configurations.[27] FEA breaks down a complex body into smaller components, modeled mathematically. Virtual forces are applied to the overall body of known material properties, allowing the internal stresses to be calculated at a given point.[28]

Stresses applied to zygomatic implants have been determined to be transferred mainly to the zygomatic bone.[29] Therefore, the purpose of this 3-dimensional (3D) FEA study was to investigate the validity of this conclusion and compare the stress distribution pattern around the zygomatic implants in 2 rehabilitation options—quad zygoma compared with 2 zygomatic implants with conventional anterior implants. The hypothesis was that the stresses applied to zygomatic implants are transferred to the zygomatic bone.


# MATERIAL AND METHODS

A 3D FEA model of a human skull was constructed based on the computed tomography (CT) image of a patient by using the standard Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board. The data from the CT scan were converted from the DICOM format with a software program (Mimics; Materialise) into a closed standard tessellation language (STL) model. Once the closed surface model was created, it was interpreted as a solid model representing the skull. The STL file of the modeled human skull was then imported to a design software program (SpaceClaim; SpaceClaim Corp) for assembly.

FEA models of zygomatic (Brænemark System zygomatic implant; Nobel Biocare) and conventional (Brænemark System Mk III Groovy; Nobel Biocare) implants were constructed 3-dimensionally based on the dimensions from the manufacturer's catalog. The appropriate length of the zygomatic implant was selected according to the distance between the crest of the alveolar process near the palate and the jugal point (JU) of the zygomatic bone. This distance was calculated to be  $52.3 \, \mathrm{mm}$ . Therefore, a Brænemark system zygomatic implant of  $42.5 \, \mathrm{mm}$  was determined to be suitable and was modeled according to the dimensions. A conventional anterior implant of size  $3.3 \times 11.5 \, \mathrm{mm}$  was selected because of the reduced alveolar bone width in the anterior region. The prosthesis superstructure was conceived as a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) milled titanium alloy symmetrical curved bar with a section of  $10 \times 8 \, \mathrm{mm}$  and constructed using a 3D CAD (SpaceClaim; SpaceClaim Corp) software program.

The implants were placed in the skull model, resulting in maximum contact with the bone. The apices of the posterior zygomatic implant were placed as close to the external surface of the zygomatic bone as possible or just extruding through the surface. A cavity command was applied to the skull so that a hole was created in the skull where the implants and skull intersected. This resulted in a model of half of the skull with 2 implants in position and connected by half of a fixed complete arch titanium bar.

All CAD models were imported as different part files, and 2 model groups were created, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. For the boundary conditions, the mid

All the assemblies were imported into a simulation integration platform (Ansys Workbench; ANSYS, Inc), and a project schematic of test conditions consisting of 2 types of implant configuration was created to restore patients with severe resorption of the maxilla. Engineering data for each material used in this FEA were input. All materials were assumed to be homogenous, isotropic, and linearly elastic. These materials were derived from the Young modulus and Poisson ratio (Table 2).


Loading consists of a simulated occlusal force applied as a distributed vertical load of  $150\mathrm{N}$  to the occlusal surface and a lateral load of  $50\mathrm{N}$  to the palatal surface of the superstructure.[31,32] The FEA evaluated the stresses with and without applying the masseter muscle force component. A distributed occlusal force of  $300\mathrm{N}$  was applied to the insertion area of the masseter muscle on the zygomatic arch and zygomatic process of the maxilla to simulate the action and pass downward and backward.[25] The stresses transferred to the bone surrounding zygomatic implants in the craniofacial region were analyzed and compared for the 2 restorative situations considered in this study.

Maximum principal stresses are stress components when the basis of other stress tensors is zero and define the stress concentrated in a specific region. However, von Mises stress is a scalar quantity obtained from the stresses acting on any structure. Evaluating von Mises stress is essential to measure the overall stress distributed on the skull model in all the axial planes. In contrast, maximum principal stress is confined to stress exerted at a particular area during uniaxial loading.[33] Since excess loads being transferred away from the area of implant insertion was a possibility, von Mises stress was considered in this study. All the models were solved to obtain maximum equivalent von Mises stresses (in MPa) and total deformation (in mm). After computation, these results were analyzed and compared for the stress distribution pattern, maximum stress, and total deformation value.

# RESULTS

A static structural simulation in the simulation integration platform (Ansys Workbench; ANSYS, Inc) yielded a maximum von Mises (equivalent) stress for each test condition. The software program displayed stresses with the help of colored contour bands and isolines and their respective legends. In addition, all components were probed for total deformation. Pseudocolors illustrated the stress distribution on the geometrical model. The red-

Although all plots were compared on the same chromatic scale, a logarithmic color scale was used to compare the pattern of stress distribution. A visual comparative analysis of stress distribution within the skull in Models 1 and 2 under the different loading conditions is shown in Figures 3, 4.

The stress due to vertical loading  $(150\mathrm{N})$  in Model 1 was more widely distributed within the craniofacial structures compared with Model 2 (Fig. 5). However, when a uniform  $50~\mathrm{N}$  lateral load was applied to the palatal surface of the prosthesis superstructure, a significant magnitude of stress was noted in Model 1 (52.4 MPa) compared with 39.1 MPa in Model 2 (Fig. 6). Although the stresses were mainly concentrated in the

maxillary region in both models, the maximum stress was observed at the implant-abutment connection in the conventional anterior implant in Model 1. A situation where vertical and lateral loads acted simultaneously was simulated in this study. Higher von Mises equivalent stress in such a situation was observed in Model 2 (58.5 MPa) with the quad zygomatic configuration (Fig. 3).

Stresses with and without the effect of musculature were simulated. Maximum stresses (57.3 MPa) were concentrated in the Model 2 assembly in the abutment-implant connection of both zygomatic implants while incorporating a masseter muscle force of  $300\mathrm{N}$  (Figs. 3, 4).

In addition to equivalent stress analysis, total deformation plots were derived from each model under all the loading conditions tested. The maximum deformation of bone surrounding the implants occurred in the abutment connection of the conventional anterior implant in Model 1. While the deformation seen in the skull bone was approximately  $6\mu \mathrm{m}$  for Models 1 and 2, the deformation ranged between  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $4\mu \mathrm{m}$  when the lateral load was applied. However, the incorporation of masseter muscle force increased the deformation to  $17~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  in Model 2 and  $21~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  in Model 1. The maximum deformation region was near the bone landmark JU point, where the end of the zygomatic implant was fixed (Fig. 7).

# DISCUSSION

The model geometry, bone-implant interface, boundary conditions, and material properties are the 4 different assumptions typically made in FEA studies relating to implant dentistry as described by Geng et al.[27] Although different model geometries have been used to represent the implants and other tissues supporting the implants, simplistic boxes or cylindrical shapes have been used to describe the models.[34] While such shapes are an oversimplification, they may be sufficient when stresses are not distributed over large distances in the bone or when the area of interest is in the restorative components of the prosthesis. However, the zygomatic and conventional implant model used in the present study was created in a software program (SpaceClaim; SpaceClaim Corp) based on the dimensions specified in the manufacturer's catalog.[30]

The implant surface in the study was assumed to be completely interfaced over the entire surface area contacting the bone. Therefore, forces and displacements were determined to be identical in the 2 structures at the interface. Boundary conditions on the computer model used in the study were applied to generate force-displacement results by restraining several surfaces of the model.[27] A smaller model with fewer elements reduces the analysis complexity and lessens the requirements for computer resources. Therefore, only half of the skull and prosthesis were modeled in the FEA. The model was entirely restrained at the superior faces of the skull, while the medial faces of the skull and prosthesis superstructure were retrained by using a roller or slider restraint. This method simulated the presence of a mirrored right side of the skull. The application of restraints on the model allowed the implant to be slightly displaced within the model instead of the entire movement of the model.

The models created from digital radiographic techniques were reformatted to yield anatomically accurate model geometries in FEA. However, Strait et al<sup>35</sup> showed that when species-specific average skull values were used in FEA, accurate results could be obtained by considering the bone as homogenous and linearly elastic. Therefore, the study assumed the skull bone as isotropic and homogenous, simplifying model construction and analysis.

All forces and models were analyzed, and the maximum von Mises stresses and total deformation for both models were plotted by using a colored scale. The maximum overall stresses observed under a force of 150 N ranged from 17 MPa to 44 MPa, a range consistent with Ujigawa et al,[29] Miyamoto et al,[36] and Freedman et al.[37] When considering 50 N lateral loads, significantly higher stress was observed in the prosthetic superstructure and implant assembly, consistent with Tie et al[20] and Ishak et al.[21]

Anatomic studies by Nkenke et al $^{22}$  and Rossi et al $^{23}$  showed that the zygomatic bone offers a larger surface area and length of bone to support the zygomatic implant than the maxilla. The parameters used in the present FEA were similar to those of Ujigawa et al, $^{29}$  who observed the stress distribution using FEA on a CT model for half an edentulous skull with 1 zygomatic implant and 2 conventional implants to support a fixed prosthesis superstructure.

The present study incorporated an occlusal force of  $150\mathrm{N}$  and a lateral force of  $50\mathrm{N}$  on the prosthesis. A 300 N force was also applied to the zygomatic arch to simulate the muscular action of the masseter. When a  $150\mathrm{N}$  occlusal force was used, higher von Mises stresses were noted in the maxillary bone for multiple- and single-implant models. In contrast, the opposite was found when the  $50\mathrm{N}$  lateral force was applied to the multiple-implant model. The zygomatic bone displayed higher stress when the single-implant model used lateral force. The present FEA concluded that the maxillary bone might carry a more significant load from the implant than the zygomatic bone in most situations, consistent with the present FEA results.


Most FEA studies have incorporated the action of masseter musculature into the FEA models to improve the simulation accuracy.[20,21,29,36] While this might more accurately replicate the action of muscular forces applied to the structures supporting the implant, it could confuse the results. However, as the simulated force at the masseter muscle attachment was applied close to the apex of the zygomatic implant, it became difficult to differentiate between the observed forces from the implant and those from the masseter muscle.[30,36] Therefore, in the present study, a separate analysis was done with each force acting individually and combining all the forces in the study. Forces were applied to inferior and lateral surfaces of the prosthesis superstructure in each model. The maximum von Mises stresses were analyzed with individual forces acting on the superstructure and when both magnitudes worked simultaneously with and without the simulated action of the masseter muscle.

The models used in the present study consistently showed low stresses in the zygomatic bone when the masseter muscle force component was suppressed. Low stresses were seen in the zygomatic bone when the lateral and vertical loads were given individually. In this situation, the stresses were distributed laterally through the palate and vertically via the lateral maxilla and nasal buttress. This result led to the rejection of the research hypothesis and was consistent with that of Freedman et al[36] and challenges the widely held belief that stresses from the zygomatic implants are primarily dissipated through the zygomatic bone.[15,22,23,29]

Alexandridis et al[38] investigated stress distribution in the dentate human skull and reported that stresses were propagated along the nasal, zygomatic, and pterygoid buttresses. In the context of low zygomatic stresses observed under vertical and lateral loads in the present study, the significance of the maxilla in distributing the forces in and around osseointegrated zygomatic implants is likely to be more significant than previously appreciated in other studies. However, the importance of zygomatic bone in providing a large area of bone for primary stability should not be underestimated. Future research should consider these findings while designing analyses. The location of maximum stresses observed in both models was either in the prosthesis or in the implants at the abutment-implant connection area when vertical and lateral loading was applied individually. However, when both loading conditions were applied simultaneously with the masseter muscle force component incorporated, the maximum von Mises stresses shifted to the skull model with most of the stresses propagating to the midline. This distribution pattern can be expected as the midline was restrained in the lateral direction as part of the applied boundary conditions. While stresses can be distributed laterally in the prosthesis, achieving crossarch stabilization clinically would allow these stresses to be distributed to the contralateral implants and prosthetic components.


Limitations in the present study included that the model was derived from the CT data of a single patient; therefore, repeating the study using data from several different sample patient cohorts would contribute to the study observations and strengthen the findings. Although efforts were made to ensure the accurate material property was used, cranial bones do not behave as isotropic homogenous materials. However, the comparisons made between the models in the present study can be considered valid, as the same material properties were used in all models. The values were approximations of the actual values observed in vivo and should be validated by further research and direct clinical measurements.

# CONCLUSIONS

Based on the findings of this 3D FEA study, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. Stresses in both treatment conditions were not concentrated in the zygomatic bone, as observed in similar FEA studies. This was detected when the present analysis avoided masseter muscle forces to elicit the actual distribution of stresses under vertical and lateral loading.
2. The stresses were distributed efficiently along the vertical and horizontal facial buttresses, as in the dentate skull. The stresses transferred to the skull were lower than those obtained in the prosthesis and implants. Under both loading conditions, the stresses in the quad zygomatic model were lower than in the model with conventional anterior implants.
3. In terms of total deformation, implants underwent higher deformation than the skull bone in both loading conditions. However, the skull bone displayed a higher deformation value when the masseter muscle forces were considered. Therefore, incorporating muscular force into the FEA studies could affect the analysis result.

4. The facial skeleton did not evolve to support implants and fixed prostheses. However, the efficient distribution of stresses through the craniofacial structures suggests a high clinical success rate and reflects the adaptability of a biological system rather than the triumph of any material or design.
