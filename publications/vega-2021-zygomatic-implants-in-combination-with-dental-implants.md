Luis G. Vega, DDS*, Michael Border, DDS, MD

# KEYWORDS

- Zygoma implants - Dental implants - Atrophic maxilla

# KEY POINTS

- Zygoma implants with or without traditional dental implants are a safe and predictable first line of treatment in lieu of more time-consuming and financially burdensome traditional bone grafting approaches.
- When adequate maxillary alveolar bone is present, the placement of regular dental implants should always be considered with zygoma implants, becoming an adjuvant to the dental implant reconstruction.
- The goal of the combination of traditional and zygoma implants is to improve the distribution of biting forces, allowing an increase of the support of the final prosthesis.
- The single most important factor for success is the establishment of a prosthetically driven treatment plan between the surgeon and the restorative dentist.
- The selection of the proper combination of traditional and zygoma implants is based on the amount of residual maxillary alveolar bone, the biomechanical requirements of the final prosthesis, necessary hygiene considerations, finances as well as surgeon and restorative dentist preferences and experience.

# Patient evaluation

The complexity of implant reconstruction of the atrophic maxilla calls for a prosthetically driven treatment plan. Therefore, the single most important factor for treatment success is a team approach between the surgeon and the restorative dentist. The treatment goals and potential limitations are similar to those of traditional dental implant patients, with an assessment of the patient's chief complaint, perceptions, expectations, cooperation, and past surgical and medical history. The financial burdens of the surgical and prosthetic treatment plan should not be underestimated. Unique to zygoma implant candidates, a preoperative discussion should also include any history of failed implant/bone regeneration procedures, previous history of sinusitis, and any previous sinus surgeries.

The physical and radiographic examination is focused on the identification of residual areas where sufficient bone is present for traditional dental implant placement. The physical examination for zygoma implant patients is not unlike the examination used for traditional dental implant patients. In zygoma implant candidates, a focused examination also evaluates the availability of maxillary keratinized gingiva, examines the transition zone, which is generally placed higher than the smile line, making esthetic considerations less critical, and assesses the ability of the patient to adequately open their mouth to accommodate surgical instrumentation. Panorex imaging was previously sufficient for the preoperative radiographic evaluation of the severely atrophic maxilla. Since the advent of office-based computer tomographic (CT) imaging with 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, CT imaging has become the gold standard for preoperative implant evaluation and planning. CT imaging can also be used for computer-assisted planning, custom drill guide fabrication, and computer-aided surgical navigation systems. In addition, more complex cases may require a haptic approach, and 3D stereolithographic model fabrication is most useful.


# Planning

The preoperative planning starts with a critical analysis of the bone anatomy of the maxilla. The process is facilitated by dividing the maxilla into 3 zones: zone 1, premaxilla; zone 2, bicuspidis; zone 3, molars. This division is performed with the idea to identify residual maxillary alveolar bone where regular dental implants can be placed. Several distinct clinical scenarios can be described when combining traditional and zygoma implants (Fig. 1). These scenarios include the following:

# Two zygoma implants and two anterior regular dental implants

Patients with adequate bone stock in zone 1, but bone deficits in zones 2 and 3, are included in this scenario. These patients demonstrate available bone to only accommodate 2 regular implants in the premaxilla and 1 zygoma implant posteriorly on each side. Normally, the 2 dental implants are placed around the area of the canines, and 2 zygomas are placed in the second premolar/first molar region. A potential third traditional implant can be placed in the middle of the maxilla to decrease the span between the dental implants and to increase the anteroposterior spread, thus improving the distribution of forces.

# Two zygoma implants and four anterior regular dental implants

Patients with adequate bone stock in zones 1 and 2, but deficient in zone 3, are included in this scenario (Fig. 2). These patients may be managed with the placement of 4 regular implants within zones 1 and 2, and 1 posterior zygoma implant bilaterally. Usually, 2 of the dental implants are placed in the sites of the central incisors; the other 2 are placed around the area of the canines, and 2 zygomas in the second premolar/ first molar region. Some practitioners will choose to place only 3 traditional implants to increase the space between them with the purpose of facilitating the hygiene of the final prosthesis. Although most of these cases can be managed with more traditional techniques, such as an all-on-four, this approach normally represents a reaction to an increase in biomechanical demands of the final maxillary dental rehabilitation. For example, the combination of regular and zygoma implants will better distribute the biting forces generated by patients with a full set of natural opposing dentition or patients with parafunctional habits. Another example is when zygoma implants are considered to help protect regular implants in cases in which there is a compromised amount of premaxillary alveolar bone that can only house dental implants that are either thin, short, or a combination of both.


# Four zygoma implants and two anterior regular dental implants

Patients with adequate bone stock in zone 1, but bone deficits in zones 2 and 3, are included in this scenario (Fig. 3). These patients demonstrate available bone to accommodate 2 regular implants anteriorly and 2 zygoma implants bilaterally. Typically, the 2 dental implants are placed in the sites of the central incisors, the anterior zygomas around the area of the canines and the 2 posterior zygomas in the second premolar/ first molar region. This type of cases could potentially be managed by using a quad-zygoma approach, but the addition of 2 dental implants anteriorly allows the decrease of anteroposterior cantilevers in cases whereby the final dental rehabilitation needs to withstand increased biomechanical demands as described above.

# Four zygoma implants and two posterior regular dental implants

Patients with adequate bone stock posterior in zone 3, with deficits in zones 1 and 2, are included in this scenario (Fig. 4). The anterior zygoma implant is placed around the area of the lateral incisors/canines with the 2 posterior zygoma implants located in the second premolar/first molar region, and a regular dental implant placed posterior to the first molar. Although most of these patients will do well with a quadzygoma approach, cases with increased biomechanical demands will benefit from the placement of 1 implant in available bone of the molar area, tuberosity, or pterygoid plate bilaterally.

# Unilateral zygoma implants and regular implants

In this patient population, there is adequate alveolar bone in zones 1, 2, and 3 in 1 side, but there is deficiency in the other side (Fig. 5). These cases are treated with several regular dental implants in 1 side in combination with 1 or 2 zygoma implants in the other, allowing for cross-arch stabilization. An example of this type of scenario is when patients have undergone traditional dental rehabilitations and have 1 or several implants fail, and no bone stock remains. One or 2 zygoma implants are then used to "rescue" the residual dental implant reconstruction.

# Partially edentulous patients

These are unusual scenarios where a small unilateral edentulous space exists (Fig. 6). The space can be rehabilitated with an implant-supported 3- to 4-unit bridge, but the bone stock is not adequate for the placement of traditional implants in both bridge pillars. These patients normally will have a history of failed sinus lift, traditional bone grafting, trauma, or pathologic condition with significant localized alveolar bone loss. At

the same time, there is adequate bone stock either anterior or posterior to the defect. These cases can be successfully treated with the placement of dental implants in available alveolar bone with placement of a zygoma implant in the area of the defect.

Preoperative planning also includes intraoral scanning and/or digitalization of records to be used for computer-assisted planning, such as a previous denture, a physical, or a virtual wax up. Depending on the practitioner preference and experience, a custom drill guide can be fabricated, or a surgical navigation system can be used for the placement of the traditional implants. Zygoma implants are normally placed freehand, but several static and dynamic protocols have been described in the literature; descriptions can be found in later articles of this Atlas of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America.


The selection of the proper combination of traditional and zygoma implants is based on the amount of residual alveolar

bone, the biomechanical requirements of the final prosthesis, necessary hygiene considerations, finances as well as surgeon and restorative dentist preferences and experience.

# Surgical technique (pearls and pitfalls)

The surgical technique for the placement of zygoma implants has been already discussed in previous articles, and very few modifications are necessary for the combination with regular implants. The following are some pearls and pitfalls of these modifications:


# Intravenous sedation versus general anesthesia

- If the case calls for the placement of traditional implants in combination with only 1 zygoma implant bilaterally, the procedure can be accomplished in the office setting under IV) sedation with very good acceptance from the patient.

- Although traditional implants with 2 zygoma implants placed bilaterally can also be completed under IV sedation, it is recommended that general anesthesia be used because of the increased complexity, length of the procedure, and better comfort for the patient.
- If the procedure is done under IV sedation with preservation of the sinus membrane, the practitioner must remember that each patient breath will move the membrane in and out. This has the potential to make the placement of the zygoma implant or implants more difficult, as it is the preservation of the membrane per se.
- At the end, the choice of anesthesia must be guided by the patient's medical history and preferences as well as the physician preference and experience.

# Regular implant placement

- A flapless approach can be used for the placement of dental implants with the help of a custom drill guide or a dental navigation system. Although these technologies can also help with the position of the zygoma platform (drill entry point), exposure of the malar bone is recommended for better control of the exit point of the zygoma implant. This will avoid their placement in the orbit or the infratemporal fossa.
- It is the authors' preference to place the regular dental implants first. This is done to avoid the lack of the space issues that can occur if the placement of the most posterior zygoma implant occurs in a more anterior position than second premolar/first molar area.
- Regular dental implants should be placed with at least  $8\mathrm{mm}$  of distance between them to allow enough space for the prosthetic components.

# Zygoma implant placement

- Operator positioning remains critical for safe and predictable zygoma implant placement. The operator traditionally will position himself or herself on the contralateral side from the site being operated. Doing so will allow more favorable visualization of the malar bone but will also provide greater insight regarding the necessary trajectory and angulation of the zygomatic implant during site preparation and implant placement.
- The most critical step for the success of zygoma implants remains proper coronal placement of the implant platform. Previous discussions have framed the "intra versus extra sinus approach" to be the primary clinical decision, with implant platform position to merely be a secondary result of the technique selected. Traditional approaches aimed to place the implant platform more palatal to maintain crestal bone buccal to the platform to counteract these cantilevers. More recently, an emphasis on a prosthetically driven surgical technique resulted in movement of the implant platform buccally and eliminated the presence of crestal bone buccal to the platform in many instances. It is the senior author's experience that proper implant platform placement within the crest of the residual alveolar ridge must remain the primary goal, with observations of the midportion of the implant being intrasinus versus extrasinus as a secondary result of this crucial platform position.

# One zygoma implant bilaterally

- When placing only 1 zygoma implant on each side, the implant should be placed as close as possible to the posterior lateral wall of the maxillary sinus to allow the largest anteroposterior spread. The practitioner must be aware that the most posterior the zygoma implant platform is placed, the more upright or vertical the zygoma implant is going to be within the body of the malar bone. This is critical, as it will decrease the availability of bone for the placement of an additional anterior zygoma implant if it is needed in the future (Fig. 7).

# Two zygoma implants bilaterally

- It is still difficult to preoperatively know for certain the size of the zygoma implants to be used; therefore, the practitioner should have in inventory 2 zygoma implants of each size. Four implants of the same dimension are not necessary because the posterior implants are going to be always shorter than the anterior ones.
- The degree of maxillary atrophy will largely dictate the angulation relationship between the posterior and anterior implant. In instances of greater residual maxillary bone stock, the zygoma implants will converge apically. In cases of significant maxillary atrophy, there is a larger vertical loss; hence, the anterior and posterior implant will become more parallel (Fig. 8).
- The anterior implant should be placed bordering the infraorbital nerve with the platform located in the area of

(B) This is critical, as it will decrease the availability of bone for the placement of an additional anterior zygoma implant if it is needed in the future.

the canine just below the lateral margin of the piriform aperture. The posterior implant, as described before, should be placed as close as possible to the posterior lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. This orientation also aids in maximizing anteroposterior spread to minimize cantilever forces.
- The authors' preference is to place the anterior implant first, as its positioning is most critical to avoid the orbit. As previously described, if the posterior implant is placed first, one runs the risk of placing it with a vertical angulation that will decrease the amount of bone available between its apex and the infraorbital rim. This thin margin of error makes available placement location less flexible (Fig. 9).

# One- versus two-stage dental rehabilitation

- The choice of 1- versus 2-stage dental rehabilitation must be guided by the patient's preferences, physician preference, and experience as well as availability of the restorative dentist/laboratory personnel to assist with the restorative procedure.
- It is the senior author's experience that it is not imperative to practice a 1-stage approach. Patients have often suffered from multiple failed surgical/restorative therapies, and they tolerate very well a staged approach before receiving a functional final prosthesis.

# One-stage approach

Implants are placed and immediately loaded. This approach requires careful coordination between the surgeon, restorative dentist, and laboratory personnel. It has the advantage that the patient functions immediately without further delay. Usually this is achieved with an interim fixed prosthesis (modified existing denture). It has been suggested in the literature that the 1-stage approach allows for a better soft tissue—implant interface, as it decreases the amount of tissue manipulation. This is especially important in patients with thin, soft tissue coverage, where excessive manipulation of these tissues could create soft tissue dehiscence with potential oroantral communication. Once osseointegration has been achieved, after 4 to 6 months, the final prosthesis can be delivered.

# Two-stage approach

Implant placement with delayed loading. This is the traditional approach in which the implants are placed, and after 4 to 6 months of osseointegration, they are uncovered for further restoration. It has the disadvantage that it requires a second surgical procedure, and most of the time, the patient's ability to function will be delayed. Still, during the healing period, the patient is allowed to use a tissue-supported prosthesis. Once the implants are uncovered, they should ideally be splinted as soon as possible with either the provisional or the final restoration.

# Postoperative care and complications

Postoperative care and complications are the same as previously discussed in other articles of this Atlas of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America.

# Summary

Zygoma implants are a safe and predictable first line of treatment in lieu of more time-consuming and financially burdensome traditional bone grafting approaches. The addition of regular dental implants should always be considered when adequate maxillary alveolar bone is present. Their combination will decrease the anteroposterior cantilevers, resulting in an improvement of the distribution of functional forces, thus providing increase support of the final prosthesis.

Ultimately, the final selection of the proper combination of traditional and zygoma implants is based on the amount of residual maxillary alveolar bone, the biomechanical requirements of the final dental implant rehabilitation, finances as well as surgeon and restorative dentist preferences and experience.
