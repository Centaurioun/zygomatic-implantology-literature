# Abstract

Objectives: The main objective of this retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study was to describe the occurrence of peri-zygomatic infection (PZI) as a complication associated with zygomatic implant (ZI) placement in a period of 22 years.

Materials and methods: A retrospective search was carried out in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of Saint John's hospital in Genk, Belgium. Patients that had a severely atrophic fully or partially edentulous maxilla, and at least one ZI placed, were included.

Results: A total of 302 eligible patients, underwent ZI surgery between 1998 and 2020. From a total of 940 ZI, 45 were associated with the development of PZI. PZI was located in the upper portion of the cheek in relation to the external corner of the eye, one or two centimeters under the lower lid. The total number of affected patients was 25 (8.3%), who had a mean age of 58.1 years. In this subset, PZI occurred in 15 cases on the right side, in eight cases on the left side, and in two cases bilaterally. Ultimately, 16 ZI were lost in the PZI site. The mean time since the implant placement to the diagnosis of PZI was 1.9 years (SD  $\pm$ 2.4) and to the ZI removal of 3.8 years (SD  $\pm$ 3.7). After implant removal, the PZI symptomatology dissipated in all patients.

Conclusion: Peri-zygomatic infection should be informed to the patients as a possible complication after ZI placement. Once identified, it should be acknowledged as a risk factor for ZI failure.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Zygomatic implants (ZIs) are a well-founded alternative to restore the functionality in patients with total and partially edentulous maxilla and with severe bone atrophy (Aparicio et al., 2008). The technique has been described as highly predictable, and its results have shown a low failure rate. It has been reported a cumulative survival rate at 12 years of  $95.2\%$  (Chrcanovic et al., 2016) and an overall reported survival rate of  $96.7\%$  (da Hora Sales et al., 2020).


However, as any other surgery, this one is not exempt of complications. The most named ones are sinus infections, intraoral soft tissue infection, temporary nerve disturbances, development of an oroantral fistula, extraoral hematoma, extraoral emphysema, and epistaxis. Regardless of the available reports, it is believed that the complications associated with ZI surgery are underestimated as a great number of studies do not report their presence or absence and the follow-up periods are insufficient to confirm their appearance after 5 years from implant placement (Chrcanovic et al., 2016; da Hora Sales et al., 2020).


In addition to the aforementioned extraoral complications, the presence of an extraoral cutaneous fistula in the zygomatic region has been described in case reports (Dawood & Kalavresos, 2017; Garcia Garcia et al., 2016; Tzerbos et al., 2016). Tzerbos et al. (2016) indicated that the fistula was located in the infraorbital rim and that it was associated with the apex of one of the ZIs. Surgical removal of the extruding apical portion of the implant led to the healing of the fistula.

Considering the scarce literature available regarding the development of extraoral complications after ZI placement, the aim of the present article is to describe the occurrence of peri-zygomatic infections (PZIs) associated with ZIs in a 22-year retrospective cohort study.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

# 2.1 Study design and settings

This retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study assessed all ZIs surgeries that took place in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of Saint John's hospital in Genk, Belgium, in a period of 22 years, from 1998 to 2020. Before data collection, the Medical Ethics Committee of the Hospital East Limburg was consulted (Z-2021024); however, ethical approval was not required due to the retrospective nature of this study. All procedures were done in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the standards of the Institutional Review Board. This study was elaborated in agreement with the STROBE guidelines (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) (Vandenbroucke et al., 2014).

# 2.2 Patient selection

Patients, irrespective of their age and gender, that complied with the following criteria were included, a severely atrophic fully or partially edentulous maxilla, at least one ZI, complete treatment until prothesis installation, and sufficient information in the clinical files reporting the patients' concomitant diseases, detailed surgical procedures, and presence of complications. Patients were excluded if there was absence of one or more of the previous criteria.

Data collection included age, gender, systemic diseases, treatment scheme, date, number, and characteristics of each of the implants placed, surgical technique, use of grafting material, type of guide, presence of complications, follow-up time, and type of prosthesis.

# 2.3 | Preoperative evaluation and protocol

All patients had signed an informed consent and received explanation of the possible complications. The extensive presurgical, surgical, and postsurgical methodology was previously described by Vrielinck et al. (2003).

Before surgery, all patients had a physical and a radiographic examination. Only those with systemic diseases were recommended to be checked up before surgery by their treating physician. The radiographic examination included a panoramic radiograph and a computed tomography (CT) or a cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan. The indication for ZIs was based on the lack of sufficient bone to place a standard implant, visible on the measurements provided in the diagnostic images. Resorption patterns were classified according to Lekholm and Zarb (1985).

# 2.4 Surgical protocol

All surgeries were performed by one surgeon (LV), following the treatment schemes proposed by Brânemark (2004), Davó and David (2019), or a hybrid scheme depending on the surgical and prosthodontic rehabilitation planning. All patients received general anesthesia using naso-endotracheal intubation.

After crestal incision in the dentoalveolar border, a mucoperiosteal buccal and palatal flap was prepared, allowing the mucosa to be carefully detached, displaced, and exposing the lateral osseous surface of the maxilla, where it was possible to identify the infraorbital foramen and to protect the infraorbital nerve. Starting from the dentoalveolar border, four entry points were selected, most frequently in the position of the lateral incisor and second premolar and from these points a trajectory was traced to the zygomatic bone. The trajectory of the implants was chosen respecting the natural anatomy of the patient, consequent to the maxillary degree of atrophy, sinus pneumatization, and osseous remnant. The performed implant placing techniques were intrasinusal described by Branemark (Branemark et al., 2004), sinus slot (Stella & Warner, 2000), and extramaxillary technique (Maló et al., 2008). In some instances, the free lying portion of the ZIs were covered by grafting material, for example, bone grafts (Bio-Oss® and Biogide®) or titanium mesh.

Drilling was performed through the lateral surface of the zygomatic bone and once all the openings were ready, the implant fixtures were manually screwed using a hand driver until the apex of the implant was fixed. To select the appropriate implant, the length of the osteotomies was measured and the best-fitting implant was selected. The ZIs were manufactured by Nobel Biocare™ (Nobel Biocare Services AG, Zürich, Switzerland), had a smoothed (machined) or rough (TiUnite®) surface, and a length between 30 mm and 52.5 mm.

Once the implants were placed, visual inspection was performed to confirm the absence of perforations in the zygomatic bone and that the coronal portion of the implant was in the desired position, as this would be in correspondence with the future
FIGURE 1 Total number of zygomatic surgeries, patients with PZI diagnosis, and patients with implant failure associated with PZI, distributed by year. An increase of the PZI cases can be seen after 2009. In 2009, the implants that were used were changed from machined to TiUnite® surface, and the prosthetic loading from delayed to immediate healing abutment and prosthesis. If conventional implants were required, they were installed during the same surgery. Finally, cover screws were placed, and all tissues were repositioned and closed with silk sutures.


When prosthetic rehabilitation included an immediate loading protocol, abutments were directly connected, and an impression was taken for prosthesis fabrication. Once surgery was resumed, all patients were prescribed with analgesics (paracetamol and/or ibuprofen), antibiotics (Clindamycin, 600 mg/day/10 days), and chlorhexidine rinse (0.12%).

# 2.5 | Postsurgical follow-up

Patients were followed up for the first time one week after surgery and regularly monitored every 3 months during a year. Then, an annual follow-up was organized until the fifth year where the follow-up became biannually. Postoperative radiographic examinations were done with a panoramic radiograph. When the clinical signs were suggestive of sinusitis or complications, a postoperative CT or CBCT scan was ordered. The presence of complications was recorded in the patient's file, in the correspondent visit. The complications were grouped by origin into mechanical and biologic. All complications were successfully treated.

# 2.6 | Implant evaluation

Success of the implant was considered following the proposed criteria by Aparicio et al. (2014), as follows:

1. Absence of pain and mobility of the ZI.
2. Absence of sinus pathologies.
3. Light recession of the peri-implant soft tissue up to seven exposed threads.
4. Prosthetic offset no larger than  $15\mathrm{mm}$  palatal and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  buccal, with reference between the center of the implant head and the center of the residual alveolar ridge.

# 2.7 Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with S-Plus 8.0 for Linux (TIBCO Software Inc.). A statistical analysis was carried out to identify those factors correlated to PZI onset using a univariate frailty model with patient as random factor that explored the relation between the time to onset of PZI and each individual risk factor as explanatory variable. The investigated risk factors were the following: age, gender, underlying systemic disease, smoking habits, presence of radiation in the head and the neck, treatment scheme, surgical technique, degree of atrophy, retreatment, implant location, implant surface, prosthetic load, use of grafting material, and guiding system. Survival times were modeled with four different underlying distributions: normal, log-normal, Weibull, and exponential. p-Values were selected from the best-fitting distribution according to the Akaike information criterion. Comparisons between the different groups of risk factors were set up using the fixed-effects estimates and their variance-covariance matrix from the survival regression and corrected for simultaneous hypothesis testing according to the Tukey. Significance was considered when  $p \leq .05$ .

# 3 | RESULTS

A total of 302 patients underwent implant surgery between December 1998 and September 2020. There were 940 ZIs and 451 standard implants placed. The mean age at surgery was 57.6 years (SD  $\pm$ 9.24, range 30-83) and 195 (64.6%) of the patients were female, from which 529 zygomatic and 266 standard implants were placed. The mean follow-up was 7.9 years (SD  $\pm$ 4.9, range 0.1-21.4).

From the total number of patients, 25 (8.3%) presented PZI in 45 implants (4.8%) (Figure 1). These patients had a mean age of 58.1 years (SD ±10.2, range 33-77) and 18 of them were female. PZI occurred in 15 cases in the right side, in eight cases in the left side, and in two cases bilaterally. Ultimately, 12 patients lost their ZI homologous to the PZI site. This corresponds to 16 of the 95 ZI failures in the whole study population. The mean time since the implant placement to the first diagnosis of PZI was 1.9 years (SD  $\pm$ 2.4, range 0.02-10.4) and to the ZI removal of 3.8 years (SD  $\pm$ 3.7, range 0.2 -10.4). The time of diagnosis of PZI and implant loss of each patient can be seen in Figure 2.


With regard to the underlying diseases, four patients had hypothyroidism, three had hypertension, two had arthrosis, two had osteoporosis, one had asthma, one had Sjögren's syndrome, and one had Crohn's disease. Three of these patients were referred for ZIs after partial resection of the maxilla and had been irradiated in the zygomatic region, while two other patients received chemotherapy during the osseointegration period due to malignancies in other regions. Concerning the previous local medical history and habits, ten patients had a history of periodontitis, four had previous sinus pathology, and seven smoked. Only history of radiation  $(p = .023)$  and hemimaxillectomy  $(p = .028)$  did show a predisposition for PZI.

For all patients with PZI, except one, this was their first treatment with ZIs. The treatment scheme was in 16 patients the Quad zygoma (Davó & David, 2019), in two cases the Classic Branemark (Branemark et al., 2004), and in seven cases mixed schemes. There was no grafting material used in ten of these patients and the surgical techniques used to place the implants were, the sinus slot technique in 55 implants, the extramaxillary technique in 14 implants, and the intrasinusal technique in 11 implants. The number of failures per technique was 10, 5, and 1 implant, respectively. Regarding the surface of the implants, three of them had a machined, while 77 had a TiUnite® surface. From this subset, only one machined implant had to be removed vs. 15 TiUnite® implants. In addition, 15 patients had immediate and ten had delayed loaded prosthesis, from which six of each group lost one or more ZI. An overview of implant success rates is provided in Table 1.

With respect to other concomitant complications affecting these patients, one had a visible intraoral dehiscence 2 weeks after surgery, another reported hypoesthesia of the infraorbital nerve at 6 months, three patients had standard implant failures at 1, 8 months, and 10 years postoperatively, another patient had gingival hyperplasia occurring at 4 years, and additionally two patients had fractures of the multi-unit abutment and the prosthetic screw, both 6 years after surgery. All these complications were not contemporaneous with PZI, contrarily to sinusitis, which occurred in nine patients simultaneously or within 2 months of PZI diagnosis, and in one patient 5 years later. Finally, eight patients lost their prosthesis following the report of ZI failure.


Factors that were found to be statistically predisposing to PZI onset were, a retreatment  $(p = .002)$ , the sinus slot technique  $(p = .012)$ , a TiUnite® surface  $(p = .047)$ , and immediate prosthetic loading  $(p = .015)$ . All  $p$ -values were obtained using an underlying log-normal distribution in the survival regression.

The course of the infection followed a typical pattern. At first, a non-colored painful swelling in the zygomatic region was observed, followed by a period of volume increase and surrounding redness that afterward evolved to an extraoral cutaneous fistula (Figures 3 and 4). In none of the cases was a bacterial culture undertaken to evaluate the causal pathogen. The exudate from the fistula usually contained no pus but rather an inflammatory granulomatous tissue. Cutaneous symptoms were not necessarily preceded by intraoral or maxillary problems.

Radiographic examination with CBCT images showed that in all cases, there was lack of bone covering the apex of the ZI (Figure 3a). Six patients had an additional anatomopathological examination. The histologic reports showed unspecific findings. There was presence of macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, multicellular giant cells, inflammatory infiltrate, and some calcifications.

The treatment of the PZI was done in stages, aiming from the most to the least conservative. As a starting point, all patients received antibiotic therapy; however, the use of antibiotics on its own was not able to eradicate the infection. Therefore, all patients underwent conservative surgical treatment, which consisted of the exploration, curettage, debridement of the PZI area, and in three cases, removal of the protruding apical portion of the ZI. Only one patient denied surgical treatment and received local wound care. Upon surgical exploration, it was noticed that no surrounding bone was present in the apical portion of the implant on the lateral side of the zygomatic bone and that granulomatous tissue had replaced

Patients who presented increased symptomatology and implant mobility after or during the exploration underwent implant removal. When the latter took place, it was observed that the ZI was not osseointegrated since all implants could be removed gently using


a forceps. Healing was observed in all patients who had the protruding portion of the implant or the complete implant removed, though a small scar remained in the PZI area. Ten patients, until the time of this study, are still in follow-up.

# 4 | DISCUSSION

Complications associated with ZI placement are often underreported (Chrcanovic et al., 2016; da Hora Sales et al., 2020) and extraoral infections in the zygomatic region after implant surgery have only been described occasionally in case reports (Dawood & Kalavresos, 2017; Garcia Garcia et al., 2016; Tzerbos et al., 2016; Van Camp et al., 2018). To our knowledge, we present in this retrospective study the first large series of PZIs. Although it was thought to be an infrequent complication after ZI placement, 25 patients  $(8.3\%)$  and 45  $(4.8\%)$  ZIs exhibited PZI. Certainly, this possibility should be communicated to the patients before the intervention and written in the informed consent.

The clinical aspect of the extraoral cutaneous fistula follows a constant pattern that corresponds to what was depicted in the case reports. The inflammation and fistula take place in the upper portion of the cheek, in relation to the external corner of the eye, one or two centimeters under the lower lid. The time of presentation is variable, but in our study, 19 patients presented PZI within the first 2 years after implant placement. In addition,  $35.5\%$  of the affected implants had to be removed. Therefore, the premise that PZI might be a sign of non-integration cannot be refuted. It is further assumed that this infection in the zygomatic area might have a counterpart in the maxillary sinus, since nine patients presented sinusitis nearly at the same time. It may be that in some cases, the infection manifest itself outwards, inwards, or both.

Although different hypotheses could be retrieved from these clinical observations, infection of the non-integrated ZIs is able to explain the clinical course. Especially, because there was a resolution of the symptoms after the removal of the implant. Similar results have also been reported in other studies (Cho et al., 2016; Fujioka et al., 2011). However, in implants that at exploration surgery seem to be well integrated and only the protruding apex of the implant appears to be causing the infection, the removal of this portion has shown satisfactory results (Dawood & Kalavresos, 2017; Garcia Garcia et al., 2016). Contrarily, it was seen in two of our PZI cases that a relapse of the lesion was seen years after the first conservative surgery; thus, we cannot disregard that this is perhaps, a temporary solution.


The clinical course of the delayed PZI cases suggests a low-grade infection. These types of infections are caused by low-virulent bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes that can infect at a later stage, and manifest the associated complications even years after the original surgery (Ström et al., 2011). For this reason, Ottenhausen et al. recommend a routine bacterial culture and a 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify these bacteria (Ottenhausen et al., 2019). However, this was not executed in our patient population.

Given the absence of report, the periodontal status of the ZIs is unknown; yet, it was noted that  $40\%$  of the patients with PZI had a history of periodontal disease. Albeit PZI should be considered a separate entity from peri-implantitis, the two are not mutually exclusive and one may even influence the other. By definition, peri-implantitis is a plaque-associated pathology that occurs in the tissues surrounding an implant, and clinically it is characterized by mucosal inflammation and progressive bone loss (Berglundh et al., 2018). The main difference with PZI relies in the biofilm component and that it affects the contralateral ends of the implant. Nevertheless, periodontal pathogens might be involved in this infection (Dawood & Kalavresos, 2017). In fact, Lombardo et al. saw in patients with ZIs that the plaque index, bleeding on probing, the pocket depth, and the bacterial count of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia was higher in patients with periodontitis history (Lombardo et al., 2016). Emphasizing the importance of periodontal monitoring.


Another possible explanation could be a foreign tissue reaction as suggested by de Lima-Souza et al. (de Lima-Souza et al., 2021), but then one could expect that this also occurred in the well-integrated implants of the same patient, as bone and titanium debris is generated in all sites. Another case report refers to the appearance of a cutaneous fistula in the lower lid after orbital reconstruction in a patient that had a secondary trauma 12 years after surgery (Cho et al., 2016). Yet, none of our patients reported having a trauma event.

Lastly, some authors hypothesize that the necrosis that led to the fistula formation found its origin in the lack of irrigation and excessive torque while drilling (Garcia Garcia et al., 2016; Tzerbos et al., 2016). In fact, it has been previously described in the literature that the current implant site preparation techniques raise the temperature in the osteotomy location and leave behind a zone of dead osteocytes that is subsequently followed by bone resorption. The extent of the apoptosis is worsened by the increase in the torque (Chen et al., 2018), especially in bone that is highly dense as the zygomatic bone. We noticed that the cases of PZI increased when there was a change in the implant surface and the loading protocol (Figure 1). Changing these two aspects of the surgery, involved a change in the drilling protocol, which lead to under-preparation of the zygomatic bone and a consequent compression to reach the primary stability of the implant that would allow the immediate loading of the prosthesis. Then, the development of a slow forming necrosis would start and given the solid nature of the zygomatic bone, it could take a long time before the signs of infection are visible, which may explain the latency period between the operation and the occurrence of PZI. Unlike standard implants, there is no instrument to measure the insertion torque when placing a ZI. This means that implants can be inserted with a high torque without realizing it.

In this mechanical line of thought, the skillful hand of the surgeon might also play a role, as one side or the other becomes easier to work. Interestingly,  $64\%$  of the PZIs occurred on the right side. We observed that our surgeon always starts by the left side, meaning that the sterile pilot bur is used first in the left and then in the right side, being able to carry some pathogens from one side to the other.

Perhaps, since a relevant number of patients experience this complication, the clinician must consider alternative treatments in cases of implant failure. Aside from bone grafting procedures for sinus augmentation, it has been described in the literature the use of transnasal implants (Almeida et al., 2021) and angulated conventional implants in the zygomatic bone (Mertens et al., 2016) as valid alternatives to restore function.

This study also encounters some limitations given its retrospective nature. The follow-up period was not consistent, as some patients were followed up by significantly longer periods than others, and some refused to receive further controls. This could cause that the survival rate of the PZI implants and the report of complications to be underestimated.

Bearing in mind the limitations of this study, the clinical significance of this large series relies on the observation of the cutaneous infection associated with the apex of the ZI that should be identified as an alarming sign of non-integration. Irrespective of the severity of the symptoms or how satisfied the patient is about the prosthetic solution, we should inform that no cure can be expected without surgical intervention. In addition, this article brings to light the importance of the torque when tightening implants. The addition of an instrument that could measure the insertion torque would be of great help to this surgical task, to bring to balance sufficient primary stability without over compressing the bone. Also, as a precautionary measure, it would be advisable to change drills between the left and right side if the sinus was opened and the drill had contact with the sinus contents.


# 5 CONCLUSION

In the present article, we describe 25 cases of PZI and 16 associated implant losses. The identification of a cutaneous fistula in the zygomatic region reflects an underlying complication eventually leading to loosening of the ZI.
