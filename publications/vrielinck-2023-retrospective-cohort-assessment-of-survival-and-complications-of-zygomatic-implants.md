# Abstract

Objectives: To report on zygomatic implant (ZI) survival rate and associated complications through a longitudinal retrospective cohort assessment.

Material and Methods: A total of 940 ZIs (rough: 781, machined: 159; immediate loading: 454, delayed loading: 486) and 451 standard implants (rough: 195, machined: 256; immediate loading: 58, delayed loading: 393) were placed in 302 adult patients with atrophic maxilla from December 1998 till September 2020. Following data collection reported complications were grouped based on their origin as infectious/ non-infectious biological and mechanical. Statistical analysis was performed to identify risk factors and preceding complications leading to implant loss  $(P < 0.05)$ .

Results: The survival rate of ZI was found to be  $89.9\%$  and the average time between implant placement and an eventual loss was 4.8 years. The mean ZI follow-up period was  $7.9 \pm 4.9$  years. Amongst the infectious biological complications, sinusitis was the most reported ( $n = 138$ ) occurring at a mean follow-up time-point of 4.5 years, whereas infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia occurred more frequently in the non-infectious biological category ( $n = 8$ , meantime: 0.3 years). The prosthetic screw fracture was the most reported complication of mechanical origin ( $n = 29$ , meantime: 4 years). Furthermore, sinusitis, standard implant loss, zygomatic/peri-zygomatic region infection, and oroantral communication were significantly associated with ZI loss.

Conclusions: ZI placement offered a high survival rate for the rehabilitation of severely atrophied maxilla with most losses occurring within the first 5 years at follow-up. The most frequently observed complication was sinusitis which tends to develop several years following implant placement.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

The rehabilitation of an atrophic edentulous maxilla presents a challenge in the oral and maxillofacial practice. In such cases, treatment with conventional dental implants is limited owing to the presence of alveolar bone resorption, inadequate bone volume and extensive sinus pneumatization (Chrcanovic & Abreu, 2013). Consequently, various bone augmentation procedures have been well-established for restoring the alveolar bone defect, such as, onlay bone grafting, sinus augmentation, guided bone regeneration and bloc iliac crest Le


Fort I osteotomy (Aghaloo et al., 2017). These grafting techniques are associated with the risk of donor-site morbidity, long rehabilitation time with delayed implant placement, need for multiple surgical interventions, increased treatment cost and longer hospitalization time (Aparicio et al., 2008).

To overcome the aforementioned limitations, zygomatic implant (ZI) has been considered as a viable non-grafting alternative for the rehabilitation of patients with atrophic edentulous maxilla (Aparicio et al., 1993). It offers predictable outcomes, less morbidity and is more acceptable by patients (Chrcanovic et al., 2016). The potential benefits of ZI with a higher success rate over grafting procedures have been well documented (da Hora Sales et al., 2020; Goker et al., 2020). Nevertheless, ZI placement is a complex surgical procedure with a steep learning curve and is prone to certain risks due to its close proximity to the surrounding delicate anatomical structures (Chrcanovic et al., 2016). The most common complication is sinusitis having an incidence ranging from  $0\%$  to  $26.6\%$  and it might even develop several years following implant placement. Other complications include zygomatic fracture, orbital perforation, oroantral fistula, subcutaneous malar emphysema, paresthesia, peri-orbital hematoma or edema, peri-implantitis and eventually implant loss (da Hora Sales et al., 2020; Goker et al., 2020).

To date, numerous studies have been conducted assessing ZI survival rate with the longest recorded follow-up period of 18 years (Aparicio, Manresa, Francisco, Claros, et al., 2014; Chana et al., 2019; Chrcanovic & Abreu, 2013). However, the main limitation associated with these studies has been an inadequate number of ZIs followed up for more than 3 years as implant failure mostly occurs during the 6 months' timeline following surgery and before implant loading (Chrcanovic & Abreu, 2013). Chrcanovic et al. suggested assessing ZI survival rate with an adequate sample size beyond the 3-year time-point (Chrcanovic & Abreu, 2013). Additionally, lack of evidence exits related to the specific time of occurrence of the long-term complications and whether these complications are associated with ZI failure (Chrcanovic & Abreu, 2013; Chrcanovic et al., 2016).

Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to assess the survival rate of ZI implants, and secondarily to investigate the prevalence and time-point of complication occurrence, and to identify the risk factors associated with implant loss.

# 2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

# 2.1 Study design and settings

A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in compliance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on medical research. The manuscript was prepared according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (Vandenbroucke et al., 2014). Prior to the start, the Ethical Review Board of the East-Limburg Hospital was consulted (reference number: Z-2021024). Patients who underwent ZI placement from 1998 to 2020 were recruited at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, Saint John Hospital, Genk, Belgium.


# 2.2 Patient selection

Inclusion criteria were adult patients with complete or partial edentulous atrophic maxilla who underwent ZI insertion. Exclusion criteria were patients who did not have sufficient data in the medical records related to the concomitant diseases, surgical procedure, and the presence of complications.

The data extracted from the patient's files included: age, gender, presence of systemic disease, treatment scheme, number and characteristics of the ZIs, surgical technique, grafting material, type of surgical guide, presence and time-point of complications, follow-up time, type of prosthesis, and if applicable, date of implant removal.

# 2.3 | Preoperative evaluation

All patients signed a consent form and were informed of the possible complications. Clinically, bone quantity and quality of the implant sites were categorized based on Lekholm and Zarb classification (Lekholm & Zarb, 1985). Additionally, a panoramic and computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan was acquired for diagnosing maxillary atrophy and treatment planning. Furthermore, a physical examination was carried out that included the measurement of the mandibular size, bone volume, bone density, occlusal relationships, intermaxillary distance, and status of the antagonist dentition. Patients diagnosed with sinusitis, polyps or other pathological conditions prior to surgery were first treated by an otolaryngologist before proceeding with the implant therapy. Lastly, patients with any underlying systemic disease were timely monitored by their primary care physicians.

# 2.4 Surgical protocol

The surgical procedures were performed by one surgeon (LV) using either intrasinusal (Brænemark et al., 2004), extramaxillary (Aparicio et al., 2010) or sinus slot technique (Stella & Warner, 2000) under general anesthesia and local infiltration (Figure 1). The implants were placed following the classic Brænemark (Brænemark et al., 2004), the quad style (Davó & David, 2019), and mixed treatment schemes depending on the rehabilitation treatment planning (Figure 2).

Surgical access was performed by crestal and releasing incisions. The mucoperiosteal flaps were detached for exposing the alveolar crest, lateral osseous maxillary surface and lower border of the zygomatic arch. The infraorbital nerve was identified and protected during the course of the surgery. Surgical guides were fixed to the surrounding bone by using osteosynthesis screws. Drilling was performed with a sequence of burs through the lateral surface of the zygomatic bone. Following removal of the guide,

FIGURE 2 Examples of treatment scheme, (a) indicating classic scheme, (b) quad zygoma, and (c, d) mixed treatment schemes best fitting implants were selected depending on the length of the osteotomies and fixtures were manually screwed in till the apex of the implant was attached in the bone. The implants had a smoothed (machined) or rough (TiUnite®) surface, and a length between 30 to  $52.5\mathrm{mm}$  (Nobel Biocare Services AG). The trajectory of ZI was adapted depending on the patient-specific anatomy. Visual inspection was performed for confirming the desired position of implant and absence of zygomatic bone perforation. In 21 patients, grafting of the coronal portion of the ZIs was performed using xenograft (Bio-Oss®, Geistlich) and coverage of the grafted site with collagen membrane (Bio-gide®, Geistlich) or titanium mesh. When conventional implants were required, they were installed following ZI placement.


Regarding implant loading, delayed loading was used until 2010 and after, together with the introduction of zygoma TiUnite implants and the quad zygoma technique, an immediate loading protocol was used. If the treatment considered an immediate loading protocol, abutments were connected in the same surgery, and the treating dentist would take an impression for the fabrication of the prosthesis. While when a delayed loading protocol was foreseen, cover screws were installed and then, in a second procedure at 6 months, the healing abutments were placed followed by prosthetic rehabilitation.

To conclude the surgeries, the tissues were repositioned and the surgical wounds were sutured with 4-0 silk. All patients were prescribed post-operative analgesics (paracetamol and/or ibuprofen), antibiotic (Clindamycin,  $600\mathrm{mg/day}$  10 days), and a  $0.12\%$  chlorhexidine mouthwash.

# 2.5 | Postsurgical follow-up

Clinical evaluation follow-up was organized at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year following the surgical procedure. Thereafter, an annual follow-up was planned until the fifth year, followed by a biannual evaluation. Panoramic radiographs were acquired for postoperative examination. In presence of sinusitis or other complications, CT or CBCT was requested. The presence and details of complications were recorded in patient's files at the corresponding visit.

Based on the nature of the complications, they were either categorized as mechanical or biological. Furthermore, the latter was subclassified into complications with an infectious or non-infectious component. To standardize the report of the complications, it was considered as dehiscence, the retraction of the peri-implant tissue and the consequent exposure of the coronal portion of the zygomatic implant; as hypoesthesia, a decrease in the sensitivity to touch in the territory innervated by the infraorbital nerve; and as prosthesis dissatisfaction, the non-use of the prosthesis due to discomfort or pain during function. Finally, complications that were not resolved within 6 months were considered permanent.


# 2.6 | Implant evaluation

The ZIs were graded as successful based on the criteria proposed by Aparicio et al. known as "Zygomatic Success Code" (Aparicio, Manresa, Francisco, Claros, et al., 2014). Implant failure was considered if at least one of the following criteria was met: presence of clear clinical mobility with disintegration of the apical portion of the implant accompanied by pain and/or rotation, clinical and radiographic evidence of sinus pathology, soft tissue recession exposing more than seven threads, and prosthetic offset of more than  $15\mathrm{mm}$  in the palatal direction and  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in the buccal direction. Implant success meant the absence of these signs, while survival meant the permanence of the implant in situ throughout the observation period.

# 2.7 Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using S-Plus 8.0 for Linux (TIBCO Software Inc.). Simple multilevel logistic cox-regression analyses were applied to separately test the association between each possible complication/risk indicator and ZI loss. The risk indicators included gender, underlying systemic disease, smoking, presence of head and neck radiation, dentition, treatment scheme, surgical technique, degree of atrophy, indication, implant surface, prosthetic load, use of graft material, and guiding system. Four different underlying distributions were used to model survival times: normal, lognormal, Weibull, and exponential. The best best-fitting distribution according to the Akaike information criterion was used to select the  $P$ -values. Comparisons between the different groups of risk factors were set up using the fixed-effects estimates and their variance-covariance matrix from the survival regression and corrected for simultaneous hypothesis testing according to Tukey. A  $P \leq 0.05$  was considered statistically significant.

# 3 | RESULTS

# 3.1 Demographics

A total of 302 patients underwent ZI placement between December 1998 and September 2020. All patients met the inclusion criteria and none were excluded. The reason for implant placement included complete/partial edentulism (89%/8%) and hemimaxillectomy (2%). The region treated with implants was edentulous for at least 1 year in all patients. The patient's mean age at surgery was  $58 \pm 9.24$  years (range 30-83). In the cohort, a total of 940 ZIs (rough: 781, machined: 159; immediate loading: 454, delayed loading: 486) and 451 standard implants (rough: 195, machined: 256; immediate loading: 58, delayed loading: 393) were placed, where 593 zygomatic and 285 standard implants were placed in 195 (65%) females. Based on Lekholm and Zarb classification, the atrophic surface type receiving ZI was classified as Type A ( $n = 3$ ), B ( $n = 17$ ), C ( $n = 315$ ) and D ( $n = 605$ ). Similarly, the number of standard implants distribution based on the contour type involved, type A: 73, type B: 336, type C: 24 and type D: 18.


Overall, 177 patients had a natural antagonist dentition, eight had conventional prosthesis, while 45 had removable and 72 had fixed implant-supported prosthesis. The mean ZI follow-up period was  $7.9 \pm 4.9$  years (92 patients  $= < 5$  years, 116 patients  $= 5-10$  years, 64 patients  $= 10-15$  years, 25 patients  $= 15-20$  years, 5 patients  $= 20-25$  years).

In relation to the general health of the patient, 49 were smokers, nine had a history of head and neck radiotherapy and 120 patients suffered from chronic diseases, which included, hypertension  $(n = 51)$ , depression  $(n = 21)$ , hypothyroidism  $(n = 20)$ , diabetes mellitus  $(n = 13)$ , osteoporosis  $(n = 6)$ , arthritis  $(n = 5)$ , and asthma  $(n = 4)$ . In addition, 88 patients have had periodontitis, 35 had a history of sinus pathologies and 14 were known cases of bruxism.

# 3.2 | Implant survival

A total of 95 (10.1%) ZIs in 65 patients and 84 (18.6%) standard implants in 38 patients failed and all of them required removal. This resulted in the loss of 28 prothesis. The mean time between implant placement and removal was 4.8 years (range 0.06-19.4) for the zygomatic and 4.4 years (range 0.13-19.4) for the standard implants. Most ZIs (64%) failed within the first 5 years after placement. The ZI loss distribution at follow-up involved, 12 losses in first 6 months, nine in the second half of the first year, 13 in the second year, 14 in the third year, eight in the fourth year, five in the fifth year, 19 between 6 and 10 years, 11 between 10 and 15 years, and four between 15- and 20-years follow-up intervals.

The surgical technique involved intrasinusal  $(n = 308)$ , extramaxillary  $(n = 188)$ , and sinus slot technique  $(n = 444)$  with a survival rate of  $83\%$ $(n = 257)$ ,  $90\%$ $(n = 170)$ , and  $94\%$ $(n = 418)$ , respectively. The ZI surface was in 159 implants machined and in 781 implants TiUnite, having 37  $(23\%)$  and 58  $(7\%)$  losses, respectively. The prosthetic loading was delayed in 486 and immediate in 456 implants, from which 74  $(15\%)$  and 21  $(5\%)$  implant losses were reported, respectively. Lastly, following the contours described by Lekholm & Zarb (1985), three implants were placed in contour type A, 17 in type B, 315 in type C, and 605 in type D. Only type C  $(n = 22, 7\%)$  and D  $(n = 73, 22\%)$  were associated with implant loss.

As for the standard implants, 256 had a machined and 195 a TiUnite surface, from which 62 (24%) and 22 (11%) were lost, respectively. Based on the type A ( $n = 73$ ), B ( $n = 336$ ), C ( $n = 24$ ) and D ( $n = 18$ ) bone contour, the survival rate was  $99\%$  ( $n = 1$ ),  $80\%$  ( $n = 268$ ),  $75\%$  ( $n = 18$ ), and  $50\%$  ( $n = 9$ ), respectively. Furthermore, the loading protocols were delayed in 393 and immediate in 58 implants. From these totals, 83 (21%) and 1 (2%) standard implant had to be removed, respectively.


# 3.3 | Complications

Figure 3 illustrates an overview of the number of implants placed and total complication events each year and Table 1 provides an overview of the ZI survival rate and its association with each complication. Amongst the infectious biological complications, sinusitis was the most commonly reported  $(n = 138)$  occurring at a mean follow-up time-point of 4.5 years (range 0.04-19.37), followed by cheek soft tissue infection  $(n = 72$ , 3.2 years, range 0.05-17.9), zygomatic region infection  $(n = 39$ , 3.2 years, range 0.03-10.4), peri-zygomatic infection  $(n = 25$ , 1.9 years, range 0.01-10.4) (Vrielinck et al., 2022), oroantral communication  $(n = 24$ , 5.3 years, range 0.1-19.4), gingival hyperplasia  $(n = 24$ , 4.1 years, range 0.6-10.1), permanent intraoral dehiscence  $(n = 16$ , 2.7 years, range 0.1-11.6), peri-implantitis of the standard implant  $(n = 11$ , 6 years, range 1.38-14.4), permanent oroantral communication  $(n = 8$ , 2.2 years, range 0.4-3.9), orbital region infection  $(n = 5$ , 3.4 years, range 1.7-5.6), and fracture of the zygomatic bone  $(n = 2$ , 1.1 years, range 0.2-1.9).

The non-infectious biological complications involved transient hypoesthesia of the infraorbital nerve ( $n = 8$ , 0.3 years, range 0.02-1.1), prosthesis dissatisfaction ( $n = 6$ , 1.9 years, range 0.6-5.5), permanent infraorbital hypoesthesia ( $n = 4$ , 2.5 years, range 0.1-10), intraorbital hematoma ( $n = 1$ , 4.3 years) (Van Camp et al., 2018) and temporomandibular joint dysfunction ( $n = 1$ , 6.1 years).

The mechanical complications included prosthetic screw fracture ( $n = 29$ , 4 years, range 0.4-10.8), prosthetic loss ( $n = 28$ , 5.9 years, range 0.4-19.4), clip loosening ( $n = 13$ , 4.5 years, range 0.6-9.7), prosthetic screw loosening ( $n = 13$ , 3.8 years, range 0.3-14.5), suprastructure fracture ( $n = 12$ , 6.6 years, range 0.4-15.7), zygomatic bone perforation ( $n = 11$ , 0.9 years, range 0.03-4.3), prosthetic tooth fracture ( $n = 5$ , 3.7 years, range 0.6-7.3), zygomatic implant fracture ( $n = 4$ , 10.3 years, range 8.9-13.1), multiunit abutment fractures  $(n = 3, 3.4, \text{range } 1.4 - 6.9)$ , and suprastructure misfit  $(n = 3, 2.5$  years, range 0.9-4.7).


# 3.4 | Complications and risk indicators associated to ZI loss

Following the statistical analysis, risk factors identified as predisposing to zygomatic implant loss were, the presence of head and neck radiation  $(P = 0.045)$ , an hemimaxillectomy  $(P = 0.009$ ;  $P = 0.025)$ , a mixed treatment scheme when compared to a Quad scheme  $(P = 0.004)$ , an intrasinusal in comparison to a sinus slot technique  $(P = 0.027)$ , a delayed implant loading  $(P = 0.035)$ , the absence of grafting material  $(P < 0.001)$ , and the use of static guiding when placing the zygomatic implants  $(P = 0.008)$  (Table 2). Furthermore, associations were found with complications with significant occurrence prior to zygomatic implant loss, such as sinusitis  $(P < 0.001)$ , standard implant loss  $(P < 0.001)$ , zygomatic region infection  $(P < 0.001)$ , perizygomatic infection  $(P < 0.001)$ , permanent oroantral communication  $(P < 0.001)$ , and misfit of the suprastructure  $(P = 0.019)$  (Table 1).

# 4 | DISCUSSION

Among the main findings of the present study is a ZI survival rate of  $89.9\%$ , with most losses occurring in the first 5 years of follow-up. This is a slightly lower proportion when compared with the aggregate evidence-based survival rate of  $96.7\%$  (da Hora Sales et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the possible explanation could be related to the inclusion of a large number of ZI with approximately two-thirds of cases having been followed up for at least 5 years. In contrast, most studies with a higher survival rate involved a smaller sample size or a follow-up period shorter than 5 years for a larger portion of cases (Chrcanovic et al., 2016).

Several factors may influence implant survival such as maxillary resection and/or history of radiotherapy, which showed a lower ZI
FIGURE 3 Report of the total number of implants placed and their complications including implant loss between the years the 1998 and 2020. The number of other complications seems to be increased, because it refers to the total complication events, in which a group of complications could belong to a single patient, or the same complication could have happened more than once to the same person.

survival rate (80%) and a significant association to ZI loss. Landes identified certain factors which contribute to the failure of ZI in patients following (hemi)-maxillectomy, such as, implant overloading, tumor recurrence, soft tissue overgrowth and recurrent infection (Landes, 2005). Furthermore, a possible explanation for implant failure after radiotherapy could have been related to the negative impact of radiation onto the bone's reparative capacity.

Considering other variables which might affect the survival, our findings were consistent to that of Goker et al., where a higher frequency of ZI loss existed in patients with a previous history of standard implant loss. Additionally, factors such as, gender, smoking habits, ZI location, implant symmetry and loading protocol did not exhibit any significant association (Goker et al., 2020). In relation to the surgical technique, a lower survival rate was detected with intrasinusal  $(83\%)$ , extramaxillary  $(90\%)$ , and sinus slot technique  $(94\%)$  compared to the values of  $98\%$ ,  $99\%$ , and  $99\%$  reported in literature (Chrcanovic et al., 2013). This could be attributed to the fact that unlike previous studies, our findings were based on a larger sample size with a longer follow-up.

It stands out, that  $19\%$  of the standard implants failed and had to be removed. From the 38 patients involved, three of them had had radiotherapy and six were smokers. Noteworthy, 24 had ZI losses as well. Therefore, a complementary statistical analysis was done to find the complications occurring prior to standard implant loss. It was seen that ZI loss is a risk factor for standard implant loss  $(P < 0.001)$  and vice versa, as described in the above-mentioned results. Thus, removal of one or more implants during treatment likely created an unstable biomechanical scenario prone to failure.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this study was the exhaustive report of all the complications and their occurrence time following implant placement. Sinusitis was the most frequently occurring complication with a mean occurrence time-point of 4.5 years, which was consistent with a prior study where majority of the sinus problems developed at a delayed time-point following ZI placement (Aparicio, Manresa, Francisco, Ouazzani, et al., 2014). The increased sinus problems might have been either due to the lack of contact between the residual alveolar crest and the implant, or larger number of cases treatment with intrasinusal technique which has been empirically associated with a higher number of sinus complications (Aparicio, Manresa, Francisco, Ouazzani, et al., 2014). Additionally, the occurrence of infection in the zygomatic and peri-zygomatic region, sinusitis, and oroantral communication were associated as causative factors for ZI loss. A previous study found a positive association between zygomatic region infection and high torque force for achieving primary stability which could result in implant loss. Therefore, it is of vital importance that an equilibrium is achieved between sufficient primary stability and torque (Vrielinck et al., 2022). All these aforementioned factors are biological in nature with an infectious component which might get resolved following antibiotics administration. Furthermore, the reported infectious complications in this study might allow a better understanding of the mechanism of implant loss (da Hora Sales et al., 2020).


Amongst the non-infectious biologic complications, hypoesthesia of the infraorbital nerve was the most frequently reported, being transient in eight cases and permanent in four. Sensory disturbance of the infraorbital nerve might be expected (Davó & David, 2019), given the close proximity of the implant trajectory to the infraorbital foramen. ZI failure was also observed in patients suffering from permanent anesthesia, however, it could be excluded as the cause of implant loss because these patients also presented with soft tissue infection of the cheek and sinusitis.

The strengths of the study included a large sample size, long follow-up period and comprehensive reporting of the complications. At the same instance, certain limitations were also observed. Firstly, the retrospective nature of the study led to an incomplete data extraction, gaps in information and lacked standardization of the treatment scheme, surgical technique, and prosthetic rehabilitation. Hence, presenting limited generalizability and risk of recall bias. Secondly, clinical examination of peri-implant tissues was not performed at follow-up. Thus, the gingival recession aspect of the success criteria lack reliable data; similarly, no data on peri-implantitis was available. Thirdly, the results should be interpreted with caution as individual patients might present with multiple risk factors which could lead to data heterogeneity due to the inability of isolating specific effect of an individual risk factor. Additionally, there is risk of residual confounding given that the statistical analysis involved a simple rather than a multiple multilevel regression analysis.

In conclusion, ZI provided a survival rate of  $89.9\%$  for the rehabilitation of selected cases of severely atrophied maxilla with most losses occurring within the first 5 years following implant placement. The most frequently observed complication was sinusitis which tend to develop several years following implant placement. Furthermore, sinusitis, infection in the zygomatic region, oroantral communication, and previous standard implant loss, were identified as possible causes for zygomatic implant loss. Future multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trials and long-term clinical studies should be performed to better understand and isolate the risk factors leading to implant failure, thereby, further improving patient's standard of care.
