Statement of problem. A variety of zygomatic implantation techniques currently exist; however, a consensus regarding the most suitable method has not yet been reached.

Purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare 3 zygomatic implantation techniques and to clarify the optimal number and position of zygomatic and dental implants for the reconstruction of the severely atrophied edentulous maxilla.

Material and methods. A 3-dimensional finite element analysis craniofacial model was constructed from the computed tomography data of a selected patient with a severely atrophic edentulous maxilla. Modeled zygomatic implants were inserted into the craniofacial model with 3 surgical techniques (classic Brænemark, exteriorized, and extramaxillary), and with 3 model variations that involved the number and position of zygomatic and dental implants. The zygomatic implants were loaded with a vertical force of  $150\mathrm{N}$  and a lateral force of  $50\mathrm{N}$ . The stresses on and deformations of the bones and implants were then observed and compared.

Results. No obvious differences in the amount and distribution of stress on the external craniofacial bones were detected in the models. The lowest stresses on the zygomatic implants were observed in the exteriorized technique group. The lowest deformations of the bone that surrounds zygomatic implants and dental implants were observed in the exteriorized technique and classic Brænemark technique groups. For the exteriorized technique group, the model with 1 dental implant in the site of the maxillary lateral incisor exhibited the lowest stress on the zygomatic implants and the least deformation of the bone surrounding the zygomatic and dental implants.

Conclusions. All 3 zygomatic implant techniques resulted in more or less homogeneous transference of force and thus could reconstruct the edentulous maxilla; however, the exteriorized technique with 1 dental implant in the lateral incisor appeared to be the most appropriate reconstruction method for the severely atrophied edentulous maxilla. (J Prosthet Dent 2013;■:■-■)

# CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

These results can be clinically applied when choosing the appropriate zygomatic implant technique for the severely atrophied edentulous maxilla. The exteriorized technique could increase the long-term success rate of zygomatic implants from the biomechanical perspective.

The zygomatic implant has become a standard procedure in the treatment of maxillary defects,1-3 patients with edentulism and with severe maxillary atrophy4-10 and also has been advocated for patients with advanced periodontal disease.11 The zygomatic implant offers an efficient therapeutic process that avoids bone grafting and has a good success rate.12-15 The zygomatic implant was first used by Branemark et al to rehabilitate maxillary defects. Since their introduction, zygomatic implantation techniques have been reported for rehabilitating severely absorbed edentulous maxilla by a number of researchers, including Stella and Warner,17 Migioranca et al,9 and Malo et al.18 Variations of the zygomatic implantation method are known as the Branemark technique,16 the Stella or sinus slot technique,17 and the exteriorized or extrasinus technique.19 The technique introduced by Malo et al is referred to here as the extramaxillary technique.

All of these zygomatic implantation techniques have been reported to perform well in short- and medium-term studies with implant survival rates of  $82\%$  to  $100\%$ . However, no consensus regarding the ideal technique for placing zygomatic implants has yet been reached, which is likely because of the lack of long-term clinical observations with extensive sampling and systemic comparisons among the different techniques.

Each method offers certain advantages and disadvantages. For instance, in both the Brænemark and Stella techniques, $^{16,17}$  zygomatic implants are positioned through the sinus and fixed into both the zygomatic and maxillary bone. Clinical signs of maxillary sinus pathology must be considered by the clinician when using these 2 techniques. $^{25-27}$  Although the Stella technique $^{17}$  may improve upon implant orientation and reduce postoperative symptoms, Boyes-Varley et al $^{28}$  disagreed with the Stella technique $^{17}$  because a lack of visibility may result in perforation of the posterior antral wall. The exteriorized technique increases the length of drill holes into the zygomatic bone, which may provide higher initial mechanical stability than other techniques. $^{19}$  The extramaxillary technique reduces the size of the prosthesis that may reduce problems such as phonetic difficulties, dental hygiene concerns, and mechanical resistance from the prosthesis; however, there is reduced support and retention of the maxillary bone. $^{18}$


The extrasinus technique may show improved biomechanical performance because it reduces the cantilever more than in the extramaxillary technique and supports the maxillary sinus more than the Brænemark technique. Therefore, a 3-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) study was designed to provide biomechanical information to address the optimal technique for installing zygomatic implants and to clarify the ideal number and position of zygomatic and dental implants for the reconstruction of a severely atrophied edentulous maxilla.

# MATERIAL AND METHODS

The research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Sichuan University. A 3-dimensional finite element solid model of a human skull was constructed from the clinical computed tomography data from a 69-year old Chinese patient with a severely absorbed edentulous maxilla. The skull was scanned in the transverse plane (Computed Tomography Scanner; Siemens) with a 1-mm-slice thickness and 1-mm scan increment in 240 slice images. Three-dimensional external shapes of the craniofacial structures were generated by image-processing software (Mimics 10.01; Materialise NV). Output data were imported to software designed for surface reconstruction and the design of zygomatic and dental implants (Pro/ENGINEER WildFire 4.01; PTC Corp). The data obtained were then processed by software (ANSYS Workbench 12.01; ANSYS Inc) for conversion into a 3-dimensional FEA solid model.

Because of the similarity between the Brænemark and Stella techniques,[16,17] the classic Brænemark technique was chosen to represent both the Brænemark and Stella techniques in the study. The 3 zygomatic implantation techniques considered in this study served to define 3 model groups: the Brænemark (B group), exteriorized (Ed group), and extramaxillary (Ey group) groups. In total, the FEA study worked with 9 reconstructed models, which were divided into 3 groups according to the surgical

technique modeled. In the Brænemark technique group (B group), $^{16}$  all zygomatic implants were inserted from the site of the maxillary first molar. Model LP consisted of 1 zygomatic implant and 2 dental implants in the maxillary lateral incisor and the first premolar on each side. Both model P and model L in the Brænemark technique $^{16}$  group had 1 zygomatic implant on each side, with 1 dental implant in the maxillary first premolar in model P or the lateral incisor in model L. In the extramaxillary technique group model LP included 1 zygomatic implant in the maxillary first molar and 1 dental implant in the lateral incisor on each side. Model P had 2 zygomatic implants on both sides, inserted from the site of the first molar and the second premolar. Model L had 1 dental implant in the canine on the base of model P. In the exteriorized technique group, model LP, model P, and model L were the same as those described for the Brænemark technique. $^{16}$

A 45-mm zygomatic implant (Nobel Biocare AB) with an abutment  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in height and 2 regular dental implants  $(3.75\times 13.0\mathrm{mm};$  Nobel Biocare AB) with abutments  $5\mathrm{mm}$  in height were modeled. The appropriate length of the zygomatic implant was selected according to the distance between the crest of the alveolar process of the maxilla near the palate and the jugal point (JU) of the zygomatic bone.[29] Prosthetic superstructures were modeled as a gold alloy symmetrically curved bar with a section  $10\times$ $8\mathrm{mm}^{30}$  and were constructed with Pro/ ENGINEER WildFire 4.01 software (PTC Corp). The different numbers of zygomatic and dental implants in models LP, P, and L with the 3 different surgical techniques are shown in Figure 1.

In this study, the mechanical properties of implants and bones were all treated as isotropic, homogeneous, and linear elastic. The elastic modulus and Poisson ratio values of titanium, gold alloy, and cortical and cancellous bone

(Table I) were obtained from the literature.31-41 The bone-implant contact area was assumed to be complete osseous integration and so the contact area was simulated by using a surface-to-surface option fully bonded for the cemented

versions. $^{30,42-45}$  Nine solid models were transferred to the ANSYS Workbench 12.01 (ANSYS Inc) to generate the FEA models with 10 node tetrahedral elements. An element size of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  was used as the meshing requirement for all FEA models. $^{46}$  Mesh generation resulted in a total of approximately 274000 elements and 484000 nodes.

To simulate occlusal force, a vertical load of  $150\mathrm{N}$  was applied to the occlusal surface along the zygomatic implant axis, and a lateral load of  $50\mathrm{N}$  was applied to the palatal surface of the superstructure.30,47-49 To simulate the action and pass downward and backward, a distributed occlusal force of 300 N was applied to the insertion area of the masseter muscle on the zygomatic arch and zygomatic process of the maxilla.30,50 For the top cutting plane, the restraint was chosen to simulate the presence of the remainder of the skull. Both loading and boundary conditions of the FEA models are shown in Figure 2.


# RESULTS

Comparisons were made between the von Mises stress and deformation magnitude and distribution in craniofacial models rehabilitated by zygomatic and dental implants with each of the 3 techniques. Stress and deformation were visualized with pseudocolors on the FEA model (Figs. 3 to 8). Unstressed regions were represented by dark-blue areas. Red areas represent regions of maximum stress. Each item was compared by using the scale shown on the left side of these images.


Stresses caused by occlusal forces were found to be primarily supported by the zygoma, with transfer through the infrazygomatic crest. The maximum stress in craniofacial bone was 20 to 25 MPa both under vertical loading and lateral loading (Fig. 9). No obvious differences in stress distribution and magnitude in the craniofacial bone of any of the 9 models were noted. The distribution of stress in the craniofacial bone was somewhat homogeneous.

The craniofacial bones and components that provided the majority of mechanical support for the zygomatic and dental implants were the maxillary bone, the zygomatic bone, and the zygomatic arch. The maximum stress values in each of these 3 components are shown in Figure 9. In all models, except model LP in the Ey group, the maximum stress in the maxillary bone was approximately  $10\mathrm{MPa}$  under vertical loading and  $7\mathrm{MPa}$  under lateral loading, and appeared where the zygomatic implant perforated the maxillary bone or in the surrounding alveolar bone (Fig. 9). The maximum value in the zygomatic bone was approximately  $20\mathrm{MPa}$  and concentrated in the JU bone landmark (Fig. 9). In all models, stress was transferred along the zygomatic arch with a value that ranged from 7 to  $10\mathrm{MPa}$  under both vertical and lateral loading (Fig. 9).


The amount and distribution of stresses on zygomatic and dental implant components are shown in Figures 3, 4, and 10. The zygomatic implant of model L in the Ed group had an average value of maximum stress on 2 sides of approximately  $45\mathrm{MPa}$  under vertical loading and approximately  $18\mathrm{MPa}$  under lateral loading (Fig. 10). All other models had a similar maximum stress of approximately  $100\mathrm{MPa}$  under vertical loading and approximately 24 to 35 MPa under lateral loading (Fig. 10). The primary regions of maximum stress were the inner side of the joint of the implant abutmen, and some stress was

maximized on the middle and end portions of the zygomatic implants (Figs. 3, 4). The posterior zygomatic implant of model P in the extramaxillary technique group (model P Ey) supported more stress and transferred larger forces than the anterior zygomatic implant (Figs. 3, 4).

shared similar minimal stress values of approximately 10 MPa under vertical loading and 5 MPa under lateral loading (Fig. 10). However, the dental implant in model LP of the extramaxillary technique group (model LPEy) showed the maximum stress values of approximately 22 MPa under vertical loading and 18 MPa under lateral loading (Fig. 10). However, stress values on the standard dental


implant were much smaller than those on the zygomatic implants (Figs. 3, 10).

7 MPa under vertical loading and 5.5 MPa under lateral loading (Fig. 11). Meanwhile, model LP in the Ey group had a maximum stress of approximately 16 MPa (others were approximately 10 MPa under vertical loading); all of the models except model L in the Ed group were similar to a maximum stress of 7 to 8 MPa (Fig. 11). The maximum stress on the bones that surround the dental implants was almost 2 to  $4\mathrm{MPa}$  under vertical loading and 1 to  $2\mathrm{MPa}$  under lateral loading except for the models of the Ey group (Fig. 11). The maximum stress on the bones that surround the implants was at the site where zygomatic implants perforated the maxillary bone, maxillary sinus, or the site near the bone landmark JU point, where the end of the zygomatic implants was fixed


both under vertical loading and under lateral loading (Figs. 5, 6).

The maximum deformation of surrounding bones in the B and Ed groups was approximately  $10~\mu \mathrm{m}$ , and the maximum deformation of the Ey group was approximately  $15~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  under vertical loading (Fig. 12). Under lateral loading, the maximum deformation was  $12~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  in the B group,  $14~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$  in the Ed group,

and  $18\mu \mathrm{m}$  in the Ey group (Fig. 12). The maximum deformation of bones that surround dental implants was approximately 2 to  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$ , both under vertical loading and under lateral loading (Fig. 12). The deformation of surrounding bones in the B and Ed groups was similar. The deformation of bones that surround dental implants was much less than that surrounding zygomatic implants. The maximum deformation region was near the bone landmark JU point where the end of zygomatic implants was fixed (Figs. 7, 8).

# DISCUSSION

No obvious differences in the magnitude and distribution of stress in the total and external craniofacial bone models were found for any of the 3 techniques. However, the lowest stress and deformation on the zygomatic implants and in the bones that surround the zygomatic implants were found in the exteriorized technique group. Stress in the total and external craniofacial bone models indicated that the 3 techniques all resulted in more or less homogeneous transference of force. Moreover, transference of force in the external craniofacial bone was consistent with those of Ujigawa et al.[30]


The zygomatic implant was found to bear most of the occlusal force. The stress on the standard dental implant was so small that it could essentially be ignored because titanium alloys are known to tolerate stresses up to  $900\mathrm{N}/$ $\mathrm{mm}^2$  without irreversible deformation[51]; therefore, a force of  $150\mathrm{N}$  would not likely result in dental implant failure.

However, because concentrated stress could lead to the absorption of surrounding bone, $^{7}$  the stress and deformation of the bone that surrounds zygomatic and dental implants was taken into consideration. The stress of the bone that surrounds the zygomatic implants was much larger than that of the bone that surrounds dental implants. Because the static strength of bone is approximately 150 MPa in tension and approximately 250 MPa in compression, $^{52}$  rehabilitating the edentulous maxilla with zygomatic implants and dental implants should not risk overstressing the surrounding bone. Deformation is determined by the force of loading and the material's mechanical properties. Because there is much cancellous bone near the landmark JU and stress in this region was maximal, maximum deformation of the

Stress on external and total bone was influenced by occlusal force and the force of the masseter. Stress on the surrounding bone was only influenced by the occlusal force. Occlusal force was much less than the masseter, and stress distributions on external and total bone were somewhat homogeneous. However, some differences were found between the stresses of the surrounding bones. Because stress distribution in external and total craniofacial bone was rather homogeneous and stress on the dental implants was low, the biomechanics of the zygomatic implant were determined to be the main factor that influenced the success rate of the surgery. Minimal stresses on the zygomatic implant, under both vertical and lateral loading, were found in model L in the exteriorized technique. The surrounding bones of zygomatic implants with both the Brænemark technique<sup>16</sup> and the exteriorized group presented less deformation than found in the extramaxillary group, which meant that the surrounding bone of zygomatic implants in the extramaxillary group was more susceptible to bone absorption. When taking into consideration the surgical procedure and potential complications,<sup>25-28</sup> the exteriorized or extrasinus technique may be the optimal method.


When considering the bone contact length of zygomatic implants, the exteriorized technique increases the contact length more than the Brænemark technique does.19 Moreover, it was obvious that the contact length of the extramaxillary technique was much shorter than that of the exteriorized and Brænemark techniques. $^{16}$  Zygomatic implants inserted by using the extramaxillary technique represent a long cantilever, which was also a risk factor of failure. The results of this FEA study were consistent with these outcomes. However, when there is insufficient alveolar bone and maxillary bone for the exteriorized and Brænemark techniques, $^{16}$  the extramaxillary technique is a proper choice.


As in every FEA study, some limitations apply. One limitation was that the zygomatic implants and dental implants were simplified to facilitate modeling and calculations. Another was that, in the present study,  $100\%$  osseointegration between implants and

In clinical situations, the percentage of osseointegration could be reduced by such things as local inflammation, drugs, and osteoporosis. Further investigations are needed to assess the osseointegration of zygomatic implants in different situations.


# CONCLUSIONS

Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. The classic Brænemark, the exteriorized, and the extramaxillary zygomatic implantation techniques resulted in more or less homogeneous transference of force and thus could be used to reconstruct the edentulous maxilla.

2. In terms of minimizing stress on the zygomatic implant structures, and when considering the stress and deformation of the bones that surround the zygomatic implants, the optimal reconstruction method was model L (a zygomatic implant on each side, with a dental implant in the lateral incisor position) of the exteriorized technique group.
