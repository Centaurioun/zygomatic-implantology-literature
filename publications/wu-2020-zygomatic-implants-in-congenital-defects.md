# Zygomatic Implants in Congenital Defects

# Background of Congenital Defects in the Oral and Maxillofacial Area

A variety of congenital inherited disorders lead to physical defects and ectodermal dysplasia (ED) is a group of relatively severe congenital disorders affecting the oral and maxillofacial area. Ectodermal dysplasia represents a group of rare congenital hereditary disorders with an estimated prevalence of 7 in 10,000 live births [1], and typically leads to abnormal development of multiple ectodermally derived tissues, including the skin, hair, teeth, nails, and secretory organs [2]. More than 150 types of ED have been identified with mild-to-severe symptoms and, in general, ED is commonly classified into two major types comprising of anhidrotic/hypohidrotic (Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome) and hidrotic (Clouston's syndrome) depending on whether secretory organs are impaired.

In 1848, John Thurnam initially described the term of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), which is the most common type of ED [3]. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is known as Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome and is the more severe form associated with more dental defects [4]. It has been reported that HED mainly originates from mutations of Ectodysplasin A (EDA). Furthermore, the

The pathway of pathogenesis of ED is reasonably well understood, notably via a classical NF-  $\kappa \mathrm{B}$  pathway mediated by EDA and EDAR. Some gene mutations in this pathway may lead to different types of ED. It is reported that mutations in genes for EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, TRAF6, and IKBKG are associated with ED. Furthermore, it is reported that the mutation of WNT10A can also lead to ED, implying a role for the WNT signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of ED [6, 7].

In the oral and maxillofacial area, ED clinically presents as hypodontia (absence of fewer than six teeth), oligodontia (absence of more than six teeth excluding the third molars), or anodontia (absence of all primary or permanent teeth) with or without hypoplastic conical teeth, undeveloped alveolar bone, maxillary retrusion, mandibular protrusion, decreased occlusal vertical dimension, frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, reduced salivary secretion, protuberant lips, hypotrichosis, and so on [8, 9]. (Fig. 1).

Because  $80\%$  of ED patients present with mild or severe dentition defect, dentists are paying more attention to this group of patients and the treatment options for patients with ED.

# The Challenge to Prosthetically Rehabilitate Edentulous ED Patients with Severe Atrophy of the Maxilla

From the perspective of stomatology, more attention is paid to the ED patients with oligodontia and anodontia, who may be referred to as severe edentulous ED patients. The dentition deficits of these severe edentulous ED patients not only cause underdevelopment of alveolar bone, but also negatively impact mastication, speech, appearance, and social and psychological well-being. Therefore, ED patients, especially those with anodontia, greatly benefit from the restoration of appearance, function, and self-esteem. However, due to the lack of alveolar bone, edentulous ED patients present a great challenge to restore by the means of conventional prosthodontic treatment options [10] such as fixed, removable, or implant-supported prostheses. An inadequate number of natural teeth preclude attaining the support necessary for a fixed partial denture. Furthermore, poor retention, support, and stability of removable dental prostheses are common complaints from the ED patients with oligodontia and anodontia. Consequently, an implant-supported prosthesis is regarded as the optimal solution for an edentulous ED patient seeking prosthodontic care. Due to most ED patients presenting undeveloped alveolar bone in the edentulous region, a great number require bone augmentation and soft tissue grafting procedures. Various alveolar bone augmentation techniques such as guided bone regeneration (GBR) and block bone grafting may achieve considerable success when performed on non-ED patients [11] and the moderately affected ED patient with hypodontia [12, 13]. Nevertheless, for ED patients with oligodontia or anodontia, the extreme knife-shaped alveolar crest and extensive alveolar bone defect require an additional extra-oral donor site, such as the fibula, iliac crest, or cranium, to harvest sufficient autogenous bone. These additional surgical operations increase complexity, cost, and risk of morbidity to bone augmentation procedures, make the surgical outcome unpredictable, and increase postoperative discomfort.

# Zygomatic Implant Approach is an Alternative Treatment for Edentulous ED Patients

The zygoma is regarded as an osseous resource for implant placement to rehabilitate the maxillary dentition when a patient presents with a severely atrophic maxilla or maxillary defect. The use of zygomatic implants could avoid the need for complex bone augmentation procedures and enable immediate restoration. Moreover, it has been reported that zygomatic implants used for patients with a severe atrophic maxilla have good long-term survival of  $95.2\%$  [14]. The edentulous ED patients often present with insufficient jawbone volume representing classes V or VI of the Cawood-Howell classification [15]. The missing teeth and insufficient maxillary bone volume of the severely affected edentulous ED patient are major indications for considering zygomatic implants. Therefore, more surgeons have been starting to regard zygomatic implant approach as an alternative and reliable treatment plan for implant placement to rehabilitate upper dentition in the severe edentulous ED patients. It is important to note that differences in zygoma bone quality and quantity between ED patients and non-ED patients remain unreported. In this chapter, the preoperative evaluation and clinical consideration of zygomatic implants placement in edentulous ED patients is discussed.

# Conventional Implant Treatment for ED Patients with Sufficient Bone Volume (Fig. 2)

# Consideration of Orthodontic and Orthognathic Therapy

Some ED patients present with only congenital partial or complete tooth loss in conjunction with favorable or unfavorable intermaxillary relationships and sufficient bone height in the edentulous site. The congenital absence of individual primary and permanent teeth leads to tilting of existing teeth and, combined with unfavorable intermaxillary relationships, hampers the treatment outcome of implant-supported prosthesis. In case of patients with favorable intermaxillary relationships, orthognathic surgery is not indicated and orthodontic therapy may focus on aligning the dentition, righting tilted teeth adjacent to future implant sites, achieving ideal dimensions of the edentulous spaces in preparation for conventional implant placement, and closing diastemata. However, to gain an optimal prosthetic outcome, many ED patients with individual teeth loss benefit from orthodontic therapy prior to conventional implant placement.


For patients with unfavorable intermaxillary relationships, orthognathic surgery is suggested, and the initial orthodontic treatment needs mainly to focus on securing sufficient space for segmentalization of the jaws during orthognathic surgery. The final orthodontic therapy then aims to refine occlusion and ensure sufficient space for conventional implant placement.

# Consideration of Bone Augmentation and Soft Tissue Grafting

The congenital absence of teeth usually co-presents with undeveloped alveolar bone in edentulous sites that culminates in insufficient bone width to accept an implant placed conventionally. As a result, these ED patients frequently need to undergo bone augmentation before implant placement. Among various bone augmentation techniques, guided bone regeneration and block bone grafting are recommended for limited edentulous sites to achieve sufficient alveolar bone volume. On the other hand, soft tissue grafting, such as free gingival grafting or subepithelial connective tissue grafting, may be also required to cover augmented bone and reconstruct the desired alveolar ridge configuration and minimize biologic and esthetic complications [16].

# Implant Placement and Prosthetic Treatment

Once sufficient bone and soft tissue volume are gained, implant placement may be undertaken. Prosthetic treatment is subsequently performed after implants have sufficiently osseointegrated.

# The Procedure for Utilization of Zygomatic Implants to Rehabilitate Edentulous ED Patients

# The Interdisciplinary Treatment Approach

In comparison to edentulous ED patients with only individual tooth loss, completely edentulous ED patients present more abnormalities and require more complex interdisciplinary treatment protocols. Some edentulous ED patients present severely undeveloped alveolar bone, maxillary retrusion, mandibular protrusion, decreased occlusal vertical dimension together with a short facial appearance, all of which present challenges during the treatment planning and treatment phases. Therefore, it is imperative to involve pediatric dentists, orthodontists, prosthodontists, and maxillofacial surgeons together to jointly plan the interdisciplinary treatment approach for these ED patients.

# Consideration of Extracting Dispersed Remaining Teeth

In the process of planning interdisciplinary treatment on a partially edentulous ED patient, the first issue is to evaluate whether the patient's remaining teeth ought to be extracted. It is common for ED patients to present with dispersed and tilted teeth and with insufficient bone volume in edentulous sites. Such remaining teeth are often obstacles to implant surgery and prosthetic rehabilitation. For ED patients with only a few primary teeth and conical permanent teeth dispersed, upright or tilted in the maxilla, and insufficient bone volume in edentulous sites, one alternative is to extract the remaining teeth. However, such an approach remains controversial. There are some dentists who hold the view that remaining teeth should be preserved as long as possible. Some advantages and disadvantages on this issue are listed below.

The advantages of extracting remaining teeth:

- Simplification of treatment procedures.  
- Reduction in complexity of surgical operation.  
- Improvement in the esthetic outcome of prosthesis.

The disadvantage of extracting remaining teeth:

- Loss of functional natural teeth.

# Consideration of Orthognathic Surgery Procedures

Along with a variable lack of teeth, a majority of ED patients present unfavorable intermaxillary relationships. It is reported that ED patients typically present maxillary length reduction and retrusion, mandibular protrusion, skeletal class III malocclusion, short facial appearance, and a significant correlation between the severity of abnormalities in maxillofacial bone morphology and absence of permanent teeth [17]. Implant surgery on these types of ED patients, regardless of any intermaxillary abnormalities, is likely to yield an incorrect occlusal relationship, and might eventually fail to restore normal oral function. In this situation, preoperative examination includes evaluating whether the ED patient presents with an unfavorable intermaxillary relationship, which requires consideration of orthognathic surgery prior to implant surgery. Standard maxillary and mandibular repositioning osteotomies can be performed to correct unfavorable intermaxillary relationship.

# Selection of an Appropriate Zygomatic Approach

The selection of a specific zygomatic approach depends on the maxillary residual bone volume of an individual ED patient. Based on the maxillary residual bone volume, a classical zygomatic approach or the quad zygomatic approach may be performed. The classical zygomatic approach, first introduced by Professor P-I Branemark, is to place one zygomatic implant in each zygoma together with two to four conventional implants in the anterior maxilla [18]. Subsequently, the classical zygomatic approach evolved through a series of modifications for the sake of surgical and prosthetic improvement, and, the quad zygomatic approach was introduced for patients with insufficient bone volume to enable the use of conventional implants in the anterior maxilla [19, 20].

In clinical practice, the edentulous ED patient with severe maxillary atrophies present insufficient bone volume in the posterior maxilla accompanying sufficient or insufficient bone volume on the anterior maxilla. These ED patients can be categorized into three types according to the residual bone volume in the anterior maxilla.

The first type is represented by ED patients with sufficient bone volume in the anterior maxilla enabling two to four conventional implants to be placed without additional bone grafting. For this type, two to four conventional implants should be placed in the anterior maxilla together with two zygomatic implants penetrating through the maxillary sinus and the zygoma, the classical zygomatic approach (Fig. 3).

The second type is represented by ED patients with sufficient bone height, but insufficient bone width in the anterior maxilla. In contrast to the first type, the second type does not allow for conventional implants to be placed in the anterior maxilla without bone augmentation. Thus, the first surgical procedure is bone augmentation for the anterior maxilla and, subsequently, placement of two zygomatic implants in the posterior maxilla and the zygoma during the same general anesthesia session. Once sufficient available bone volume on the anterior maxilla has been obtained, conventional implants are placed in the augmented bone (Fig. 4).


The third type is represented by ED patients with insufficient bone height and width in the anterior maxilla and which is neither able to accommodate any conventional implant placement nor reliably achieve predicable bone regeneration with any bone augmentation techniques. For this type of patient, the surgical operation should be selected to place two zygomatic implants on each zygoma (the quad zygomatic approach) and omit any bone augmentation procedure (Figs. 5 and 6).

# The Location of the Coronal and Apex of the Zygomatic Implants in ED Patients

# The Coronal of the Zygomatic Implants

In order to fully use the zygoma to increase the bone-to-implant contact area, appropriate positioning and trajectory of zygomatic implants should be carefully selected. The trajectories depend on the location of the coronal and apical portions of a zygomatic implant. For the classical zygomatic approach, it is proposed that the ideal location of the coronal aspect of a zygomatic implant be at or near the top of the alveolar crest at the level of the second premolar/first molar region [21]. For the quad zygomatic approach, the ideal coronal location of the additional anterior zygomatic implant should be at or near the top of the alveolar crest at the level of lateral incisor/canine region [22]. From the perspective of prosthetically driven implant surgery, the coronal platform of zygomatic implants should emerge at the position corresponding to the artificial teeth of the prosthesis. Placing the coronal platform with careful consideration of the planned position of the prosthetic artificial teeth reduces the palatal extension and bulk of the prosthesis. There are many benefits to controlling the palatal extension and bulk such as improved patient comfort, self-cleaning/oral hygiene access and speech, which in turn lead to an outstanding rehabilitation for the patient [23]. However, it remains controversial whether the coronal portion of zygomatic implants should be placed with no or minimal alveolar bone support for the sake of satisfying prosthetic needs for ED patients with extreme horizontal alveolar atrophy, corresponding to type 4 Zygomatic Anatomy-Guided Approach (ZAGA) [20]. Exposing the coronal portion of zygomatic implants without bone cover on the buccal aspect of the alveolar crest to meet the prosthetic needs and realize the concept of prosthetically driven implant surgery might increase the risk of implant thread exposure resulting in peri-implantitis and mucosal recession. Compared to conventional implants, any complication affecting zygomatic implants is more difficult to address. Although some remedial measures, such as GBR and buccal fat pad grafting, have been suggested to treat this biological complication, the long-term treatment outcome is still unpredictable. Many edentulous ED patients seeking rehabilitation of their dentition are at a young age, and it is highly desirable to provide them with a long-term predictable treatment outcome. Therefore, the location of the coronal platform should be carefully planned in ED patients whose prosthetic dental arch does not match with their maxillary alveolar ridge, and the importance of bone surrounding the coronal portion of the implant be balanced against prosthetic considerations.

# The Apex of the Zygomatic Implants

The zygoma provides the primary support for zygomatic implants; hence, it is crucial to planning which part of the zygoma is the ideal location in which to place the apex in order to obtain optimal anchorage. No research has yet reported if the zygomas of ED patients are different. According to our experience and ongoing study, it appears possible that the zygoma bone of ED patients has developed normally. Some studies have reported that when the classical approach is performed, the area near the orbit has the largest bone thickness in the zygoma, and suggested this orbital area as the optimal location in which to place the apex of a zygomatic implant [24, 25]. Another recent study measuring the radiological bone-to-implant contact based on CBCT images suggests that, when the quad zygoma approach is utilized, the postero-superior region and center of the zygoma are the optimal areas for the apex of the anterior zygomatic implant and that of the posterior zygomatic implant [23]. For the edentulous ED patients, if the classical zygomatic approach is selected, the apex of the zygomatic implant should be at the center of the zygoma and the orbital region should be left untouched in case a rescue zygomatic implant needs to be placed in case of conventional implant failure. If the quad zygomatic approach is selected, to obtain the greatest zygomatic bone-to-implant contact, the apex of the posterior zygomatic implant should be at the center of the zygoma, and that of the anterior zygomatic implant should be at the postero-superior region of the zygoma.

# Placement of Zygomatic Implants with the Assistance of a Surgical Navigation System

The risk of penetrating the orbital cavity and infratemporal fossa increases when placing multiple zygomatic implants because of the irregular shape of the zygoma and the limited intraoperative visibility [26]. A high accuracy stereolithographic surgical template may be used for guiding the placement of conventional implants and this template is a reliable method to transfer preoperative visual planning into the actual surgical operation [27, 28]. For an ED patient with a severely atrophic or undeveloped maxilla, however, it is difficult to maintain the surgical template in a stable position during the entire drilling procedure. A slight deviation in the entry point or initial direction may result in a magnified deviation effect at the apical portion of the implant. This renders surgical template use in the severely atrophic edentulous ED patient to be unreliable and unpredictable, especially when placing a long implant. The zygomatic implant is four or five times longer than a conventional implant. The length, the extensive flap, and the vibration of the drilling operation are likely to be main risk factors of deviation when placing a zygomatic implant. Chrcanovic et al. [29] reported the placement of 16 zygomatic implants with the guidance of a stereolithographic surgical template on human cadavers with a mean angle deviation of the long axis between the planned and placed implants of  $8.06 \pm 6.40^{\circ}$  for the anterior-posterior view, and  $11.20 \pm 9.75^{\circ}$  for the caudal-cranial view, of which one had emerged in the infratemporal fossa and one emerged inside the orbit. Another study [30] reported the placement of zygomatic implants with the guidance of a surgical template on patients with mean deviations at the entry and apex point of the zygomatic implants of  $2.77 \mathrm{~mm}$  (range  $1.0 - 7.4 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) and  $4.46 \mathrm{~mm}$  (range  $0.3 - 9.7 \mathrm{~mm}$ ). Furthermore, two of the implants were retrieved due to excess apical emergence and maximal deviations were about twice as large as mean values. Therefore, a surgical template is suggested neither for determining the location of the coronal points of zygomatic implants nor for use as a drilling guide.

Real-time surgical navigation provides a different operating approach using completely visualized trajectories through analysis of preoperative computed tomography images. Furthermore, real-time surgical navigation system enables full utilization of the zygoma for multiple zygomatic implant placement and optimal prosthesis anchorage. In the last two decades, use of navigation technologies has increased to determine optimum trajectories for placing the implants in patients with severe atrophic maxillae or severe maxillary defects, and have reported promising outcomes for not only reducing the surgical complications, such as penetrating the orbit and the infratemporal fossa, but also realizing the preoperative aim of maximizing zygomatic bone-to-implant contact. A clinical study has shown that real-time surgical navigation system improved the accuracy of zygomatic implant placement with the mean distance deviations of the zygomatic implant of about  $1.37 - 1.99\mathrm{mm}$  and the mean angle deviation between the axes of the planned and the placed implant of  $2.25^{\circ}$ . This study also reports the clinical accuracy between different implant sites (the anterior and posterior zygomatic implants) and different length of zygomatic implants was not statistically significantly different (Fig. 7) [31]. Therefore, to achieve precise zygomatic implant position, minimize invasiveness and the risk of complications associated with implant malposition, the real-time surgical navigation system is a promising alternative to the surgical template.

# Comparison of the Survival Rates of Conventional and Zygomatic Implant Placed When Placed in Edentulous ED Patients

A multi-center randomized controlled trial reported short-term results that immediately loaded zygomatic implants have significantly higher survival rates and significantly lower complications when compared with conventional implants placed in augmented atrophic maxillae of otherwise normal patients [32]. Another clinical study reported that the survival rates of conventional implants and zygomatic implants were  $77.50\%$  and  $100\%$  in the maxilla of ten ED patients, and the survival rate of the conventional implants was  $88.75\%$  in the mandibles [33]. The survival rate of conventional implants placed together with zygomatic implants in the maxilla is relatively lower. The relatively low survival rate of conventional implants placed in the maxilla might result from several factors: (1) greater bone absorption of iliac grafts compared with other autogenous bone graft donor sites [34]; (2) insufficient vascularization to support maintenance of the graft due to the severe atrophy of the grafted area; (3) compared with non-ED patients, the severe edentulous ED patients have more "fibrous bone" in the anterior maxilla and this condition compromises bone grafting and successful osseointegration [33]. To avoid the risk of implant loss of conventional implants placed in augmented bone, for ED patients with severe insufficient bone volume in the anterior maxilla, the quad zygomatic approach should be considered to omit the bone augmentation procedure as well as decrease the likelihood of intraoperative and postoperative complications.

# The Interdisciplinary Strategy of Treating the Young Edentulous ED Patient

Unlike adult ED patients, treating young edentulous ED patients may be more complex because their oral and maxillofacial complex may still be growing. The interdisciplinary conference with pediatric dentist, orthodontist, prosthodontist, and oral and maxillofacial surgeon is needed to not only decide what kind of treatment the young ED patient needs, but also decide when to perform these operations with respect to growth status. The overall treatment schedule and planning of intermediate treatment should be outlined based on the specific age and growth status of the young ED patient. Clinical and radiographic examinations, including cephalometric radiographic analysis, intraoral radiographs, study casts, and diagnostic wax-up should be well prepared and smoothly and appropriately transitioned to each clinician until the entire therapy plan is completed.

In order to achieve optimal rehabilitation of oral function in young edentulous ED patients, unfavorable intermaxillary relationships must be corrected, alveolar bone preserved, correct speaking and chewing patterns developed, and normal facial characteristics and dentition be developed so that these patients can develop normally emotionally and psychologically. Unfortunately, in the professional community, there is poor agreement regarding when to start prosthetic treatment to rehabilitate young edentulous ED patients. Some studies suggest that prosthetic treatment could start at the early age of 3-4 years to help normalize masticatory function, perioral muscle development, and, consequently, the growth pattern of the jaws [5, 35]. Another study suggested starting prosthetic intervention before school age to assist the patient in developing their social and psychological health and improve their confidence and self-esteem [8].

Prosthetic treatment includes fixed, removable, or implant-supported prostheses. Fixed prostheses are seldom used in the treatment of young edentulous ED patients because of a lack of an adequate number of natural teeth and interference with jaw growth [8]. Removable prostheses, such as complete dentures, partial dentures, or overdentures, are frequently reported to be used for young edentulous ED patients because modification during growth periods is easiest [8, 36]. Although removable prosthesis may temporarily maintain relatively normal oral function, the poor retention and stability of dentures and, sometimes unpleasant esthetics, may hamper the psychosocial development of children. Therefore, an increasing number of clinicians are inclined to treat young edentulous ED patients with implant-supported prostheses. Children and adolescents are considered not to be an indication for implant-supported prosthesis because their physical growth and the morphology of the jaws are under developed. Nevertheless, as the lateral growth of the anterior mandible is usually completed at the age of 3 years and its vertical growth rate is lower [37, 38], the region of anterior mandible is a possible site for implant placement in severely affected edentulous ED children. Encouragingly, initial studies show favorable treatment outcomes [35, 36]. According to the guidelines of the National Foundation for ED patients, implants are recommended for placement in the anterior mandible of children older than 7 years [39]. As the morphology of the anterior mandible might not exhibit evident change after the age of 7 years, early implant treatment can be started at this age on the anterior mandible. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the length and height of the mandible can continue to develop through adolescence into early adulthood [16]; hence, this should be taken into consideration before implant placement.

Compared to the mandible, however, it is reported that early placement of implants in the anterior maxilla for children is detrimental to the developing maxilla during the growth period [40]. A 1989 Consensus Conference on Implantology recommended that implants should be placed after maximum maxillary growth has occurred, which is approximately at the age of 15 years [41]. Because the path of the zygomatic implant is penetrating the maxilla and zygoma, in order to provide a more predictable and reliable treatment outcome for the severe edentulous ED children, the use of zygoma implants should be postponed until growth of the maxilla is complete.

# Conclusion

The zygomatic implant approach is a reliable alternative that provides a predictable and reliable treatment outcome for the edentulous ED patients. Preoperative evaluation should involve pediatric dentists, orthodontists, prosthodontists, and maxillofacial surgeons to jointly plan an optimal patient-centered interdisciplinary therapeutic protocol. Selection of a specific zygomatic approach according to each individual ED patient's situation is suggested in order to avoid intra- and postoperative complications and to achieve the desired long-term treatment outcome.
