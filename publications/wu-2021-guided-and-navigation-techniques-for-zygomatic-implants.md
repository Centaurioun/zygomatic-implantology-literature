# KEY POINTS

- The application of surgical navigation in complex craniomaxillofacial procedures has become helpful in transferring the surgical plan to the patient and in avoiding pertinent anatomic injuries.
- In quad approach, the potential risks of surgical complications are minimized by navigation.
- It is recommended to use individualized fiducial configuration in zygomatic implants placement for patient with maxillectomy defect.
- Errors in zygomatic implant navigation do occur that the surgeon should be aware of.

With the continuous improvement of medical devices, the use of dynamic navigation systems in dental implants is gradually increasing worldwide. The ideal implant position can be determined in advance with dynamic navigation system software, and the preoperative design can be accurately transferred to the operation with guidance, especially in the esthetic area of the anterior teeth and in patients with complex anatomic conditions in the operation area.

For patients who suffer from severe maxillary atrophy, guidance systems have also been gradually used in zygomatic implant surgery, which is considered a reliable and promising approach for the rehabilitation of oral function. The following 2 cases show the use of real-time navigation in classic zygomatic implant surgery for an atrophic maxillary edentulous patient and triple zygomatic implant insertion for the rehabilitation of a patient with maxillary bone defect.

# Case 1

A 65-year-old female patient, healthy and a nonsmoker, requested a fixed prosthesis for edentulous jaws. The patient had been diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis and had maxillary anterior teeth extracted 2 weeks before implant consultation. Clinical examination revealed moderate to

E-mail address: yiqunwu@ hotmail.com severe atrophy of the edentulous maxilla and mandible (Fig. 1). Initial soft tissue healing was achieved in the extraction sockets of anterior maxilla (Fig. 2). Panoramic and cephalometric image analysis showed pneumatization of maxillary sinuses and severe bone resorption in the posterior maxilla and mandible (Fig. 3).


A cone beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scan was taken. Severe vertical bone loss was observed in regions of maxillary right central and lateral incisor. Although adequate bone height was present in the anterior region of the maxilla, inadequate bone width limited conventional implant placement (Fig. 4). Based on the division of the edentulous maxilla into 3 radiographic zones, by Bedrossian and colleagues, insufficient bone volume for the installation of the implants was observed in zones 1, 2, and 3 without extensive bone grafting.

Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) data were imported into the Nobel Clinician (Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) implant planning software. Preliminary planning for zygomatic implants using quad approach was also conducted at this stage.

Placement of the zygomatic implants was performed using a dynamic navigation system. On the day of surgery, bone-anchored mini titanium screws were used as fiducial markers and were broadly spread in a polygon arrangement across the maxilla (Fig. 5). An intraoperative CBCT scan was performed with fiducial markers fixated, and the data were imported to the planning software for the navigation surgery (iPlan Navigator, BrainLAB AG, Munich, Germany). The data from the initial plan, containing information about the positions of implants, were exported as an STL file and overlapped with the new DICOM file in the navigation surgery software.

The skull reference base was rigidly secured within the hairline with a single self-tapping titanium screw (Fig. 6) under general anesthesia. The navigation system (VectorVision2, BrainLAB AG, Munich, Germany) was registered by using a navigation probe to contact the surface cavity of the mini

screws (Fig. 7). A custom-made rigid bracket integrating the reference array was connected to the zygoma drilling handpiece, enabling constant visualization of the drill on the screen in real time. $^{3}$  During this procedure, the position of the bur was actively followed on the display with a 3D image of the patient, allowing the surgeon to adjust the position and angulation of the tool. A midcrestal incision and vertical releasing incisions at the maxillary tuberosity region were made. The lateral sinus wall and a part of the zygomatic complex were exposed, a window of  $5 \times 10 \mathrm{~mm}$  was made in the lateral aspect of the sinus wall, and the sinus mucosa was reflected. Zygomatic implants (Branemark System Zygoma, Nobel Biocare, Goteborg, Sweden) were placed with the guidance of the navigation system, and complete drilling procedure followed the trajectories from the entrance point to the exit point, as planned. In zygomatic drill-path preparation, calibration had to be executed before the initial drilling and later, every time the drill was changed; then the direction vector of the drill, relative to the coordinate system of the reference frame, could be obtained (Figs. 8-11).


After implant placement, multiunit abutments were installed (Fig. 12), and the incision was sutured. Immediate provisional prosthesis was delivered after the surgery (Fig. 13).

A postsurgical CBCT scan and radiography were performed to evaluate the three-dimensional position of the placed implants (Fig. 14).

Final fixed prosthesis was delivered 3 months after surgery. Patient received implant-supported fixed restoration later in the mandible (Figs. 15-17).

# Case 2

A 30-year-old female patient who suffered from a maxillary bone defect due to a car accident requested oral rehabilitation (Fig. 18).

The fracture line involved the orbital floor area, resulting in a defect of the left maxilla. The fractures in the orbital floor area were fixed with titanium plates, but the maxillary bone defect resulted in an oral-nasal communication. The patient was a nonsmoker and healthy (Fig. 19).

The patient received an extraoral and intraoral examination to evaluate the mouth opening and healing of the mucosa. The patient exhibited a IIb bone defect with Natural dentition in the residual maxilla, according to Brown's classification (Figs.
Fig. 40 The CBCT data obtained preoperatively and postoperatively were merged to evaluate the accuracy of the implant position.

20 and 21). To achieve good retention and stability of the obturator prosthesis, it was suggested that multiple zygomatic implants be used to support the superstructure.

A removable obturator with basic esthetic and function was made to guide the future implant position. A first CBCT (ProMax 3D Max, Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland), with a resolution of  $0.39\mathrm{mm}$  /pixel and a slice thickness of  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$ , was performed to evaluate the width of the bone and the thickness of the left zygomatic bone. The data were then imported into the planning software (Nobel Clinician) for the initial planning (Fig. 22).

The number of zygomatic implants depended on both the zygomatic bone width and length. The safety margin to the orbital rim and that to the inferior margin of the zygomatic bone were both set to  $2\mathrm{mm}$ . Moreover, a minimum of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  between each implant was maintained during the preliminary planning. The zygomatic bone of this patient was sufficient to design 3 implants and to make the best use of the bone for implant anchorage (see Fig. 22).

The reasonable placement of fiducial markers in patients with maxillary bone defects is a substantial challenge. West and colleagues<sup>5</sup> proposed a principle to achieve reduced error in the registration procedures: (1) broadly distributed around the surgical area, (2) placement of the centroid of the marker configurations as close as possible to the target surgical area, and (3) avoidance of a linear or near-collinear arrangement. Moreover, the markers should be as concealed as possible to avoid scar formation in the facial area. In this case, the fixation titanium screw and the mastoid process were considered a suitable location for extraoral fiducial markers (Fig. 23), and the unaffected side of the alveolar ridge was used for intraoral fiducial marker placement (Figs. 24 and 25).

Before surgery, the skull reference base, with 3 reflective marked spheres, was fixed to the calvarium within the hairline. The navigation system was then calibrated to the patient by using a probe to contact the fiducial markers one by one (Figs. 26 and 27). After the procedure, sagittal, coronal, axial, and three-dimensional reconstruction images of the patient were displayed on the screen (Figs. 28 and 29).

During the surgery, a full-thickness flap was elevated to expose the zygomatic process. The fixation titanium screw and plate, which were in the zygomatic implant drilling path, were removed first (Fig. 30). Then the handpiece with a custom-made reference array with reflective spheres was used for drilling. The whole drilling procedure followed the trajectories from the entrance point to the exit point as planned preoperatively (Figs. 31-34). Then, 3 zygomatic implants were manually placed (Figs. 35-37).

Multiunit abutments and healing caps were placed on the implants. The flap was then reapproximated and sutured. The fiducial markers were then removed, and sutures were not required.

A postsurgical CBCT was conducted to verify the deviation between the placed implants and the planned position $^{6}$  (Figs. 38-40).

# Clinics care points

- For the "quad approach," surgical safety and precise placement are the most important issues during surgery. Most of the surgical complications are attributed to the deviation of the long axis angle between the implant planned and placed positions. To minimize risks and to improve the precision of the surgery, dynamic navigation might be a good option.
- Zygomatic implant was initially introduced for the rehabilitation of patients following maxillectomy. Zygomatic implant-supported prostheses have better retention and are more comfortable for patients when compared with conventional removable obturators. Registration is the key step of navigation surgery. In navigation-guided zygomatic implant placement for patients undergoing maxillectomy, the use of bone-anchored fiducial marker provides higher registration accuracy compared with surface matching approach. Owing to the irregular shape of the remaining tissues after maxillectomy, an individualized fiducial configuration is recommended.
- Navigation surgery may help the clinicians achieve prosthetic rehabilitation driven zygomatic implant placement in maxillary defect patients.
