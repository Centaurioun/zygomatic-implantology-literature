# Abstract

Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the content and quality of YouTube videos of zygomatic implants.

Methods: According to Google Trends (2021), "zygomatic implant" was the most preferred keyword related to the topic. Therefore, in this study "zygomatic implant" was used as a keyword for the video search. Demographic characteristics such as the number of views, likes/dislikes, comments, video duration, number of days after upload, uploaders, and target audiences of the videos were evaluated. To evaluate the accuracy and content quality of videos (available from YouTube), the video information and quality index (VIQI) and global quality scale (GQS) were used. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact chi-square test, Yates continuity correction, and Spearman correlation analysis  $(p < 0.05)$ .

Results: A total of 151 videos were searched; 90 met all inclusion criteria. According to the video content score,  $78.9\%$  of the videos were identified as low content,  $20\%$  as moderate, and  $1.1\%$  as high content. There was no statistical difference between the groups in video demographic characteristics  $(p > 0.001)$ . Conversely, information flow, accuracy of information, video quality and precision, and total VIQI scores were statistically different between the groups. The moderate-content group had a higher GQS score than the low-content group  $(p < 0.001)$ . The videos were mainly uploaded  $(40\%)$  from hospitals and universities. Most videos were targeted toward professionals  $(46.75\%)$ . Low-content videos had higher ratings than the moderate- and high-content videos.

Conclusions: Most YouTube videos on zygomatic implants showed low-content quality. This implies that YouTube is not a reliable source of information on zygomatic implants. Dentists, prosthodontists, and oral and maxillofacial surgeons should be aware of the content of video-sharing platforms and take responsibility for enriching video content.

# What is known

Rehabilitation of an atrophic maxilla is challenging for dentists because of insufficient bone which precludes using conventional dental implants. Recently, zygomatic implants have been applied as an alternative to conventional methods in patients with an atrophic maxilla. Video-sharing sites such as YouTube are the most popular sources of information. However, there is no standard video review process. Therefore, misleading information can be obtained.


# What this study adds

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first on this topic, and results suggest that the quality of YouTube videos on zygomatic implants is inadequate.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

The rehabilitation of an extremely atrophic maxilla is difficult for dentists because of insufficient bone that precludes placement of conventional-length dental implants. After tooth extraction, alveolar bone resorption is usually inevitable, and may compromise implant placement. Various bone augmentation procedures have been suggested which increase the bone level and allow rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses in cases of atrophic maxilla. These include grafting procedures, apposition graft with or without Le Fort I osteotomy, and sinus lift. However, although most of these approaches have a high success rate (60%-90%), they require two-stage procedures, increasing the potential risk of postoperative complications.

Within the scope of recent developments in dentistry, zygomatic implants have been applied as an alternative to conventional methods in atrophic maxilla reconstruction. These implants were first introduced by Brænemark in the late 1990s. The implant technique involves bypassing the atrophic alveolar bone and using the highly dense bone of the zygomatic complex as the fixation unit for longer implants (30-52.5 mm long). Indications for zygomatic implants may include rehabilitation of atrophic maxilla, treatment of patients with ectodermal dysplasia, and post-surgical maxillary reconstruction in patients with oral cancer. The success rate of treatment increases with the use of zygomatic implants. Conversely, the number of surgical steps, treatment time, and the use of bone grafts decrease. In clinical studies, cumulative survival rates, ranging from 95.2% to 98.6%, were achieved with a follow-up of 2-12 years. Despite the advantages and success rates, complications associated with zygomatic implant treatment such as sinusitis, soft tissue infection, paresthesia, and orbital perforations can occur. However, the incidence of prosthetic complications is very low (4.9%) regardless of the type of prosthetic treatment.

Healthcare professionals and organizations have undertaken the task of providing support to patients via the sharing of medical information. However, due to recently increased access to the internet and patients' desire for education about their disease, there has been a significant increase in internet use by the public seeking medical information.[14] As the ease of access to information technologies has increased, the internet has become a frequently preferred platform for accessing health information by both patients and healthcare professionals. In particular, video-sharing sites such as YouTube are the most popular sources of information.[15,16] On average, more than

500 new videos are uploaded to YouTube per minute, and users spend at least 15 minutes a day on the site.[17]

YouTube has become an important resource for obtaining healthcare information. In addition, this platform offers individuals an unlimited opportunity to express feelings and views after viewing videos.[18] Survey studies have shown that almost  $80\%$  of internet users prefer online platforms as a source of information.[19] Currently, there is no standard reviewing process for YouTube videos. Therefore, it is possible to obtain incorrect or misleading information.[20] Patients may not be able to discern the level of information quality in videos.[21]

Recently, many researchers have assessed the quality and adequacy of health-related content in YouTube videos in striving to determine the patient benefits of this open-access platform.[22] Abukaraky and colleagues[23] reviewed the content of YouTube videos of dental implants and reported that the general quality of videos was poor. Similarly, Koller and colleagues[24] reported that  $86\%$  of the videos were of poor quality. Conversely, a survey study among dental students reported that  $95\%$  of students found YouTube videos as a useful learning resource for clinical practice procedures.[25] Studies have indicated that health professional students prefer online media as their primary source of information.[25,26] With the increasing use of internet-based video applications among students and patients, it is imperative for healthcare professionals to evaluate and improve the quality of health information available online.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the content and quality of zygomatic implant videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the content quality of YouTube videos on zygomatic implants.

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

YouTube videos of zygomatic implants were evaluated in this study. The videos were identified by searching YouTube (www.youtube.com; Google, San Bruno, CA). The search was performed in the English language, and “zygomatic implant” was used as the keyword. According to the Google Trends Website (2021), “zygomatic implant” was the most frequently used search term for extremely atrophic maxilla rehabilitation in oral implantology in various regions and languages. “Cheekbone implant” was the other possible keyword. Based on a search of both keywords, “zygomatic implant” was determined as the appropriate keyword for this study based on the frequency of use. To avoid restrictions based on user history, the cookies and computer history were cleared before the search. The search parameters were limited to "the last five years," and "worldwide" settings were chosen to obtain more comprehensive results.


For the YouTube search, only the relevance filter, which determines the related topic, was used. Video properties, such as duration and type of video, were not filtered. The search results were limited to the first 151 videos. Previous researchers reported that  $95\%$  of YouTube users were interested in only the first three pages of search results and recommended that a user not watch more than "the first 30 to 60" videos and "the first 60 to 200" videos, respectively.[22,27,28] Additionally, after the first 151 videos found in our search, unrelated videos began to appear in the list. Therefore, this study was limited to the first 151 videos. Since the search results may have changed as new videos were added, a playlist was prepared and the videos from the list were recorded after viewing.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) no audio; (2) language other than English; (3) unrelated subjects; (4) longer than 30 min; and (5) duplicates. Multipart videos were counted as single videos.

The video attributes such as the number of days since upload date, country of origin, duration minutes, number of likes/dislikes, and viewer comments were recorded. The interaction level of the viewers was calculated based on the interaction index and viewing rate, according to a previous study by Hassona and colleagues<sup>14</sup>

The content evaluation of these videos was performed independently by two assessors (GY, HK) on the following subjects: (1) definition of zygomatic implant; (2) indications; (3) contraindications; (4) procedures involved; (5) advantages/disadvantages; (6) complications; (7) survival; (8) postoperative pain; (9) swelling; (10) bruising; (11) bleeding; (12) oral hygiene; (13) prosthesis satisfaction; (14) speech performance; (15) swallowing and eating performance; and (16) psychological and psychosocial impact. Each content's existence was scored as 1 point for a total of 16 points, which was determined as the total content score of the video. Videos rated as 11-16 points were identified as high content, 6-10 as moderate content, and 0-5 points as low content. During the video evaluation, researcher disagreements were resolved through a consensus meeting.

The upload source (i.e., those who viewed videos) of the videos was divided into five groups: healthcare professionals (dentist, specialist), hospitals/universities, commercial agencies (dental manufacturing or dental supply company), laypersons, and others (television channels, news agencies). The target audience was classified into three groups: professional, layperson, and both.

The general quality of the videos was evaluated using the Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI). This scale uses a five-point Likert scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (high) to assess the video properties of information flow, accuracy, quality, and precision.

The videos were assessed for audio-visual quality. In addition, the educational quality of the video was evaluated using the Global Quality Scale (GQS).[22] The GQS is a five-point scale that assesses the flow of information, level of usefulness for patients, and the quality of content. Higher scores indicate better video quality. This scale is also used for the quality stratification of videos, with scores of 1–2 determined as low, 3 moderate, and 4–5 high quality[29-31] (Table 1).

TABLE 1 Global quality scale.  

<table><tr><td>Poor quality: poor flow of the video, many lack of information, not helpful for patients</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Generally poor quality and poor flow: some information listed but many important subjects but of limited use to patients</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate quality: suboptimal flow, some important is adequately discussed but others poorly discussed, somewhat useful for patients</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Good quality: generally good flow, most relevant informations is covered, useful for patients</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent quality and flow: very useful for patients</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The videos that caused disagreements among the researchers were rewatched and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Ethical approval was not required; this study involved only publicly available data.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to identify the normality of the variables. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and frequency) were used to assess video properties, VIQI, and GQS scores. The Kruskal-Wallis test (post hoc Dunn's test) was used for comparisons between more than two groups of quantitative data, and quantitative data between the two groups was compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate relationships among the parameters. The chi-square test, Fisher's exact chi-square test, and Yates continuity correction were used to compare qualitative data. Statistical significance was set at  $p < 0.05$ .

# 3 | RESULTS

A total of 151 videos were analyzed in this study. Sixty-one videos were excluded for reasons listed in Table 2. All evaluations were performed using 90 videos. Seventy-one videos were determined as low, 18 as moderate, and one as high content. The video content was analyzed for quality and adequacy; since the number of high-content videos was insufficient, videos with high and medium content were considered as a single group and compared to low-content videos.

The statistics for the descriptive features containing the average number of views, likes, dislikes, and days since upload are shown in

TABLE 3 Descriptive statistics of the YouTube videos.

Table 3. The average duration of parts of the video that were relevant to zygomatic implants was 4.58 min (range; 25 s to 22.48 min). The mean number of views was 4547.74 (range, 28-17 187), with a mean viewing rate of 467.76. The mean number of likes was 220.11 (range, 0-231), whereas the mean number of dislikes was 1.00. The mean number of days since upload was 1082.43 days (range, 58-4273 days). The mean total content score was 3.5 (range, 0-11; median, 3), the mean GQS score was 1.99 (range, 1-5, median, 2), and the mean VIQI total score was 6.99 (range, 4-18; median, 4.5; Table 3).

Other video demographic characteristics, such as the source of upload, target audience, and video content, are shown in Table 4. The YouTube videos were uploaded by hospitals/universities (40%,  $n = 36$ ), healthcare professionals (33.3%,  $n = 30$ ), and commercial agencies (26.7%,  $n = 24$ ), respectively. No videos were uploaded by laypersons, television channels, or news agencies. Most videos were targeted for professionals (46.75%).

Indications for zygomatic implants were the most commonly covered topic (61.1%), followed by prosthesis satisfaction (48.9%), procedures involved (45.6%), and definition of zygomatic implant (37.8%). Conversely, contraindications (2.2%), bleeding (3.3%), complications (4.4%), and bruising (4.4%) were the least frequently covered topics (Table 4).

Of the 90 videos, 71 (78.9%), 18 (20%), and one (1.1%) were determined as low-, moderate-, and high-content groups, respectively. Due to insufficient numbers, only one video in the high-content group was included in the moderate-content group. The moderate-content group showed a higher median GQS score (3.4 ± 0.7 (3) vs. 1.6 ± 0.9 (1);  $p < 0.001$ ) and higher VIQI total score (11.2 ± 3.7 (12) vs. 5.9 ± 3.3 (4);  $p < 0.001$ ) than those in the low-content group. There were statistically significant differences in information flow, accuracy of information, quality, precision, and total VIQI scores between the groups  $(p < 0.001)$ . Conversely, video demographics such as duration, number of likes/dislikes, views, interaction index, view rate, and others showed no statistical difference between the groups  $(p > 0.05)$  (Table 5).


The correlations between the total content score, VIQI, GQS, and video demographics are shown in Table 6. A positive correlation was observed between the total content and VIQI score ( $r = 0.658$ ;  $p < 0.001$ ) and between the GQS and total content ( $r = 0.824$ ;  $p < 0.001$ ). Additionally, the GQS and VIQI scores were significantly correlated ( $r = 0.842$ ;  $p < 0.001$ ). The duration minutes and number of views showed a correlation between the VIQI and GQS scores ( $r = 0.338$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ;  $r = 0.267$ ,  $p < 0.011$ ; and  $r = 0.317$ ,  $p < 0.002$ ;  $r = 0.221$ ,  $p < 0.036$ , respectively). The viewing rate was correlated only with the VIQI score ( $r = 0.315$ ;  $p < 0.003$ ). No correlation was obtained between the total content score and video features ( $p > 0.05$ ).

# 4 DISCUSSION

YouTube is a popular video-sharing open-access platform. Due to its high accessibility, YouTube may play a significant role in influencing patient decisions regarding dental implant treatment. Nevertheless, the accuracy of information on YouTube is controversial due to the convenience of video sharing and the lack of standardization control.[32] Many articles on different topics related to the content accuracy and quality of YouTube videos have been published.[21,22,27,28] To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the content

Our results showed that YouTube is not an adequate or appropriate source of information regarding zygomatic implants for patients.


For this study, the videos were categorized into three groups according to video demographics: high, moderate, and low content. Similar to previous studies on dental implants, we found that the number of high-content videos was low.[33-36]

Controlling the relevance and quality of YouTube videos can increase patient knowledge of many different treatment options including zygomatic implants. With the development of information technologies, video-based resources will grow rapidly in the coming years and become the primary source of information for individuals.[34] Recent studies have suggested that sharing information on YouTube has positive effects on patient knowledge compared to information provided through brochures or verbal communication.[22,37] However, the results of the present study showed that most videos on zygomatic implants (78.9%) contained limited content and led to the underestimation of these potential benefits. Consistent with these findings, other studies reported that the patient-clinician relationship may be adversely affected by the information obtained from these platforms due to the poor quality of the video content.[34,38]


Our study results revealed that no video included all investigated content. Indications and definitions of zygomatic implants, prosthesis satisfaction, and procedures involved were the most commonly-mentioned video topics. The superiority of these topics can explain the high rate of hospitals/universities (40%) and health professionals (33.3%) as video uploaders, respectively. Most of the parameters that are important in implant treatment are not addressed on social media platforms, and some information may be confusing.[35] While most of the videos cover surgical and prosthetic procedures, very few contain information about implant definition, oral hygiene, failure, and contraindications.[34,39,40] Similarly, the current study showed that few YouTube videos included content related to contraindications and complications of zygomatic implants.

Lena and colleagues<sup>41</sup> reported that viewers lose interest when the video duration is excessive. We found that the average total video duration was 4.58 min. Conversely, the median duration of moderate and low-content videos was 4.24 and 4.67 min, respectively. According to Sezici and colleagues, content classification is not relevant to video duration. Therefore, presenting as much content as possible to the audience in the minimum time will be more effective for information flow.<sup>22</sup>

YouTube users are generally active in communicating their positive or negative thoughts and experiences with actions such as comments and likes/dislikes. Our study evaluated the demographics of viewers of YouTube videos of zygomatic implants. No statistical difference was observed in the comments, number of likes and dislikes, interaction index, and viewing rate between the three groups. Nevertheless, these parameters can be affected by factors such as the number of followers and ads. Different opinions have been expressed on implant treatments and surgical complications on other social media platforms.[34]

Another striking result among the results of the current study was that moderate content videos had higher total VIQI and GQS scores. This result showed that the information flow, video accuracy, and the overall quality were rated higher. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the total content, GQS scores, and VIQI. Using different elements, such as photos, animations, information flow, accuracy, and a selection of titles that are compatible with the content can all increase video quality. The diversity of the video content is more efficient in terms of information flow. This may explain the positive relationship found between the total content and GQS scores.

Our study results imply that the number of YouTube videos providing information about zygomatic implants should be increased. Although there are problems with video content and quality, in the current age of technology, YouTube will remain an open platform for information. To minimize the risk of inaccurate or missing information, healthcare professionals should be aware of the up-to-date information available on social media platforms and direct patients to sources where they can obtain the most accurate information.

The limitations of this study were as follows. A relatively short range of time was used to collect data. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of YouTube content, viewer interests, video viewing times, and search results are constantly changing. This makes following the video streams and sequences difficult. Additionally, although the most commonly-used keywords for zygomatic implants were selected using Google Trends, it is important to note that various videos can be accessed using different keywords.

# 5 CONCLUSION

The content of YouTube videos on zygomatic implants is generally inadequate. Most videos included the indications, related surgery, prosthetic procedure, and prosthetic satisfaction; however, few videos included complications and contraindications. Considering that access to social media and platforms such as YouTube and information sharing cannot be controlled, it is critically important for healthcare professionals to identify/review and recommend videos with correct and useful content that are available on YouTube.
